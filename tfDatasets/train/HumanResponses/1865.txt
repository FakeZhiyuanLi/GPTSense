i had a bit of an adventure with swiss alpine cheese friday night. i've been making it my small mission to get through as many different kinds of swiss chocolate and cheese as i can, and so was trying out the swiss speciality - super tasty cheese made fresh from unpasteurised milk up in the alpine pastures where the cows spend their very pleasent summers. only i think it was the 'unpasteurised' which was the problem. the cheese itself was very tasty indeed, but i think there was too much of it topping my tomato, tofu, and vegie sauce, and whatever nasties that were along for the ride, were too much for my stomach to cope with. so friday night was not so fun. i suppose i only have myself to blame though, since the cheese was 'reduced for quick-sale' at the supermarket.
