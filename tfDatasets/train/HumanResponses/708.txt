can i borrow some hope i 'm having trouble looking ahead because i can't stop seeing the past it's hard to not fall hanging by a thread how am i supposed to stand fast can i borrow some of your hope i've seemed to lost all of mine can i have some of your trust offer me your presence, your heart and your love they shine recovery seems so far off in the distance the road of healing is a long and lonely one through the hard times i feel your existence and the promises you made shines like a midnight sun can i borrow some of your hope i've seemed to lost all of mine can i have some of your trust offer me your presence, your heart and your love they shine pain and hurt are no longer my only friends you lent me your hope and i felt healing and freedom and now through me the victory extends your always there strong for me whatever may come
