at a local deli, i'm a stock boy. i'm not positive on the pay.but i'll probably make like 6 bucks an hour. which is pretty darn good for me. all i have to do is put some peanuts in a bag.more peanuts in a bag, then put some fruit in a bag.some more fruit in another bag. then put some cardboard in a box. shouldn't be too hardright?
