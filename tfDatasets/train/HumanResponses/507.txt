oh walls of pink and orange leave me to write, to live, to love. and blinds let the light shine in just enough to see my pen dance in the reflections of you, your beautiful light could make anyone dance and sing. i love your silly antics of nothing and your thoughts of everything your like light, your neccesary to me you are a need, you are my life, you are a rant, you are a love, you make my pen dance in your beautiful light never leave me. oh light you are me.
