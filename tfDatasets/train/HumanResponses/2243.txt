today my daughter and i got italian charm bracelets. boy, the charms are expensive. it is nice that they do not dangle down and interfere with my knitting. nothing can interfere with my knitting. anyways, i thought it would be something fun to do together. we each have 2 charms on our bracelets. over time we can add more. she is a brownie in girl scouts so i would like to see if there is a girl scout charm. to celebrate special occasions/holidays we can add charms that represent whatever we are doing at the time. she says that she wants a charm to remind her about her family. i think that is a great idea. oh, i almost forgot  one of my charms is about knitting :)
