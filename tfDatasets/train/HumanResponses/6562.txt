well, my dear friends, this humble web page has made the ranks of google! if you do a google search of 'shaun whittington' or 'idylls and rambles' you will be directed to this wonderful page of inspiration and thoughtful insight. which i must explain has not recently received new posts since i am very behind in papers for this quarter. i intend to have them finished very soon and will entertain you all with new insights. i am thinking about writing about modernity's fear of etiquette. . .
