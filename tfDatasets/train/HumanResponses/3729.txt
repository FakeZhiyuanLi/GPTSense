with text rpgs? how do they cram such evil difficulty into ascii output? gah! besides, they never let me do what i want. e.g~~ you enter cave. obvious exits are north, east, southwest, troy. what do you do? :troy troy says hello. obvious exits are not troy. :ask troy about quest i don't know what you mean. :say to troy "what about this quest"? i don't know what you mean. :grrr! just leave! i don't know what you mean. :not troy ad nauseum. this has inspired me to make a text rpg of my own, and make it at least as good as "hunt the wumpus." hehehehe. wumpus. :publish post i don't know what you mean. :aaaaaaaah! trlblzr p.s. check out the new avatar. executive office chair + kitty = good times indeed
