my blog has been born again. i bailed on the old one because i never used it - it never really worked to my satisfaction anyway. anyway, so here i am with a clean blogging slate. i like to think that having a new blog will give me cause to write more often. i do like to write, so i should just find the time to put pen to paper (so to speak) whenever the urge strikes me. these random thoughts will be posted as frequently, or unfrequently, as my time and interest allow. if you happen by, please drop a comment or random thought of your own.
