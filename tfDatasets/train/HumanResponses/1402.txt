why can't i forget him? well, yesterday morning, i was thinking: "why couldn't i stop loving and thinking of him?" (sounds like a loser, huh? yah right) but seriously how can i forget someone who had shown me that life has the best to offer like happiness? yup i have never been happy until i was with him but now? what am i? back to the same old me, the one who pretends to be strong and always happy. it's so damh hard to think whether he's thinking of me or not whether he still loves me or not some say love is the best feeling in the world but they forgot that it could also be the worst.
