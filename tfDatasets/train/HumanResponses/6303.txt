i've read one of two articles for class on wednesday. the article i read was confusing as hell, i can't lie. reading works written for academia is going to become vary tiresome in a short time. this particular article looked at semiotics as it relates to filmtext. what does that mean? good question, i'm not sure myself yet. i guess i'll have some good questions in class on wednesday. tomorrow, i'll be spending 10 hours at work. working as a g.a. in media services is about the only thing i look forward to right now. yeah it's work, but i love editing and when i actually have projects i'm working on, time moves at a faster pace. sitting in an edit suite is relaxing i guess.
