yep, i'm back, lol! sorry i didn't post a lot to begin with. i just went back to school a few days ago and i had piles of stuff to do so i didn't get time to write an entry while that was going on but anyway i'm back and i'll be posting once every 2 days at least nothing much happened today, just another boring school day. although my french teacher is acting a bit weird. he's usually always shouting and going off his head but he didn't today which i was surprised at. last night i started playing fifa 2001 on my pc last night just for a while but it gre w on me and i ended up playing until early morning so i'm pretty tired as well.
