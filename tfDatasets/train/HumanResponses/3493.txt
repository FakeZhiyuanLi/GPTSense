so the interview went really well, i must admit i was a bit nervous at the beginning. i was told he likes to dress formal but to my surprise he arrived wearin a beach shirt (hawaii style) and suddenly i felt over-dressy. anyways we spoke for about an hour in his office, topics ranged from the situation in the middle east. to arab immigration to mexico. then he gave me a copy of one of his books that he wrote titled "arab immigration in mexico" i also found out that he lives about 2 blocks away from me here in las brisas, so we're sort of "neighbours". he invited me to go visit his house and meet his family tomorrow evening. but i'm not sure if i will go. he also asked me to go next tuesday to one of his classes. and talk about anything related to the middle east. also answer a few questions that the students might have. which is kinda cool with all the free time i have. so all in all. it went well! :)
