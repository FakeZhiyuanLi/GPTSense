well today i worked at the nursing home the whole day. i met a new person, he will be a senior at jesuit this coming fall. he is very interesting. no i don't like him like that lol! he will work there fridays and saturdays. i worked there monday-friday, so he kept telling me to come saturday. of course i won't! it's funny he lives close to my house well sort of and works like a few blocks away. ok well enough about this new character for now. nothing special really happened today except that. i'm really tired so.*yawns* i might go to bed early andrew kept me awake last night lol we talked for about 2 hours. it's amazing how you can't run away of things to say. i might talk to him tonight or anthony either one is entertaining lol. bye for now! ta ta!
