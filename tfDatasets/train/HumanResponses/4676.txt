rediscovered qcd (quintessential player) after years - i started using it when it was a lightweight cd player. it's sure grown in capability :) think i'm going to switch from winamp to qcd - it lacks a media library like winamp, but i guess i can do without it. it does have a media library plugin, but it doesn't integrate very well - i'd rather see media library support native in qcd - so that skins affect the library window as well.
