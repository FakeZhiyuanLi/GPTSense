to say you are all that counts in this world of all the towns, in such a city that is so pretty, would not be saying nearly enough. that which seems so far, yet you're so near, to lose this love i have no fear. there is nowhere, not near or far, that can make a brighter star, you shine above all others, that sets you apart. i look in your eyes and they melt my heart. there is no light that shines stronger, with all that can last longer with all the need, want, and hunger that your beautiful love brings. star bright your eyes with magic they shine, with in-depth love i want for mine, deep, so deep, hidden from day, yet the love you've shone me so divine. beautiful you are inside and out, your love is all i need; of that there is no doubt. -troy
