i had a really awesome night with my girl tonight. i picked her up from work, then we went to my store to visit. from there on we went to logan's in fair lakes and had a wonderful dinner. i took her back to her work to get her car, and then we parted ways for te evening. it was awesome. i love you shannon peace, rob
