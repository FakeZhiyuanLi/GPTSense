hola everyone! today is a good day not like the rest. im beginning to get over daveion.but im not that sure if it is a good thing or not. i hope it is but idk. nut the story behind that is that he died in a car accident on my birthday and i knew about it before it actually happened because of my dreams. that fucking sucks. so for the next few says after i vowed not to sleep because i did not want to hurt anyone else, and i didnt for about 5 days. but i cant not sleep forever. i just need some of the drugs that the kids were on in freddie vs. jason so i can not remember my dreams. but thats not something that can happen well thanx im sad now. bye.
