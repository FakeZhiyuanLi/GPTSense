lydia, oh lydia; have you met lydia? lydia the tatooed lady. homework is yet to be done. this post only exists to remind myself i have a blog that still exists and 'needs' regular updating. after having several blogs on rival websites that have failed miserably, i feel i should start with something on the site that more or less started it all. may start transferring thoughts online. these have already been compiled with papier mache and twigs in the garden shed, and simply need a lick of paint before they are released on the world. they will be stolen. this frightens me. well, at least i'm the only person aware of this page thus far. this makes me joyous.
