we completely re-did my room. it looks soo pretty. painted the walls a really pretty green color, got a new dark dark purple carpet, new bedding thats green and purple and beige and all these frilly cute pillows. plus a mirror and some paintings for the wall. it looks so cute. and we did it all on a budget of like 200 dollars. oh it looks so friggin cute. thats pretty much all i've been up to. we destroyed the rest of the house in the process so yesterday it took me almost all day to pick that shit up. oh well it's done now and my room is worth it. my birthday is 13 days away. i'm going to get a tattoo that should be funnnn and painful. not much else is up. school starts soon :( back to 4cs ! and jeff wants to hook me up with his brother steve. haha we shall seeeee
