it's the last day of school and i threw out all of the assignments that i spent countless hours perfecting.it kinda felt like i was throwing the whole year away.i guess i was throwing elementary school away, wasn't i? next year means highschool, which is good, and i'm stoked about that but, in the short term all i have to look forward to is summer, and in actuality i'm dreading it.i'm going to go insane with boredom. i still have the biggest thing for n.p. but i guess it's a one sided thing. i'm used to that so i can live with it, it's just kinda disappointing because he created the illusion that there was something there. i want to be over him enough to kick his ass, but i'm not, and right now i seriously doubt i ever will be.
