unfortunately, i had no time to blog yesterday as i was over at my friends house. in the morning we went on a bikeride all through berwick. when we returned i played nightfire on his x-box and noticed something: the game looks exactly like the other versions. it even has the same texture's, although they are slightly enhanced. the other games didn't have astounding graphics either. so, is the x-box overhyped in the graphics department? one thing is certain, screenshots of x-box games look better than the games themselves.
