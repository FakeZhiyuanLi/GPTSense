my philosphy for why monkeys and cheese along with cows cannot live together is because like the human jesse, monkeys love cheese; however cows, such as rene, also like cheese. so the cows, being bigger than the monkeys, beat up the monkeys, eat their cheese, and steal their milk money. how do you think the cheese feels, huh, well let us ask our expert dustin. dustin- well clearly the monkey is in the wrong because the cow gives the milk to make the cheese so the cow, who doesn't like the monkey, should be allowed to choose who get the cheese. me- okay that was weird but anyways thats my opinon on why monkeys, cheese, and cows cannot live together.
