hip hip hooray! i'm actually more hyped up for school than usual, not only because i'm now king of the school as a senior (and totally get to wear colored polos, which means that i'm cool), but also senior year should be the sickest ever. if it wasn't for fugly ap calc and physics, i would be even happier. oh well, you win some you lose some.
