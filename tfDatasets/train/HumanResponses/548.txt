why don’t you clarify the rules? – you may think. but once you indicate the rules clearly, it will arouse opposition from those who are against the rule. japanese people usually think any conflict is of no benefit. when it comes to democratic process, it must be more desirable to discuss about the rule and try to reach agreement. but some japanese probably regard this process as waste of time and say, “we’ve done well without them.” certainly, it seems that we’ve done well, but how about hereafter? the number of foreigners living in japan continues increasing. we will have been left them out?
