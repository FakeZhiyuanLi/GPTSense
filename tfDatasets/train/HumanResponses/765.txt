another long weekend is almost over. time sure flies when there is no work. it was a great bbq on sunday, thanks again jerry. i just receieved those wacky pictures from the bbq and they are just way too funny. i think i will post some of those pictures up on my site soon. on a game note, doom 3 is finally out, but can only play it at resolution of 800x600 on my ati radeon 9800 pro, which kind of sucks. i really got to finish playing farcry first !
