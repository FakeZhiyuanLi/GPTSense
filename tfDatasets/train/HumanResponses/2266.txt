i know, i haven't posted in a few days (like anyone cares but me!). things have been a bit busy. even things at work have picked up. tonight, though, i have been working on spanish notes trying to get ready for the new semster. only a few more days! i had a scare tonight. mike im'd me and told me that dennis had been in an accident. scared the shit out of me. he's ok, and the truck is still drivable. i got to talk to him briefly but i am not sure about what really happened. it's about time for me to go home. more later.
