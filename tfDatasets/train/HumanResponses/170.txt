shadows falling down as the sun creeps away and starts to drown the other side of the world they suddenly disappear the only thing left is black the skyscraper lights illuminate the city and keeps us unafraid of the dark many different colors fulfilling our lives they create a painting in our reality showing us rays of a rainbow blowing away our sorrows and causing us to forget our days but each morning you wake up and you start your day anew you find that itâ€™s so hard to see the difference you can make forgetting the pain of yesterday will show that sunrise once more the one that brings hope where everything becomes a dream and keeps us fueled for the long road ahead where brighter things will come your way and challenges shall await you you must never look back you must never look back because this day belongs to you take your paintbrush and paint your sunrise too take your paintbrush and paint your sunrise too
