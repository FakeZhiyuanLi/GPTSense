sometimes things change and it takes me a while to catch on. i flew into dc late the other night, and it hit me that the town has lost a lot of its mystery for me. bush ambition to the contrary, it doesn't seem like the center of the universe. instead, fittingly, it seems like an ordinary town somewhere in the middle of america. first the airports: they close so early. i don't think i'll ever get used to landing at dulles in the early evening - the place is a virtual ghost town at that hour. national is open a little later, but it still seems like i've just landed in birmingham or muskegan. second, the view from a taxi. there are many buildings and monuments of historical and architectural significance, but they're spread out - there's not a cohesive downtown feel like you find in great cities like new york, san francisco, chicago, etc. washington feels like a town that could have grown up, but didn't. i wonder why.
