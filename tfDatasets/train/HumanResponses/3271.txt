well here it is. this is the first entry into the journal that i have been trying to start for years. i really don't have much to say right now. i'm at work, and i want to leave. i am the systems administrator here at phoenix worldwide industries, inc. i work with my buddy adrian. it's a cool job, lots of responsibility, but who the fuck cares. i want to get drunk. after work i'm gonna go home and try to go to the gym. tv sucks now that summer is starting, so i really don't have any excuse not to go. i have no money, no weed, and no girlfriend, so what else am i gonna do i'll write more later when i have better shit to say.
