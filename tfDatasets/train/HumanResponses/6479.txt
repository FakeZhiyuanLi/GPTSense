back home after a fabulous weekend away with my girlfriend, angie. i ache in places i didn't know i had! ;) on friday i didn't leave work until 4am on saturday morning. one of the programs that was meant to take an hour to run (at the most) ended up taking seven and a half hours! had to wait for it to finish. well, what can you do. got home at around 5am and saw the sun rise on the way. it was very romantic, which put me in a nice frame of mind for the weekend. plus a late night meant i'd be able to stay awake later on saturday! the hotel was great; a lovely room, and a shower that had so much pressure you could use it to strip paint! makes a change from what you usually get in hotels. had planned to go for a drink when angie arrived. but that all went out the window when she appeared. as i'm a gentleman, that's all i'm prepared to say; if you want juicy stuff, go browse for porn! lol we had such a good time. it's great being in love. :d steve ;)
