hi there. it looks like i've joined the blogging community, which by now consists of everybody and his mother. let me briefly introduce myself. i'm a second-year grad student at ucsd in economics working on my phd. on the side i would like to get faster on my bike and i'm a bit of a gourmet coffee and wine snob. life is too short to drink maxwell house and miller lite. i'm one of the few republicans in the department but i'm an equal-opportunity curmudgeon. it looks like i'll be doing some research in macro in the near future but there's no major hurry yet. at this point i hope to kick back and enjoy the ride.
