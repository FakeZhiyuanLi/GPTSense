i keep thinking about what my boss' husband says about being a parent"life without parole." interestingsince my youngest is now a proud member and resident of the county jail. not sure what i'm supposed to do at this point. bailing him out doesn't work. talking doesn't work. yelling doesn't work. guess it's going to have to be tough lovehopefully he doesn't take that as his mom doesn't give a crap about him. wish i was with my grandson making purple snowman with playdohor watching a movie with him lying on my lap. i miss him terribly. i wonder sometimes if he really knows who i am and how much i love him. ok, enough for the first timei guess i'll get better at thisbut at least i have made the first blogblog.what the hell does that mean anyways? chow
