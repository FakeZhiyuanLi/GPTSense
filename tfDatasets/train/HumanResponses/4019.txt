i realized after reading that last posting that it was starting to sound like a penthouse forum, or even worse, a posting on okayplayer.com's gd (yeah, i'm there too, just not on the regular) and it got me to thinking-is pornography the only universal use for the internet? and how many dudes troll the internet with the expectation that it will get them some ass? i admit that i have hooked up with a few girls i met on the internet, but those were thru dating sites, not via chatrooms. it just seems to me that the internet has turned into a gigantic sex clearinghouse, where you can get all that you were looking for but were afraid to ask about (kinda like that skit from chapelle show where he dreams that the internet is like a shopping mall-"i'm spamblocker bitch!")
