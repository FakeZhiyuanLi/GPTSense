i am tired, beaten and confused. woke up with that strange disengaged feeling of insomnia - had a shower and it still hasn't gone away. maybe i'm about to spontaneously combust. if somebody takes a photo of it that would be cool; and make sure to ring the hospital beforehand. so it would be less of a "spontanteous" combustion after all. more like, an organised combustion. wierd. anywho, i best stop clogging up the phone lines so jonno can use it. and i'll try and get around to getting my profile photo working. argh. "wide asleep today, and i don't want to leapfrog. just set me on fire."
