it is sad, people, when you arrive at work to find someone sitting in your cubicle. when that happens, something is not right in the world. and it's your job to fix it. otherwise, they'd be sitting in someone else's cube. and it is also sad when, upon first inspection on the human, you come to the conclusion that you afre speaking to a female, and the voice that comes out of the mouth of said homan contradicts said gender association. yes, that's right. i came to work and found a woman in my cube. and she sounded like a man. and this woman didn't just sound like a man. she sounded like a big man . and it's hard to carry on a conversation with a woman that sounds more manly than you. you wonder to yourself as you are speaking, "is there actually a woman in there? did she eat some dude and he's talking to me through her?" and the answer is left unsaid. moral of the story: lay off the steroids, you crazy iron-pumping lady
