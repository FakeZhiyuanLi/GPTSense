driving in traffic today, i got behind an 18-wheeler semi truck with a sign on the back that stated simply, in red, capital letters: show me your hooters. this poses a few queries in my mind, even if in no one else's: 1. does that work? are there hoochie mamas out there who'll strip off their tank tops and let boobies flap in the wind just free for the asking? 2. if one was going to entertain such a notion, how do you maintain control of your own vehicle whilst freeing said hooters? philosophical questions such as these boggle the mind, and will likely puzzle scientists and theologians for millenia to come.
