he seems to be fine.considering the situation. of course, i didnt say hichristina did. but atleast i know he's ok. it's so bizarre that this is happening. whta if he and i had gotten seriousi would probably be a mess right now. i guess its sort of a blessing because i wouldnt be worried about him. but i do sometimes miss laughing with him. we should have stayed closer.as friends. maybe i didnt give him a chance. maybe he was a great guy and i was the idiot. or, maybe, i just feel this way because of what nat told christina. who knows -j
