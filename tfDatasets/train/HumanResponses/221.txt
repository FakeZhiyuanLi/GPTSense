well. this is my first blog post i figure that it could be a nice addition to my site and i need a way to speak my mind without getting grounded by my parents. they pissed me off so bad yesterday, my parents. my little brothers won't stop telling that when i'm wit my friends i bug them and annoy them. such bullshit. then my step mother keeps riding me about insulting my sister when wit my friends when its not me it's my friends. and usually its when im not with him. so im sorta pissed off right now well anywayz. my life other than that is going pretty good i'm never stuck with nothing to do, except for morning and late at night. i've got a girlfriend now. natasha, she's not the smartest but she's funner than most other people i know and she's pretty good looking well im done talking ttyl paul
