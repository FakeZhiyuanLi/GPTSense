the feeling is mutual i know that you don’t like me, but you see i don’t like you either. i never listen to you because 			you 			won’t 			listen 			to me. you huff in deep breath i try, but truly don’t really care what you think. why do you try to be so rude, make me feel foolish frown at the waste of your time when you so obviously 			mean so very little to me. save your breath 							and exhale for someone else. you taint my air and i like you even less.
