given that your goal is to write at least two entries a week into this blog, i think i'll set things up like this. each week, i'll give you a prompt (for example, the one from yesterday) and for the other prompt, you will be invited to either post your own writing for people to read/respond to and/or respond to a second prompt. we'll see how this works. even though things can be read by anyone searching through the blog, i believe that keeping the response contained will make things run much more smoothly. thanks. ms. h
