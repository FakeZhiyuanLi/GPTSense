wow.it seems like only two short days ago that it seemed impossible, this idea of me having a blogand yet today it is more true than ever. how can this be?!? do i need to explain myself? who am i exactly? what am i doing on the internet machine that is so damn special that i deserve my own 'blog'? what i'd really like to do is have an erotic blog. i'm not sure how to go about such a thing. i'd ask one of my erotically oriented friends, but i have none. no friends!
