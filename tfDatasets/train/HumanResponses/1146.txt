today was the first day of rock and roll summer. to kick things off, i am going to see aerosmith and cheap trick this saturday. i have a bunch more shows planned for the summer to include great bands from my high school years. bands like kiss, the tubes, and steve miller are already scheduled. there may be more to follow! it looks like it's going to be a rock and roll summer!
