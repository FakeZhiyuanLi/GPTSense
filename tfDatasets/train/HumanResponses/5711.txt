well i didn't blog yesterday for several meanings, the main reason being that i didn't much feel like it, moving on im fucking sick of these damn pop ups my pc keeps getting. anyways i had a good day yesterday, although the friends that were supposed to didn't and charlotte left me to go out. moving on, its nearly time to be back at college which i aint at all looking forward to :(, cause soon it's uni and i will have to get a job soon which means my online time will be like dramitcaly cut :(. i have a concert soon though so it isn't really that bad, although of-course concert means practice so that means doing something then just sitting infront of the keyboard of course. no doubt : don't speak
