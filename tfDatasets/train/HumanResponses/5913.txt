we played pook last night at albert park. it was windy and cold (surprise, surprise). we started pretty well, apart from alex giving john a blood nose by throwing the disc in his face! but the we faded, and they won 11-6. i was catching way above my skill level. there was this one that john (i think) threw. it was about at my knee height and i was running in and i just stuck out my right hand and caught it! i was in shock for a couple seconds before i turned around to throw it away. everyone was complimenting me on it after the game. we went to john/barrie/liz's place after the game to have pizza, since it was alex's last league game with us :(
