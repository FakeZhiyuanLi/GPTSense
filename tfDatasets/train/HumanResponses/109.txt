got the shock of my life yesterday night. it was half past twelve and went to the bathroom. in front of the door was something dark. and while i was wondering what it could be the thing moved and went into the bathroom as the door was slightly open. then i recognized it as a mouse - and it wasn't a small one. unfortunately we didn't catch it.
