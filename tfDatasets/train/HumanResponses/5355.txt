late night a late night afternoon with clovers, present as you look me over. frosty dew that should appear, much later in the early year is what's ahead, i walk around, i feel my face, i touch the ground. and all i know that second there, is how it feels to feel your stare. i shouldn't care or dare at all, or blink as i embrace the fall. it's not as though i didn't plan things, make you think you had a hand in making me the way i've wasted, sickest, sweetest thing you've tasted. all because i let you move me, trapped inside romantic movies. when i start to walk away, i'm still to blame and not ok, and nothing's even changed at all, forgotten still becomes the fall.
