i find myself still thinking of you, every time i blink my eyesi'm so scared. i don't know if this is what i want, but there you areright there. my mind keeps taking me to that night, lighting, thunder and gentle rain. you kissing me, making all the others melt away.i still remember your smell, your gentle touch. i find myself taking deep breaths, just for lack of air, you make my heart jump and i can actually feel every second tick by just because i am not with you. i am scared not only because i don't want to fall in love, i don't want to hurt but because i am scared if i do fall in love w/ you, i hate the thought of our mortality. i nestle my face into my pillow searching for the smell of you where you laid. there is a sadness that clouds my mind and i find it hard to concentrate and a dash of confusion. i want you. i miss you.
