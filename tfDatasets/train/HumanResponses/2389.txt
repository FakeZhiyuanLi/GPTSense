i've decided to take up kendo. i know you might be thinking, 'hehe this dude has watched kill bill too much', and you're probably half right. i've actually been thinking about it for a while (probably a couple of years at the most), and have been ridiculed by certain friends for contemplating starting, 'cos apparently it's not useful unlike jujitsu or kung fu. well, i've finally got off my arse and have found a dojo in bangkok and i have my first practice on saturday. i have a fair idea of what's in store. i know it won't be easy and there's a lot of hard work involved. still, i would like to thank the timely release of kill bill for inspiring me to finally do something.
