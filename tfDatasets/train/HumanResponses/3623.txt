met someone wierd today. named llena45. just came up to me and told me her phone number (probably fake). proceeded to try to follow me into a locked room when she didnt have the key. i gave it to her because there was a dungeon there and she would probably get killed. i got down there and first thing a lvl 28 giant attacks her (shes lvl 20). she fights for a few seconds and then runs away. i kill it. repeat step about 4 times.gets kinda boring, so i stop helping her and she logs out. strange.
