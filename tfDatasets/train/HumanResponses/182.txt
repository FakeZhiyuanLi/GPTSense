i brought pepper to sentosa today. expected a warm and sunny afternoon. it doesn't turn out that way. been raining since morning. i nearly want to give up going there. luckily the rain stopped before the appointed time i'm suppose to meet the others. it's was a nice cooling afternoon. the only day i didn't get sunburned. there were 5 doggies there. pepper, rose, cola, coco and minnie. cola is the only stud among the bitches. a 3 month old stud who is very lecherous. he wanted to hump minnie and coco. had to push him away from the bitches. he had no interests in pepper though. think he preferred white bitches. minnie was a poor gal today. cola started to chased and bited her when she first arrived with her "parents". her "mummy" just stood down there watching her being bullied by cola. finally minnie had met her match. she was always the one who bullied others. she had her taste of her own medicine today. thanks to cola. my pepper is still the most obedient among the group :)
