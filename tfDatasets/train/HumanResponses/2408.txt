the other night i had a dream that my wrists were bleeding, but they weren't cut. i kept yelling at everyone to help me because i was going to die with my wrists bleeding so much, but nobody would because they just kept saying i didn't need help if my wrists weren't actually cut. i was like "dude! but they're bleeding! i'm gonna die!" and everyone just walked away from me. i know there's some meaning behind "being cut off at the wrists" and then being abandoned, but i'm not quite sure what.
