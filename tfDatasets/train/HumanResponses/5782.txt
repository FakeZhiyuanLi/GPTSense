recently i bought both taking back sunday cd's, and let me just say, they are rockin'. with alittle over excessive screaming on the first cd, but other than that, both cd's allow me to rock out. *clears throat* sorry. anyway. apparently some info on 2 games recently leaked out, and some people at bungie and the makers of half life 2 or getting a whippin'. thats correct. info on halo 2 and half life 2 have leaked, for example, the fact that there will be 4 players split screen on xbox live for halo 2, allowing alot of freakin' people in a game at a time. those dirty bastards, making the game even more bonable.*shivers*they will perish.
