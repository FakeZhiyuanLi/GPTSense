reagan is dead. he did put his mark on the horrible 80s along with mrs thatcher, but making him into a saint is slightly over the top. when charlton heston supports a president, it's time to be sceptical. and it's beside the point that heston was perfect in touch of evil, soylent green and a man called horse. having reagan as president of the world's most powerful nation is similar to letting your hamster drive you to cambridge in your new mustang v8. scary and dangerous.
