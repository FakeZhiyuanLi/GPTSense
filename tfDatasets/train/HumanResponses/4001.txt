haven't done much today. just been trying to bring my pc up to scratch after the install of xp on my new hard drive. i've now installed xp home edition 7 times on 5 different hardware specs, and it's activated successfully everytime! very unusual, but hey, who's complaining?! sven's staying. er.well, duh! he costs way too much to get rid of over some personal problems. instead of worrying about how he sucks with women, why not analyse how he sucks with footy i mean, don't get me wrong, he is a good manager and all, but if his personal life is not actually effecting how he manages his team, then what's the problem. what the really should do is give him an ultimatum. "england must successfully qualify for world cup 2006, or your out sven!" of course, they could be harsher.
