my grandparents are coming into town. which can only mean one thing, i have to sleep on the air matress in the living room. oh boy. i love 'em and all i just hate sleeping in the living room. we have to go to kemah tomorrow, which i guess is ok but i'd rather spend the day at katlyn's house. but i can't, so i just gotta stick it out. oh well. i love you katlyn!
