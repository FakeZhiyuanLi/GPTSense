i would like to jump on a train and not know where its going. i would like to be surprised at its destination. i would like a one-way ticket to nowhere. just pack my toothbrush, a change of clothes, and my wallet and see where i would end up at. i could stroll along at my own pace and see things on my own time. when i am older this will be my plan, when i have been loosened of the responsibilities that i have now, i will do this. i will purchase a train ticket and see what happens.
