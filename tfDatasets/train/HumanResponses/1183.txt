first i will graduate high school then i'll go to college and i'll play the lotto. if i win then i will have a great life without work cause i will invest lots of money and have it work for me. if not then i will just have to stick to my career which is going to be something important and i am going to make lots of money doing it. maybe i'll be a computer engineer or major in business management. and in these jobs will be very rewarding. i'll have a big house drive a skyline and treat my wife like a queen and i wouldn't care if my friends say that i am whooped cause i don't care what people think. so if i go to college i will have positive outcomes.
