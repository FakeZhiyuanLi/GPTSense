right enough with the cosmosis. jenna is back tomorrow night so i have to buy her the best flowers here for my baby. it was sunny for most of the day and then it rained, i am happy because my leek patch is growing and i have a likening for them so i went down to moss bros and bought a suit it cost me Â£999.99 that is supposed to be a bargin. goddamit things are too expensive. so i tried it on and people like it. so long as jenna does. i am going to pick her up tomorrow at gatwick so i have to get a lift with james. i want to point out to the stupid jordan and daniel that their story is not believeable and that i would like to email them at some point. at some point somebody is going to be pissed off because they are not really again their personas are awfully ridiculous. who is this parker is a poophead? can anyone have a more oaf like name? here coy_stars@hotmail.com get me
