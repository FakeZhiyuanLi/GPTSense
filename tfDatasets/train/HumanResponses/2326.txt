okaay, i met this girl. she works for the e mail arm of our company. initially it was just small talk through im. message here and there. which ended in me walking her home twice, seeing here at her office once, dinner (if you would call it) once, a stuffed toy and a boquet of stargazers. i start falling for her, maybe coz she bared out her soul, and started talking about personal stuff. and she is so responsible, something i'll never be. and yes opposites do attract. i guess she is my exact opposite in every way which makes her even more enticing. i hope you get the picture because i would never delve into any particulars. and it is so so hard to talk without specifics. let me see, fri we had a tiff. haven't talked to her since yesterday. where we sorted out our differences. and , apparently were making progress. she is something else, i am falling for her. i hope i could weather this though
