it's 0233 and i've got insomnia. slept over 2/3 the day yesterday and i'm not even close to being tired. it's so boring walking around the house alone that i wish i could fall asleep. i've been keeping myself content eating boxes of triscuits and doing this blog crap. it's beginning to become very therapeutic, i've always wanted a place to complain about things. i lost my usma candidate number and password, so i'm pretty much shafted unless i want to go crawling to my malo begging for him to bail me out. i intent on floating lethargically through sunday in a symbiotic relationship with my rack. no church monty? oh well, i'm going to hell anyway. me, hitler, charlie manson and beelzebub can get a poker game together every other friday. i think i'll go to centerstall and watch bj hall bring the pain over and over until breakfast time. status check: morale - 23% hooah-ness - 35% boredom - 89% optimism - 12% conclusion: the pain train's a-comin'!
