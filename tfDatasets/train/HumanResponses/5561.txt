harry potter and the half-blood prince the official title of book 6 is out! there was rumour that it would be named [harry potter and the pillar of storge]. the pillar of storge, i ask you! i'm guessing that the 'half-blood prince' is neville. it makes sense, seeing how jk said that the 'prince' would be neither harry nor voldemort. ron and draco are cancelled out, they're pure-bloods. but neville's half-squib, and also the alternative to harry potter, dumbledore mentioned in ootp. half-blood doesn't always mean muggle, you know.
