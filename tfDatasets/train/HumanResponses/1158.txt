i have to go to my moms today which sucks because i am going to be there through wedsday. (i hate my mom) but whatever, i have to go do laundry because i don't have any clean clothes. oh, and i am going to valleyfair with the guy i like (who doesn't like be back) and our friend (who told me he doesn't like be back). it should be fun, but it would be even more fun if he liked me back. :(
