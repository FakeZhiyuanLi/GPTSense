it has now been a week. the gayest week of my life. enough with the probing. the people i was talking to have vanished. someone was mumbling something about 'reprogramming' to 'better serve the company needs'. the "management" (as i have named them.) have started to take us to the back and begin our "meetings". i do not know what the meeting has in store for me. i just have to resist as much as possible. maybe i will survive.
