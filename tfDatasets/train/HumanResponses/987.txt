today i went for the prefect interview. the first thing that the hol told me when i went for the interview: "i believe you applied for ip program." then the next thing he told me: "to be a prefect you have to be loyal to the school. you have the qualities and your results are good. im not questioning you about your loyality but just to let you know that if you became a prefect someone else cant be."this struck me. should i be a prefect or not. if i became a prefect, then i ought to saty in sji. this concern about my future so i have to decide carefully. if i want to stay, i will want to be a csm. then it will be worth it. so should i stay, i also had no idea.
