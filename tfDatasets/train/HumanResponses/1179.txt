okay, for reasons unbeknownst to me, i believe that food on the weekends has no calories. why on earth is that? i feel like i should reward myself, making it yet through another week of work, traffic jams and other nuissances. this weekend was especailly bad, since it lasted 4 days. comes the week, i have no problem sticking with my diet. i exercise daily for about 45 min every morning, walk at night, eat healthy foods, but then comes the big saturday, sunday fallout. i'm with my most fabulous husband and it just seems natural to have more fun eating together rather than alone. maybe that's it. i usually hate eating by myself and will forget food altogether when alone. i need to ponder this thought a bit more, until then, i'm somewhat glad it's tuesday, but then again, i can't wait for it to be friday. peace.
