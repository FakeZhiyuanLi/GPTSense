so jessie wants in my blog. here you go jessie. tell the small handed german that you are now in itnernet fame. i have gotten no work done this week, and i will probably not get any work done until tomorrow. busy busy week. it is killing me. i am so tired i dont know what to do. con law is over, and i dont think i retained a thing. i am going to have to go back over my notes in detail because i think it all went in one ear and out the other ear. oh well. i am going to do a bit of work and then i am off to this benefit at the museum of natural history with the boyfriend. should be fun, but i am sooooo tired. i'll make sure i make it through though.
