thoughtless nights tears i shed concentration of deep thoughts while a blanket covers my head countless questions are calling but no answers to grab to stop me from falling i think back to a day not long ago a star had fallen in my hand and there was no letting go she was more beautiful than the universe the power of affection trailed with a curse so many times i think back if i could have changed a minute in time or switched from this to that but as everyone must find out love is but a word that must have feeling behind each mouth i tell this out of courtesy just because for everyone will go through this for this is my first love this is a poem of wut i thought bout my first love ya fun huh sweet lata
