although the summer's supposed to have started today, i've been having a hard day keeping my eyes open today because of bad and rainy weather. perhaps going to bed last saturday around 4.30 am had also a bit to do with it. also played the new driver 3 game all the way through in 5(!) hours. that's about 10 euro's per hour of 'fun'. :p anyway.just cleaned up my laptop (a powerbook 12") and learned that osx is still a delight to manage in contradiction to windows xp. no problems with defragmented harddisks or programs that seem impossible to delete. i'm not saying that steve jobs has released a crash-less os upon this world.but it's giving me less fustration each day :p enough nerdish chatter.
