darn. just as i thought it was too good to be true. spymac.com offers 100 megs free webhosting, and 1 gig e-mail. (sounds familiar?) plus, free blogging. :-) amazing, i thought. until i tried to access the spydisk (webhosting) feature. apparently, from the forum, you have to have wait 36 hours. they use webdav, and what is that? i've tried looking online for webdav freeware for windows (can't afford my programs to stop working after 1 month) and i've found 4 webdav clients at webattack. all shareware. kudos, webattack coulda gotten the freeware too? anyway. i quite like blogger. it's funky. now, how do i change the template?
