having a little peruse of the news sites for the tdf, everyone seems confident that lance will take the race. i too, feel that way, but we all know, it is a long race and a lot can happen. remember, tyler hamilton broke his collar bone last year, early. he will be a signifcant competition to lance. especially on the l'alp d'huez time trial. that will be amazing, and i will probably have to watch it live. tomorrow's time trial is a sprint, 6.1 km. i think lance will be in the top 5, and maybe win, depending on the weather. if it's slick and rainy, he'll stay safe. so, finally, my prediction for the tour, lance will win with at least a 5 min margin, total. if he loses, my blame will be place squarely on the shoulders of sheryl crow, and the definition of "succubus" will be complete. (needless to say, this belief of mine angers my wife, a bit).
