just got back from my roadtrip through civil war battlegrounds. very fun and i learned a lot. anyway,i'll be back on runescape soon. . . dang, i forgot what i was gonna say. . pffffft. oh, yeah. i just remembered that i signed up for a pen pal in japan. my japanese teacher (yes, i do learn japanese in my school) told our class about a pen pal thingy that she and an english teacher in japan set up. what was i thinking? i barely know any japanese that i can use in a conversation with someone else. i just got my first letter from her. her name is chihiro. her english is waaaay better than my japanese is. i have only been learning japanese for 2 years, and i heard that they start learning english sooner in japan than we start learning japanese here. this is gonna be hard. i'll probably just find a really good japanese-english online translator. hmmmmmmmmm.
