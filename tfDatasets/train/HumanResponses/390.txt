my inside source on this girl (her name is erica, i'm tired of saying "this girl") says that the freshmen shes been talkin about is someone she's serious about. damn, i'm so pissed right now. i'ma need some demon music so i can stab my wrists or some shit like that (jp). anyway, he runs cross country, and even thought i'd never go through with something like this (well, it depends who it is, and if it's someone i don't like, or i grow to dislike). sooo, possibly things i can do are -put sharp objects in his running shoes -trip him on accident -just kick his ass (cmon, he's a freshmen, i'm sure i'm bigger than him) -have someone kick his ass -ruin his relationship with erica (hopefully i can dig up some dirt on him) -something more evil.bwahahahahhahaha ok, i'm scaring myself with some of this stuff i'm thinking of.maybe i need a break.
