i'm just tired of being in this constant state of flux. nothing is ever enough and nothing is ever right. i want it all and i want it to be better than the last time. i don't really know why i am doing this, but, i suppose i just need to start opening up my life. i need to be ready for the next step, no matter what that is. i feel so trite. how did happiness and enough ever become a bad thing? when did i become conditioned to want and feel that want become "need"? again, it almost hurts that i'm so transparent. yet, i say nothing. ironic. i guess that transparent is the wrong word.more like childish, silly and empty. nothing new to say, nothing new to share, just raw.
