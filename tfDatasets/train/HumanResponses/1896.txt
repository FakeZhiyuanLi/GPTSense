i had one doggie sister and i have two human sisters. despite my musing that i love mom so much, i love my human sisters very much too. i'm sad they are far away. my sisters buy me gifts and love my licks. my oldest sister rachel really mad me sad by getting a dog. i guess he's my nephew but he's also a tool. my other sister sarah is very cool even though she likes cats. i hate cats. my family had one once and she just tried to harass me. i even like the fff (flat-faced fiend) more than that. i hope i see my sisters soon, sans cats and pug!
