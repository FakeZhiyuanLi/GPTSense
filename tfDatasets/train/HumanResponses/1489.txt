so i got bored i thought i would post this gay little thing i wrote while i was half asleep last night. it is stupid and for laughs. so dont be a dumbass and take it seriously. 0.o the past can not be changed. the future can not be seen. all there is is the present, the moment i hold in my hands. forward! with the sky above, and the blood in my veins.
