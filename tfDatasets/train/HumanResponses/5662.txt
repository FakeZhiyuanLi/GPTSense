today i had exams, i was really stressed out. i felt prepared because i was up until 2:00 am, studying. i studyied about 5 hrs. yesterday. anyway when i got to school and started my first exam, it was so easy. it took me like 45 mins. tops, everyone else took almost an hour and a half. then in my next exam, i was done in less then 30mins. their wasn't another person done for like an hour. it was suppose to be the hardest exam. i almost laughed at how easy it was. that was pretty much how it was for my last exams today too. so i guess all that studying was a waste of my time. i could have been working on my website, or something. o well, can't change it now.
