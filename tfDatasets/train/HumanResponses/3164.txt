i love my junior high kids.yesterday we had our first jr. high only class since i've been working at this church (after two sundays of cancelled classes because a total of 1 student showed up in two weeks.) i had a great class planned with group activities and fun stuff, and while we were reading the announcement sheet, we found the verse of the day from ephesians 6. when i asked a student to read that for us, he couldn't find it, and then we realized that nobody in the class knew how to find ephesians. so.we spent the whole day doing a quick lesson on the nt books and where they came from! i loved it because they were totally into the lesson, asking questions about it, and seriously interested in where this stuff came from. i'm really excited to see this hunger in them.may it be an indicator of things to come in the jr. high group.
