it seems hard to be a grown-up or a decent man. the criteria for grown-up are not evident. a few days ago i read a defintion for a man from one of the books i read when i am in my bathroom. .the convent men's group defines a man as one who has converted experience into wisdom and who willingly acts from and shares that achieved wisdom. .perhaps we have become men when we think it is important to be soft than to be hard. these two sentences are not new and not even any close to profound. but they move my heart-they tell me something i have not recognized.
