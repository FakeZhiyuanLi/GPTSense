listening to: blind guardian fast approaching (friday, to be precise), we have our very last gcse, providing no-one wants to re-do them. of course, this provides us with a good excuse to make a mess and annoy people as a party, so such an event will be going on in the hallowed grounds of."muzzy's" house. but only for persons with invites, fool. less of the cordial invitations, and more handy titbits of information/pictures for you to peruse. enjoy! this is big in japan - it's called cosplay. others prefer gay, or cross dressers. no, the one on the right is , in fact, a woman. sorry, is that.mr. richards? 'nuff said.
