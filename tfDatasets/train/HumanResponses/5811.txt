life may seems miserable to you but have you ever seen life from a positive angle ? if you haven't i challenge you to do so. it will help you a lot. as for me, i felt my life was miserable and i really hated myself for the past and for what i am .the past is the past no one can change it. it took me hard to accept it .well if there were a time machine i don't mind going back to the past and change it hehehe well my advice to you is to look at life in a different view a positive view and enjoy life take care  -kev-
