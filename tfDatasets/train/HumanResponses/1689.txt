so, life around my house has been pretty busy lately in preparation for the coming of our new exchange student from korea, who comes in a week. she is to stay in my sister clarissa's room, and therefore, she and i had to switch beds, which meant mom had to clean the carpets while we were moving stuff around and all. but it's all good, cuz i totally got to rearrange my room. it looks so different and it's gonna take some getting used to.
