i get to start writing [the last chance] again! i've been putting it on hold for really long, about a week and a half. too caught up with schoolwork. but now i'm free, and i can let go the edginess that's been building up inside me, every day i go without writing! now at chapters 15 and 16. bet you didn't know that i've gotten so far already, since i haven't been telling! i'm really happy when writing. true, occasionally i do get a bit frustrated when i can't find ideas, but i always get over it in the end. i'm not uploading until the story's completed.
