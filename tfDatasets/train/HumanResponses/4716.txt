this blogging is a new thing for me, although writing is not. i am blogging out of a need to expel my creativity from myself and share it with others, and my horoscope told me to "take a chance at creating something in an old or new medium," so here i am, creating something in a new medium. i like to be able to say what i want to, about things that i don't like, things that i like, and to be able to share thoughts, ideas,my life and opinions with others, and these days blogging seems to be the way to do that. so, here i am, trying my hand at sharing everything i can think of with everyone that is interested, read on and enjoy, or not! i really just want to write, write, write, and hope to do at least some every day. catcha later! critter keeper
