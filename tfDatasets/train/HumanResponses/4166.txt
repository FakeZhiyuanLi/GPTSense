starbucks is my heroin. really. even whan i'm drinking a starbucks (yes, i use the work like that) i'm thinking about drinking more starbucks. i just crave my triple grande soy caramel macchiato every waking moment. its actually a little scary. this morning, waiting in line to order and then waiting again for the barista to make my tasty beverage was killing me. there's this awkwardness before i get my fix that makes me feel like a caged monkey, i can't stand it, and i wish it didnt affect me so much, but i can't help it! now i need another one. all of this talk of the sb has me all riled up.
