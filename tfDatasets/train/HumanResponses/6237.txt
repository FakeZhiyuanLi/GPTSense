i sit and stair at the wall watching the world spin round’ me feeling your arms near by i close my eyes and begin to cry i don’t know how to say this or even where to begin but today as you left the house i knew you would not be returning trust me i tried to stop you i called out your name but the noise of the truck over took me and i saw the whole thing your body lay dead on the drive way your clothes were all torn i knew by the time i got out there that it was too late, you were gone that driver was too stupid to look when he hit the side of your car he tried saying he was sorry but all that came out was a sob i know the pain was brief and that you died before you could suffer to which i am happy god took you quickly and i know you’re in a better place but why did you have to leave? i didn’t even get to say goodbye please come back to me i sit and stair at the wall watching the world spin round’ me feeling your arms near by i close my eyes and begin to cry
