after the work i'm doing everydayi still find the chance to sitback and relax to a hot and not that comfortable roombut slow music in the background. in that hot and not comfortable room, i realize lots of things. like being alone in a valentine's day in my 4-teenage years. yup, i always say "i hate valentines day, it's just for the couples who love each other." ok, it 's a big lie the night i realized itwe should celebrate the valentines day that we really love and care for like our families and true friends. the next time that valentines day will come, i'll invite my whole barkada to have fun. every entry i publish here would be my feelings and realizations in my hot and not that comfortable room :) i hope it can help you to realize things too
