i know you love to read a story remember to give those eyes a break relax your eyes, look far away and you'll feel good all day i see you staring at a computer screen remember to give those eyes a break relax your eyes,look far away and you'll feel good all day chorus let our eyes see their best don't we put them to the test no more strain, no more stress our eyes need a rest looking left, looking right look at something far a sight no more strain, no more stress our eyes need a rest
