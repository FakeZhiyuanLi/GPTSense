i have this computer that we will call "alpha." it is used as a server for hosting files for my friend. well this morning at sometime (i will still half asleep) it was making clicking noises. so i shut it off and went back to bed. well, i got up this morning around 8:30ish. i didn't feel like dealing with it. i was going to go help my dad sell flowers at messiah college's graduation. but when i call him at 8:45 the flowers werent there. so i didnt go. i am sitting inmy apartment in the cool of the ac and i give a try to boot up this computer. it turns on, no noise. and it seems to be booting ok and i think its completely booted up. welli have another program to connect to the server and see the screen.and that wont connect. so i hooked up a monitor to it and during the loading of windows 2000 it doesnt even begin to load. it stops and of course my keyboard is dead so i cant reinstall. oh welltough crap. off to circuit city to buy a new keyboard.
