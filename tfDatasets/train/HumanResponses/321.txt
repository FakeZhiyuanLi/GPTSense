my place is overun by animals. one roommate has 2 dogs. the other has 5 guppies (used to be 6, but one mysteriously disappeared.) and i have 2 rabbits. one rabbit is psycho. will have fits of energy, running around the cage in circles and jumping. the other bunny is way too lazy and is huge.still wondering what happened to that one guppy. might have been sucked into the filter. could have also been eaten by his/her brethren. the dogs bark at sirens. and there is always a siren every 45 min. or so. aarrrgghhh
