i get home from a girls night out with nicole and there are cops everywhere in other newsmy neighbor, jose, helped me attempt to open my kitchen window this evening. he has great conversation skills and asks me, "so, do you do drugs?" what? it isn't like we are close. i am not sure if this was exercise in sales skills or if he thought that i did do drugs because the current state of my duplex does smell what meth labs are supposed to smell like (they are refinishing the wood floors next door). jose either a) talked to the is folks at work and they told him they thought i was high b) wants to make a new friend and find a new location to do his own drugs because the wife won't let him at his house or c) he just thought it was a good idea if the smell in this place doesn't get better soon, i will be high.
