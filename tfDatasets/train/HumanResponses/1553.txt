as you may have noticed, i use the words tis, twas etc. alot. i only wish there were more of this it + is contraction-like things. who will join me in a revolution to create more t'will, t'had, t'am, t'are, etc. will be added to the english dictionary and the world would will be a better place. *note - this may require the hypnosis of several/all english teachers in the u.s. so come prepared. all revolutionaries meet at my house friday night for an important meeting and plans. slowride.
