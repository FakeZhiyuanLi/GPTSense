i was going to go see napolean dynomite for free again, but we got there too late. so instead we saw saved! it was really funny, and being a christian, i didn't find it offensive. all these people wthin the christian communitiy are rising up about how this is a bad movie, and that christians should boycott it because it portrays us as hypocrites. hello! most of us are. actually everyone of us is. i believe that falls under the catagory of falling short of the glory of god. anyways, people should not talk about things they don't have a clue about what's going on.
