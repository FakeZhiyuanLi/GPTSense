i woke up darn early today as i was hoping uss phoenix crew will hold a meeting. but guess not. so i was working on the uss phoenix new look. it turns out well. after tkd class then, i get back to the comp, did some editing to project piper, and here is what i have done so far: ->new picture added to gallery ->6senses superstar karaoke page has an edited correct (hopefully) lyrics and hopefully by next week, the star trek :interceptor [deal with the devil] will be completed. also, i thought of adding some images of landscapes i made on my own using terragen program. that is all i can do and update on for now. au revoir.
