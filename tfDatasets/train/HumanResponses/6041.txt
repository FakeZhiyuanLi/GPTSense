got a call from office, asking me to help out in holland village's branch today so was kinda tired but still went ahead the day was messy in hv but overall it was okay. anyway, im getting too used to working now. so i gradually think of phei qi when im at it which isnt gd cause i kinda joined h.d. to divert my attention. to everyone who wants to know what's going on, there has been no news of phei qi since i came back from japan. however, mostly when i think of it im still optimistic abt this whole thing, even though there hasnt been a single msg, call or whatever between us. i've nv felt so strongly b4, there maybe other's out there. but none are like phei qi, recently it seems that my relations with girls really sux. oh well if life is run by fate, which i doubt, then i'll have to accept it.
