thought processes dampened all i can do is feel nothing but sensation makes sense anymore i'm feeding off my own emotion slowly consuming myself as wave after wave of pleasure engulf me a transformation begun at the time of my birth reaching a peak, not ending, but beginning again with realization leading again to the culmination of my personal efforts to simply be. becoming myself all over again for the first time looking in the mirror and liking what i see but not enough to keep it transcending physicality into a world bewitched where all there is left to learn is everything and love is the only knowledge we need
