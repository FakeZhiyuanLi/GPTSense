i know i'm not alone but i've never met another person of my kind to always be the bottom of the top or the top of the bottom i can never be ahead ov everyone for some strange reason. i'll always be the worst of the best or the best of the worste and i can never explain why. but if another of those people stumble upon this blog they'll know what its like when every one you know always better then you or your better then everyone you hang with but everyone in your category is better then you.
