lately in emails and several blogs i have seen there are many people taking every shot they can at the current prestident. well, let's look at some of the positive things he has done. first of all he caught the most dangerous leader of terrorism in sw asia and has taken the first step to moving democracy over there. also i see people who catch one or two quotes from him that sound wrong or are incorrect or misinterpreted. my question to them is  can you speak 100% of your words correctly in front of several live cameras and thousands of people sitting thereno?then back off. sure not everyone will agree with everything that the prez does but u cant go so far as to say that he has made the country hell or that the country of the free is gone.the u.s. is still the most opportunistic places in the world even nowso to all you bush hatersget used to it .he's here for 4 more years vote bush-
