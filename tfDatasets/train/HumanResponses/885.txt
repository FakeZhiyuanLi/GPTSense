got some small surf at garrettstown this evening after work. 1-2ft windslop was all it was but it looked better than a kick in the nads. really weak waves with miserable rides, but you'd find the odd one that peaks up and gives you a nice drop. good practice i suppose. there was about 10 or 11 people on the inside, swimming, surfing and body boarding. there was a fairly fun shore break, but it was mostly closing out. if you weren't there you didn't miss much.
