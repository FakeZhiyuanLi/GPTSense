i enjoy blogging because it makes me sit down and take a moment and stop all the madness of "busyness!" so for the next 2-3 minutes at the least, i am not too busy to blog my thoughts. that's a tremendous endeavor, i would say! today is wednesday and it looks like it's going to be a good day with the weather. i have to work today. however, i find that at work my primary function is to organize my mind, so that i can do all that i have to do. if the mind is not straight, the action is not straight. this is my experience. busy-ness (definition) - the state of being mentally preoccupied with many things at once. i'm starting my own dictionary. my closest friends tell me i need to do this because i'm come up with words and expressions that they don't understand. ah well. like the word, "werld." now see; i think that's pretty self-explanatory. but here we go: werld (definition) - the weirdness of the world = werld have a great day!
