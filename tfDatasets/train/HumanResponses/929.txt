i had a moment of stupidity today. i'm not sure why, but for some reason i started to get upset that i have been eating unhealthy food and not regularly exercising for the last few months. stupid eh? i decided a long time ago that i wouldn't get upset like this. i absolutely hate it when girls bitch and moan about being fat, so why should it be any different when i do it? it's not. thats why i don't usually do it. actually thinking about it now, i wasn't crying because i think i am fat, but more that i am just really, really disappointed in myself. i am disappointed because my body is the one thing in my life that should be completely within my control and it's not. i am the person that chooses what goes into my body and what i do with it, so it is my fault that it doesn't look as good as i'd like. from now on i am going to be in control.
