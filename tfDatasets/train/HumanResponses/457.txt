i found myself pondering that very question this morning because that's what its costing you and me for security at the dnc. $60 million - and for what? for a 3 day pr event? the conventions have no meaning in this day and age. there's no question that kerry is going to be the democratic nominee. there's no question that he's running with john edwards. so why the party? the replublicans are no better either. i'm sure it'll be at least as much to hold their convention in new york - and again, for what? in what way does this serve the american people? our last election made it quite clear that the will of the people has very little to do with the outcome of the presidential election, so why the formalities? why spend over $120 million just to put on a pagent to make the american people feel like they still have some role to play in democracy. i say save the money, spend it on something useful like yak herding, and stop the act.
