well its getting to be fall here in alaska and there is a bit of crispness to the air now. i'm pretty excited i'm ready for moose season and being in the outdoors with watching the leaves change color. we are going berry picking this afternoon i'm pretty excited its time to make some blueberry jam. so what do you do when your ex-boyfriend still wants to be friends? i guess just be his friend even though i still wish i had my arm around him. he is getting ready to leave alaska on the 22nd of september he says this is home but i kind of wonder if he will ever come back. some days i still wish he was more a part of my journey then he ended up being.
