well, i finally remembered what i did on saturday! for most of the day.nothing! then i went to the bar (post office) and worked for a couple of hours. they had a huge wedding in the mall, and tom was expecting a ton of people. however, that never happened, so i basically went in for nothing! we might take amanda driving after we eat. not sure if i am really ready to do this or not. it means that she is growing up, and i definitely do not want that to happen! can't stop it though, but that doesn't mean i have to like it!
