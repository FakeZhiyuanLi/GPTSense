i suppose it was only a matter of time before i took a stab at representing myself here (having already signed up for the blogger account years ago). i've worked with web pages, personal and otherwise, since 1995 or so, but i had thus far resisted this format. to blog requires more expressiveness and communication than i'd typically expect from myself. finding that voice is one reason why i'm here - even if i'm only going to be communicating with myself.
