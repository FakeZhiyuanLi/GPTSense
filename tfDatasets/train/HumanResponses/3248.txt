this is my second 4th here in buffalo. i really miss home on this day. in recent years i had gotten use to going up to knob hill right behind vanderbilt university, where you could see all of downtown nashville. it was really cool up there, because you could see down to the cumberland river and the fireworks the city but on. and it never failed that someone would bring along a radio, because one of the stations would have the fireworks set to music. yesterday, i got to thinking back about when i was a kid. how much i loved to watch the fireworks, but hated the heat and humidity of a kentucky summer.
