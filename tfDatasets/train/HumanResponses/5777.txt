i love tenjyou tenge. over every manga that i've read, and believe me, i've read quite a few hundreds. but the anime sucks. it hurts my heart to state this. the first fights were awesome, but now they've turned ugly. and we have the seiyuu's. they suck. really bad. aya's voice is creepy, shin's sounds like a pig, and bunchichi. let's not talkt about his seiyuu. anyway, the opening really rocks, and i still haven't found the full-version of it. 											i'm going south and then to germany in a week, together with my family. i'm not really in the mood for this, so lets just call it a day. 											 oh! great 's the best!
