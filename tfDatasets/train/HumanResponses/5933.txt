my first blog. should there be a book or something about that? so this is my first blog. ever. i saw this site on the website of an interview candidate. funny the things you learn from your interview candidates. yesterday, i learned that the latest twist on a "pimps and hos" party is "golfter pros and tennis hos". if this saturday's party goes well, i may have to have one of those. i've been doing a lot of different things with my life lately, so i figured a blog would be a cool way to tell people things that i've found and that i've been up to. so watch. i may just through something in here that interests you!
