we went to 80's night at neighbors's last night. sometimes it was horrifying and sometimes it was really fun. there was this weirdo that was following me around trying to violently hump my leg. he actually knocked me over with his humping action and almost took betsy, amy, and a couple of other people down down when they tried to catch me. then i laughed in his face because he reminded me of a guy in sex in the city. luckily i was able to get away eventually. it's sad when people don't take the hint. actually, there was lots of humping last night. renny was being melodramatic all night and betsy and i humped him into a good mood. nothing else was working so i guess humping (the word of the day if you haven't noticed) is the true path to happiness.
