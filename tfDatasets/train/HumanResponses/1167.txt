went up to blaitiere with stuart to climb majorette thatcher but the route was too wet in the 5+ crack after the 6b section to continue. retreated and had a go at deux goals instead. we did the first two pitches and then headed up the rest of nabat leon as we dropped the guidebook and were not sure where the rest of it went.
