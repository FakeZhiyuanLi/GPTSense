this is not a journel or anthing but i just have to ask this. if you have a frend, no, a bestfriend and they come over every day and they talk to you and yous are great friends, having fun every day and then they just suddenly stop comming over what would you think. what would be some of the reasons that you think they stoped comming over please leave me some feedback.cause this is like ripping me appart.we were awsome freinds no problems. except his family thought i was to old for us to be friends.im 17 he is 13 so they try to stop him from coming over my house .but he came over anyway. (not that they should have any problem with this because his dad is 46 and his mom is only 34 so you would think they would have no problem with age) thats the only thing that i can think ofbut it never bothered him before?.
