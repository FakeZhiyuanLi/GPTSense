pay day today! woo hoo! news: i am thinking about applying at unlv law school as well. it is cheap, and i love las vegas. plenty of jobs. but i don't know how much housing will be. i need to research vegas some more. :) however, if i find some other cheap law schools that are good, i might apply for them as well. i have about $18,500 to work with. we'll see.
