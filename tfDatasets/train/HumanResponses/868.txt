sorry for being such a brat, ryan. but thanks for the hookup with the gmail! it made my day. hmm. does the fact that getting gmail made my day make me weird? i guess i already knew i was weird already. on another note, i went down to u village to lucy to check out some new workout clothes because they were supposed to be moderately affordable. well, for now, i think i'd rather go to target. not because it was too expensive or not cute. but because i am feeling so out of shape right now (no joke) that i don't think my body deserves to be dressed in cute, slightly more costly workout gear. arrgh.
