god what on earth am i doing right now waiting for your mail as if you cared i know yeah i know you are never gonna answer me not because you are too busy but because i'm not even a pal honestly i had a crush on another guy earlier this year even if the special feeling just completely faded away i'm still too shy to talk with him he isn't like you yeah isn't like you at all he's quite athletic but you are far too bright the only characteristic you two have in common is that you are both very gentle you never meant to but you did hurt my feelings not because i'm too sentimental but because you are too gentle heartbreaking gentle and he sigh now i don't care the least bit i was just too lonely i miss you so much i don't expect you to know actually i dare not let you know how much i cared about you i still remember those dreams but now i can no longer realize them cause now i belong to another field worlds apart from yours now i feel crying better stop typing
