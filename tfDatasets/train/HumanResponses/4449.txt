ok, so maybe being an architect isn't quite the best idea for me to get into now, maybe four years ago, but not now. my reasons are that i would possibly be in school for 5 more years, then i would have to do like a two year internship, then probably a two year apprenticeship, then if i am lucky i would get in with a really neat firm and maybe in a three or four years then i could design some really impressive buildings! so if i started that now, at 23, maybe by the time i am 35 i could do what i really wanted to do with architecture! realistically tho, andrew and i are thinking about starting our own business(es)! more later maybe sooner!
