i just searched on google for xmbhost (my main website), and the stupid thing has put my blog over it, i can't see my website now.i think it might be because googles on the crawl and i posted a link to here that was on a forum being crawled (it was an invision board so i could watch it :d) so it's indexed this site, before it's got to my other one again. -_- i hope it goes back to normal soon.
