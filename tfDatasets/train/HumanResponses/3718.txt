just got back from having coffee with a few old pals. we gossiped a bit, told a few funny stories, and generally had a laugh. ever have one of those nights with old pals that make you wonder why you haven't gotten together more often? tonight was one of those. last night i went out with the posse.it was fun. happy birthdays go out to my brother brian (26) and pauly of the posse (28). this is the first update since i reformatted my hard drive because of the "porno" virus. i lost a few files, but i saved most everything. this'll teach me to do regular backups, and not to open strange files from the net!
