i listened to npr on wednesday and a commentator said there was speculation that ali sistani the leader of the majority of the shia in iraq was not in london because of heart problems. it would appear that his heart condition was a ruse to get him out of iraq in attempt to prevent him from having to act as middle-man between the sadr and the iraqi(us) gov. the fear was that sadr would take up residence in his house and force sistani to negotiate on sadr's behalf. this morning, in interview with larry king, w. was asked about the political divide in this country that seams to have grown significantly since he was elected. w said "i don't have a sense there is a lot of anger." what kind of sheltered world is our president living in. every step he takes and everything he witnesses are carefully scripted. unlike clinton, who i beleive was very much in step with the country, w. could be campaigning in siberia and he wouldn't know a difference.
