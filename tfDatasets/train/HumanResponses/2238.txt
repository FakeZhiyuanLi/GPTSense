isn't it amazing how quickly an online journal can be created? it's like breathing life into a web address. from there onwards, crystalisation of memories begins here. a little about how weird a person i am: it is exactly 3.13am and i have just created my third online journal (at an amazing speed of 30 seconds!) and my washing machine is purring with laundry churning within (mine, of course). but surely, you see the course of incidents that lead from one to another: "i ran out of underwear" leading to "i need to get my laundry done" leading to "i wander around in the never-sleeping world of the internet" leading to "a sudden irresistable urge to blog on a website that allows me to host my pictures f.o.c" leading to "creation of wild_daisy's blogspot". it all makes sense doesn't it? perhaps i'm not as weird as i think i am. after all, running out of underwear is fairly common.i hope. well, cheerios. my laundry is done. i must go do some hanging.
