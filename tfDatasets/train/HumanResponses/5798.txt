hey y'all; seems like john wyndham, the pioneer science fiction author, wrote one of the first short stories about time travel. specifically, time loops. seems crazy as. a woman travels back through time, upon recieving a letter from her future husband. thing is, her husband lives some hundred years in the past, so off she goes. one thing leads to another, and it's a cool time loop; eventually this woman becomes her own great great grandmother. her own ancestor, if you will. anyway, then she gets kidnapped again, and the husband has to write the letter to the future wife - because otherwise she'll never get the letter, never give birth to her eventual self, and the universe will implode. it's true! messing with space and time causes accidents; some people think it might prove the existence of god. more on this later. haiku break! "time is not linear, but history runs straight lines, and we don't fit in."
