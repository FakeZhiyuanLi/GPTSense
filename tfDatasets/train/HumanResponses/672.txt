the haircut i got outta impulse was intolerable so i've decided to get a hair extension. after 4 odd hours, whola! i've got nice long hair that touches my waistline! all of a sudden i look feminine and i love it! it looks so real if take good care of it, the stylist said it can last for 2 - 3 months. well knowing me.i wonder if it'll last for a month! angie : congrats to your engagement have you set the date yet? clement : wut's your decision? cheer up! mike : no way i'm taking pic with that hair! haha too bad! yeah jell-o is super cute! jennifer would love him too!
