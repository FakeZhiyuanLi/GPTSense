hey. is this thing on? dude, the ability to update the red zone via telephone is amazingly clutch. and amazingly dangerous. oh, faithful readers. if i start replacing my typical drunk dials or drunk text messages with phone calls to this page, it could get ugly. so sit back, turn up your speakers and enjoy!
