i don't really have anything to say right now. the title of this post doesn't really mean anything. i'm not actually in a bad mood, but i just felt like putting that, because i thought it would be a cool title. sometimes that is the only thing i have to hold on to though. ya know when your having a really, really bad day your only hope is that tommorow you can start fresh. sometimes for me though i get so bad that the only thing that helps me is to tell myself that life doesn't go on forever and i will die some day. don't get me wrong. i'm not suicidal or really depressed or anything. it's just that when i'm in a really bad mood and having a really bad day it's comforting to think that it won't go on forever. well, i hope i didn't scare anybody with this post. that's definitely not what i meant to do.
