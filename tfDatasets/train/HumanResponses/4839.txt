jeremiah. i just found out, after you bought your plane tickets, that i can't take off any of those days that you'll be here. plus, they want me to work saturday, too. so it kinda sucks, but you'll be all alone during the day until about 3:30 each day. but then we can hang out and have a good time. is that cool? oh, actually, can we just meet at the dairy queen in on middlebelt rd. near the airport for some lunch, like on that sunday? that's really all that i have time for. *this is all just a joke
