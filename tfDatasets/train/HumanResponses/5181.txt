i just woke up. couldn't post yesterday 'cause i went to church, then to my grandparents house until 9:00, we watched the 'horns get beat :( the astros beat the rangers, and the san jose sabre cats beat the arizona ratlers in arenabowl 18 (that's football). we also played some tripoley (card game) and some bridge and now i'm bored so i just keep talking.
