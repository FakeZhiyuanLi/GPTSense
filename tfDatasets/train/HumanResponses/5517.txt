the teenage years::smiles, tears, superficial fears, all are part of the teenage years. first dates, first cars, having crushes on football stars. first jobs, first kisses, one to many hits and misses. the best years of growing up, with great achievments and screwing up. good girls, bad boys, finally throwing out old toys. sneaking out, getting caught, remembering all the fights we've fought. boyfriends, girlfriends, hoping they're love never ends. heart-breaks, making out, just to hear parents shout. drugs, pot and beer, all are part of the teenage years. high school college, then it ends, its time to change once again. but we'll always remember all of the times, when we won we lost and when we cried. we'll always have memories of our fights and fears, and all the good times spent in the teenage years.
