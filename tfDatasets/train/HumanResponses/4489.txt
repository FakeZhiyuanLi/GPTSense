just saw bel's blog. she seems to be very happy now . made 6 new friends and even have a group name. while here i am, feeling so miserable on how come life is so sucky for me? i feel that most of my poly friends take me for granted, when they actually dun like me . and i dunno , but i just feel like shit now . i am very happy for bel, but i dun know if this will cause us to drift apart, by the fact that we are both now in different polys and my class time tables are now diferent. we dun get to talk much, wad more hang out with one another. haaiz really missed 4f! sometimes, i dun know wad to look forward to going to school for, sometimes, when i dun even understand wad the lecturer is talking about or how to work those equipments argh
