why do we work? is it just for the money or for the love for the job? :-) :-) just wanted to say that :-d but seriously, would i be happy had i been a rock-star? for one, i wouldnt want to play the guitar in my free time then! i feel competition spoils everything. the fact that there *has* to be a winner, and there *has* to be a loser, takes the fun out of work.
