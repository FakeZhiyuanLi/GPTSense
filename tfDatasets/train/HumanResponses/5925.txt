hello, today has been a quiet day. i have finished making the bag holder doll for ray's mom. she has lung cancer and isn't doing to well lately. we well be going up there to visit on the fourth of july. it rained a little here today. my dog abby and i will go for a walk later when it cools down. when its a quiet day like this i think about the past and worry about the future. today i was thinking about my late husband. trying to remember what he sounded like. ray my boyfriend didn't come home after work like he has always done on mondays. i was fast asleep when he finally got home. he said he went to a bar to relax. i'm not a man so i probably just don't understand what that means. we have no kids and it's midnight when he gets home anyway so why can't you relax at home? sometimes i wish i had never put a personal ad in.dunno if i should worry or just chalk it up to men are men.night
