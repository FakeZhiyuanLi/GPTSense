called her up she was asleep. i told myself i would never express any angst. but why do i feel this way? i really miss hearing her voice. i really don't know what's happening, feel like i'm falling too fast, too hard. i thought i knew myself. a certified control freak, i never should have let it come this far. heck i can't even decide if i want to go through with this or not. it's as if she's slowly taking over me, ha haa. i kinda missed this.
