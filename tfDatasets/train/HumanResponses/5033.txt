i've only ever programmed in c and perl, but i've decided to start branching out a little, experiment with new languages. i picked up php this morning thanks to the suggestion of a fellow jaxlug member and i really like it. it's far easier than perl in a web-based environment, at least for the simple database stuff i've done with it so far. i look forward to seeing how much more i can do with the language. i also intend to experiment with python a bit, and further experiment with ruby, which i've played with only a little once before. should be fun. darkmyst
