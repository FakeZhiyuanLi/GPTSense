lunch with ivy, dave b. and kristine. very nice and full, and yet, i'm still craving the chocolate cream pie i got ivy for her going away. i just caught a whiff of my very interesting breatha result of lunch. hmm. might need some gum and/or peppermint tea for that one. also, i may have to wash this shirt as soon as i get home to avoid a faint stain directly over my nipple area from my salad dressing. i need to start posting pics in my blogs. oh hey. it's 3 o'clock already. pie time. catch ya later, bitches.
