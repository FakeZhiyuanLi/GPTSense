i had so much fun last night because i haven't been drunk in a long time. my favorite part of the evening was talking right before we fell asleep. if the room wasn't spinning, i would've talked and talked and talked. i miss talking to you that way. i miss being able to say anything i want to say without worrying about what you might think or say. sometimes, i feel like i can't be myself around you for fear of offending you or giving you a reason to snap. honestly, when we're sober and immersed in our normal, hectic lives, the silence is deafening. and you know what? you were so attentive! for the first time in a while, you were asking questions and looking at me while we were talking. maybe my drunken state was amusing you, maybe you were fishing for info because i was in such a madaldal mood, but i don't care, it still felt great to be looked at, talked to, and to hear "i love you" before closing my eyes. same time, same place again tonight? =)
