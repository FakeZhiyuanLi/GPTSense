i just saw this movie. twilight samurai, and i've got to say it's one of the best movie i have ever seen. it's a man content with himself without an ambition to build a career that can ultimately destroy his humanity and family. it's the perfect portrayal of life and fate. i love it. it's messages are narrated beautifully without a hint of persuasion. so if you ever visit your rental or dvd store, buy this gem! i highly recommend it! i've also been listening to l'arc-en-ciel's latest masterpiece: smile. although the album's only got ten songs, every one of them is worth listening!
