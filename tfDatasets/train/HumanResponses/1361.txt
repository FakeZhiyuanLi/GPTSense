has any one thought about the important of friendship? i used to take it just as any other thing.but some people really change it all. one should be lucky enough to get a real good friend. if u have a one real good friend.then i believe u r the most luckyest person on earth. for me friends are more than any thing. its a treasure.and very few see it that way i believe? but i dont know if every one will agree with me on this matter each one has his her view on this matter. but i like to say that iam very lucky to have a very good friend with me. i dont know what i would be if that friend was not there.?
