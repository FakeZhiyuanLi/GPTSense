i haven't died peopleat least not yet. it's currently 2:30am and i just got home and get to stay here long enough to shit, shower and shave. literally. in a few i'll be off to lovely alabama and if i'm lucky i'll get to come straight home afterwards but something tells me i'll have to go pick sugar up in louisiana. ugh! i haven't slept more than 3 straight hours since sunday so i feel like a zombie but it isn't anything a six pack of red bull can't take care of. time to go. adios fuckers!
