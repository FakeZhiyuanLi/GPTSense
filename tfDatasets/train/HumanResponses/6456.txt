i have had a working theory for some time: successful terrorist operations, more than anything else, recruit terrorists. as of late, i have heard much conjecture about whether our presense in iraq is creating more terrorists. this is certainly possible, but i would say that terrorists pulling off terror operations is much more successful. finally, evidence confirms it. in the 9/11 review, working papers quote osama bin laden as saying that he wanted to pull off a major operation to create a "funding and recruiting bonanza." just as i thought. so in order to prevent the recruitment of terrorists, i suggest we continue to attempt to prevent all terrorism everywhere.
