what is up my peeps? just a quick update for y'all. first off, work is stressing me out a shade. i really should be looking for a full-time job right now. i'm getting paid crappy money for doing two even crappier jobs, and i think it's about time that changed. i just cringe at the idea of being stuck in some boring stiff tie for the rest of my life with a bunch of stupid dorks working around me. secondly, rita is working really hard to get things ready for shooting. this encourages me, which is good, because for a little while there i wasn't so convinced that this bird was going to fly. so thank you rita, if you are reading this, and good work. i am going to work on some of the rewrites tonight. nothing too extreme, just some touch ups on the dialogue and the backdrop to account for the change in climate. i might add a "hot shower scene" for tricheck, too.
