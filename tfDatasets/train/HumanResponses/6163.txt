mood: ill np: ac/dc - back in black so is it possible to have insomnia and hypersomnia at the same time cos once i decide i wanna go to sleep it takes me about 5-6 hours to actually get to sleep. and once i am asleep, if no one waked me up, i could sleep up to 2 days. so maybe thats possible. maybe i am just wierd. yer. thats probably it. reeeeeally couldnt sleep last night. i didnt end up going to sleep just cos i was too hyper from the caffiene. no more caffiene . so anyway. yus i did cut last night but that was to be expected. i did 9 new ones. onli small ones cos i was testing out my new razor. they were thin but they were pretty deep. they bled looooots. hmm. no one ever seems to wanna listen to me. i mean. my friends just dont care. i hate living, breathing, suffering. i hate my friends and family. fuck i just need to get out. and no one cares. *cries* may
