it’s difficult for me to put into words how i feel, the only way i could think of doing such a thing is to write a poem about how i feel. but to worn you, i hope that you know that these are my original work and half of my poems are published so if you do decide to steal it then you will get caught one way or another. what comes around goes around. sorry if i sound mean but i have had people try and steal my work and call it there own. i felt like someone had took my soul and stomped on it as if i was never even there to write it; like i did not exist to them. it’s the worst feeling in the word nonexistence, its nothing that’s it.
