i was just thinking today about a nap. i asked myself what is a nap? i looked it up in dictionary.com and it said "a brief sleep, often during the day." how many people, when asked what they did that day , say "i took a nap." they then go on to say that it was for two or three hours. i am guilty of it too, so this is not a premature judgement made before casting the beam out of my own eye. but here's the thing a nap is a brief sleep. in my opinion, and many would agree, that two or three hours is not considered brief. therefore, it is really not a nap in the true sence of the word. i believe one could say i slept for two hours and be 100% correct. however, i feel these two or three hour sleeping times are getting a raw end of a deal. so i suggest creating a word for these non-naps/non full nights sleep. maybe a mini sleep, or perhaps prolonged nap. or maybe we could combine the two and call it a slenap? let me know if you have any ideas.
