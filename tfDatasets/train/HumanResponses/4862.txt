bored, so, again, why not post. not alot really happend. went to my grandparents 50th wedding anniversary sunday. you'd think after 50 years of being married they would have something interesting to say. but no, not my family. boring stuff there. then i test drove the camaro that i'm trying to buy. fun shit there. my brothers eyes were so huge when i was peeling out and stuff. i loved every second of it, trust me. then sunday night until tonight, tuesday, i was in south lyon at my uncles house. worked my ass off but he bought my hungting license and all my tags so that saved me $75.00 so i guess i cant complain. came home and talked to shelbz about some people for awhile, nothing better to do. trying to figure out where brandon is, i think he's at his moms which sucks cuz i have the next two days off with nothing to do, and ralph moved/is moving so cant go there. oh well, two days of rest i guess. more in a couple days. i dont do enough in a day to post daily :)
