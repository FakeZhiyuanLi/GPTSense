everytime notice me, take my hand why are we strangers when our love is strong why carry on without me everytime i try to fly, i fall without my wings, i feel so small i guess i need you, baby and everytime i see you in my dreams i see your face, it's haunting me i guess i need you, baby i make believe that you are here it's the only way i see clear what have i done you seem to move on easy and everytime i try to fly, i fall without my wings, i feel so small i guess i need you, baby and everytime i see you in my dreams i see your face, you're haunting me i guess i need you, baby i may have made it rain please forgive me my weakness caused you pain and this song's my sorry at night i pray that soon your face will fade away and everytime i try to fly, i fall without my wings, i feel so small i guess i need you, baby and everytime i see you in my dreams i see your face, you're haunting me i guess i need you, baby
