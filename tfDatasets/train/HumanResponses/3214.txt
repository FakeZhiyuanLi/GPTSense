“my love” like a thief in the night i steal a glimpse of the master’s gentle hand at work. with the tip of my finger i follow the rigid cut of the jaw, mouth, chin. pausing upon the lips to caress; with the intimacy of mother and infant all the while learning, memorizing, abducting— a small piece of him to have as mine alone. and as a child slowly loses innocence, he will never even realize that it is gone.
