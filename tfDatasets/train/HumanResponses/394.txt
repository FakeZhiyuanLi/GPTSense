this time next week, i will be either sleeping in a hotel room or on the road. on tuesday next week i will leave to go to california! yay! i'm so excited that i even organized my closet and room earlier. in a way i kind of started packing. i put all the clothes that i'm not taking with me on a shelf in my closet, and organized all of my other clothes in a suit case in my closet. my dirty clothes went into the wash earlier. i'm so happy! well, i wok up at 8:30 pm today i went to sleep at noon yesterday. my sleep schedule is so screwed up. i think ffr is realy addicting. it's like ddr, only you press the arrows on your keyboard instead of the dance mat thing. it's much easier than ddr. i gotta go. later.
