i've been thinking, thinking of this beautiful man that was in my life for only a brief time. he impacted me, very deep. he was very tall, towered over my 5'1 self. beautiful blue eyes that had me wrapped around him with one glance these luscious lips that once gave me sweet kisses, very soft embraces that i remember. he appreciated each touch that he made on me. he was a great lover, too great for my own needs. i've been lusting for him for quiet sometime. if i only had one more night with him, just one, i want him to show me what i've been missing after all these years. i was foolish to let him slip away, very foolish. oh, i am lusting over this stranger i hadn't seen in years. i would love to leave trails of kisses and gaze into his eyes once again. if only time can fly back, i would be in his arms again feeling his hands caress me. passionate he was. oh i miss that man.
