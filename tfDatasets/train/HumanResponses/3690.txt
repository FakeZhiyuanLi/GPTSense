if you couldn't tell i was being sarcastic. my night was, well, pretty boring. a whole lot of doing nothing mixed with more nothing. i actually could have avoided the boring night but that would have meant drinking until i was drunk. i have no problem with that but sometimes it just gets old. besides i need to rest up my liver for the future. i mean in three weeks i'll be in baton rouge getting drunk as well as every following saturday until the end of football season. if only there was something to do tonight besides drinking. i was really in the mood for poker but the usual guys i play with weren't in town. everytime i read over what i just wrote, the words translate in my brain to blah, blah, blah. i think this was my worst post over. sorry for letting you guys, and girls, down. hopefully, my next entry won't suck as much.
