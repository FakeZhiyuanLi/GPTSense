okay. so i finally got my web page to work (http://jmh.250free.com/webpage/index.htm) and it only took some smart thinking by josh. who woulda thunk that border="0" would fix everything? so, yeah, that's good. and i went to the mall, picked up "the killing dance" by laurell k. hamilton part of the anita blake, vampire hunter series. got that alyssa? loo. good so far, and i'm only on page 6. didn't do much today, i slept until 2. and after going to the mall i have done nothing. what a wonderful day. so flippin' bored! grrrrr. i tried to get amanda to convince my brother to take me with them. it didn't work. she asked but he wouldn't take me. i'm so bored. bleh bleh blah! i had more to say when i first started this, but i forget now. boredom has overtaken my mind.
