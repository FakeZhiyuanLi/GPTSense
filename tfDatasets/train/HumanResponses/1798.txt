it was a pretty good weekend overall. friday night, i saw the new harry potter movie. it was incredibly good. some of the pieces were a little too hollywood, but i suppose that's the way the book was written as well. saturday night i washed my truck and got it sparkling, got a haircut and the went to the side bar. it was a great time and i met a girl names melissa. she's really cool and looks great in an opeth t-shirt. wow. what a body. sunday i just messed around with music stuff, did some recording, and went to the driving range. i'm pretty happy today because the weekend was fun. i haven't had that much fun on a weekend in a while. w
