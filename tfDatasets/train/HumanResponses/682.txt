current music: vineyard - surrender i'm giving you my heart, all that is within i lay it all down, for the sake of you my king i'm giving you my dreams, i'm laying down my rights i'm giving up my pride, for the promise of new life . and i surrender, all to you, all to you and i surrender, all to you, all to you . i'm singing you this song, i'm waiting at the cross and all the world holds dear, i count it all as loss for the sake of knowing you, the glory of your name to know the lasting joy, even sharing in your pain. that's my prayer for this week, and the rest of my life. like liberty said today, those are some pretty bold statements.some i can't really sing honestly.
