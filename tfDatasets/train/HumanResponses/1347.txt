fahrenheit 9/11 came out on friday (today), yet i got to see it yesterday. well in a sense i saw it today, but basically i saw it thursday at 12:00 at night. i would rate the movie a 11/10, and i recommend all of you to see it. fahrenheit 9/11 will be the first movie ever to change the elections. basically the movie shows how much an idiot george w. bush is, michael moore also shows the people what really happened september 11, and what our president was really doing about it. well i don't want to give the movie away, so go watch it! anyways, i just changed the layout of my blog, this is not one of their "stock" blogs this is a hand edited version, that only i have. well soon it will be on blog everywhere cause there are a lot of copy cats! >:(.
