hello there people. i am devin, or dragon as some call me. i am a teenager of 15. and it's not as simple as it sounds. isn't it interesting, how every life you look upon appears fairly simple and you tend to categorize it under a certain category of lives? at least i do anyway. it really takes a great deal of interest and caring for you to really see the depth of a person's life. every one's is different, no matter how similar to another it appears at first. well anyway, there's not much to write tonight. my friend came back from a place near tahoe today. i missed her lots, and i was dumbf*ck bored without her around. i was so happy to see her today. ^^ i haven't talked to the one i'm so madly in love with since our not so happy, abrupt ending of a conversation yesterday. *sigh* i think i'm just going to go to bed now maybe play some simcity 4 for a while. who knows. i like this font! w00t. well anyway. goodnight all! goodnight cricket! :)
