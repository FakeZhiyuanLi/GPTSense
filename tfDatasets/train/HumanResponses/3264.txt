well, midterm grades have been given. it's not that i failed during my midterms, except for p.e. class, but i somewhat received low grades. i got mostly 2.5's equivalent to my hs grades of 85-88. though quite high for some i'm still disappointed. i did get a 2.0 at math,which is good, since my normal math grades lie between 1.0 and 1.5, somewhat similar to 70-75.
