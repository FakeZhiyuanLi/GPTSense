i don't think i've mentioned the score for the [euro 2004] finals, have i? well, here they are, then. 1-0 to greece, embarrasing for portugal, that was. no extra time, no penalty shootouts. it really took all the fun away from the match, there being only one goal and all. i should start work on a second fanfiction piece quite soon, though i'm not too sure exactly when. should it be based on orlando bloom or otherwise? oh yeah, before i forget. i'm going to finish [the last chance] quite soon, for all you fans of that story out there, so keep your eyes peeled!
