hi all.trying to write the music for this song.help believing, receiving the burning inside, learning and yearning for greater light, melting the frost, moving the lost. through the winds of change, encircled by the clouds of pain, i guard it with my life, i need the warmth, i need the light. though the storm may rage, i stand against the pounding rain, i remain, a keeper of the flame. also.if anyone is interested check out a book call the radiant heart by dr. sharon j. wendt.just started reading it.fellas be warned it is a little feminine, but it is a damn good read. best wishes and all my love!
