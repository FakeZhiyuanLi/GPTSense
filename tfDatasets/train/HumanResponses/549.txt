why are there many tacit rules in japan? the principal factor is, i think, homogeneity of japanese or japan. japanese people don’t like behaving in different manner, for they want to avoid making themselves conspicuous. in a train, for instance, you can always see japanese people sitting in the same polite manner. in addition, those who live in japan are mostly japanese. ( it's anything but tautology.) race homogeneity is the important feature of japan. in short, japanese want to do as others do, and there are only japanese in japan. therefore tacit rules have worked well. it’s the rules which work only among similar members.
