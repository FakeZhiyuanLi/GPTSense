last night i went and saw the first movie i've seen in about 5-6 months. since i'm so cheap it probably was the fact that movies are free here on cbs that i even went. as i was sitting there watching shrek 2 i lost the reality of my surroundings. i felt as if i had a youth group sitting around me. at first i was happy with the warmth of the thought, but then it made me sad and i realized how much i do miss all of the youth that i've come in contact with during the past 4 years. to all of the youth around fairless, i'm thinking of you. to all of the youth at stonybrook umc, i'm thinking of you. may god be blessing each of your lives and calling out to you to join him in everlasting joy and freedom that only comes from knowing jesus christ personally in your life. i'll be praying that someday our paths may cross again. if not, then know that i'll be out there praying for you and smiling as i remember you.
