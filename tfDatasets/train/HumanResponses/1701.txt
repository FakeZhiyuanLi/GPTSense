hey everyone. why should we have world problems? i think we should just ignore the problems, say fuck the news, and eat cake. everyone likes cake, right? and everyone who isn't insane hates war. so i say we replace war with cake. people would be happy, fed, and wouldn't complain. but then, we'd run out of cake and the wars would start over cake. who cares. that would be funny. george bush yelling at vladimir putin because they stole each others' cake. ha ha ha ha!
