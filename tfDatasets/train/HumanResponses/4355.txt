april 3, 2004 lord tennyson was a driving soul. ~ n.c. (secret hero of these poems) strange how one such line can make it all okay, even if you're biking out in the rain at 3:40am and nothing seems to be working out the way you hoped it would. and none of that matters because you just spent 4 hours drinking wine and whiskey with your best friend discovering new/old wondrous pieces of music by thelonious monk and listening to cassady raps. and your roommate's good-luck-hug means so much more than the job you wanted so but didn't get (and it's okay to sometimes tell people that you love them)  makes you think the world's not such a bad place, sometimes :)
