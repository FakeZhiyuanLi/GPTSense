i am not having a good life at this point in my life. i think that this is god teaching me a lesson. i am having the biggest financial problem that i ever had. my mother does not know but i really don't have the money to pay my bills. my mind is not in to school but i have to act like it is so i can get out. i am have so serious problems with my personal life. why is it can not find love? i am losing my cool and i am giving up on love. i thought that i had found the one i would be with but he said that he is not interested. am i not good enough for love? do i look bad? or is it that all of the things that i did in the past is catching up with me? what ever it is i can not take much more.
