so i need to decide what to do with my life. am i considered middle-aged? i am 36. i majored in art-education in college, ran a restaurant for 8 years, and now i am the office manager at a non-profit. i am not happy. but i don't know exactly what will make me happy. i have started taking yoga classes, which i really love. should i become a yoga teacher? i could make alot of money (maybe?) and get fit at the same time. i love to paint. should i become a painter and starve? i like to write i need suggestions. i don't want to work weekends or nights, and i travel alot. i need career counseling. discuss.
