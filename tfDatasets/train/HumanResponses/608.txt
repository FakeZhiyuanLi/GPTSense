today was an ordinary day . . . i was off from wal-mart and didn't really have anything to do. there's no food in my house, and it was kind of an adventure trying to find something to eat. i'm really feeling too lazy to go to the grocery store. i've been searching for gmail invites and orkut invites, but so far to no avail. gmail swap has proven to be a bust as well. will has actually done more today than me. he had some stuff to turn in for classes and wasn't gone long. on days like today, we both feel like a waste of humanity, but it's nice to not have to do something every day of the week. sometimes, it's better just to sit around and have a lazy day playing with the dog. jen
