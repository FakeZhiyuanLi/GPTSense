i'm starting to get really tired of my job lately. it's really easy, but just sitting here everyday, thinking. thinking that i have so much more potential and that i could really be applying myself to something a little more worthwhile. there are several things that i've thought about doing, many of those ideas require a somewhat hefty, so i'm not sure what to do because i don't even know if these things will end up working out. i'm always on the look out for a way to make money on my own time and i really think i'll be working for myself in the future anyways but i've been screwed over too many times and now i don't know if the ideas i have now are worth pursuing or if it's just another hair-brained idea. well, i'm out. i'm going to hang out with the other guys from the band tonight. i'm really looking forward to it. there's been some friction between some of the members lately, and i'm anxious to just chill with em and relax.
