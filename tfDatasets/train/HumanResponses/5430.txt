i, robot is a famous book written by isaac asimov. in his book he writes the three laws of robotics and that all robots created must follow this rule. in the movie the head designer at a united states robotics is found dead. all facts point to suicide, but will smith a homicide detective that has a bad background with robots is determined to blame a robot. overall this movie is very well throughout and there is never a dull moment. there are parts of the movie that are very unrealistic, but most movies like that. i recommend going to see it, but if your like reading the book is much better.
