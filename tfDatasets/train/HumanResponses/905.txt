ok, normally we don't really care for soccer at bia. but this time the dutch soccer team made it into the semi finals of the european championship hosted in portugal. tonight the dutch soccer team will play against portugal and when they win they will go to the finals. as our office is on a prominent spot in the centre of hilversum we felt that we needed to cheer up the building a bit, so there you go! we want to wish the dutch team all the best tonight! and yes the photo is real
