hello! guess what? we went to port elgin with my cousin from detroit and we had soo much fun there! we went to the beach, and there were humongous waves, and we were crashing through them! but my cousin had to leave the next day, but we were gonna stay there for another week. so, on tuesday my brother and i went to see the movie "signs". the rest of the week went by, on thursday we went to a restaurant called "jangles"! then, when we were coming back to toronto, i begged my parents to take me to one of the many farms we passed by, so that i can actually see a horse up close. i guess i was lucky that day, because not only did my parents take me into a farm, but the farm owners were walking their 2 horses after giving them a bath. they were brown horses with a patch of white on their muzzles. one was a 3 year old boy named scat, and the other was a 4 year old girl named willow! they were magnificent! that was the end of my trip to port elgin c ya!
