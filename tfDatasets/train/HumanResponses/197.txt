last 2 weeks - crazy at work but found some time for play. 2 weeks ago went to the goring on thames regatta - played at who can drink the most pims whilst competing in tug of war competion (lost in final), and rowing race (came second too and fell in at end). last weekend had a good night at a nice pub by river will elaborate at some point in future.
