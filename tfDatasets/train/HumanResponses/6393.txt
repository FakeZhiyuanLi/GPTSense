in the dictionary a friend is defined as a companion, someone who will help. well my friends are so much more powerful then that. my friend natalia is one of the smartest people i have had the pleasure of meeting, melissa is one of the most creative, crusty is the most easy going, beane is one of the funniest, stock is one of the most un-predictable, and podd is one of the most brightest, he's always smiling. you guys all make up a big part in my life, and i don't know what i'd do without any of you! thank you for sticking by me and being yourselves!
