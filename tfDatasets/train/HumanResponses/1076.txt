ugh, today sucked. i wanted to go home all day. on the bus i decided i was going to go get the bike out of the closet and just ride it around for a while.but the key wasn't on the hook in the kitchen so i couldn't. oh well, maybe tomorrow. nothing too interesting today happened. just wish i didn't have to go back tomorrow. :-/
