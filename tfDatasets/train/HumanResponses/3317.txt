well, at about two last night, i managed to get stuck in the bloody ass by a fucking wind scorpion and christ allmighty, that hurt like a motherfucker. my left leg is still dead. in other news though, chimmy and i are talking about partying in the netherlands, it seems like a damn cool idea, get to a country that isn't likely to kill me, pretty peaceful, very openminded. europe's canada. man, europe is pretty nice. as for seeing becky, that was just bizarre, even more bizarre was that i thought she was pretty before i recognized her. thought about grabbing her number in spite of the other women. of course, then i get stung by a scorpion. life is fucked up sometimes. a big novel if you will. symbols. next weekend i'm doing shrooms i guess. that's cool. man, my relationships get weirder and weirder and weirder as time goes on.
