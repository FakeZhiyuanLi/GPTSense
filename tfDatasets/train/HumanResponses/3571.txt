i've made a blogger weblog, as you can clearly see here. i still have my xanga up, and i don't know.these two services offer different perks. i think i should keep this for a while and see how it goesmaybe i'll like it. anyone can comment now; you don't have to be a registered user. i could also make this blog my homepage :-) we shall see in the near future. well, also, rain (from earlier) kept me home today (no program). i'm not going tomorrow either (doctor appointment), so that really sucks. two full days of community service (for school), five days home. i don't seem to like free time anymore.
