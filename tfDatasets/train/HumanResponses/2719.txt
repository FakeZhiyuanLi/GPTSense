well, after spending 13 hours yesterday doing mcdonald's business, i came home to get some rest before another day of nothing but more mcdonald's business. you would have thought that my body at least would let me get away from the store for a few hours, but no. instead i spent the entire night working a shift, trying to figure out my new dream fry procedures that required us to take fries out of the vats with a skimmer an put them in a box with the same skimmer. don't ask me, but these are the things i dream about. anyway, i've spent the morning doing some more mcd stuff, action plans, staff reward lists, and now i'm getting ready to start staff reviews and notices. later i get to go in to the store to do inventory. i hate the end of the month.
