bush is so stupid that it's infuriating! it seems to me that there should be an iq test to be president. i'm not the type of person who gets upset easily, but he truly makes me ashamed that he is the leader of this country. i can't understand why republicans support him either. if kerry was that much of a bumbling idiot i'd be super pissed at the democrats for letting him get on a ballot.
