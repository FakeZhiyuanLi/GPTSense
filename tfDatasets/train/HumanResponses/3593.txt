i told my closest friends at work today about my decision to go for surgery. they both thought i was nuts as they saw nothing wrong with my nose (is it really all in my head? hmm) but they too have known me for 4 years now, so maybe they just see past my appearance too. anyway, it was a bit of a relief to tell them, and now my mind, as it has a habit of doing, turns to the more practical issues of the decision. how will i get home from the surgery? do i need to have someone stay with me while i'm recovering? how long do i need to take off from work? i also realised that it might be an opportune moment to quit smoking, as after the surgery i will only be able to breath through my mouth. i'm not sure i'm talanted enough to breathe and smoke at the same time :) roll on september 2nd so i can get some of the answers sorted out :)
