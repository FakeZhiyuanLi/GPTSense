why, you might ask? well, frankly, when we want erotica, we want quality erotica. but the market is being so exploited these days that a lot of the erotica out there is of very poor quality. so offerot have decided to put this right by pointing out to erotic authors and producers/directors what their failings are, and what their audience want. at the moment, we are only equipped to review gay samples. it may be that in the future we have people who wish to review the heterosexual stuff (if that's you, send me an email!). in the meantime, please enjoy our first review.
