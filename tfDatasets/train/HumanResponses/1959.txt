if you have to ask, odds are you don't have one. or you're too shameless to know better. but let's put it this way, if you can appear on springer and there's a good chance a fight will break out or some serious bleeping will occur, you have a jerry springer reputation. if you harbour deep sexual urges for your pet rock and you act on them on your front lawn and the neighborhood looks down on you, you have a jerry springer reputation 'cuz you lived the jerry springer life, you sicko. and if you're married to a man just for political convenience and he gets more popular 'cuz he bangs a girl young enough to be his daughter and then lies about it in a trial about whether dropping his pants and showing off his penis to a woman who was brought into the room by his state troopers constitutes sexual harassment, you deserve a jerry springer reputation.
