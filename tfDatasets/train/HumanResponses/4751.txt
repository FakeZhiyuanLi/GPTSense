agh! why do people have to do drugs? i just don't understand. ok we have another kid in and this time for possession of cds. she's asking us a million questions and we don't know the answers to. i'm sitting here listening to this girl talking to my partner and he's trying to calm her down by answering her questions. ok i've been here almost thirty minutes and she is already bugging along with my partner. please people be quiet. i'm thinking please stop talking to her and making her worse and let her sleep. please girl go to sleep.
