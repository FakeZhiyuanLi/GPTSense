i have a number of blogs all over the wide open plains known as the world wide web. for some reason, however, blogs on this site constantly catch my eye. they are organized, colorful, and did i mention, organized (something i personally am not)? so we'll have to see how long this one holds up. i'll still maintain my xanga, simply because i have contact with more people there.
