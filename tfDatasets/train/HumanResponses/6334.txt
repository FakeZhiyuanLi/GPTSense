so, an ex-boyfriend has a live journal that keeps him writing, and i thought that since i don't write as often as i should, maybe this would be a good idea. forgive me if nothing is very profound. i'll probably have to work up to that level after not writing regularly for a while. i just moved into a new apartment and i'm really enjoying it. the current roommate is a lot more compatible than the last two were, so things should be gravy for a while. the layout here is much nicer too. i think it has something to do with the fact that there are only two bedrooms instead of three, which takes away from the dormitory feeling and adds to the homey one. hopefully this will be a good place for me to turn over a new leaf and actually start writing.
