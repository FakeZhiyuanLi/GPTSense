written with a pen and sealed with a kiss. if you are my friend please answer this: are we friends or are we not? you told me once but i forgot. so tell me now and tell me true, so i can say, "i'm here just for you!". of all the the friends i've ever met, you're the one i won't forget. if i die before you do, i'll go to heaven and wait for you. and if you don't make it there, i'll give the angels back their wings and risk the loss of everything just to prove my friendship is true, to have a friend just like you! i love you forever more.
