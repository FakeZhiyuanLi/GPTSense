wow, yep i havent written in here in like two weeks atleast, but i'm not gonna try to put a shitload of stuff in here. i got my senior pictures back yesterday, and they're actually pretty good. or atleast like 4 of em are. i'm hoping that i'll still be able to get professional ones, even though i don't really need them haha it's just fun to have your picture taken man. i've still got to read this god-awful book for english .heart of darkness. one kid put it very nicely: "this is one of the most poorly and confusingly done novels ever written. with such an interesting plot, i was amazed at how utterly boring and clouded the novel became, the only reason this novel is still in print is because english teachers get hard-ons through mental masturbation trying to analyze this overly ambiguous work."
