i have been busy these last couple of weeks making and editing and designing websites! first of all, i am trying to put the finishing touches on my beastie boys website, that will take a couple of weeks, so i'll keep you updated. i was also asked if i could create a mini-site for drama at my college to help promote this play that we are doing called "work, leisure, life and death". i have created a template and finished most of the pages, but i have got to now put the information on the pages now which will take about 2 hours. i also have another site in the pipeline promoting myself. i decided that i wanted to create a site for myself so that i can put up a couple of promo songs for my album that i am creating. i have other websites that i would like to make in the future, so keep posted for further info. peace
