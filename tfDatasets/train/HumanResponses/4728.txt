we had a good first day. after crossing the cascades it got warmer. eastern washington can get old fast, and the curves though idaho and western montana can wear on you. we detoured off of 90 and took backroads to get to polson. it was definitely worth the detour. polson is nestled between snow topped mountains to the east, rolling hills to the west, is on the shoreline of flathead lake. it really is a beautful and quaint little tourist town. since it only takes a day to get here, nico and i are planning to revisit when we have more time to explore. i took pictures and was going to upload some, but realized i forgot the cable that connects my camera to usb. i do have a usb card reader with me, but it only works with one brand of usb card, which happens to be the card i didn't use. oh well. right now i'm leaning on making our next stop bismarck, but who knows.
