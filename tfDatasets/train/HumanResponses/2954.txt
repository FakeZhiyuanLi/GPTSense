i'm doing it again. i'm complaining too much and i feel like an ungrateful little shit. i'm have second thoughts though and i just don't know what to do and for the first time i feel like i'm not in control. i feel like i'm whirling around and it feels like everything is always spinning and it's never been like this before and i just want it to stop and i want it to stop now; i just don't know how to. i don't know if i wanna date him or go back to sulking all the timegoshi'm confused. ".so here i go.scream my lungs out and try to get to you.you are my only one."
