hallelujah i made it through the visit. of course she was here 45 mins earlier than she said she would be. so there we were at 8:15 just dressed when she showed up. oh well she sat and had coffee with us while the kids ate their cereal. we gave her a full tour of the new church which totally blew her mind. central would fit into our foyer. lmbo~ dinner at the china emerald was ok, i found some veggies and salad i could eat so i hope i didn't blow my diet for this week. but on a good note we are done with the visit until xmas so i can get down to serious dietting. mum, went on and on about how bad a dog would be but i tried to ignore her. i want my puppy!
