ok, today the pools were suppost to open. kids were suppost to get 5 degree sunburns, and parents were suppost to buy kids ice cream (well for me anyway.) but no, it's suppost to rain.again. for the last 3 weeks we've had rain, tornado warnings (like 80!) and hail that really gets us all in the mood of hitting the pool. so instead i'm going on a car trip with my family. nice small car + 2 boys under the ages of 8 + two parents who don't go out alot together anyway + me= one hell of a crappy day. i just want to go to the library! but enough self pitty ok i don't really have anything else to say. so i'll go. :) be sure to check out that horrible site! thanks all. bye.
