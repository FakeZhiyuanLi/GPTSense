i expunged the reverie of my affection, anticipating the notion of "us" desperately, i tried to uncover my thoughts did you notice my wanting? i sighed, i created a poet, an integration of your persona and mine not blatant to convey my emotions he's veiled, like you, in my unconscious. ecstatic, i went mad when you held me close near me, i distinguished realism and imaginings. with me, reminiscent of the rain, invigorated my soul you were the wanderer i inexorably valued the magic unbelievable my morning prince sanity. came the 5th day minx, catastrophic! i never imagined. twinge. resentment. dread. regret. that instant i died unnoticed. in my dissolution's phantasm, i heard your song i tried to hold you for the last time but the deity came and took you away love won't linger in oblivion. quondam. soon i will be appealing for a resurrection. for now i shall subsist in verve of reality. live and love. nevermind.
