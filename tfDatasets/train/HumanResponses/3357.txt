now and then, i would do a crass (if not hilarious) chinese adaptation of english songs. some of my prized works include baa baa black sheep, do-re-mi, and now, "top of the world". sing to the tune of the song! the lines don't quite rhyme but hey, the meaning does correspond. enjoy. top of the world (世界高峰) such a feeling coming over me 有种感觉拥上我心头 there is wonder in most everything i see 我看到的事物都是奇迹 not a cloud in the sky 天上没有云朵 got the sun in my eyes 眼中充满阳光 and i won't be surprised if it's a dream 如果这是梦也不奇怪 i'm on the top of the world 我站在世界的高峰 looking down on creations 看着地上的事物， and the only explanation i can find 而我找到唯一的原因就是 it's the love that i've found 我得到的关爱 eversince you've been around 自从你的出现 your love puts me at the top of the world 你的爱让我站在最高峰
