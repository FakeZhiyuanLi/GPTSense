oh my god this is stupid. my cd's are still not here. it has been a week and a half now, and still priority mail can't manage to get my a little box from ohio to here. i have barely talked to kris lately, because she is always doing something when i'm not working (which is rare, since i am working jen's hours also, while she is in missouri) and the stupid payphone at camp doesn't work half of the time. i really want to see her. in any case, we still have the 31st coming up. there is no way we are going to miss that because it is something we won't see again in a very long time. i guess i don't have much else to say, this has been a very boring few days. i'm going to go call kris. bye-bye.
