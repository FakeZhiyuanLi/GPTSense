okay.so i get back from the orentation thing. it was totaly boring. i am taking ceramics wich will be awsome. and black and white photography. and general art and tone chimes as electives. my cuzes is here and i have a freakin headache. they won't shutup. its " chaz look at this" chaz look at that." just shut up. well i am not going to be able to see my friend because the frickin phones are busy. god save me. it is so dark down here so cold with no one here. all alone yet someone is here. physically: no. spiritually and mentally: yes he seems familiar yet so distant. i call out and he responds with a deep yet quiet voice: someone does care chase. someone cares. when life gets you down deep look to your friends, not pity. i realized he was with me
