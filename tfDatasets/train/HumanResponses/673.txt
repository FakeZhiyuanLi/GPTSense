well, it's sometime in the wee hours of the morn and i'm beat. i just got back from the eighteen visions, midtown, and lostprophets concert and i am sore. i have a fracken shoe print on my shirt! all the dudes from the bands were cool, they signed some stuff and talked to us. i even met some scene sluts, ooh don't like scene sluts. crazy show, a lot of moshing, and yes i did get killed, i think i have a broken rib. finger eleven is sometime soon and got to recoup in time for that one. i'm going to pass outlater.
