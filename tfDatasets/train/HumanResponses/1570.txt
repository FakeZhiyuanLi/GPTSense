despite my girlfriends very cute protests, i went ahead and named this entry winkie pinkie ;) she's been working in a pre-school for about 4 months now, and has run the gambit of childhood illnesses. everything from the sniffles to full blown flu. and now pink eye! ewwww! anyway, i hope you enjoy the wonderful photo of her beautifully colored eyeball there. that's all she would allow me to post.
