there is a road that everyone follows, however the way of which we travel is different to others not that it matters, we all end up at the same place. i want her to understand that everything she could possible need, she could find in me. yet she doesn't seem to understand that i want her to be happy, even if that takes me out of the picture. sacrifice is something i have done, something im doing, and something that will be done. i always will. i want her to realise that i love her. even if she doesnt love me in return she needs to know. that way i actually tried to obtain that which is out of my reach.
