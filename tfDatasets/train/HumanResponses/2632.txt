if i were a tear in your eye i would run down your cheek and die on your lips. if you were a tear in my eye i would never cry in fear of losing you i feel so in love and some times i just dont understand why. i mean not really why just how could it happen. i know some times i get hurt and i am not sure why and or how. some times i feel happy some times i feel sad and some times i just feel all alone. i hate being alone i dont want to be alone any more. i think i just want to try and start over i would maybe like to live in a bigger town. i dont know if i could ever leave my family though. i know i want to be with davina when i think about her i smile with no reasoning at all just because she makes me happy. i dont know if i will ever be able to do this for her. i know that i am ready to settle down and start a family. but i am not sure if others are ready as i am. maybe in time i will find out but today aint looking good
