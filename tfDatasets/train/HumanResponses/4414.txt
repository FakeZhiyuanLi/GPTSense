so yesterday i had to yard sale to end all yard sales it was amazing the amount of crap 2 people can accumulate and the worst part is, we had one last year too so pretty much over the course of one year i purchased enough crap to make almost 500 dollars.how sad is that? so i have made a promise to myself that i will no long purchase something, just to have it, it must now serve a function or purpose of course i will probably say the same damn thing in my blog, one year from know, but what the hell, sounds good right? well now that we have sold all shit, i am off to go shoppinghe he he he more later
