seem to be having problems here, two attempts at posting a picture last night failed, here's hoping third time's lucky. anyway, the picture was to be of a little cartoon squid who goes by the name of squishy there he is! anyway, to explain - the blog's called squidstew because of a song we used to do in a band back at uni, and also (due to my addiction to console games) it gave me an instant icon in the shape of squishy from the kirby series of games. hopefully that goes some way towards explaining the slightly crytpic title of the first post. right, at work again, but it's my birthday today so let's go crazy with cake and jelly and blogs!
