today i went to walmart with my dad around midnight well my dad says my mom threw away all his pajama stuff. and shorts. well he said he'll buy one there and i felt bad because he buys me and my sister all this good stuff and he buys himself crappy stuff. i felt so sad when i saw him do that even thinking about that makes me tear. and when we were walking. he looked at this cd case and i knew he would buy it for me because i dont really take good care of my cds. and like. well i was sad -_- so im like cmon im getting tired >.
