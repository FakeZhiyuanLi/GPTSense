well it was another crappy night of softball. after playing to near flawless games against 2 of the top teams, my team decided to suck ass. i have no idea what happened but the teams' defense went to the crapper. mistakes were made everywhere. they only positive was the fact that our offense picked up some. i had a couple mistakes myself so i am not blaming everyone else. i had one ball go off my glove at first which is an error. then twice i left runners on base when i was up. i hit the ball where i wanted to each time, but the defence got there before the ball had a chance to drop. hopefully tonight we will pull out a win and have a slim chance to make the playoffs. i hope we make it. if not oh well. i luckily found a guy at work that knows of a fall league so hopefully i can get on that.
