it's amazing how badly people can damage other people. today was the first day of drivers ed. wasn't as bad as i expected. the lecture was just about how the engine works, it was boring. our lecturer was all right, he teaches or is a dean somewhere in jamacia queens. the driving teacher was nice, i'm in a car with mike and luke i think there names are, and sal. everyone except for me drove like an old person. it's from 8:30 am to 11:45 am. after that i smoked for a couple of hours and then went to the plaza and came home at 9:30 pm. exciting day.
