the center for american progress noted the irony in bush's appearance at the war college which has released a string of reports condemning the president's handling of iraq and the war on terror. in january, one war college professor released a report that concluded " "the invasion of iraq was a diversion from the more narrow focus on defeating al qaeda." another report came out in march warning that in iraq the us was "ignoring the more critical strategic aim of creating a stable, democratic nation." and last month a third report warned that u.s.-arab relations would suffer if the us fails to articulate a clear exit strategy in iraq. from democracynow.org
