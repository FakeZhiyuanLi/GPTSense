omg! i was just reading about the european union's court case against microsoft asking them to remove their media player from being shipped with windows. they should just get over it, obviously if there is a better media player than wmp (windows media player) which personally i think that there is, people will just get it. jeez they should just let microsoft do its thing. i mean they are moaning about wmp now but a while ago it was internet explorer and they still are not happy with internet explorer being shipped with windows, but when apple ships safari with its os no one complains do they, i think its just the general hate of microsoft and people should get over themselves.
