at work we were just notified that once the contract ends we would be put immediatly into oem (hardware) and customer service skills. basically the severence that we were offered because we were being laid off is horseshit. the whole point of that fucking package was so that we could have a comfort zone while we looked for new work. how exactly im going to look for work while working a full fucking shift all day. i really hate how theyve jerked us all around for the last three years. just totally lying, and fucking us around.  jax, signing off.
