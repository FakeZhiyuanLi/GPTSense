i spent the morning kickboxing at amore. it was very, very fun! that is about the only exercise that can keep me focused. i am recovering. while watching tv in the dining room, dad told me that to venture into the overseas market if i can find a job there. i asked him whether it is mission impossible for me to find a job again. he didn't answer. i am upset and i can't help feeling worried. at least, the medicine is taking a hold on me. even if i got a job, can i assure myself that i won't get into trouble with the boss? the colleagues? and the work? i hope at least probation is for 3 months' period. ok, i got to stop here. dad is here again. ya. comments/interact with me/blar. click below! thanks.
