i am going to a graduate recruitment fair today. it's one of those one-day events where companies offer themselves to new graduates, and graduates hope to find a decent job with a decent income. my last 2 million job applications haven't been a success, so i am going along too. there are also workshops where you can make your cv better, as they say. i am still not used to that it is fairly common over here to lie on your cv, or exaggerate, and i can't do it. but the downside of it is that employers tend to look at cvs with a certain scepticism, and who can blame them? my cv is awesome, and that's probably why it doesn't help, i don't know.
