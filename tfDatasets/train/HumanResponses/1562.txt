well it's now one month since i offshored myself. if that sounds strange let me explain. over the past few years there has been a lot of hype and paranoia in the us around the practise of moving "american" (hah) jobs to countries that have lower cost profiles than the us - primiarily in terms of the cost per hour of labour. this got me thinking.why should i be stuck here in a dreary anytown, usa office working my butt off for (an admittedly good) salary when i could be working my butt off for (a lower but equivalent in terms of cost of living) salary in an exotic location.like cancun, mexico for example. well it took a little while to plan. but now i'm here. it's only been a month but no regrets yet. my productivity has soared, i'm full of enthusiasm and energy for my work again.
