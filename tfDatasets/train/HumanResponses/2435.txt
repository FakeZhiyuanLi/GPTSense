i was walking to the train station from work today, strolling down rue stanley, when an old homeless looking man started crossing the street. he got to the middle, bent over, and stood up again with a large potato in his hand. he looked at me and said "look, a beautiful potato in the middle of the street just for me!". then he raised his prize aloft and proclaimed "this is the best potato i've ever owned!" and wandered off down an alley. well that made my day.
