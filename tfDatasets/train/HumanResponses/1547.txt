today president reagan died. now i'm listening to some song written about him called "i remember ronald reagan." a tear almost formed in my eye even though the song sounds like it's being sung by trey from south park. "i remember and i will pass it on, i will bear the torch of freedom, i will raise it and be strong." on a lighter note, i'm going out tonight (or at least i think i am).which means that i'm not an entirely huge loser. but i can't quite find something to wear.
