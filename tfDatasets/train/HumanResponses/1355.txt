hello there people well, today really blew. nobody would listen to me, i have absolutely nothing to do, hockey was cancelled, and a whole bunch of other shit happened that made this entire day worthless. people, who needs them, 95% of the time, they only want to be your friend if it benefits them in some sort of way. arrrg, they irritate me! ok, well, im outta here, see ya
