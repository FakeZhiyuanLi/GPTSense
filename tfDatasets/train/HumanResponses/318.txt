not sure if i mentioned in a previous post, but i hate the heat. i am not a sun bunny. don't like outdoor activities. no beach, no camping, no hiking. don't really like to sweat. which kinda sucks since i live in hawaii. i really should be used to it, having been born and raised here, but i really don't like the sun. i avoid the beach like the plague. i don't even know how to swim. i always joke that it is some kind of karmic retribution for some evil deed done in a previous life. it could be. i just can't see myself leaving here though. i'm doubly screwed.
