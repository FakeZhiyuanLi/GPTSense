whenever a bad joke is offered at work, everyone cries "jimmy joke". i resent it of course because of the implication that all i ever serve up lack humor is completely false. come to think of it, probably it's just that nobody ever appreciates puns, of which i am terribly fond of. yep, punny i am. puny i certainly am not. whatever, i always enjoy a good laugh and here are some lighthearted moments from my kids. ~~ 0 ~~
