i can't believe that pepsi has this whole crock of shit about appealing to hispanic people. not only that, but the problem is that they go out of their way to put the word "si" in their product with the thought that this is going to make hispanics think pepsi is amazing. if you put "yes" next to the word fanta on a can, it wouldn't make me want to drink only fanta for the rest of my life. then you have the fact that the product hasn't changed at all, it's just the word "si" on the label. it's obvious that pepsi is so dumb that they think hispanics are easily won over by having spanish next to the word pepsi. in the political campaigns, even though there are commercials for the canidates in spanish, the spanish speakers say that they will want to understand the issues and that a language will not just win over their vote. so maybe pepsi can realize this, stop being stupid, and drop all the crap.
