have you ever noticed how, everyday, at dawn and again at dusk, the blackbirds gather? always in the same place. always at the same times. there is an aramaic word seen often in the old texts of the christian faith. they seem to be talking to each other. gathering the information of the day. small groups flying from one tree to another, intermingling. you know, the old superstitions believe that these birds were messengers for the dead. that these birds carried a spirit's wish of words to you while you slept. this word is 'selah'. and that was why they gathered at dawn and at dusk - to deliver and take back messages, between the living and the dead. it means 'pause, and consider'. so maybe i was right. maybe they are gathering to talk. just not to each other. selah.
