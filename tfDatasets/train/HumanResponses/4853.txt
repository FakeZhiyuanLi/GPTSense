i relocated to hamburg (largest city in the north of germany) at the beginning of july and on monday the world's largest cruise ship, the queen mary 2 from cunard visited hamburg for 24hrs. when the ship arrived, several thousand people were at the river elbe at six o'clock in the morning to watch the ship enter the harbour. during the 24 hour stint almost 400.000 people came to hamburg to watch the ship. the coolest thing was that it was extremely good wheather (sunny and hot). but after the ship had left, it started to rain almost instantly :-(
