cracked cup of water day ends and time bends to fit it all in. trickle down into the little cup that is my hands hold it in by and by until its dry thought i caught up with it all by now glass falls only to bend and break i wanted to not be like the glass knowing i was showing the tiniest cracks enough to shatter through the toughest stuff thought i belonged but i was so very wrong i am not enough to hold tough agaisnst it he is the strength i find to hold me up it was not home until i knew he was there. day ends and time bends to fit it all in.
