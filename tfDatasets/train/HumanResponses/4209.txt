this morning i told my brother what i really think of him, that he is prolly the most selfish person i kno.i kno i hurt him this morning, and i apologized to him. lol, i can't help but always feel like shit, cuzz i always hurt people or mess things up. ahh, i cried extra hard in the shower today. for those of you who don't kno, which is basically everyone except one other, i cry in the shower everyday. i kno it's nothing to be proud of, but that is how i vent my anger, frustration, and most of all, my self-pity. not one day has gone bye where i don't ask god for forgiveness for the wrongs i have committed. i've been staying extra long in the shower these past weeks, and i have begged and begged for what i do not deserve. the truth of the matter is, taking a shower is the best part of my days, it's the only place where i can cry, and no one can hear me. if you read this, don't think differently of me, i'm still an asshole, i don't need ur sympathy.
