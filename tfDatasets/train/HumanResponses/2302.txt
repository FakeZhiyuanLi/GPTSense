hmm, i often feel as though i run in circles, many, many of them, all overlapping each other but, of course, none of them ever going anywhere but back into each other. we never want to lose sight of dreams, of pure angst. nobody wants to be thirty and say "i haven't changed. that much." i have come to learn that is gets more and more difficult not to trade in blue jeans for breifcases as we age. i never want to be that, i never want to lose heart, to become a social creature. i want always to dream and sway, to grow and learn. always to remeber where i came from and never to know for certain where i am headed. however, on weeks such as this, i feel life draining me, making me dull and horribly mundane, it taunts me with beauty that is just beyond my reach. i feel pure terror at the thought of becoming ordinarily domestic. dream a little dream.
