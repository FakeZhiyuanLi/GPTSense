number one child doing fine and having a great time. some of the girls were apparently grounded for having boys in their room late at night, but mine wasn't one of them so phew for that. they have performed their class play in a local amphitheatre, and she tells me it went very well. this means she didn't forget all her lines and have to be dragged on to the stage screaming and kicking, so all good there. and the little ones are off to my mum's tomorrow. i am ignoring all the comments about my ex (i can't cope if he is going to cause trouble! i can't take stress!). he's never been near her unless invited, and at the moment he's not so interested in the kids as he is in getting at me. so i reassure her that everything will be fine, and meanwhile my harassment notice stays in place and my lawyer stands ready to apply for a non-molestation order.
