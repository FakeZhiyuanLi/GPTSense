today is probably the hectic-est day of my life. after a gruelling session of badminton i cycled my way back to my house with a headache and i now have a whole body ache. i hate it when this happens! anyway badminton's cool. the olympics is kinda boring. the stadium is empty and everyone seem to have died or something o.o life kinda rock-ed today. and i have clean nose after a tough session washing itmy nose can now be declared black head free. ta da! dang im bored. goodbye! - blog ends here -
