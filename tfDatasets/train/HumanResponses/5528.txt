clay aiken returns he sang 'fantasy' last night. together with the top four finalists, and would you believe it latoya got voted out! that's so unfair! i thought jasmine was the worst last night. her voice is definately not for disco. maybe hawaii was too over-anxious that jasmine wouldn't make it and made 100 calls per person. jasmine didn't even get into the bottom 2 fantasia was in the bottom two which isn't such a big deal, she wasn't her best last night. but latoya! latoya london!
