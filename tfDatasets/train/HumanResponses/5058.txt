today was eventful i played my guitar for the latter of it. as for the rest i helped my aunt move out yes she's moving to dallas, whish sucks on two levels 1.)now i cant stay over and sneak out to see heather 2.)im actually going to miss that crazy girl. well i am really committing my self to this musical aspiration of mine and im infatuated, i also cant stop thinking about how awesome today i went, i saw heather last night and at school she just made me laugh over and over she makes me ridiculously happy. i don't know what id do if i didn't have such wonderful person in my life. im happy content and sleepy.
