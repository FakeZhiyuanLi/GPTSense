hi y'all, okay, this is officially my first time using the blog. god, i hope there's spell check because i can't sepll without it :) i got the idea from chris wakelin (check out his blog) a former colleague at lpc(o). he's super funny, so his blog is much more exciting than mine. anyhow, i thought this was a good way to update people since we're all over the globe. i plan on putting funny stuff up and updates. later, shanna (aka. the ~~~~~)
