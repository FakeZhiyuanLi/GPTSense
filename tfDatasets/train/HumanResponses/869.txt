yesterday i bought my sister's birthday prezzie. i can't wait to see the grin on her face as she opens it :d zapp's home *dances ab00t* he came home this morning, and apart from some very suspect fur-shaving (which makes him look curiously like a poodle) you'd hardly notice he'd had anything wrong with him. he is as cute, and lovely, and meowingly in-your-face as ever :) i can't really be bothered to type much now. we are about to have a picnic dinner in t'garden. so mebbe i'll be back later.
