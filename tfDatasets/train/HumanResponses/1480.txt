i feel so unloved no one gave me any valentine's day anything. on top of that there is this guy and he keeps calling me a feminen man i really don't like it. maybe it's his really uncool way of trying to flirt with me dude, kamui, if you're reading this please stop. let's see what else happened today? um. well, i glared at a guy in my japanese class, but i do that every time that i see him. it's not that i don't like him, i'm just messing around with him. he's pretty nice. even though he likes to laugh at me. well, there is still church later today so if anything exciting happens there i'll tell ya.
