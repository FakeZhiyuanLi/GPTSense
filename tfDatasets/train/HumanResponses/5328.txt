ok. my first attempt at becoming a blogger. new words, new ideas, new programs on my computer in an attempt to learn how to "do it all" i'm uploading a photo of gary and me taken. by gary himself! although it looks like we are schmasched - we are not yet there. at least, i'm not yet toasted because i'm learning all these wonderful new skills of bloggerdom. this is super cool! and i hear liz making more fun liqure drinks in the background. so i'm cutting this whole thing short.
