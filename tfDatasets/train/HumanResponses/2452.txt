so i'm finally posting in here. i'll try to come in here when i have some spare time. but today is the first weekend after school started. my week has been vigorous, filled with running all the way across campus to get to economics. and i get to see chloe every morning because she's in the portable next to my class (i think she's in government, but that's just a guess). has anyone heard about that crazy get-together somewhere near franklin? i'm thinking that no one's going to go, plus i have a gig that day. ah. the smell of money. -terra-
