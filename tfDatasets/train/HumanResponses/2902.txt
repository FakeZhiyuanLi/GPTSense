have not been online for the past week due to some systems know it all that came out on monday and messed this whole side of the subdivision up. 5 hours lost work and 4 "forced visits" from time warner they still don't know what is going on. can you believe that one of the techs actually went out and kicked the cable box as part of the service? anyways got a full plate have not been playing anything due to lack of internet and me accidentally placing my doom 3 play disk in one of the hundreds of cd cases that i have. anyways will write more when i have the time and hopefully my internet will be up as well.
