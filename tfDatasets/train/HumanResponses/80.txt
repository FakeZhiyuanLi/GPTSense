i was strolling down the wonderful avenue of my mind today when an idea struck my mind, rather than keeping my thoughts and ideas of he world all wrapped up in a pound of a neurons i should but find a place to put them down. i thought of paper, but alas paper is a medium which drawings are made not notes of this importance. i continued upon my wandering thoughts until it came to me, i will but put them on the internet. then and there it was born the idea of using a blog, a wondrous idea to whom ever invented it, to store both my thoughts and ideas, and hopefully some good opinions as well. i do not lavish my mind with the hopes of others reading these writings, i only hope that they are preserved in their entirety for so however long the internet shall live. iggy :)
