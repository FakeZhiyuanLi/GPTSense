wow, this school year has flown by. i can't believe that graduation for my senior friends is a week from tomorrow. then i get to go to all those graduation parties, which will be cool. awesome night last night. luke was wasted and he really is funny when he is drunk. he'd talk to strangers and wander off and stuff. hey, he even got a free scoop of ice cream from the ice cream dude. fun night for sure.
