there were times when i opened my eyes and the world is already chaotic the place is a mess and the weather is pathetic but i'll live cause in my heart i know that i'll always have you in your heart i'd rest my heart assured there were times in my life when i looked around and realized that i've lost the best things in life my head is spinning and my hope is all gone but i'll survive i've been through the beating up and here i am still breathing. the rest of the world is a piece of cake cause i know that you'll be here for me. will you? will you stay with me when everything is a blur? will you be here with me when everything is falling apart? will you be the one for me when everything is not?
