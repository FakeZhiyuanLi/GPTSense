happy new year, and welcome to my blog. it's takes only a few pennies a day to save a child in some impoverished country, but there are still a lot of you out there that would rather spend $2.99 a minute to talk dirty to some faceless stranger. ah, what a world. send an e-mail today to a complete stranger. from my corner of the world to yours, i hope we can all get along this year. you may be my neighbour or you may live across the ocean, but we all share the same sun and moon. peace
