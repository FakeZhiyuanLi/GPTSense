just a short post to introduce myself. i am 23 years old female. i am an assistant manager for a local convience store lets call it "bedspreadz" (anyone from pa, md, wv will know what i'm talking about ;)) i work alot, and my schedule is always messed up  which leaves for a cranky, tired bitchy person. lol  right now i'm not in too bad of a mood, simply because i am leaving for vacation in less than a week. me, my boyfriend (we've been together 8 years), and two people i work with rented a cottage in ohio. it's going to be one wonderful fun week of being drunk! i have just recently turned into a total alcholic. but you gotta enjoy life when you are young. however, i always take my turn being the designated driver! anyways gonna go watch nip/tuck and finish cleaning.
