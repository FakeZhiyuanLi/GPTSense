well now i can tell you. the so called "youth barbecue" activity (as mentioned below) was really a going away party for our beloved mexican, steve martinez. if you missed it sorry you couldn't come and say good-bye to steve before he leaves for tennesee. yes, he's moving there in about 2 weeks so go hang with him! we will miss him greatly and it will never be the same without him. his personality brings humor and crazyness to us all! it just won't be the same, steve. be sure to visit!
