there are firts breaths, first steps and here is my first blog. lucky am i to have found this. i am sure it will be a great new addition to my life. i have been thinking for a while that i would love to have a personal webpage, or some place where i could keep a journal. i tend to have pieces of paper all over the place that just make their way to the trash bin when i have no more room to keep them. i hope this will work. and i hope to find people i need to connect with. skol for the first try!
