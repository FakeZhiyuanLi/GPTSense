a week before the mission and it's all very interesting. often i wonder how god will work things out to bring him glory as sometimes things seem a little too complicated. but i trust in god. he has my friends lives in his hands and he knows what is best. so i pray that god will reveal his plan for their lives and also mine and that he is glorified so much that people can't deny that he is real. if you're wondering i'm still waiting to hear from both of the below. so there go.
