a little progress update. the draft of the first chapter is done. i am really excited and totally enjoying the experience. it takes up so much of my time. i hope i can carry it through to the end. i started feeling for my characters, they shaped up in my mind and started breathing and actually acting up, helping me write. i feel like doctor frankenstein, except my monsters are going to turn out great, i know it. well, it's late. i spent all the day thinking and all the evening writing. i'm tired. i think i'll call it a night. if i am able to sleep, that is. i can't seem to be able to turn my mind off the story, it is playing in my mind all the time.
