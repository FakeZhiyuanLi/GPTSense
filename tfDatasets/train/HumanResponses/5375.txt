well, this morning was interesting.i got to school, set up everything, then played what i had to. later, when the sun arisied over the school and into my eyes, it was difacult. but when it was time to take everything over to the feild, it was even more difacult. cecilia and i took one cart and nick took the other. no, it wasn't just a light weight cart with nothing on it. on one was two marimbas, music stands, and backpacks and on the other cart was the timpani, backpacks, and cybal stands and cybals. so me and cecialia pushed the cart half was up the hill to the feild when suddenly nick needed help. so basicly i ran to each of them and helped then out. then when we got to the feild, basicly everyone ran out of water. and it was fucking hot! anyway, my day went ok i guess. my student that i was tutoring keeps being late! damn him. gr. so i told him if he doesn't come earlyer, then i will be forced to eat lunch with him. it was quiet funny. ok, i shall stop typing now. toodles!
