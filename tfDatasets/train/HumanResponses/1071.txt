too dark to sleep too much light in here sleeping with the light on hiding from the man in the closet shadowy figures keep me awake looming eyes, faceless enemies taking my night, my life away trying to sleep with the light on so very very tired of fighting, hiding my blankets protect me pulled up to my ears covering the sounds, the ringing the wind calling my name falling asleep now with the lights on please turn them off for me mr. man in the closet
