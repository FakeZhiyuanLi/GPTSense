today was a cool day because my family and i went to the beach and had a lot of fun. we went boogie board for most of the day and then my step brother and i just swam in the water which i might add was really cold. we were all sandy when we got in the car but my parents did not care. now im worried that my dad know that im talking to the friend that i supposidly broke up with cause i was switching between windows and i think he saw the e mail but i know that i should not stress over it. its my life and ill deal with it how i want.
