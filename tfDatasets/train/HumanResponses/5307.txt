well, today is the one year anniversary of the fall of the twin towers and the crash at the pentagon.i was thinking and it came to me, that we should name the towers the fallen angels and the pentagon the mended circle.but thats just me, i know there are people out there who lost friends and family.and i don't know what to say, i can't say i understand because i don't, i can only offer all the love i have in me to each and everyone one of you who is hurting. please be safe, and stay strong. god bless us all. kate
