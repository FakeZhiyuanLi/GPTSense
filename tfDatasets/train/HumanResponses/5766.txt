well, the day today was spent taking a verbal beration from my mates about pulling toni on saturday. it's okay though. it was the kind of friendly attack which i totally expected, especially given it was my first time. i think i got off okay though, because as far as i know, none of the people who would really kill me about it, because they don't like me. :d anyway, depressing day today: first batch of results. :'( i didn't do terrible though. that's about it. tatty bye.
