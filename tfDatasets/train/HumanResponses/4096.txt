well another softball game down against a good team. we got a win! very excited about that. that brings our record up to 7-9 with 2 games left. one we should deifnatly win and the last i hope to steal another and end up .500. well wendy finaly start to do some serious batting practice last night. good thing since the season is almost over. that kills me. she did actually do good last night. she made a catch i didn't think she would. she also had a hit that made it over the short stops head. our top girl jess hit a ball that would have been a hr if we were in the alton field. it was a bomb. it scared the crap out of the other team. i love that girl! i got roped into umpiring tonight. that ought to be fun. i do it for the elementary kids but this is will pissy adults. luckily i have friends on both teams and should be a fun game. if not you will hear about it, lol.
