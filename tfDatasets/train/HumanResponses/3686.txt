just a quick note. i read rep. jim mcdermotts speah to congress on july 13, 2004. it states that while dick cheney was c.e.o. "two of halliburton's subsidiaries sold millions of dollars worth of oils services and parts to saddam hussein's iraq regime. " it also made clear that while iraq, libya, and iran were under severe sanctions, halliburton had dealings with all three countries. i found that odd because dick cheney campaigned in 2000 by saying " i had a firm policy that we wouldn't do anything in iraq, even arrangements that were supposedly legal." if anyone would like more info on the congressional findings let me know via comment.
