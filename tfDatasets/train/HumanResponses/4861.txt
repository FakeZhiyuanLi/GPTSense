i'm back home and will try to post pictures using hello the chat software from picasa that makes it possible to upload pictures to your blogger blog. have you been buying songs on itunes to try to win the awesome prizes? if you haven't this is probally going to be the last day. i forgot to tell you all that you don't even have to buy a song to enter you can use the tell a friend feature in itunes and type itunes100@apple.com for the email address and you will be entered, it is equal to buying one song. i know it is a little late but you still have the opportunity to win the grand prize.
