i was trying to start revamping my website when my alarm went off. hmmm. i wonder why . whne i rushed to my phone, the alarm came with a message "channel 73." it was then i remembered that i needed to watch a show on the national geographic channel called "taboo" which showcased "extreme cuisine" that night. the show was everything i expected it to be. gross but extremely fascinating. it even featured the filipino delicacy "balut" (steamed duck embryo). that ruined my appetite that night but i can't wait and show it to my coworkers later for lunch. lol!
