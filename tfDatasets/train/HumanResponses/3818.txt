my first real post. i have been reading a few other diaries on here ( i'm not keen on the word "blog" for some reason) and i have decided i am shallow. pain? troubles? angst? black backgrounds to your web page? cheer up a bit. i get cross and depressed along with everyone else, but then i realise i am typing this on a brand new laptop and i am happy again. consumerist, socialist uber-hippy - that's me. :-)
