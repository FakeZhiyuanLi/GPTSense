post number 30! everyone dance, now. but really, i just wanted to wish everyone a great weekend. i leased an apartment today. my move-in date is set for sept. 1st. it's not r.'s parents' place, but more on that later. he was a wonderful, loving boy today and helped me beyond belief. these are the times that i realize how lucky i am. and they are the times that erase anything negative that has come before. i'll update soon. i have to go to class (ugh!) love to all!
