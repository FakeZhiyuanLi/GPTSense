today was actually kinda boring, i pretty much watched tv like any other kid during the summer, but then i realized i had to get something done so i did it, then i said a rosary for my brother, dan, and then watched more tv, i know, not an exciting day, but hey, im just starting out for our lady of angels: readings for next sunday august 8, 2004 1st reading-your ancestors waited in faith and courage for god's primsed summons (wisdom 18:6-9) 2nd reading-because of his faithful obedience to god's call, abraham's descendants number as the stars (hebrews 11:1-2, 8-19) gospel-keep watch and be prepared, for you do not know the day or the hour when the son of man will appear (luke 12:32-48)
