today i saw : harold and kumar go to white castle it was the shiznite , specially since im harold and parth is kumar. cant wait to see it again. best movie ever . the story of my life. i love it. after seeing the film we left the cinema and contemplated what we were going to do next. so i made a few calls and we tore the fuck ass out of the cinema lot decided that we had the munchies and kept an eye out for a white castle. since we didnt know where one was (except the one in cherry hill) so i spotted a burger king and agreed to go there so we tore in to the drive through and orederd pie. it took a long ass time before we got the pie because the lady workin there is an idiot. after chillin in the parking lot and eating pie we burned a little rubber coming out of the parknig lot. i got home @ 12:15 im the morning going to sleep at around 3:30
