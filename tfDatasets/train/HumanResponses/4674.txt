here's a good recipe for a skid: a few inches of rain water and muck all over the road. here i am taking me wife back home from work - one would think a scooter would go nuts and weave all over the place. no sir, not this one. steady as a rock, this dio baby is. it just kept tracking where i pointed it. darn thing was as steady as if it were on rails.
