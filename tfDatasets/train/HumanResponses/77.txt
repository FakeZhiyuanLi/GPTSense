i hurt my bad leg again today, sooo i didn't do a blasted thing really. i got up and did a few things this morning then it started hurting so i put my leg up, and watched tv for most of the day. and the house shows it too. rod even went to mcdonald and treated us to a big mac and shake. we haven't had any forbidden food for a long time. tomorrow i have to go to vancouver for two doctors appointments. eyes and skin, and i am hoping to go goodwill hunting. i love that place. and there are sooo many in portland. i have found so many treasures there. well. see ya tomorrow.
