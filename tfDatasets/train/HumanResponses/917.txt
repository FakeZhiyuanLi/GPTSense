i'm so damn bored. life is boring - it's official. i have nothing to do. that's why i haven't posted on this thing in a week and a half - nothing really to say. last weekend was my parents' 25th anniversary, so we went out to london and had fun. not the most normal way to celebrate it, but there ya go. but they're having a party on the 17th - not massive, only 50 people - so everybody can come over and eat lots. which is always good. lemme think. georgina's bbq tomorrow, and that party next week. other than that, nothing to do. just brilliant. must play a game of football. i need sleep. i slept for about 15 hours last night, but i'm still tired. not easy being me.
