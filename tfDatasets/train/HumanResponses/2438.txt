today was our friend cara's 30th birthday. to celebrate this momentous event we joined her and tyler and some friends for a very fun few games of volleyball. i was completely inept at the whole thing, as is usually the case with any kind of sporting activity, but i still had a good time. the sand was really hot though. after exhausting ourselves on the volleyball court (pitch? field? beach?) we headed back to their place for bbq'd burgers and dogs and some much needed liquid refreshment. tyler wanted to teach me magic, but cara wasn't having that on her birthday.
