well the strawberry cheesecake from the coffee shop across the street was as good tasting as i has assumed, watching from afar. a perfect companion to some bong hits and reality television bliss to cap off a work night. it would come back to haunt me, first at 12:30 and then 5:30. my god the humanity of it all.
