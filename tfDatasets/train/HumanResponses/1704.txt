you guys wanna know some coffee that's the bomb!? of coursey. coke coffee: get some black coffee with nothing in it. then grab some coca cola or some cheap coke rip-off product. then pour half your cup, mug, boot, whatever you're drinking out of of the black coffee. then, oh the so delicate process. add the rest of the container you're drinking out of of the coke . make sure theres room cause the next ingrediant is sugar! k, por in how ever much sugar you want and the coffee'll fizz now it's like those expensive shit coffees you find in the ever-loving snot starbucks. stir it and drink the junk. super caffine and super tastiness. down like 4 cups and try to sit still bizotch! hahaha. that's about the end of my post that wasn't philosphy but you guys should know it anyways. if you want a little kick add about a shot of vodka. smirnoff perferable. thanks for tuning in! till next time, keep up the shit dumass!
