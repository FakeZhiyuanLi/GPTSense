'k, peeps, just learned that the hunger site etc. only counts one click per person per day maximum per site of the five, so i've been clicking foolishly for a while today, but oh well. it's still worth while. it's just a few mouse clicks to help out all those causes a little bit, and it's still free. i just have to remember to click them every day, but they're willing to send you reminders to do that.
