today is tuesday, and i haven't written in here at all over the long weekend. must had too much fun eh? jk, i didn't do a thing, until sunday. i went to the movies, i saw shrek 2. it was alright, nothing big, some funny parts. i went with lacey, josh, and ryan. shelley is sitting beside me and being crazy (she asked if she annoyed me, what do i say? jk she doesn't). so yeah, oh right i was at the garage sale this weekend too. we made like $300 which is pretty good for out first fundraiser. lots of people showed up (not from our class), but from all over. it was a good turn out, and we were happy with what we got. but weren't happy when we had two van loads of left over junk to take home. but i guess thats what you get when you sign up for this. anyways, i'm out until after school
