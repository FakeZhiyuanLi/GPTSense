we always have pizza on friday nights. it takes the stress out of "what am i going to make for dinner" and the kids look forward to it. in fact, many of their friends look forward to it too! but tonight we are having a family gathering at my mom's and i've offered to make pizza for all the kids. so i've been madly making dough in my breadmaker (which is very easy but still needs to be done) and freezing it. now i have to go home and cut vegetables for the vegetarian cousins' pizzas and grate a huge amount of cheese. then i'll have to cart it all over to my mom's without wrecking the crusts. it is not the usual relaxing friday night, but this hasn't been a relaxed week at all.
