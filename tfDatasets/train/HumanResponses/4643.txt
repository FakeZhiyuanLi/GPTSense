here in the city- i am in complete sensory overload. as i sit here and type i hear cars, people screaming and the ring of just noise. i have had a million calls today. i am realizing that my life revolves around a cell phone and the internet. what happened here? but in the midst of the noise, i love city life. how can one person be so craving silence but yet love everything in which the city has to offer. i am looking forward to the silence of a plane i will take to west palm on saturday. life is very busy right now. i pray that god quiets my spirit and speaks to me. i really need to hear his stilling and calming voice. i am asking him specifically to show up in a tangible way during the next two days. a friend of mine has lost something. father, i want so much for you to show up in the bushes very much like you did for moses. we believe you hear us. we want to see you here in this city. please intervene.
