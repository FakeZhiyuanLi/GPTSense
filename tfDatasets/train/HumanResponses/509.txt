writings in the dark, no glare, no light, so much life. the only light is the alarm clock, and the street light that creeps through the blinds with such a brilliance it is like an unending light that is dark and has so much feeling. the green light of the alarm clock glares off my pen to make reflections on you, you piece of paper i can write to you and noone can care. i can see the outline of the hulk on my sheets and thats it. this soft music helps me to write to you, i can barley stay awake anymore to see the faces of this life drown into certain places of myth and leave us. please leave this place now and make room for the good ones leave us in peace, in health, in love.
