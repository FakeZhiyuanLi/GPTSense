when something goes wrong, i look into your eyes, and everything turns out alright. when i am depressed, i look into your eyes, and i am filled with happiness. when i am in pain, i look into your eyes, and all of my pain disappears. when i cower in fear, i look into your eyes, and my fear goes away. when i feel that i might loose you, i look into your eyes, and i know that i can trust you. when i am worried, i look into your eyes, and i know that everything will be ok.
