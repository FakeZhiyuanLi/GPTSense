i spend all my waking moments weeding our vegetable patch. why do they grow so fast? why can't they get the message? it doesn't help that our 'patch' is the size of a small sports field, i think we'll cut it in half next year. jen mowed the lawn while i watched and drank beer, that was the fun part of the day.
