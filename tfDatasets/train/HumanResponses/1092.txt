its just not god damned fair is it? am i the only one whos sick as hell to see the same thing happen to an england side time after time after time. i can remember the pain of england v west germany 1990 (still west germany!) as waddle and pierce miss the penalties. the pain again against germany in 1996 when southgate (bastard) missed. the pain against argentina in france 1998 after another 2:2 draw and another sol campbell goal disallowed! ince and batty could hardly be blamed; both being defensive midfielders who rarely netted anyhow, but beckham and vassel thats the third consectutive penalty beckhams fucked up for england! goddamnit its not fair. and another thing. we fought on the same side as the french in the war did we not? so why the hatred and the glee at our failure?
