my apartment complex just decided to refuse to sign a new lease with me unless i get rid of my dog. fucking bastards. i have had my dog here for a year and they approved him wtf is their problem? thinking about taking them to court but i don't think i would win because they have the right not to let me sign a new lease for no reason right? i dunno i'm not sure about that one. plus i didn't tape the conversation i had with the manager when she told me it was because of the dog. so i can't prove that stupid me. i haven't found a home for him yet but i'm looking i refuse to take him to the pound because thats like sending him to his death bed. i am moving to indiana in 8 months! finally i get to be with my boyfriend. we are getting married in december 2005 ! hopefully if all goes as planned. it has been a bitch since he left here :( everyone hope i find a good home for my dog. thanks.
