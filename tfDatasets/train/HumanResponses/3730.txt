i'm speechless. well, maybe not. we got out early from band camp! o_o you may have noticed that i've been writing about nothing besides band camp lately. here's why: i'm on my feet usually at least 7 hours a day, sometimes up to 10. with barely enough breaks for lunch and supper, i'm basically commited to band camp for 13 hours a day. now you now. shoot, i never got that pudding.*light bulb* idea i'll give you some random fact, or word, or something in japanese on each of my blog posts to share my enlightenment. (hehe) japanese word of the day/week/entry/whatever: プディング pudingu that's katakana, the more angular of nihongo's 2 phonetic alphabets. katakana's used for 'borrowed' words, like pudding. tee hee. trlblzr
