another minister at our church asked me a question last week that i thought was insightful. he referred to the story in john 9 where jesus' followers asked him about a man born blind, and whose sin caused that ailment, the man's or his parent's. the question was, is being blind inherently a bad thing? we realized that the question that was asked of jesus, "whose sin caused this," assumed that blindness was a bad thing or a punishment that would be the result of sin. jesus' answer is great."it is not this man’s sin or his parents’ sin that made him be blind. this man was born blind so that god’s power could be shown in him." i would like to see my weaknesses, as well as those of people around me, as opportunities for god's power to be shown.not just as weaknesses for us to hide or work around.
