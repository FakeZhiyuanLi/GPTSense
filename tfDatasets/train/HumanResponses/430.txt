today, the sorority placed their votes on which house they wanted to be partnered with for greek week. they ended up voting fo rdelta lambda, who wasn't even up for votes. the seniors were raged and scorned the girls who did not pick there choice of fraternity house. they eventually got over it and began their week of greek week. meanwhile, at a keg party thrown by the delta lambdas one of the frat brothers raped one of the alpha ros. (the alpha ros are the main sorority in this book.) she told her dad and her parents told her that she wans't going back, and that it was the sororities fault. she completely disagreed and even told them she would pay the dues herself. she returned from home and had to deal with the rape. thank goodness no one knew who it was that had gotten raped or her and the sisters would have been branded. not a god thing!
