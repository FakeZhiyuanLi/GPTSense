just got out of bed. having trouble getting to sleep. maybe a brain dump will help. my boss caled me about half seven tonight, the deals all done, i'm starting work in bellshill on monday. i know that it's full of good opportunies/people/cash, but i just can't think positively about it. the phone call took all the fun out of the night. spent it perched on my bed watching tv, a film called "three to tango", neve campbell is very cute. had a few drinks to try and chill, but didn't help either way. wouldn't it be excellent if one of the jobs i applied for hired me tomorrow, then i'd move to a new job and feel good about the whole thing. i always find job hunting a daunting task, and starting at a new workplace quite intimidating. but i never dread it this much. i like being quite a laid back person and hate to find myself moaning like this, just goes to show how much this is bothering me. suppose i'm the only one that can do anything about it though. to be continued
