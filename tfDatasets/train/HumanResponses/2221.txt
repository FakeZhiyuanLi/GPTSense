why must summer holidays be so boring? most of my friends are in germany. i really hate this. but lucky for me i have final fantasy x-2 (like finally). i missed out a lot already, but who cares. i really like yuna. but the guys, gippal and baralai are so cute *drools*. although they're just animations, i think they are so cute. but still my number one guy is kei-chan *squels*
