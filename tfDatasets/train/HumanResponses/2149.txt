the french do love to see their riders do well on bastille day, same as we love it when the americans ride well on july 4th. i think it was lance's stage win on july 4th, '99 (fact checking now, nope, it was july 3rd). so, they must be doing backflips over there to have virenque win the stage in such driving style and also have voeckler holding the yellow jersey yet again. i guess we'll have to wait until friday to see the peleton really crack. it sounded like there was some testing of riders in the finish today, and i think if ulrich is going to want any chance on lance, he's going to have to attack him and try and drop him, otherwise, lance will do the same to him.
