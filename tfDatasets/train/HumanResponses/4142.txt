right. i must remember that this blog's called not past tense for a reason. well, we had a funky yo rehearsal today. beethoven's 8th is a delightfully corny piece. not corny as in makes you look completely asinine, but corny as in childish, mozart, tick-tock kind of corny. the 2nd movement is ridiculous. written in 2/4 but performed like 4/2. heh and did i mention i got to choose a new(-er) piece of firewood today? yeah - i'm taking bass no. 3 from now on. and another thing: i was the only bassist there. whee. it's kind of irritating when conductors rub it in, saying "more bass, please". oh yes. went to marks & spencer and bought a bag of fruit sherbets, some chocolate and 2 packs of shortbread. i am obese! (177 cm, 60 kg - that was yesterday). lysistrata. funky. ciresias (is that how you spell it) was darned funny. sex-crazed maniacs lol. chamber music rules the world! (especially poulenc, his violin sonata rocks)
