well, obviously i figured out how to upload pictures which will make my blog a bit more interesting, not like anyone's going to see this. off to work the night shift at the cartersville quiktrip. the night clientel reminds me that i really need to rent "deliverance." i haven't seen it in years. "southern comfort" would be nice to see again also. you get the drift. people with no shoes, no teeth, wearing blood-stained hank williams jr. t-shirts asking me what our cheapest cigarettes are.
