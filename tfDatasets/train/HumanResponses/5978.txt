enjoying myself. not the first thing you alley cats out there would want to here me say. but its not tht kind of enjoyment. woke up at 11, got stoned,and realised i never have to go to school again. long gone are the days of the jocks and their trophy girlfriends. long gone are the days when id have to sneak out for a lig and pretend to be going to get coursework. and now i can hate pretty much everyone in the year and not have to care.this is the best thing ever.so now i can wake up at 11. not go to school and smoke all day long. what a great life i lead. now all i have to worry about is running out of herbs and not getting paid soon enough. word trilby
