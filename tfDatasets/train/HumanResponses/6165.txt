weekends are the hardest. there were very few weekends over the past 5 years that we didn't spend together. i loved the weekends, even though they never seemed long enough. it just wasn't enough time together, we both dreaded sunday evening when it would all come to an end. his brother and sister in-law are supposed to be visiting with the kids this weekend. i miss those kids too. i loved those kids and i loved being an aunt. that just makes this weekend so much harder, knowing his niece and nephew are here and i don't get to see them. i want to call him, i need to talk to him but i can't. my life's a wreck, i just feel so hopeless.
