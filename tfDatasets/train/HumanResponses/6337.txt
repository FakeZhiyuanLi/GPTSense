well i must admit that i have gotten into all of the hype about this new mail account that google is offering. called gmail, and i have seen alot of people already with account even though they are in the beta stage. people are getting invites from other people but nobody has invited me yet. when i do get a invite, i would really like to have andrew@gmail.com but i highly doubt that it will still be avaliable to use. it's always nice to want stuff isn't it? i'd also like $1,000 :) send it to me by mail, thanks.
