so what is my second passion? chicago sports! let me go on record as saying that acquiring nomar garciaparra is one of the greatest events in cubs history. we are truly blessed to be witnessing 4 future hall of famers on the field for the cubs (sosa, maddux, alou, and garciaparra). anything less than a world series championship will be a disappointment. as far as the bulls go. . .why trade jamal crawford? crawford is the only proven scorer on the whole team. now granted, being an illinois transplant, i wouldn't mind seeing frank williams come over from the ny knicks in a trade, but i still think crawford is future all star. i got a few names to throw out - miller, brand, artest, hassell. the bulls have been too quick to discard developing talent. i'm not sure what to say about the bears yet. i'm excited about what the future may bring, but there are just too many unknowns. and, by that, i mean unknown unknowns as opposed to known unknowns or unknown knowns, but i digress.
