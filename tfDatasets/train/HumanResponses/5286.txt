so, that was hell on earth. camp sucked. basically, no one i liked came, i was put into a room with people i did not like, and the few people i thought were pretty good friends blew me off. lovely. i was pissed. my team didn't win anything. i got hit in the head with a vollyball. the way up there and the way back i was stuck on a bus full of annoying junior high kids. i didn't get any sleep. the thing that bothered me the most were my "friends." it seemed like they didn't want to do stuff with me, or that i was in the way. i don't know, but my boyfriend was among the group of boys. when i did talk to them, they asked me if it sucked, i told them it did, and they were just like, "oh well, sorry." they didn't even ask if i wanted to maybe do stuff with them during the times we could actually do stuff. i understood they had to practice sometimes, but they just ignored me. vent, vent, vent.
