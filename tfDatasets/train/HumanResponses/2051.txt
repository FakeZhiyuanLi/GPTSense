i had some kind of revelation or some kind of thought on xmas eve at victors. i guess i spaced out. but i sat there seeing all the kid playing with each other, unwrapping present. all i could think of, is look all everybody has achieved with their life. all in relationships and starting familys with kids. i just feel im in a time warp. but im getting there.
