i went home this weekend to see my family and my friend. when i came home i also brought dwight home with me. i thought that it was going to be a bad idea because i don't bring people home that i hardly know. but it turn out to be good. my family liked him very much and my dad did not make himself look like a fool. on friday when we got there we were to tired to do anything so we went to sleep. but on saturday we ran the streets. dwight and i started off by going to my friends house and staying with her most of the day. then we went to my cousin house. later on that evening we went to the movies and out to eat. on sunday we went to my friends house, my cousins house, and to my grandparents house. my granddad took us and the family out to eat. so as you can imagine we had a full weekend. but on monday when we said our goodbyes is when i knew that they liked him . they hug him and invited him to come back. i was very pleases and i enjoyed my weekend.
