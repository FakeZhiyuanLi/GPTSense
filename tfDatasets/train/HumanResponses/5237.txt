i've always been a little unsure is this my friend for evermore? people change and drift apart can i really count on this one heart to spill the beans - no holds barred to show myself - the pretty and the dark the scars and fears, and still be cherished still be told "you can be so much more" calm and clear, i must remember to rejoice in simple things - like his voice.
