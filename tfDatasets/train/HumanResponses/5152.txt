mmm its like midnight, and im so tired, but im so inspired im like sitting up here and i cant go to bed until i finish writing this poem, it started off with a really good idea but now, uggh i dont even know ive lost all the talent i thought i had at writing, i want it back!:(, i think i have to many thoughts going through my head, so everytime i get an idea it has to do with something different, i can never get anything to fit, just like it wont in my head, its stressing me out, i think i just need some sleep, or some better inspiration, i duno i think im just gonna go lie in my bed for a while, night
