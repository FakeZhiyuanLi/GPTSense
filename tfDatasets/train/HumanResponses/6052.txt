i'm really pissed right now. its 45 minutes until midnite on a sunday, and i'm working at the office to try to appease a client i never wanted to serve in the first place. nothing else to say. i have worked for this firm since 1990. i think i'm going to leave. in fact, i think i've already left the firm mentally. i just don't know where i'm going next. but i think i'm already gone. i think that was the title of an eagle's song.
