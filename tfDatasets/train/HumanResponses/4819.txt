wow! that was amazing. my ex-bf/friend/obsession/love-of-my-life/torturer recommended it to me. i think he intended for me to view it with him, but i was in a funk today and really wanted to watch it. basically it is about a society that forces its inhabitants to inject themselves with a serum that makes them void of all feeling. well one of the main enforcers of this law goes awol, stops taking the serum, and begins to feel. it's really quite amazing. anyway- the point to this is i've decided to stop feeling. i know it sounds so melodramatic and selfish- but i hate feeling. my ex- the main reason for this decision- ironically, is the one who recommended it, as i stated before. though i've viewed this film and fully (well as much as i possibly can) absorbed it, i still choose not to feel. (though it is the exact opposite of the message the movie intends to send). i want to feel, i just don't want to feel what is inevitable.
