paul martin promised today that if he is elected he will create 250,000 new affordable child care spaces. i think they promised something like that last time around too. but if they really want to do something for working women, they should make it easier for women to work and be with their families. an affordable child care space would be helpful, but i want to spend more time with my children, so i need more flexible working arrangements. instead of a year's maternity leave, what if they made it mandatory for employers to allow women five years of part-time work. if we worked at least 50% they should have to hold our jobs for us. i think that would appeal to a lot of moms. and then there would be a lot of part-time child care spaces too, which are impossible to find right now. yes, i'm still pondering quitting my job. it seems to me to be ineveitable now. just a question of when.
