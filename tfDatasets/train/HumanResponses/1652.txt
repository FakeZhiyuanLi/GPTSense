fucking trains! a train loaded with coal derailed while passing over i-57 in illinois and dumped something like 800 tons of coal onto the freeway. it was shutdown, my truck overheated, lots of traffic, i get cranky. needless to say i wasn't having a good day and i really don't like when it takes 9 hours to go a distance that should only take 3 hours. this is all i'm saying because i am off to bed and don't plan on waking up till dinner time tomorrow. adios.
