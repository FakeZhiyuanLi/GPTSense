trapped inside, oh my beautiful one. trapped beyond, you cannot be reached. someday, someday i'll be more, more than you expect from the remains of a failing dream you cannot be reached. beautiful one, oh. the world fades. the enviroment, replaced. replacements, noise. fades to black. you can never be reached. what remains of this failing dream, oh my beautiful one. as i fall, in my fall, why i fall, beautiful one. you can never be reached.
