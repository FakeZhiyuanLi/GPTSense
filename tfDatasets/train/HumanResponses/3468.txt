well, this isn't exactly poetry, but i'm just not feeling very inspired at the moment. of course, that could be due to the fact that it is 2:33 am where i am currently located. anything i try to type that isn't planned will most likely not be coherent. i'm very tired, but i don't really feel like sleeping. strange. i'll probably sleep in tomorrow until 12 and then be a pain in the ass all day. such is life. anyways, i'm going to attempt sleep. i'll put up a poem tomorrow or something.
