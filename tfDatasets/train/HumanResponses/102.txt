hm. now i forgot what i wanted to write. i should do something to have a better memory. anyway, i finally have something to finish my "praktikum", meaning a translation from german to english. once this is done i can soon start with my diploma, which means that the end of my studies is coming closer. and i'm gladabout this fact. however, i have no idea what will happen after this. i would love to travel for a while but then again i don't want to. it's just not really cool when you're alone abroad. i have been in the garden this morning to save the strawberries from those stupid birds and discovered that even the weeds have lice on them. that's so. i hate that. i couldn't enjoy the sun properly due to the heavy and rather cold wind. not nice. but in two weeks i'll have way more sun and heat.
