today 2004-6-29 i proudly launch myself into the air with the siesta hotline plans are to have a bit of this and and some of that. (yes that's right mr.) so this is my first post right. haven't really figured out all those lovely little features of this site but anyway. suppose this will be fun. i'll try to update this as often as i can. though not too often(not like every minute of the day. that would be a bit too often.) right now im waiting, not very patiently, for two cds i've ordered. i hope both razorlight and the streets will be good. and i'm pretty sure the will be.
