i have nothing to eat in my house. i don't get paid until tuesday, and i could go shopping, but the fact is that i'm leaving two days later. so until then, i could continue to eat whatever is convenient and continue to feel like crap, or i could get my hands on some quality eats and pass whatever is left onto the roomies. there's also the small matter of my inability to cook. suggestions, anyone?
