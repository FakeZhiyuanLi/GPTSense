really, i want to know. i used to go down to the basement of my house and play the piano and sing. but now i live in an apartment. playing late at night isn't greatly appreciated. but tonight i couldn't resist. i just spent over an hour with my favorite chopin and debussy pieces. on most sleepless nights these days i daydream about my adventures in europe last summer. i saw some amazing places. lake lugano in switzerland topped them all i think. the water was blue blue blue. i'll share a picture here and say goodnight. more european train stories to come. you've got to hear about my amsterdam blackmarket drug story and late night escape to paris. cherio! mariposa
