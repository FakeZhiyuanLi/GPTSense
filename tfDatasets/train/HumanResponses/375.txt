wouldn't it be sad if from the time we were born we knew exactly where we would end up in life? i personally don't believe in fate, but it might just be because i don't want to think that i don't have control in the outcome and direction of my own personal life. i enjoy being able to think that if i wanted to, i could completely change everything, and nothing would be predetermined. but at the same time i can't help but wonder if my life will end up the same way no matter what.
