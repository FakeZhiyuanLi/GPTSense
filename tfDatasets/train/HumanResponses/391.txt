i was at target today (it's like walmart, in case you've never heard of it), and they have tv's with fancy music videos playing non stop (i feel sorry for the people that have to listen to it all day long), but i heard a good song today. it was float on by modest mouse. i liked it so much i bought the cd right there, and i'm listening to it on my pc as i'm writing this. it's good stuff =)
