we are about halfway through the process of moving house. we've got our mortgage approved, and had the survey done. this resulted in having further checks carried out on the wiring and gas appliances, plus checking for damp. this has resulted in us asking for Â£7k off the price! we are waiting for a response on that. in the meantime, the solictor acting for our buyers has spotted that we don't appear to have permission from the freeholder for the extension. the extension had been built by the previous owners, so our solicitor should have spotted this. we are now having to apply for permission retrospectively, and i have told the old solicitor i will be charging our costs to them.
