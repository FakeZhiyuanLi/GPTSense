so, i should really be studying for a final that has the potential to actually ruin my life. but as any good person knows, studyin's for chumps, and real good music is the only thing that matters in this sad sad world. i've purchased no new albums lately, so i haven't a review for you. i did, however, uncover an amazing resource for some obscure and hard-to-find albums that you've been searching high and low for, or maybe ones that you didn't even know that you wanted. and what's best about "other music" 's reviews is that they are either written in-house or they are pulled from sources other than the ever-popular and musically omniscient (sp?) allmusicguide. other music's personal description: " a unifying aesthetic for a cornucopia of seemingly disparate musical genres; an attempt to classify the unclassifiable by delineating the common threads among these genres." check "other music" out at: othermusic.com
