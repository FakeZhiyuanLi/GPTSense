so i get a phone call, asking for me by name, on my line which is: 1. unlisted 2. in my mother's name 3. never given out to any companies/agencies and the caller claims to be representing maxim magazine. when i asked where she got my number, she answered "maxim magazine". knowing that maxim does not have my phone number, i again inquired where they got my numbed and her reply was again "maxim magazine". after telling her that i did not receive maxim at that number she hung up. now, i dialed star[*] 69 and got the number 800-362-0796 . i've been trying to research that number but with no luck. so far, it will cost me between $60 and $250 just to find out who owns the number. $250 to find out who called my phone. i call out to the masses. if anybody has access to this information would you please email me any information you have. i dunno, maybe someone in your family is in law enforcement or is a private investigator? i could use a hand.
