hey party people! so, in about 4 hrs. i'm going to wake up to start training for the la marathon. all i can say is, "starbucks to forget!" i'm excited about the marathon (it's my first) and right now my only goal is to finish. it's quite encouraging that i'll be doing it with about 4 or 5 friends from work.including someone i've taken quite a liking to. well, i must attempt to get some rest in, but until next time, ciao! question of the day: how do you know if you are being driven by love or driven by fear?
