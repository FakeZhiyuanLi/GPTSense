my last post was probably portentious. the time has come to make a decision. and i have made mine. i can't honestly say this would not pain me. i am choosing the least painful path. at least i'll have more time for me, and my son. i can't help but just feel envious of people who could be so very selfish. i wish i could be  my day started when it ended. i raise a glass to love , for once again it has won the day.
