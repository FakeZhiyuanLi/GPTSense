i'm really packing now *sigh* i don't want to go anywhere, but i don't have much of a choice. at least i'll get caught up on my summer reading and such. speaking of reading, i broke down and bought the code book by simon singh, the guy who wrote fermat's enigma . it looks interesting, and i'll probably read it in the car. i also bought a really cool journal/notebook thing with graph paper inside. mom laughed about that. why would i want to think about mathematics, she says. i said mathematics is elegant, and boy did she get a chuckle out of that. guess i better get busy.
