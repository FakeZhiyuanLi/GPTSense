i finally reformatted this computer, and i'm really glad i did. now i think that its working much better, and i've also gotten rid of a lot of clutter and stuff that should be there. now i just have the task of putting everything back in. i had my second driving lesson today. i'm glad i got a different guy because i couldn't hardly understand the first one because of his accent. i did some things that i haven't done before, and i didn't really make any horribly bad mistakes. later.
