i question myself on a daily basis. i never feel sure about much. i can recall only a few times in my life that i knew that what i was doing was right. to go through life feeling so uneasy about myself is like constantly being short of breath. i knew it was right to keep chiara. i know now that it is right for this baby growing inside me to be with another couple. the part that confuses me is why did it feel right to keep one child and now it feels right to let someone else be parents to this child? breathe. some days i actually feel up and my outlook is less dreary. then i lay in bed at night and it all creeps back.my questions, my fears, how i got here in the first place. my limbs become tense, and ache. my breath, again, escapes me. on god nights i fall asleep and do not dream. on good nights i believe that in the end it will all be worth the anxiety and the pain. on good nights i can catch my breath. breathe.chiara.breathe.
