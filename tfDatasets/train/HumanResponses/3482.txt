well then, all was going to roll smoothly for tomorrow if not for my over reacting close minded parents. they cant even begin to imagine me as my own person it seems. i want to dress diffrent because i feel differnrt. i want to stand out because i always do anyways. i dont know why sociaty has to hate the change and the fu that young people bring with them. annie's mom wasn't posioned by it why are my parents? i like the coulor pink, they call me gay, i defend myself, nothing i say can sway them. wtf! why cant they be accepting of who i am rather then negitive and angry about what i do to express myself. aw well.
