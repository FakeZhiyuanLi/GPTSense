i made an interesting revelation today about the wonderful internet system called "ebay". i have heard many stories of its great amount of ludicrus items, scuch as selling a town, though i had not really belived them until today. i saw for sale a broken camera priced at $26.50. now, i know you may by stuff on ebay like a used wedding gown but a broken camera? maybe i am overreacting, but i would like if all you people could write in with your weird ebay stories.
