well, this is new, i am not one to post stuff on the net and i am not sure if i really want it read, but hey, seems like a good outlet to get stuff out. days of thunder, days of silence, my husband is out and that is seriously great. i don't know where he has gone, but i am surely glad that he is out. we are fighting, all started because i caught him drinking during the day and then all hell broke loose. would be good if someone realised that they are an alcoholic. life is not glittery at this day, but glory to god and his mighty power he shall make it so. amen
