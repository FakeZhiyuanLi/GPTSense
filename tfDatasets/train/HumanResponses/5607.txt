remember the happy simpler times when you thought that the friends that you made now, would be your friends forever. sleepover parties were considered cool, and all boys no matter what age had ‘couties’. remember playing with barbie and her boyfriend ken. barbie wasn’t a feminist and it was okay for her and ken to sleep together even if we didn’t know what ‘sex’ was. those were the days when you didn’t worry about, hair, make-up, sex, std’s or pregnancy tests. i wish life was still so simple and friends were still, honest and real. i still remember the endless days of summer, playing tag in the park and making mud pies, after it had rained. remember the girly giggles and wide-eyed smiles, when you had a birthday and you got to spend it with the people that meant the most to you. i often dream of being 6 again, you know the age when you dreamed of being 18, cause those girls had it all. but really they didn’t. i still whish i could go back to the carefree days of, yesterday.
