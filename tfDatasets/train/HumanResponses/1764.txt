i am screaming your name. don't leave me. my love. my star. hold this rose tight up to your cheast. surender your heart to me. these dice we role turn out to be only the love square. pain pumps threw this hart. lungs strive for this air. so soon my eyes are watering. watch these falling stars. both hands break but still i carry you.
