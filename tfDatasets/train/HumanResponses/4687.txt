even days, weeks, and months later, i still feel it. depite the bitterness, i still feel it. does it ever go away? what a peculiar moment to see someone you love after a month of silence. how two years can fly by in a flicker of lightning and yet a month may seem so endless. how do you say good-bye to a part of your life that you wish you had back? how can you simply exist in the present while you yearn for those moments that made you feel alive. how do you light that flame that brings afloat the part of your soul you've been shielding in a hidden compartment of your heart? where do you find that desire and the hope? i've forgotten how to dream .
