ever get tired of your parents? yeah, me too! i hate the way they always act like they don't care what we do, only what the other one wants to do. which always results in back and forth talk of "no you pick, i don't care"s. i never want to end up like my parents. i would rather not be a parent. i love them, but i want to change some things. don't you?
