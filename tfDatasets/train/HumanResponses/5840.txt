i'm starting over again, sharing this with matt. so let me introduce myself yet again for the 500th god - damned time tonight. my name is nicole, and my boyfriend is matt. i'm 14 years old. time's up! that's all you need to know for now. i really have nothing to say right now besides the fact that i am really on edge today. i'm just stressed about school and stuff. but oh well, i get to see matt tomorrow so it will be okay. i'm just really annoyed and aggravated with things and i have the urge to scream right now from all this, but i'm resisting the urge. i hope tomorrow goes faster because i'm not really adapting well to school. the day just drags on and on while i listen to dumb people talk and yell and gossip. i'm really not in the best of moods tonight, but i'm talking with matt, and that's always nice therapy. ~nikki~
