well we are halfway through our trip on yet another scroching day in vegas (43 degrees) though at least it's dry heat. i hope anton turns up cos without mobile phone contact we really don't know where to look for him. i haven't been doing very much except playing poker and eating ice cream (the best way of staying cool). i haven't won any yet, but haven't lost any either and got some free drinks along the way which was nice. live cash games can be quite hard work to play properly - u can go literally for hours without playing a hand and then everyone folds when u raise with pocket aces.
