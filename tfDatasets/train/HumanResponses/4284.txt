ok, here's something for everyone to check out. my friend michael has some original songs posted on acidplanet . you can stream them live from here . i would recommend listening to several different songs, as he switches from leftist political diatribes to extremely soulful songs about his relationship with his son (or at least that's how i interpreted them). sometimes when i listen to his music, i think that bob dylan and the man in black (later years) had a son together, and that they called him michael. =) enjoy - i know i do. here's a picture of the dork praying with his guitar to w. and ashcroft to "save his freedoms." oh yeah, i almost forgot to shout-out erika's blog. check it here . you can do it!
