dear angel you say it or you don't, but i can see it in your eyes, some words are not worth saying, they try to remain in your heart. i saw it years ago inj your eyes, what were you trying to say from your smile. this lovely destiny was like a game for me, strategy, logic, moves everything it had for me, this wild game was great to play, but as per rules, for every wrong move i have to pay. i am paying for the move i made long ago, but now i love her even much more. i have seen the world around beautiful oceans, just like your eyes. beautiful flowers, just like your smile. life goes on miles and miles share your kindness, share your smile life goes on miles amd miles life in not a play, it is full of dangers, take care sweetheart, take care dear angel. nil
