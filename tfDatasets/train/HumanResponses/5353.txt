relapse "kiss me," i said. but i am so fake. i preach it, and teach it, but quickly i break. hypocracy follows wherever i go i hate it, debate it, yet fall down below the codon to end has repeated itself as deeper into the regression i delve i walk out to purify all of the holes that living has left deep inside of my soul for once i am doing this only for me never when i am with someone to see it shames me, i blame me, for all that i do i should but i don't lay the hate upon you i group them together, the things that i crave for a while i was whole, i was selfless and brave but the haze from the tip calls for my attention and it's me who deserves to be scolded and hung so in my summation i summoned it thus i broke through the pattern, now lying in dust the light that withstands at the end of the mold is warm to my lungs, but i am so cold.
