goal 1) diet and exercise - 6/10: i cheated three out of five days, but only a little each day. i did my walking 2/5 days, and even worked up a sweat once. in the ww board vernacular i'm at 209/198/130. goal 2) time with the kids 8/10 - i had some great times with my children this week. we worked and played together. alaric and i have plans for saturday night to go out stargazing. it should be a lot of fun. goal 3) take pictures 0/10 - not a single one, no movies, nothing. goal 4) writing 0/10 - nope, once again, i thought a lot of things through, but nothing got onto paper. goal 5) keeping work at work 4/10 - i started making the arrangements to work in the office full time, but i am still wasting a lot of work time that could be more productive. so this week averages out to a 3.6/10. next week, i'm going to shoot for a 5.
