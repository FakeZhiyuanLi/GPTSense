i have eaten peanut butter on pears. i eat peanut butter on tortillas. i eat peanut butter off the spoon. i also eat peanut butter as other people eat peanut butter, on sliced bread or crackers or apples; in short, i eat peanut butter. peanut butter makes me think of language, the meaning people ascribe to their words. you see, when i refer to peanut butter, i mean that the label on the jar should read only "peanuts, salt." nothing added. otherwise, it is not peanut butter. often, friends try to give me their old jars of unwanted peanut butter (yes, these are my friends) based on my professed adoration of the stuff, only to discover that they do not, in fact, own peanut butter, and, as i love peanut butter and peanut butter only, i will have none of it. apparently, i have invented my own food dialecta language specific only to the gastronomical universe of joy tang and unintelligble to the general public, which is interesting, if you are thinking about words.
