i was recently asked the other day by someone i was until that very day seeing whether i had been using him. i'm sad to say i kind of laughed- luckily we weren't actually physically speaking to each other. but what made me laugh is that for the past few months i've felt so sorry for myself because i couldn't get over the fact that i had been used by someone i cared for. but the funny thing is that when people are in situations like these ("romantic" relationships) everyone uses everyone. the purpose of those relationships are to feel good. you use the other person, whoever they may be, to feel better about yourself. the reason you stay together and you stay in love through all the shit that may or does happen is because the way they make you feel. you love that feeling, you love the feeling that they give you, so in return, you love them. and hopefully you give them that same kind of feeling.
