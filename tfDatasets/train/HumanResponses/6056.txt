last night one of my friends (christian) had a party. i got wasted and some time during the night i started arguing with another one of my friends (adam). i don't remember what started the fight, but neway, me and adam got into quite the fist fight. now, adam is the biggest kid at the party, and was a varsity wrestler freshman year. i got my shit tossed. my mouth and nose was gushing blood everywhere. today i'm nursing some cuts and a black eye. that wasn't that bad, because when you're drunk and your adrenaline is pumping you don't feel much. what sucked was waking up this morning at 6:30 to go to work on 4 hours of sleap, hung over, and with a smashed up face. oh well, shit happens.
