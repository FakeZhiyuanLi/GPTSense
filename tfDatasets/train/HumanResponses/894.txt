and i do. i kind of almost broke my brother's nose today, 'cos he knocked off my glasses on purpose. so i kind of slapped him, and his nose started to bleed. (cool, huh?) anyway, i gave him some tissue, but i could hardly care if his nose was broken or not. turns out, it wasn't. i guess that's good, seeing as my mom would go berserk if his nose was broken. ah well. i hate people like him. he's bloated and obese, and although he's 8 years old, he can't feed, bathe, put on shoes, change, or do anything himself! oh god, i feel like pummeling him right now
