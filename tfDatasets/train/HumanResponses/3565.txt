this blog, my second, obviously, will be in dedication to my good friend alex. she is always there for me, i that i appreciate. she is the true poet i know. she's an inspiration to many, and a friend to all. but, enough about her. my english class spawns much poetry in me. yes, that may be corny, but its true. it also, in many other views, makes me say some funny things. one of these is "imagine, if you will, a world without hypothetical situations." that, if you can't tell, is the basis of this entry. here is where i announce my plans. if you have a quote, one completely original, e-mail it to me, and i will post it along with my thoughts. this, hypotetically, will spread your quote to make it widely know. something all of us poets strive for. but, untill i recieve my first quote, i shall just write my peotry in these entries. please send me these quotes, so that your inner poet can be revealed to the world.
