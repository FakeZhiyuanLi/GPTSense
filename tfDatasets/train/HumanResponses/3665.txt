ack. i hate mondays. actually, they've become something of a reprieve, seeing as darling hubby and i usually work harder on the weekends than we do during the week. my baby turns one today.*sniff sniff* i don't know where the last year has gone. one of the characters in stephen king's dark tower series talks about how time is no longer passing at a steady pace - it is alternately speeding up and slowing down. that's what it feels like to me - like time is just on fast forward these days. the days are turning into weeks so quickly, i'm afraid to blink - i might lose a whole month. i'm working on getting a webpage set up - i used to have one, a long time ago, but i quit working on it, and over the years i've forgotten what little html i did know. so.i guess that's it for now - i'd better go see what the kids are doing. they're being quiet, which usually means that they're into something that they shouldn't be into.
