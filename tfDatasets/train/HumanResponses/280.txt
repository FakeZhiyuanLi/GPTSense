what the hell. what kind of fucked-up and conceited self-defense mechanism is this? whenever person a realizes they may be wrong on something (i.e. a dead phone means it was a telemarketer's auto-dial machine but there was no operator available to "take the call") they automatically get pissy and declare that you "don't understand". fuck you! and it's always about small things too, like how our cordless phone should always be on its charger even though it has a battery life thats longer than our cell phone. fuck off, eat shit, and die.
