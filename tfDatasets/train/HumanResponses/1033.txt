eyes. the glimpse into your soul, yet at the same time, the welcomed intruder. they express emotion so beautifully- fear, anger, sadness, passion, happiness, angst. they cannot lie. i'll never forget that moment we locked eyes, you, suddenly shying away. and then you looked back. all of those emotions, suddenly melting into pure bliss as i stared into those piercing eyes, seemingly carved from stunning blue perfection. never look away. sweet dreams.
