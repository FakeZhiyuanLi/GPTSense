ok, i am going to give this a try. i really enjoy "checking" in on the rescigno family, so i thought maybe we would give it a try. (april, i hope you don't mind!) it is really hard to keep in touch when so many of our friends and family are so far away. so please hang in there with me while i work this out. i hope you enjoy. jana
