yah, the usual we talking now. my baby. he's been so far from us for so long na rin. miss nya kaya ako? ummm hehehe. he better be! he actually looking at this stuff. comment ka okies! muah@! loveyah! " i always thought that love was something i'd know the minute it appeared. that there would be drumrolls and bells ringing as love swept me off my feet. no one told me how quietly love could appear, or how humbly. that someday i'd look up and there it would be, waiting for me in a pair of familiar eyes. i never expected i'd find somebody to love in you. i guess i never knew love the way i do now.
