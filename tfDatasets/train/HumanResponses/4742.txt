why do i try when all i do is fail? why do i hurt when all i need is love? what should i do when i have no will? why should i try when there is no strength? what's to do when i know not what to do? where should i turn what should i do? is there anything i can do? were i to know what it is will i be able to do it? do i have the strength to continue? if i continue is it worth it? where is the path that i lost so long ago? these things and more are the questions in my life.
