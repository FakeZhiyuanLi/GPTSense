i had an old friend who i will never forget. i can't. if i did, i would break a promise. we met about eight years ago in winter. we knew everything about each other. for four years i had the best friend i've ever known. and then something happened. we drifted away from each other. slowly at first, and then before i knew it, she was gone. i hate how time and emotion blur the past, especially the moments you wish you could keep forever. if only back then i realized how lucky i was to have her as a friend. i'm sorry. i still hope that one day we will talk again, like we use to. its 11:11 - make a wish.
