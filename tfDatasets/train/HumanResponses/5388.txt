yah, crazy storms outside this week. haven't posted for a while, anyways, but tomorow i leave for michigan. im kinda happy, im getting a little restless here. you know, cabin fever. its not that it's boring, but i sometimes needs a little change of scenery. oh, saturday ryan and i went to see shrek 2 which was hilariously funny. just about every fairy tale and nursery rhyme were made fun of or had a satire about them in that movie. then he fixed my computer so that i finally have aim now. i know, i'm such a dinosaur! finished packing today which was just a magical experience. i think that if i go to hell at the end of my days, my punishment for all of my evils will be the task of packing for eternity. wow that would suck. anyway, that was pretty much the sum of the last couple of days. my life is so exciting, i know.
