i tripped the other day with my friend, honky. we day tripped at the park, in the grocery store, in osco, in the corner, and in my treehouse. we heard a lady tell her friend that she is allergic to polyester and that if she ever laid down on a bed with polyester sheets and went to sleep she'd never wake up. ha ha. honky also was willing to try some yoga poses from a yoga deck and did them all! first time she ever did yoga! at one point i was reading the directions on how to get into the pose and concentrating really hard on my reading then i looked up when i heard an ouch honky looked like a pretzel! in total position! anyhoo, dr. octogon rocks! and this stuff is totally legal. and i am tired. and i have 3 kinds of buds to smoke!
