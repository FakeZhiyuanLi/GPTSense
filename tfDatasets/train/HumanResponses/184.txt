this is intense ever since i came to college. never would have thought it would be this hard. back when i was in highschool, i really loved math! i don't know what happened. they just teach very fast in college. not the usual thing i'm used to. so, wether people liked math or so, i'll find a waay or another to delete math out of my life. although i know i'm going to need it in the future anyway!
