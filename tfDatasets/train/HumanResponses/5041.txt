went to office depot (why don't they pronounce the "t?") today, to get some school supplies. i went to the office depot in mountain view because the one near me is evil, and unorganized, so i have no idea where anything is. mother! school starts in exactly a week. ah! why must summer go to the beyond? also played some b-ball at the park. i'm getting better. i bought 2 locker shelves at office depot because they break to easy. also walked to walgreens, and on the way there these asians near tin-tin market were doing tai-chi or something. really interesting. i tried copying them from a distance, didn't work out that well. ha ah ha ha. tomorrow i'm going to see a clown midget! she's very odd, she's tries to ryme everything! and sometimes the sentences turn out wrong. don't ask. well ask if your dying to know, which you all should be! ask! i'm going to watch the "bend it like bekham" movie again. night
