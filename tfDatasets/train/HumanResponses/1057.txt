i was barely sitting down when i heard a voice from the other stall saying: "hi, how are you?" i'm not the type to start a conversation in the men's restrooms at a rest stop but, i don't know what got into me, so i answered, somewhat embarrassedly: "doin just fine!" and the other guy says: "so what are you up too?" what kind of question is that? at that point, i'm thinking this is too bizarre so i say: "uhhh i'm like you, just traveling east!" at this point i am just trying to get out as fast as i can when i hear another question. can i come over to your place after while? ok, this question is just wacky but i figured i could just be polite and end the conversation. i tell h! im, "well, i have company over so today is a bad day for me!" then i hear the guy say nervously. "listen" i'll have to call you back, there's an idiot in the other stall who keeps answering all my questions,
