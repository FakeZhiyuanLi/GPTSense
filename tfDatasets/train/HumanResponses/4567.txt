the traffic this morning was really heavy, presumably because of the tube strike, and i ended up turning around and finding an alternative route to work. there was a piece on the tv this morning asking whether tube staff should have the right to strike or not. personally, i feel that the right to strike, given sufficient grievance, is an important one and i wouldn't want it taken away from these people, but i do wonder whether their action is fully justified in this instance. as far as i'm aware, they're well paid for what they do and their dispute seems a trifle petty. of course, i'm not directly involved and thus i'm not in possession of all the facts but that's my opinion based on what i do know.
