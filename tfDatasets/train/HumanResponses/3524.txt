the first day that you came to me, i thought it wouldent be real, the first day that you came to me, i felt made out of steel, not bent, not broken, not movable, not soft, i sweated rivers, and grinned out lakes, in my becoming, of a nervouse wreck, but you started to smile, i began to calm down, you started to talk more, its you whom i found, the first day that you came to me, you were to good to be true, the first day that you came to me, i knew that i'd love you.
