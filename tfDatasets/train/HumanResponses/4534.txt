today we went to kodak on an adventurous field tripit was kinda cool to learn all about the real world application of imaging sciencethe fact that we got to see all the new technologies and such aided in my understanding of imaging science and it's value in the world.i thought it was pretty darn cool to see stuff that most ppl will probably never be able to see because they won't live to see it's entrance into the world.
