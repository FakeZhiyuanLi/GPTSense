well the weather in st.louis has been wild it has rained every day this week and my parents want us to go on some dumbass trip to branson. well i think that it's bull i could really care less about going to branso again there is nothing new the only thimg i wanna do is ride the go-karts. and buy a new knife the only thing this does is it makes me have to stay at school caue i wanted to leave early cause i dont want to see the talent show cause it's a hella fun( for u dumb asses i was being sarcastic). i went back to the ymca today and went to my favorite class and i can finally jog. i couldn't jog or run because i broke my toes from riden a motorcycle. i'm thinkin i'm gonna skip and go home and get yelled at for skiping.
