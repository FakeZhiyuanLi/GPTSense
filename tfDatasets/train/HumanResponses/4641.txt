tonight is my first entry. i have spent the night in downtown tasting the best chicago has to offer as far as food is concerned. what a city this is. full of diversity and creativity. but amongst the crowd, there are people that are hungry and alone. i saw a lady today in a light purple jumpsuit that had such a look of complete disarray. as i drove past her today, she noticed me noticing her. i saw her crack a smile. i connected with her on some remote level. life is so interesting sometimes. it was such a good day. i love this city.
