so here i am in minnesota my mom packing the days full of crap that no one cares about making us all get up at 5am and we don't get to sleep till 12 or later. my dad went and got himself hypnotized and i thought he was embarrassing enough normally heres what he did: gave birth to a baby boy named jimmy tried to breast feed said baby thought he was garth brooks and gave "autographs" thought he was michael jackson and tried to moon walk thought he was britney spears and tried to dance thought he was an alien from mars (which by the way "is purple and pink") who didn't know it's sex and had been here for 6 years looking for cheese made from a mouse (not for a mouse) danced to a song from beatlejuice tried to take his shirt off and i thought the hypnotist would be fun.
