well, after only some minor difficulties, the website is up. there is some type of problem with external javascript that i need to resolve. for some reason the scripts would not load if i used a src= statement. so i stripped down the script and data set and inserted it directly in the main html. i tried to get my link to blogspot, but for the life of me can't remember the password. i'will switch the blog back over to blogspot when i have everything else up and going and can get my hifn email back. well it should be obvious, i remembered my blogspot username and password and now have moved the blog back to blogspot.
