at the end of the day i heve neither the strength or wit to write a clever entry. well that's not the point is it? today has passed by so fast i didn't notice anything coming. maybe i wasn't supposed to. does it matter? probably not. tomorrow is another holiday. should i look forward to it? perhaps. i'll be meeting my friends. something i haven't done in quite a long time. i'll be leaving to bali on monday. yipee. maybe i can work on that tan i've always wanted.
