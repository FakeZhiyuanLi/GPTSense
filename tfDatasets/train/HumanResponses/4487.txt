here i am again . 2nd time today . still at school comp lab doing the project. cairu says that she will help me tomorrow. hopes she keeps her words. anyway, i am feeling much better. sorry if i offended anybody just now . i was damn fraustrated and about to cry(i think i did). anyway, going to go home and attempt to study cause most of the mock exams are approaching and i dun wanna fail . haiz! anyway, now, huimin's project seems to have conked up, and she is back at her usual mood again . dunno it is the how many time already . i sort of really admire darren for being able to take it. i am already quite tolerant, and i and starting to get irritated at her more often. shumin seems also to be getting pretty short-tempered. i dunno whether it is the influence of huimin, or if she is already like that.haiz!
