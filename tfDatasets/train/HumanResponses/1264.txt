the coolest member of my family is my mom. when we want to go to the park and play a game, we go all my brothers and go play soccer. my mom, my sister, and me play against my two brothers, "we always win". when we play soccer we laugh, scream, fall, and etc, we always have fun. sometimes we go play basketball, or we go to another park to run. i like to be like her, because she has the energy like us to have a good time or have fun. my mom has accomplish a lot of things, she even got a diploma. having a mom that you always have fun is great.
