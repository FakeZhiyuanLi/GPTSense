over the past few months i've been going over how to tell my workplace that i'm transsexual. i told my parents in 2001 and they've never liked the idea - to be honest, i think they still don't believe me, which is why i don't see them an awful lot now, although recently i've seen them for a few hours once every one or two weeks. that's about the longest time i can stand to pretend everything's nice and normal before i have to go home and be myself again. i'm considering e-mailing my line manager and telling him the situation but i'm unsure about whether this would be the best course of action. i'm going to have to tell them sooner or later since i'm intending to see a psychiatrist and, hopefully, begin hormone therapy to start putting my body right but that could be a couple of months away, at least. the question is whether i can wait that long and still act like everything's okay. i don't think i can.
