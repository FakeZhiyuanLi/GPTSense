hmph. well as it seems that the summer draws on and nothing i want to get accomplished does, it makes me wonder why i should even care. well it's just one more year until i finish school, which is all i look forward too. wow it seems like i'm just wasting away. i don't even know what the point of this all is anyways. i don't really care so fuck it, maybe something will change for the better, and help me through this hell of a life.
