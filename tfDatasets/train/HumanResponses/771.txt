i've got this really bad pain in my back like right in the middle like someone stuck a knife right there. yet my love wonders why i have trust issues! how the heck can i learn to trust anyone if the people i thought i could trust go around stabbing me full-on in the back. i guess my life is just one bad choice after another. i feel like going shopping. but today i have my physical for my new job at 3. maybe after that i'll go. the boy and i went for a picture-taking ride this morning before lunch. i had a few moments of aggravation when this ugly white ford ranger with red decals on the side decided to ride my bumper and try to exert peer pressure on me to go faster. i get really irritated at people that follow too closely, you know who you are.
