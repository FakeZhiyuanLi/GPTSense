just putting the finishing touches on this page of nanas and custard for toxic, two figures to draw and that's it - get it scanned tomorrow and then put everything aside to concentrate on a batman sample. this month hasn't been as productive as i'd've liked, on the plus side got an offer out of blue which might be interesting (if it comes off), might have found a home for one project and maybe found another home for another project.
