the first pillow that i buy will be covered in turqouise material soft as moss that would not be irritating there will be tight brown stitching that wont imediatly be ripped out there will be a scratchy annoying tag that i will rip out that says "do not remove" it will be so huge that it will be about half my height it will be extemely puffy, but not the kind of puffy that gets squashed down after about 10 minutes of use
