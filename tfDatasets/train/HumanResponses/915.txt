i'm fucking starving. i need food. it's ten to four - i haven't eaten in what? three hours? too damn long, whatever it is. i ate cereal at one (or something like that), and now i'm hungry again. yes, i know you don't care. yes, i know i could go and make myself a sandwich, but that would involve picking my arse off of this comfy seat, walking down some stairs, strolling into the kitchen, getting the bread and cheese out, slicing the cheese, toasting and buttering the bread. you get the picture. it's just not worth the effort. eventually, someone'll come home and give me food. either that, or i'll starve.
