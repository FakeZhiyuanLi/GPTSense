i took the dog to the park, and it just occured to me now that throughout the whole ordeal i didn't stop once to think about anything. i am becoming more mechanical day after day, and just concentrating on daily chores, which is excellent. slowly regaining my motivation to better my condition after years of overclocked brain activity  i always have too many questions  but hey who am i to figure out the answers just using my brain, i figured going through life. day by day. would eventually answer some of those questions, so no need to stop the whole train. just to look at the freakin map!
