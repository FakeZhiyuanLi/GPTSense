".or from him touching meheh :d" a quote from the girl that i am supposedly talking to and about to go out with's away message. to be honest it has been about 2 weeks since we've seen eachother but a few days before she told me that she wanted to be with me but then she writes shit like this? is it wrong for me to have an awkward type feeling? i dont think so. why are you women so god damn complicated? can't you just tell us the truth instead of making guys like me assume what you're thinking. doesnt seem like anyone reads this but i guess it's good for me to relieve tension.
