new song obsession whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper. i hear the sound of the ticking of clocks, who remembers your face who remembers you when you are gone. i hear the sound of the ticking of clocks, come back and look for me, look for me when i am lost. and just a whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper. whisper, coldplay, rush of blood to the head it's been in my head a couple of days.
