heya, what's up the olympic games are on and me being coral, imma wishin' i was a swimmer im wishing i'm everything. my road to satisfaction does not exist. so i got up, washed my face and brushed my teeth, rearranged my desktop with a collage, loaded the dishwasher, and gave my dog a bath. now imma here to vent.
