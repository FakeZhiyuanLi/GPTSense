whatever i said i meant it the best the possible way. i said that because not only do we think completely differently but you think more geniously than me. i would like to get inside your mind for one day (and plant a virus)and just figure out how you think. it's almost like i'm jealous. (syke) i clikcked on that link that said the similarity is shocking or something like that. thes stupid cars showed up and it made me mad. i check out the bk site. i think there is a database that the closet phrase is matched to. i told punch the t.v. and it punched itself. i told it to go in the kitchen and get a knife. it started rolling around on the ground. i turned off my compute rafter that. n e ways peace!
