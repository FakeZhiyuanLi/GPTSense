so , here i am in the drama city, aka d.c., and my teacher asks me, "matthew, what do you want to be when you grow up?" so, i thought about things i loved to do, and came up with music. i told her and she said, "well when ya famous, hook me up kid." i felt a confidence that yes i can rap and make music. so i started spittin' around some of the people i ride metro(dc's clean subway) with. they started spittin' as well. friendships were made, and i am considered a high figure in the rap game around my school (which is very competitive). then, i decided, why not make a group? next thing you know, i have made 4 hours worth of songs without anyone but myself, but i still have a group name. dis blog is to show you what happens when i recruit, and the uphill battle of a rapper who has messages and solutions from and for the world and how he plans to find other rebels to join his cause.
