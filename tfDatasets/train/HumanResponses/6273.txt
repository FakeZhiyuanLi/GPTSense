hello everyone, today was a damn funny day. in the morning, i went to nus to do my science mentorship programme. got there at 8.20. had agreed to meet kin kit at 8.30. then kin kit turns up at 9.20 and i couldm't contact him cause his phone was off. anywae, still finished the experiments early. they are turning out wonderfully well. anywae, when i was coming back, i saw this stray cat (actually i saw this yesterday, but.) and it was given food by this stranger. it turned round and shat on the food. that was damn funny. i laughed all the way home. lolz. then, come home, homework time. philo essay. wth, i only get half an hour of recreation daily. lolz, this sux. anywae, started my blog. no time to change anything so used a stupid format. anywae, hope can blog often. anywae, overall, i think today was a very fun day. tomoro must go to nus again, so shall end now. thx for reading. ttbb. supersonic
