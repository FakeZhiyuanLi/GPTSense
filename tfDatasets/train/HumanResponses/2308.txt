friday morning about 6:45am jim called me on the cell phone. jim wanted to know if i had cooled down yet and wanted to talk about what had happened the day before, he asked if i really wanted to quit or just said it out of anger, i told him that at times he just pisses me off to know end, amd i was sorry i stormed out like that and for what i had said and that i really didn't want to leave my job. he told me to come to work and at the end of the day we could talk about it. pic of the boss. so i got ready and went to work, but we never did talk about it at the end of the day.
