yeah i didn't get blamed for anything of the things mentioned in my previous post. it turns out that the "marine" was actually in the army reserve and was like a volunteer cop for the roswell police department. (we were in fulton county so he was out of jurisdiction. the person who got in the most trouble was the fake cop/fake soldier. he got screamed at by parents and by the principal of the school and had to leave there feeling like an idiot. the other kids whom he blamed got off with a light warning. so nothing serious came of this incident except gi joe feeling like a gi dipshit.
