my biggest problem would have been that the day just went by to slow. i am sure that who ever reads this has had one of those days where the day just dosen't want to speed up a little bit. but when something good happens it just decides to speed up. example, when i am sitting in history class and the teacher is just talking and talking and dosen't want to do anything on a friday such as a game or a good movie to speed things up. but then on the other hand when i am in music class the period just wants to fly by and not slow down. this weekend on the other hand will during the day speed up and slow down and the same over and over until you just cant take it anymore and freak out and smoke cigarettes until you are dizzy. then when you are working the night shift at a gas station the time is very very slow more so when they decide to put a clock right in front of you and it is huge so you cant avoid it.
