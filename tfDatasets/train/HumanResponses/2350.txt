i had a phone call from a promoter last night who has booked the band for a gig in september, but he was initially a little unsure as to whether it was a good idea to book us, based on his concern from hearing demo recordings with the kind of screamy shouting we occasionally do in the band. he said he thought we might be doing ourselves permanent damage, but that maybe that was just his age showing (from his voice he was in his 40s, probably). with a million and one screamo bands popping up here there and everywhere, it strikes me that you would have to be quite musically-isolated not to hear this happening in a lot of modern rock music (even lostprophets, for instance). at least he said we could make some suggestions as to other bands that could go on the bill we'll see how this turns out.
