it's 8:35am and i'm supposed to go to pisay [my school] at 9 with mithi but since i think she's asleep i might as well have fun on the net while waiting. i've got everything ready for my enrolment, but i really don't have money. i guess i ran out during our regular mithi-and-i trips to sm north but whatever. it's so sad to know that one of my barkadas, jerico, is "migrating", or as he uses the term. i think they're going abroad because of the election results [which is stupid, i guess, so they must have another reason]. he won't be coming back to pisay anymore, which is sad. i'm so excited. i don't know why.
