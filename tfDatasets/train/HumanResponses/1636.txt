the purpose of this blog is to be anonymous; to write stuff without feeling like i need to censor myself. it's so interesting to me to read other blogs about people's day-to-day lives. you would think that this would be boring, and many people would probably describe their lives as routine or monotonous. yet reading these reflections and musings makes one realize that life is really in the details, and that this "day-to-day" is your life. as john lennon said, life is what happens while you're making other plans.
