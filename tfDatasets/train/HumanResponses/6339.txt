ok, it's not exactly prom night, but it is memorial day. that means beach day. so, of course, it's raining. well, it's not raining yet. but it's supposed to this afternoon. go figure. i suppose today might be the last time i see many of my classmates together. in some cases, this is good . in some other cases, not so much. either way, it's a changing point. man am i ready for some stability.
