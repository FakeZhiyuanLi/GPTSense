hey everybody, this is my first post! i'm really bored and i'm leaving for my cabin, in brainerd, mn; today at 3. or 4 with my mother. she always makes us late for everything. i'm really bored :-) i have nothing to do. i went to a movie with my friend maggie, that was way fun! i got in a couple of word fights with my best friend and ex-girlfriend, mandy. i thinks it's ok now, she just doesn't trust me. we would probably still be together had we not if 'stuff had not happened. i wish it hadn't. i used to really not like her new boyfriend nic lake, but i figured out that hes ok. well i have to go out side away from the computer *shudder* on this very awesome day! i love all of you, -danny
