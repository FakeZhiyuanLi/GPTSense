is there a way to get back to college? relive those days? is there a way to getaway? i've had many jobs in my life. thrown papers. shoveled asphalt. i've seen people that no one else has seen again. i've walked over 25,000 people, sometimes more then once. i've carried groceries and crushed cardboard. i've delivered papers and eventually designed them. i've worked with many different people. i worked with convicted convicts and holy rollers. i've worked with geds and phds.
