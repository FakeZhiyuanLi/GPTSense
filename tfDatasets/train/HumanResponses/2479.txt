yarg, i am so sleepy, yesterday was steph's sweet sixteen and i didnt sleep well. i cant believe she is sixteen, thats almost twenty, we're old. actually im not even going to be sixteen for a while.i still have to turn fifteen. we stayed up late and then after everybody went to sleep i couldnt stop thinking so i stayed awake for a while, sorted somethings out in my head and eventually went to a light sleep. i had a nap this afternoon which was nice but i feel like i've wasted part of my day. i watched waynes world 2 yesterday which was great, i hadnt seen those movies in a while and now i'm saying things like shwing! and cha! well i am to tired to continue typing so.bye
