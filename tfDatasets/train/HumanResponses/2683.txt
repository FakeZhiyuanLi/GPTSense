i have wondered for years why i loved james bond so much something so cool. not the gadgets; not the chicks; not even the cars. no, something deeper something almost unexplained. but! i think i figured it out! the man responsible for writing these books (ian fleming) lived in st. mary, jamaica. he spoke in interviews of how the scenery of st. mary and the people and the culture and the food all inspired him to write about the ever so cool spy. so, what's the revelation my father and his family were all born and raised right in beautiful st. mary. kind of like far and away for an irish person i guess?
