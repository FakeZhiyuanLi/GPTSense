ok, so its the morning for me, at work 11 am sharp. drawing and what not. listning to sum music, and messin wit my celly. i realized yesterday i have alot of shit to carry around, even if im just leavin the house for a bit, like a cell phone, wallet, a pen ynever know. an inhaler, i only carry that sumtimes tho, cause im allergic to dogs, and when i go over any friends house thats got a dog i need to make sure i bring it, then theres the cloves, i like the taste of the cloves, and i think it smells better than the regular cigs, but my friends disagree. i need some new videogames to come out, i havent played that game i bought like at allll, im angry yet at the same time i was hoping it would have sum aspecs of the new game fable but it doesnt and it turns me off quicker than a stripper with crust in her g string.
