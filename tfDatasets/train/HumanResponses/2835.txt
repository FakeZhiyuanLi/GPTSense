this morning was youth sunday at church. i was running the sound board like always, and it was harder than on days with a regular service. nobody knew how to hold microphones or anything. definately interesting and different. i guess its because none of the people involved ever see what goes on for set up or how to actually run any of the equipment. it was hard for just about everybody.but o well. it went better than expected compared to the rehearsals. and this afternoon theres a church pic-nic to go to, assuming it doesn't rain. any ideas of what my girlfriend and i can do tomorrow?
