yes! i get the fun task of starting high school this year. it's really gonna suck. some of my friends wont be going to school with me cuz they get to go to this early college thingy. also a lot of ppl dont like me so i'm not gonna have a bunch of friends. also i know i'm gonna get teased becuz i'm not the prettiest or skinnest girl either. but i guess if i stick with my friends i'll be okay. plus i'm doing drama and choir so we'll just see how it goes.yea i like to conplain a lot so wtf?
