excuse me for living, don't mind if i do! i hope all is forgiven, you know i'd do the same for you. if it's true what they say, someone must pay. i'll bear my share of the pain, but i won't take all the blame, if it's all the same to you. i used to like to choose my poison, but now i wouldn't dare make a choice between the water and whatever's in the air. i'd like the buy the world an aspirin and slip it in their coke. if it'd do any good, i'd like to tell the world a joke. lighten up everyone. the weather's not that bad, and even if we can't use skow field, we can still have fun >:|
