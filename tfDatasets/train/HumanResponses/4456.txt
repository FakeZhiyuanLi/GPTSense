hey hey, i'm up and bored. i know no one reads these, but i figured i'd update. since this afternoon. anyway, i volunteered at the rock ridge branch library from 1-3 p.m. i got out with an hour to kill, but no one was home to hang out with me, and drinking soda and sitting on a curb talking to no one isn't very much fun. i came home and practiced the guitar and was very angry with the world for no reason, so i was in my room most of the afternoon. dinner was chicken wrapped in bacon and had some herbs and stuff inside it, pasta on the side and a salad. um, watched the olympics with my mom, and stuff. yeah i don't lead what most would call an interesting life, but whatever. school in: 6 days. later, jack
