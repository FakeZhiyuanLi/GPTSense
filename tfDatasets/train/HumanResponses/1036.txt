people say to live in the past is a bad thing. you get stuck up in a moment and can't move on. why? what if that moment was so amazing, so incredible, that living in it forever wouldn't exactly be bad. our past makes us who we are, so why not embrace it. the future only brings an end, and gives way to the past eventually. what are we without our memories? i often catch myself thinking of one great memory, and wishing that i could go back and relive it. but i can't. its gone. locked away in time, forever. time sucks.
