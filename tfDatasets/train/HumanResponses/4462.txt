!fire! yesterday i went to school and after lunch a new girl called emma came to visit because she will be joining our class next term. just then the fire alarm rang. it is a high pitched tone. my friends and i have started up a band and we were going to my freinds house to do our first rehearsal. max had brought his electric gitaur and amp. my other friend emma had brought her teripins, so we had to grab them to. we ran down the fire staircase and hurried outside. there was a small smell of smoke and cameron`s mum came to get us. the dep. head said "it will be one to two hours." so we went to rsvp across the road for an hour and came back. me and my chums went to the janitors to check it was safe to go in the building. we found out it was safe to go in so we went in and there was a weired smell of foam. when i got picked up from cameron`s house i found out that there was a small fire in my dad`s work too!
