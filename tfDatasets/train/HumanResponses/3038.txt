sorry i haven't posted much yet. i've been mezmerized by the dnc speeches. its about time we heard the truth about what needs to be done for a more prosperous america. first, we need to defeat the evil george w. bush and try him for crimes against humanity. then, we need to reverse the trend of selfishness that has destroyed the true spirit of this nation since repukelicans started taking over. government has to make sure that everybody is cared for, insteaad of leaving them to die in back alleys because they were too poor to pay for a safe abortion and they couoldn't feed the baby they were going to have, and the baby was going to be a mutant because awol's corporate cronies polluted the atmosphere. let america be america again! go kerry!
