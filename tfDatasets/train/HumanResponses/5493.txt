guess what?i went to the saloon today.and u know what?i got my hair cut.i dont think u want to see my new hair cut cuz its damn hideous.everytime i got my hair cut,i will always regret it later.and still,i got my hair cut.stupid isnt it?and i dont even know what am i crapping about.anyway,this morning,after so many months,i finally attend my taekwondo lesson at the pusat belia near wisma saberkas.since i cant come to the school training,my sir recommended me to come to the black belt training on sundays.so,i come la. needless to say,he and nadia never take their time to mention about the name of the training which is physical training. and you can guess how they train.its very torturing.seriously.my body ache all over right now.i even suck at my patterns.thats the price i have to pay for not coming for 5 months.well,i guess things like this happens all the time.
