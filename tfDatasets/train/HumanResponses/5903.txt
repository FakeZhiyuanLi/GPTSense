why were you there when i got broken-hearted why did you sweep me off my feet why did you look at me with those beautiful eyes and then told me that everything is going to be alright? why are your eyes green why are you so amazing why are you always blushing why did i fall for you and not knowing why? why were you out there and why was i here? what was the reason that god wanted us to meet without letting us to see each other? were you wrong for me? why did i want you so bad and why would turn away from me? .di.
