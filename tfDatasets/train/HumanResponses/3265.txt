this is how i exactly feel. scorpio october 23 - november 21 you may feel as if you are running into a brick wall at every turn, dear scorpio, especially when it comes to your emotions. the intensity of the day may have you feeling like you are in a pressure cooker. try not to blow the situation out of proportion. work to keep the lid on. realize that much of the drama is more a figment of your imagination than actual reality. clear away the clouds and get to the heart of the matter.
