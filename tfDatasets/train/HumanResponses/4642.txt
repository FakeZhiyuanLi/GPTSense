i am back in nashvegas working with other people and situations. i still have a coating on chicago over my skin. this is really strange to me. i am affected by this city is such a negative way. when i went there i noticed that it took me a day to adjust spiritually and emotionally to this place. and yet, when i arrived back here i am still affected by this city. i am under spiritual attack and i am fully aware of it. i think that if i acknowledge it- it will someone how go away. whoever reads this today, i pray that you would lift up the team there. it is thier week off and yet they are not able to rest and have peace. pray that the coating i have on my skin will be diminshed and i will be able to fully be here in nashville. the situations here are serious as well. i need you holy spirit to led and guide me today as i sift through what has happened and what should happen. lead me.
