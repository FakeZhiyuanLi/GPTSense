i can't promise that i won't end up venting here, but i'll try to keep the rants to a minimum unless they have to do with design/art. just lookin for a place to express my thoughts instead of holding them in and being ashamed of my opinions on art. that is what art is for after all right? expressing one's feelings and emotions? or is it?.
