last night had to be the most confusing nights of my life. i meet a guy name darell the night before. he is very beautiful by the way. he has this butter looking skin, soft hair, and beautiful eyes. but enough about his looks, i was going to have him for myself. only one problem he is eighteen years old. my heart sank, a eighteen year old boy. what am i going to do with him, play with him. this has got to be the most confusing thing right, but no it gets worst. i have another guy that is nice and caring but i never see him he lives in orlando. i really care for him and i want him to be my man but he lives so far away. i could go on about it but that is not all. there is another guy, he is great and loves me but he is in the military. i don't think i can take him dying on me, so i let he leave me without tell him i love you. see i told you my life is full of drama.
