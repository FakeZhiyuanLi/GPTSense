its incredible after a night of partying - the first in a long while - how you have ablsoultly no desire to move let alone train for the event.but it was worth it! great seeing everyone and my friends at the graduation. i guess i can use this to gauge how much weight i will be losing too. i am thinking i will drop about 10.i hope i dont lose too much.
