right now in my life everything is going good. i really don't want anything because i'm happy the way my life is right now. although i'm happy as it is now i wouldn't mind having some things. one thing that could happen to me is to get a car. i really need a car because i'm always taking the bus to school and i'm tired of it. another good thing is that i pass the ap world history test that i took like 3 weeks ago. if i pass it i won't have to take world history in college and that would save me time and money.
