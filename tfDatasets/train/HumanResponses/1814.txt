ozzfest was amazing! the best bands were judas priest and of course black sabbath. it was so much fun. there were so many people smoking pot, it was hilarious. then there was also a grass fight with half the stadium, not cool. i'm so surprised that grass is stil growing there after all of those concerts. and the other great part was this drunk guy next to us kept passing out, but his wife was pregnant and drinking and smoking. that kid is going to be severly screwed up. but hey, it's not my kid. but, i can't believe that school starts in 3 days i don't really want school to start. aahhhh.waking up early, doing homework, marching band rehersal everyday after school, then go to work after marching band rehersal. oh the joys of working. oh well, only 1 year left and then seniors are out of here. yay. but still so much to do before we get out of here, it really sucks.
