i was so tired and so overwhelmed last night that i was just about in tears. i knew that i just needed to sleep, that things would look better in the morning. which, for the most part, was true. i just have so much to do, just to keep caught up (not even trying to get ahead right now!). gotta hit the sack. goodnight.
