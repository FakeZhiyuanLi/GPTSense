newly discovered. george dubya bush is like cancer. he grows were he isnt supposed to, he's not wanted by anyone, anywhere, he destroys everything ithat gets in the way of what he's after and he cant be stopped until they attemp to remove him. bush should have a live porcupine shoved up his a$$ and then covered in fire ants and given the flesh eating disease and then while he is recovering someone should pour gasoline on his bedsheets and set him on fire and then put him out and let him live a little longer only so he has time to say goodbye before someone shoots him in the funking head
