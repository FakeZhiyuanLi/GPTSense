in my little sister's car, there is a chicky, aka a small wire and fuzz toy bird of a chicken-like persuasion. she has named the chicky "joy." the chicky is continuously thrown from its perch on the dashboard from the momentum of the car turning this way and that as the oh-so-powerful toyota corolla careens crazily about the little german hamlet of klein, texas. the last time i (aka "the chicky") was thrown from the dashboard, one of alexa's friends stepped squarely on me. alexa: (screams) ahieeeahieeieee her friend: what?! what?! alexa: you stepped on joy! her friend: (baffled) what? "my" right wing is now crushed and dangling from my poor, wizened body. it's a metaphor for my current life. joy: when will i be better, alexa? alexa: (sagely) when your wing is glued back on, joy. can't touch our depth.
