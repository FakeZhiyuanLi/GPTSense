i'm really close to a cousin from my mom's side of the family. me and her grew up together like sisters. since we were little, with did everything together and even hung out with the same group of friends. even though she is slightly younger than me, we manage to have an exelent relationship. we may fight sometimes, but really that's just because we care. she is like my little sister and my best friend.
