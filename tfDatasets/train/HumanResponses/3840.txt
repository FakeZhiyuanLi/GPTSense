booyah! i am done! i've only got 5 exams left and then im outta there. got a 79% on my math test that i thought i failed so i was pretty pumped about that. did nothing on our last day of school. finished off my brick in school, and did a little bit of wg but nothing much. went on a romper bike ride with h-dawg, back to the old swimming hole and looking at the tunnell. good times. gotta go help paint tonite for the grad so that shouldn't be to bad. a change for a few of us to get together and have some fun. ccr - proud mary
