i recently saw this on a message board: the pope during the crusades was to christianity as osama bin laden is to islam. just because a select few "religious" fanatics declare these two people leaders of their faith, they really do not imply nor practice the true teachings of their religions. so, apparently at the time of the crusades, only a handful of fanatics thought the pope was the leader of the roman catholic church. do i need to say anything further?
