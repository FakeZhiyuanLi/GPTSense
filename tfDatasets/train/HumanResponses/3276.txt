today is mum's birthday, having dinner with brother,sister-in-law and ron @ long beach marina. it was hell of a jam along the expressway because everyone is stopping to catch the fireworks. not too bad for me dinner with firework display right infront of me although not a bird's eye view but manage to catch a glimpas. after dinner went home,suppose to meet ah lian, shawn and kenneth @ aa but was too troublesome and tired so decided to stay home and watch my vcd. fell asleep not long after.ya, almost forgot my dad is back, he have been missing for two months.got a shock went i reach home,lights were on and brother's room door was closed (mum was out playing mahjong after dinner). dad was saying he will be leaving again on thurdays to hongkong and have been in hongkong and china for the past few months.hmm guess he will have alot to settle with the lawyer the next few days in singapore.
