you know, what i have never been good at is making things with my hands, face it if you can't see the finished project in your mind then its hard to build it. but dang if i can't coach a soccer team. i wake up at nights write plays or practice drills down and run them at the next practice. i can make any player feel like a winner weather we win or lose. i can motivate, if you know me you would find it hard to believe but on the soccer field i become "coach" and have a great attitude and make people feel good, and people make me feel good and wanted. i hope i can make that my calling, i fear if i don't act soon i might miss my window to work my way up to the pros someday. we all have our extreme goals, that is mine. on a finer note i feel like my friends have all become closer and stronger and .better magic players. since we saw each other for a weekend and we need to do that more often, and more often and more often.
