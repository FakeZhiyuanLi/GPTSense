so yeah, the other day at work, i was doing my usual no. 1 in the urinal at market cafe. and i noticed a crisp twenty dollar bill, sitting at the bottom of the urinal. at first i thought it was some hidden camera prank or something. but i soon got over that. so yeah, i grabbed the 20. as i was reaching for iti noticed it was fake, and well i kinda knew deep down it was fake anyways, but i thought it would be a hoot to grab it anyways. and of course, it was a twenty dollar bill telling me that i was going to hell, and i'm a foolish human being etc. etc. (sidenote: i wonder if anyone, when they get these little "fear" notes, go " holy crap! i'm an idiot and a worthless pile of crapi need help." ) instead of throwing it away, i threw it back in the urinal, just hoping to frustrate another opportunist like myself. i proceeded to wash my hands and exit the restroom.
