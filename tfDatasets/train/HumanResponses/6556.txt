i am sooo glad its finally friday. this has been the longest week ever. plans for the weekend are. if it doesn't rain all weekend, do a minimal amount of yardwork. go to a gay cabaret program at memphis theater works, because i know some people in it and it should be good. at least it was good last year. go to a couple of meetings, work for weight watchers take naps
