tonight i looked up into the sky and to my surprise was the big,white moon. i felt like taking a bite. but at my height. no way, that wouldn't happen anyday. maybe i could fly- fly up so high i could touch the sky how will i get wings to fly so high to touch the sky? just think happy thoughts and i'll give you pixie dust. no way that will be a bust. but lets try anyway. lets go up,up, and away!
