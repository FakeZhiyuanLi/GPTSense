i'm new at this but it takes me back to my teens when i was all full of angst and everything i thought was expressed in one of those 5 year lock-up diarys, remember them? so now i can talk to the whole world if i so wish. what a good idea this would be for my mum, she is house-bound and what she finds to do with her day i don't know. if i ever won just a small amount on the lottery i'd buy her a computer and teach her the limited amount i know on how to use one, treat her to some lessons also. it would open up her world. i'll buy a ticket this very day.
