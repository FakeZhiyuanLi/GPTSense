i have everything i want, but everything is not enough. something is missing, completely missing, im listening to outsmarting simon and its opening my eyes so much more to my world. i'm so passive with feelings, everything passes me, i watch the world pass me by but don't do anything about it. i feel like all my life i haven't accomplished anything of significance for myself. i want to know what love is, to feel love, to be in love, to feel. i've grown so much, i can appreciate the beauty of life, but why isn't it enough. i'm going to tear myself apart looking for the one thing that may not possibly exist, and when i find it ill be nothing.
