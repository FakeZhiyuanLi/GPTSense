awhile ago katie and i promised to get our ears pierced together. i'd be getting my second piercing, while katie would be getting her first. well this tuesday she walks into the classroom with her ears pierced! she broke her promise! then the stables called and said i couldn't work until my back was better. so, another thing wrong.
