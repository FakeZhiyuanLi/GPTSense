i am working on a poem, and i havent finished yet because i have to go to the movies, but heres what i've done (i will probably be doing some rewording): i live here you live there here feels nowhere near there i want you here, with me we may be a few miles away but that doesnt mean i wont travel to come and spend my days, with you i may play sports to win a trophy but that doesn't mean i won't spare strength to try and win you too you like diffrent things than i do but that doesn't make me feel a diffrent way about you because.i love you
