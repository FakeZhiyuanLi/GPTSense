richard brautigan a poet who i respect and enjoy, wrote a poem that infuriated me. it's called the pill versus the springhill mine disaster . every time you take your pill, it's like a mine disaster. i think of all the people lost inside you. my reply is called masterbation versus the swiss air crash every time you jack off, it's like a plane crash. i think of all the people splattered on the floor. it's the poem i'm most proud of. :)
