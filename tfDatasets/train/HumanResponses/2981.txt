booked my air ticket yesterday. leaving the uk on 16 nov for rio. then sao paulo to bueonas aires, santiago to auckland, christchurch to sydney, sydney - perth, perth - alice springs, darwin - singapore, bangkok - london. i'll have to get a few internal flights in different countries and definately do some overland travel but the basis of my trip is there now. it's all becoming quite real now.
