driving is a strange experience. at first i had very little skill and it was subtly nerve racking. then i gained experience and it became natural, but there is still a strange, subtle experience underneath it, a strange feeling. it is like visiting a far away land where you don't fully understand everything that is going around you. every so often this feeling develops into one of almost panic as i try and figure out whether or not the directions i got were good ones, or if i just missed the exit. when you are on the highway, one hour away from home, without a cellphone, you really are alone. you don't have family or friends to support you or double check you. i can handle almost everything that is thrown at me, but it is wierd having so few safety nets. my guess is that my driving experience will change as i learn more, and also that the strange, lack of safety net feeling will occur more often as i go to college and start living on my own.
