wow! i'm going to see how amazingly short this is, seeing as i've done absolutely nothing today. i was extremely annoyed at my mum and dad earlier. they are so amazingly irritating. i was told off repeatedly for "being smart". isn't that such an amazingly sad reflection on our universe that it is now some sort of telling off when you say "are you being smart?" as if its wrong for the answer to be yes? or that you aren't allowed to "answer back". isn't that what the whole of modern democratic society is based on? "answering back"? just a thought.
