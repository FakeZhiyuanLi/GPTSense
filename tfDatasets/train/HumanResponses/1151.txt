today i found it interesting that someone with whom i had spent the last 5 days straight did not call me. i think we're both a little overwhelmed with each other. i was told that he would do that by a very wise friend of mine, and she was right. boys are stupid, and girls are stupid, and i wish i were tired but i'm not. i'm bored, and in about 5 weeks i'm going to pine for these days of languid boredom. for now, i will whine that i am bored and that i need more structure in my life. said structure will commence in approximately 60 hours and counting. damn. p.s. i did not smoke today. i ate some sugar, but not too much. i hate having to keep track of this shit.
