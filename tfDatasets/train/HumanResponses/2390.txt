so today i have a lunch appointment with my boss and a radio rep. on the way, i ask my boss how her day is going. she begins to rant about who?-the accountant that doesn't like me. i now have dirt on her. it seems as though she made a mistake that cost the company $20,000. but she'll call me out for being 5 minutes late?!? and then my boss has a daquari at lunch-giving me dirt on her. then she tells me about how the owner keeps throwing away money on "hoochey-mamas". and apparently, he is rubbing it in everyone's face how he recruited me. and my boss is pissed b/c she thinks it was just luck. i'm finding the whole 2 1/2 hour lunch to be very exciting. however, right before lunch, the accountant caught me playing solitaire. oh, what an exciting day at work. just when i thought everyone was against me, turns out, they are against each other.
