when i was chatting with the girl i mentioned in the post before, she asked me if i'd like to see her niece once. i thought "okay, this girl will be maybe around 8 to 12 years" and told her, i'd like to meet/see her once. but another surprise was awaiting me: it was a beautiful girl with the age of 20! we chatted all day (around 4-5 hours) even though in japan it was already early morning. and this chat was really embarrassing but at the same time my self-confidence rose because both girls always said "kakkoii" or "kawaii". damn, i don't know what i would do, if i had to choose - i really like misa and despite her age she is sooooo sweet and beautiful. and her niece is sweet and beautiful too, but i don't know her well yet. oh my, my life is getting more complicated - i like that ;-) until now, my life has been rather boring, so from now on it's time to live ^^
