feeling is an interesting concept, we don't actually feel, we think that we do but we don't. on a (non)purpose-society like ours, feelings are a based on the "me" "i" "mine" therefore we only think to feel what is really a demand of a fake morality. instinct however has always survived within this concept of morality, if you analyze this you will know it has truth and if you are a preception based human you will deny at first but come to the same conclusion, humans are nature demons. flesh has always prevailed.
