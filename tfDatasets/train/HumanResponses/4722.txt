it's depressing, trying to lose weight. or just watching what you eat. still on paxil and wellbutrin. i was late in taking my doses today, and i started to feel lightheaded on my way to lunch. sad too. every once in awhile i start to think that i'm cured/healed, but then i go for too long without the meds, and i feel this sadness or angerjust emotion, reallywelling up from somewhere like a creeping incoming tide. all the bad emo poetry cliches are true: sadness colors everything. what the fuck is up with that? why? why, why, why?
