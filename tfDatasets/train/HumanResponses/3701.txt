now is it just pathetic when all your friends ditch you in the same day? thought so. yesterday sucked. i did nothing. all day and all night. i fucking walked around town like a worthless bum, then came home, and did a lot more nothing. i couldn't sleep last night. too much shit on my mind. so i just laid awake in my bed for hours. i finally got like 5 hours of sleep. about what i got night before last. i can't wait to get outta this fucking town. this place is just depressing. you really do have to be fucked up all the time in this town to keep from being depressed, just about. i'll go without anything for a while and it just fucking sucks. that's the way it's always been. i'm not suffering from withdraws, here, people. i'm pissed off, depressed, and i don't know what all right now. confused, mostly, like the rest of the world.
