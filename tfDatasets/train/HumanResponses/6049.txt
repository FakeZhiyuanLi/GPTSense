got an excellent book yesterday: "siblings without rivary". really great and very very practical. and the main point is always something you know about, but forget to do. in this case: letting in be and allowing all the feelings (in regards to sebastian, my 21/5 year old boy). yes, when he is angry, or overexcited and he hots her, what do i do? i scream at him and punish him by putting him to another room. does this allow his feeligs to surface - not of course. i do not even acknowledge them. would rather say something like: i see you are feeling angry. would you like to show me how you feel with the pillow ( or crayons). teaching children from early on to express their feelings artistically is probably one of the best things ever i could do for them. don't we all wish we learned it when we were babies too? another good tip from another good book: the magic of a word may. "you may hang your clothes now" - isn't it elegant?
