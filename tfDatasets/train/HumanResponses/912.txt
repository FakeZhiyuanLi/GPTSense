well, this is just a quick note before i'm off to matt's house. i've finished my last exam (and it was as easy as hell), and now i'm going to get pissed. unfortunately, matt says he's out of booze, but i'm sure i can steal a bit when he's not looking. i'll keep ya looped. and kim, i haven't forgotten about those pics. i'll see if i can get a few shots today - i can't find any recent photos. oobs.
