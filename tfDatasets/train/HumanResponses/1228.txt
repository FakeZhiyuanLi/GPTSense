if you haven't yet, catch the perseids, an annual meteor shower happening for the next couple of weeks and visible from almost anywhere in the u.s. round about 20 minutes ago, i saw the biggest falling star i've ever seen just sitting out back waiting for the pup to poo clear, distinct, lengthy for a meteor streak, gorgeous. the stuff from which wishes are made. thus, in an indirect way, a very earthbound experience led me to one of the more memorable stargazing experiences i have yet had. what a mingling of opposites. so i charge you: go forth, see comet tail, and make wishes! :)
