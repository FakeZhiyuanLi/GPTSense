it's not the fact that my mom is insain that bugs me so much. she's a dry-drunk, and she has menopause and she had a crappy childhood and she's never really gotten therapy for it. its perfectly normal that she would act this way. the frustrating part is that i can't cut her out of my life, as im not 18 yet. and i cant just leave and go live with my dad, because my birthdad is dead. but i'm talking to kellen online now and that makes everything easier. i love him so much. i cant wait till he gets back. he's coming back early. wednesday. i cant wait! anywaythat's all for now. peace.
