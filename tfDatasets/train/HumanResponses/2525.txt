today was just one of those nice days. i didn't even attempt to do any study and just took the day off to unwind. i went for a nice drive to moss vale and wollongong, it was very pretty and there was good company too :). the weather could have been better but you can't win them all. i have tonight off work so i might continue my nice bludge that i have going. i have a heap of yearbook stuff to do. there are profiles that need to be typed up, it's so tedious but i really want to get it done by really early next term so there is no stress.
