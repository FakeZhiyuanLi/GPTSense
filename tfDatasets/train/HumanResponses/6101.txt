well today i did the usual. i'm getting better at guitar and the snare too. my fingers ache a lot though but i guess that will be my sacrifice lol. today we had gardening at the nursing home. mr. comfort (yes that is his last name was so funny) lol he says he is god's gift to women lol. but anyway bingo was fun i guess though i got the giggle attacks in the middle of calling numbers so i started messing up and literally threw the mic to steph so she could call the numbers that was funny. saturday i'm going to six flags for a concert and stuff it will be so much fun! anthony and drew are going so i'm going with them and it will be so much fun i can't wait. tomorrow is fr. benson's b-day and i hope i'll be able to go to his party. anyway that's all for now my fingers hurt when i type.lol god bless
