the other day my friend and i were talking about our crotches (a different friend this time). i think we started talking about our scents. that was when she told me that she sniffs she panties regularly, in order to insure that her scent is pleasant. i think she thought that was, like, some huge revealation and asked me not to mention it to anyone else we know. the truth is that i only expected that was the natural thing to do. everyone smells themselves. and, most, probably like the way they smell; it's just nature. i know i like the way i smell -like warm butter, all hot and juicy; melted nectar, honey, fresh dew of the flower -petals dripping.the ground below it soaking. the scent is like that of fresh sex. now, another friend told me that she tastes herself during self-inspections; good for her. i just save that for the guys.
