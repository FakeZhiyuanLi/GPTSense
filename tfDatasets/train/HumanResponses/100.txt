so far i didn't have any problems with the my domain. that's pretty strange. all the stuff i've wanted is already online. now i have to move the sites i want there to the new place. will take quite some time. i'm afraid there's a mouse in my room. i've heard strange sounds before but not as loud as today. i can't say mice scare, they don't know. but i don't like unwanted visitors. in the middle of the night most of all.
