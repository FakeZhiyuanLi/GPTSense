here in poland it's 10.35 in the evening and i've just watched my favourite film the virgin suicides" where the most handsome guy in the world josh hartnett is playing the main character. i've seen this film about 6 times but i still love it. but films that i really love are horrors i think these kind of films are the best!and i also like films about drugs like  thirteen" with evan rachel woods who is very good actress i think. i know that my note is boring but who cares. i supposethat nobody would give me a comment anyway so why should i write interesting things if nobody would read it. so please!can anyone give me that one stupid comment
