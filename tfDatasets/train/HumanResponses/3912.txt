ok i have been doing some reseach tonight trying to find a bit of history about 'nothing' hopefully that will lead me on to some clues as to what exacully nothing is: the word 'nothing' was first traced back to a cave man, named dohnk who lived during the stone age. it is said he created the word becuase he use to slur his words together, and while saying, "vios higoff" (no thing). he mistakenly combined the two words (voishigoff) and created the word nothing. when asked what definition he would like to give the new word he created, he is believed to have said, "nothing comes to mind." this has been interpreted by italian historian biasonni ignorentti as saying, there is no definition for nothing because no definition is the definition. so there is a bit of hisroy of nothing. nothing has no definition- acording to mr ignorentti, i will soo find out for my self weather that is true!
