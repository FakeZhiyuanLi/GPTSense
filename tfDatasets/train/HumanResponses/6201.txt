i am pretty new at all of this stuff, but wanted a place to just be able to rant if i feel like it. so this seems like a good place to start. i never thought that having a daughter would change a person, but boy does it my girl is only 10 months old, but is my boss and my wife's boss too! she is as cute as a button and just about as good a baby as i have encountered, but damn, she is time consuming. i don't think that is bad, just not really what i expected i guess. ok, more later, not sure really what is supposed to happen but will be back soon d
