well, today has been my first day of high school, now as a sophomore. i am too tired to type coherently, i probably should've followed my own advice in the last post too. oh well. here's a break-down of my course schedule: a - day 1st spanish iii 2nd world history ap 3rd theatre art i (blagh =p) 4th algebra ii b - day 5th ap computer science i 6th chemistry 7th team sports (w00t) 8th english ii well i've already finished about the first 6 weeks of spanish this semester. haven't got the algebra 2 book yet, forgot the world history book (*whacks head in masochistic effort to boost memorization*), and theatre art doesn't have one. no long-term projects yet. damn, i wish i didn't need sleep.
