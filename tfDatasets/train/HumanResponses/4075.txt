hey all, last night i went to the linkin park, hoobastank, pod, and story of the year concert and it was wicked awesome( hahaha). i went with justin, kylie , alyssa, and marie. the only band that really sucked was pod. i bought this awesome hoobastank shirt. yay. we got home about 11 30, and since the roads were so bad everybody just spent the night. we started to watch the labyrinth but people got tired so alyssa went and crashed on the couch and marie in the den. so kylie, justin and i went and talked in my sister's room where justin was sleeping. we stayed up till like 3 30. i was a great time though. i think we are all really tired though so i'm going to go ill write later.
