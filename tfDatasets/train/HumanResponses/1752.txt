well, i finally got a 64-cd holder. i had outgrown my 32, i ended up doubling up cd's. its pretty nice, its made by napster and has 8 slots on the front for easy access its pretty cool. but i want my ipod! jeez to be able to get any song i want at the touch of a finger. man, thats nerd-vana right there. i just spent about 30 minutes loading it up, and found some cd's that had been missing. including some computer games. i'm still missing a couple, but my bet is that abby stole them from me she finds ways to get my cds (and clothes.err, she wears my dc shoes hoodie all the time). i think she has my yellowcard and offspring cd. i'm going to look in her room (don't tell her, she hates people going in there) and find all my cd's b4 i go to practice. oh yeah! crap, i have to practice. i'll update later tonight. signing off, dp until the day i die
