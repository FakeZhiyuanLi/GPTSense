tomorrow i have a meeting about making a tv series about two dogs. the series is for children age 3-4 and up to 6-8. i've been chosen to do the pilot, and we well try to do as much as possible localy here in hadeland "county". later on friday i'm going out with colleagues from my old job. we were split in the summer of 2002, but manage to keep in touch. occationaly we go out for dinner and ends usually up at some party. friday is also the first weekend that there are no smoking at all! as of juni 1st there are probated to smoke at any public area where they serve, whether drinks or food. like irland, and some states in the us. i'm not gonna miss that awfully stinking smell from my clothes and the smell of nicotine being washed out when one hit the shower. da-ah. smokers: suck it up!
