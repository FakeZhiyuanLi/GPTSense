i feel i have kind of neglected this. although there are some news. i had this website abut books and stuff but it just wasn't what i wanted. so i deleted it and decided to create a german site about jerry o'connell. just love the guy, he's so funny. what i didn't expect is that it's sooooooooooo much work. but i swear i'll get it done. my thoughts still revolve around ramazan. i just can't get the guy out of my head. and if i talk about this it just gets worse. *sigh* i wish thigs would be different. meaning that i fall in love and be happy and not sad as always.
