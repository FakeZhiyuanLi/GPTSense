5/22 is my younger sister's birthday! but on saturday i slept over so when i woke up, she's gone out already. she went to gym with my mother so i cooked cheese cake for her. my father went to dentist 'cause he ached his throat of bad cold and he ate candy to decrease his throat ache but his teeth became cavity so he must go to a dentist. i wish he find the way how to lose ache of his throat another way. i presented my sister album of photograph she wanted. now she's preparing go to work, she works as a receptionist at sport gym. she's very beautiful so she seems to be popular at working place. she likes dancing so she goes to dance school 3 times a week. i'm proud of her very much and i love her. she's very kind to me but also she's selfish on me maybe i'm too kind to her.
