welcome to my journal thingy. i have started this journal so that you can keep up with my movements when i am overseas. or should i say we, as i will be travelling with scott. in the lead up to travelling, we have a lot of preparation to do. today we went to kathmandu, as they are having a sale. we were a little disappointed to say the least, as they didn't have anything we really wanted. the backpacks were not to our satisfaction, the thermals were expensive, etc. but there are plenty of other shops around, and i intend to visit them all! over and out.
