primordial fear where is away when away was here thinking and hoping there's nothing to fear i look and search for the one to come then i find i am all alone. find a way to get myself through the day don't know what else i can do need a way to be free of the pain i'm told its found all in you. where is away when away was here thinking and hoping there's nothing to fear i look and search for the one to come then i find i am all alone. like those times we could play all day the world was full of things to do younger times we didn't know any pain before i forgot about you. where was i when i was lost blinded by demons and almost paid the cost i've looked and found the one who came he's never gone because he rose again.
