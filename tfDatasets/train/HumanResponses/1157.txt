i feel really bad because yesterday was my brothers birthday and my mom got completely shit faced. luckily he is only five and he didn't know that his mom was drunk but that hardly makes up for it. whatever, at least i got him the one thing he really wanted for his birthday, i really lucked out because i didn't know that he wanted it.
