i had my two hour sailing class on friday and my four proteges could have used instruction in more than just water based activities. they didn't really want to listen to my sailing instruction and i had trouble organizing it in a cohesive way. watching these people mingle made me realize i need to either settle or give up by my late 30s, dating can not continue forever.
