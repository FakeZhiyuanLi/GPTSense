july 01, 2004 7:46 morning thursday semi-windy day skies almost blue i had a much weirder dream the night before. it was blackout in our neighborhood and it was past 10 in the evening so everything was real dark, save for the faint glimmer of candles in some windows in the houses. i also noticed that there were no cars passing by that night, it was all so silent. there were a few people outside passing time and the heat of the night. i was walking away from our house when i saw this three people walking in my direction. two girls were at the extreme right and one guy was on the left. as i got closer to them i noticed they were talking, but what really freaked me out was the guy had no head! his head however was dangling from his back, i quickly ran for what seemed such a long time back to our house and decided to take my cellphone with me. *there's a consistency here, this and the other had one common denominator = 3*
