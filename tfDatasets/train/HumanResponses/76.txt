i decided to start over on my blog getting ready for inventory at work on the 9th of june. this year i am not going to stress out like i did last year. as long as nobody dies on sunday i will be ok. also checking to make sure all my prescriptions are filled too. i have my plan of action all made out and i am determined to stick to it. no faltering. the saturday after inventory, i will be picking my nephew and 2 nieces up from the airport. they will be visiting for a week. i am soooo excited about this. my niece jennifer and nephews andrew and christopher are the kids of my sister christine and my brother-in-law dave. andrew won't be visiting right now. soon though, i hope. my other niece that is also coming is elizabeth, my sister maggie's daughter. abby, maggie's youngest won't be coming up this time. she is going camping with some friends. well, just wanted to get this started. laters
