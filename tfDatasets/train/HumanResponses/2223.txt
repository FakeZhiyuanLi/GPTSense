holidays are supposed to be great, right? but no, my holidays are boring. i'm not allowed to go out, not allowed to do this ao that. what am i supposed to do? sit at home and tidy up my room (well, my room is kinda messy). and when my mum's allowed to go on a holiday next week, i'm gonna be stuck at my aunt's house doing absolutely nottin at all. my friends are all away for holiday. lucky piggys. never mind. i just burn my new w-inds cd *squels*. w-inds are my absolutely favourite j-pop group. i love keita. he's got such a nice voice and he's cute.*drools*
