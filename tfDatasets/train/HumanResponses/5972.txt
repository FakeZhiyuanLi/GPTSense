yes, i am finally moving to my own place out on my own. gone are the days of roommates. i'm moving to this cute little one bedroom place in durham. it's quiet (oh what a blessing) so i won't miss the racing boat starting up at midnight setting off all the car alarms, or the caravan of modified fourwheelers roaring by my window. i will enjoy the birds, setting on my patio and strolling down the rural roads. i also live in an orchard so i get tons of citrus fruits. as a bonus, it's closer to my job at the ranch! and i live right down the street from a park. it will be so nice to get out of noisy chico. the draw back you ask? well i won't be able to zip down the street and get cold stone ice cream :( i think i'll manage though.
