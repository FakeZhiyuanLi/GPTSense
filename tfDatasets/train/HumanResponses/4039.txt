have you ever noticed how george bush "looks forward" to addressing any controversial matter reporters remind him about rather than actually addressing it? he "looks forward" to meeting with the 9-11 commission he "looks forward" to figuring out what went wrong with the intelligence in iraq. he "looks forward" to having a debate with the american people about the issues. we have to hope that he also "looks forward" to getting kicked out of the white house, living the rest of his life as an object of ridicule and scorn by most of the country, and going down as the worst president ever.
