well 2day.as it is friday.we had another game of soccer, this time against guildford.well it was another disappointing game coz we lost.again. anyway here are the highlights: sukhum was bout 25 metres from the goal and he the ball came 2 him and somehow he booted it backwards into sheahan's goal.then liam (the ex goalie) went to clear it and it came flying off the side of his boot and he almost bounced into the goal.so that's a own goal and another very close shave.then michael ierace shoulda been sent off.coz he just tackled this guy really roughly wen he tried to get the ball.and the guy chucked a huge psycho at him.and they almost started fighting.luckly ierace got taken off just after that.then there was sam missing quite a few gd oppurtunities in front of goal.especially this one just be4 half time.where it was a absolute sitteranyway in the end it was 2-1 and jaron scored this hell gd goal. well betta luk next week.
