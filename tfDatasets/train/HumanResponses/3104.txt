thank you for the comments and e-mails. i've been enjoying the messages, and have had a good time exchanging e-mails with you guys and girls. it really makes this fun when i get to make friends with new, adventurous people. please, thought, if you write to me, i only ask 2 things: 1) be nice, not pushy and not rude 2) don't ask my real name. i'm not your wife, i'm not your sister, i'm not going to tell you my name. other than that, let's have some fun :)
