what a horrendous day. the morning wasn't too bad for me, as i was off working on the dinghy. from lunchtime onwards it went downhill fast, as christopher has been dreadful all day. a victim of his own early morning, he has been tired, grumpy and demanding, whinging constantly. good points - we bought some books for the kids, and susanne has quite happily started reading a childrens novel, no pictures at all. christopher is reading dr seus.
