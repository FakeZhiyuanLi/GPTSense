well, i've been reading various books in the marvel reload that last couple of months and while i'm not really super impressed by any of them, the only which is really bothering me right now is the new excalibur. guess what - magneto's still alive! bah - they should bring back psylocke and colossus if they are gonna ignore their own "death is real" rule. more later. wyldwolf
