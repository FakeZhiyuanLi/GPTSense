as i excited 287 i thought of starting a poetry journal about piscataway. poems from piscatway , piscataway poems . everything sounded cheesy. i'm not sure how i'll do it. i'll leave that up to the response. but i feel excited about hearing people's stories about this town. people always say there is nothing to do in piscataway- that piscataway has no center, "it's boring." is that the future of this country, or maybe now the present? as my parents said after their driving trip up and down the coast- "we passed so many strip malls- bed bath and beyond, applebee's." there must be stories of piscatway's memorable places- cliches or suprises or maybe just memories of where the roads used to go, what we used to pass on the way to- i have nine months left here. i'm getting sentimental.
