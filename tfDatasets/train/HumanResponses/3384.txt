i'm off to a job interview. in a few hours i could be on my way to becoming an it consultant for the swedish company office it-partner. the scary thing about this is that i'm not even sure i want the job. it's not the coolest company in the world and to top it off, i get to work in vb6 :d the job also requires me to drive around sweden a lot (one or two hotel nights a week). we'll see. i'm probably going to another job interview in lund next week. if i screw this one up, i can rest assured i get to try again next week :d
