yes, it's been awhile. while my thoughts are still fixated upon this beautiful man, i have yet to concluded that he would like to see me again. this will bring me back to the lusting faze, wanting and craving him like i used too. it's very strange that our encounter was only for that brief time, only that day. i'm lost  lost in this corrupted mind of mine  what more could i want then a tasty man?
