hey there! i'm posting from the great state of texas in the best city ever, dallas! eeep! hope y'all are doin' good back in new mexico or wherever y'all are at now. alright, enough texas talk for now, even though i truly am starting to pick some of it up. i miss you guys so much and just wish that we could all be together again. college is fun though and i'm sure you guys will all enjoy it. my roommate is nice and my suite mates are awesome. classes are hard so far(i've only had two days) and i already have some homework. it is a lot different from aa, well at least smu is different, so be ready for that. anyways, hope to hear from you guys soon. miss you all and love you tons! texas rocks my socks! (i'm sure i'm going to get tons of comments from you guys on this post!) love always, karen
