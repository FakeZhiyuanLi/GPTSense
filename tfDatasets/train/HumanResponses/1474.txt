when i look at the world around me, i see people laughing in amusement, but i cry in vein. when i look at the world around me, i see people people's enjoyment, but i am in agony. when i look at the world around me, i see forgiveness, but i feel revenge. when i look at the world around me, i see happyness, but i feel sadness. when i look at the world around me, i see what i want, but it doesn't want me.
