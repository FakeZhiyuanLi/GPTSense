i've noticed a distinct contrast betwen my current mood and the happiness of my long ago post. it has distinctly worsened. (but if you ask some of the kids in my school they'll say that it's not possible.) my life has been pretty normal really, nothing exciting about it at all. no one calls, and of the only two people who im me on a regular basis, one lives in louisiana and the other one is in another city. but to make this post a tad longer for those of you who actually take time out of your oh so busy schedules to read these things, i shall post a poem of my own devising. please don't take it. it's not that good anyway. woe is i for in the darkness i have forgotten the light. and the only warmth is the dying ember of my hope. yet i trudge on through life caring for my ember and making sure it never goes out completely. for the day it does is the day i cease to be as i am. ta-da. have a nice day. :)
