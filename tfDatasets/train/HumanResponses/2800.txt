i thought shit had changed but i was wrong by far. i dont care anymore it is out of my hands. just listen to me when i say: dont ever introduce your friends to a significant other. i am tired of the summer, well this summer because so much bad shit has happened. i am prly going to court which is a good thing because hopefully i wont ever have to see the sperm donor. he is a fucking fag. but oh well. im so sick of people. well only 3 years right? bye
