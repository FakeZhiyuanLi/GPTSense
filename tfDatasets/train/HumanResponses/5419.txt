.this time i know its the real thing. ah yes, there's nothing quite like quoting horrendous 1990 pop lyrics in the first line of one's new blog. kinda sets the standard, no? i'm referring to the fact that over the last few years i've managed to sign up for numerous blogs/journals, and i have successfully managed to neglect each and every one of them (yes, yes, i know. i rule!) but as the scary pop song suggests; this one is different. other than some optimistic drivel, at the moment there isn't much to add really. i'm currently working on a whole new layout for the blog, and hopefully that will be up in the next few days . i'm also working on a moblog which should be interesting. maybe? -hey, i find it interesting. what does a guy have to do too get some love around here?!
