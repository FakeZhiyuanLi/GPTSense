i cannot believe this. greece won [euro 2004]! that is not fair, at all. why does greece have to win? why couldn't it be portugal? i've got a million questions that are demanding to be answered, right now. greece, of all countries! and there i was, thinking that portugal would win. hell, cristiano ronaldo's on their team! he's like, one of the best for his age! only nineteen and on the portugal national team? truly remarkable. but my support for cristiano ronaldo doesn't mean that my support for england has died down. i'm still bent on england to beat the rest sometime soon!
