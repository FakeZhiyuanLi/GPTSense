i've come up with a name for the sequel to [the last chance]: [eternally yours]! took me ages to come up with that name. i'm going to start to write it, sometime in the very near future. also, i've planned the main characters for another 4 stories, which i'm not going to reveal just yet. who knows? maybe someday, i will become a writer! now for chinese orchestra. i've been selected to perform at parco bugis junction on saturday. not that i seriously mind, but if mom and dad really do turn up, then it's going to be the embarrasment of my life; i'll probably blow the flute off-key.
