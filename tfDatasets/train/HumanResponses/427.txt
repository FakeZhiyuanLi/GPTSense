my book talked about the different cases that have been filed for court nation wide and how they lose everytime. a sorority is nothing more than a way to let people know that you have money and are basically set for life. the sisters are crazy. they even go as far as setting up date rapes: they will drug you up on "special k" and then take you to a designated frat house where they have already pre-arranged a guy to "deflower" the "little sister." it's sickning to think that there are people out there that actually contribute to rape in our society. i am definatly considering beig in a club or something, instead of a sorority. i will not subject myself to their kniving, childish, and immature acts: rape, drug and alcohol usage and abusing, aswell as health issues.eating disorders. i don't know about you, but i like to keep what i eat down, that was the whole reason of eating it in the first place.lol. but, that's just me. make your own judgments.
