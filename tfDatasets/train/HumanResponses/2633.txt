some dumb fucker just ran over my dog and didnt even have the heart to come and tell me. i just dont understand how someone can be so cold hearted. no campassion for anything living and or dead. people are just sick i know if it would have been me i would have atleast went to someones door and asked if it was there dog and maybe ther could have told me who it belonged to but no. brooks and bub are going to go and bury her in the yard. i just cant do it i mean i just cant i dont know why but i cant deal with shit like this. i have a hard time with death even if it was a dog. i just dont feel good right now things have got to get better i dont think they could get any worse
