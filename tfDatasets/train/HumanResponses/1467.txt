today was boring i went to the movie 2 days in a row and it gets boring after a while, plus i think i gained 10 pounds off of popcorn! i saw corey, justin, and ryan at the movies so i ditched my parents and hung out with them instead. then when i was eating lunch my dad had one of his "talks" with me and he said that if i continue to smart off my parents then he will ground me for the rest of the summer (i already have another month to go from the last time i got grounded, so i better watch it!) when i was checking my grades on edline i dropped from a 99% in wv studies to an 87% just because of a stupid test! its not my fault i failed it! but how could it drop my grade 12 points? o yea and now i have a c in french class because i got a 69% on my finals. well now i'm just sitting here talking to lindsey and watching the countdown to degrassi. ttyl bye ~boring post~ i promise it will be better next time *em*
