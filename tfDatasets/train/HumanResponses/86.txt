everytime i have a crush, i'm always hoping for something that might not come true. i always end up daydreaming about him, i can't concentrate on the things i'm doing. sometimes, i convience myself that the guy i like might like somebody else, but i still like him. maybe the word martyr is next to my name. i'm always waiting for the right guy but i always falling with the wrong guy. a friend e-mailed me about what those the selection their mean, the question # 8 asked to choose a # between 1-10i choose 8and it says thare that's the number i will fall in love before i get marriedthat's so weird. ok, i admit iti easily fall in love with a guy that is really sweet,nice, good-looking and accepts me for who i am gtgi've got some work to do
