well life is good, school is over! a time of great reflection on the year and all things that partain to it. i am glad that summer is here but with summer comes alot of extra time so thats what i am doing this for to journal my summer basically. this is election day and the time for choosing new government is at hand, hopefuly the liberals will win and become the government once more! a conservative government holds a scary future and thats not something to look forward too. on mylimbo i will be posting some stuff on the election over the night as it arises or as the oppertunity to get on computer comes up. well that is all that i have to say for now. until next time.
