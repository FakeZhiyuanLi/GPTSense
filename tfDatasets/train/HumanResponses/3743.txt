i've been lazy, which is why i haven't posted in a while. anyway today is memorial day and it's pretty ugly outside. i've been working on my blackjack final for programming. i am almost done, i just have one more thing to do. that one thing however, will be a bitch to do. the stanley cup finals are pretty interesting. i am having a hard time watching, due to what happened in game 7. calgary leads 2-1 though, calgary really deserves the cup. they've played with basically an ahl defense, rookie goalie, and being the underdog in every round. the lakers should wrap up their nba western final series, while detroit and indiana might go 7. after the nba and nhl playoffs, it's all baseball until september. that's it, i'm feeling sick, gotta go.
