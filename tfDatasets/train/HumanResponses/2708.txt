so the greatness that are the gods of advertising have decided that we are docile, programmable animals and the only way we buy stuff (elephant.co.uk)is by repeating (elephant.co.uk) the same name (elephant.co.uk) over (elephant.co.uk) and over (elephant.co.uk) a-bloody-gen. so it comes to no surprise that when seeing an advert with an elephant and the words elephant.co.uk being repeated so many times my head hurts, that all i could think of after the ad was why don't elephants ever forget.it certainly isn't with the help of (giraffe.co.uk).
