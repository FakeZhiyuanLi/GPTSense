well well, i went to the top bunk of my bed, searching for freelancer, and what did i find? i found the power and av cables for my dreamcast. so i went under my bed and found the old white beast. after dusting it off i plugged in all the connections, put in my quake iii arena disc, and asked myself one question. why did this thing fail? visually, it's better than the ps2. controller wise, it's better than the xbox and the gamecube. (the playstation controller can not be defeated, it is the standard imho) the dreamcast is a great system, again, in my humble opinion. why oh why did it fail? i'll never know.
