ok, so it wasnt really a road trip but i couldnt come up with a better title. so sue me. andrew, derek, dawn, andrew's cousin, and i went to the mall yesterday. twas fun. bought a couple of cd's and never bought the keychain that i was going to buy. *shrug* yeah, so that was my day yesterday. the only thing that sucked is that i didn't get to roleplay at all yesterday like i said i was going to. forgive me, meredith?
