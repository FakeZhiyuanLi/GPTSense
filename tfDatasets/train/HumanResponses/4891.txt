about to fall asleep i think. just been looking at porn online for the last hour or so. forgot all about my blog. q left here to go to work at about 5am. she only slept about 3 hours, so her day is not likely to be a good one. that was partly my fault. i woke her up before she could really fall asleep and we fooled around. she showed up about 3 yesterday afternoon and stayed the night. i ended up taking a shower shortly after she arrived. we watched a few movies and made terriaki pork chops, rice and corn for dinner. i ate way too much. still feeling stuffed and it's been 10 hours since we ate. haven't heard from danny for a couple days. q might come back after she gets off work. well, that's about all of the blogging i can handle for now. gotta get to sleep. last shower: 17 hours ago ripeness meter: [1]
