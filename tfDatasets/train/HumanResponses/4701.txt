hey levi thanks for helping me figure this whole thing out, mad props bud! this is how i feel you don't know me, so dont talk about me! i know what happened, i was there and you weren't! he is saying that i keep calling and bugging him, but i'm not. you didn't here the things that he said to me and you don't know the way he made me feel. he was my good friend, he could tell me anything, problems with his girlfriend or school, i could also tell him anything, i thought that i could trust him. i was wrong. he told you lies so that way he could be cool and i would be a fool. so this is how i feel. right now i'm not thinking about what we could have had, because you are not worth it. why would i want someone who tells lies? why would i want someone that can't respect me? you might ask why i am saying all of this if i think your not worth it, but the truth is i don't know either, i guess that's just how i feel! -chelsea
