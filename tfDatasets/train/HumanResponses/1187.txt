i regret going to furr high school last year because that school sucks and they messed up my life. i could have been a senor this year and i could have been headed off to collage this fall. but they messed up my credits said that they could not give me credit for the rest of the school year so i didn't finish the school year last year. so i am stuck with another high school year. i would do anything to go back and change ever going to furr high school. the only thing that i ever liked about that school was the football team because there is so much chaos there. it's like nobody like each other there because everybody is alway's fighting at that school. i have never seen as many fights in my life as i seen in that school. wait the only other thing i liked about that school is that i got to lift weights at lunch and in one of my classes. other than that i don't really like anything else about that school. so i really regret going to that school yeah.
