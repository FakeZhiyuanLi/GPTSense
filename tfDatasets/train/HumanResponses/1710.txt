normally i don't do sentimental stuff like this, but this is a dedication to someone who affected my life a bit. a while ago, i was in a class called library media. a while after, when i finally talked, i met a girl. i know, most people reading this are going to say "omg teh romnance story", but no. all those people please report to the giant cliff of doom now. >>" anyway. we talked. a lot. she was really nice, but had depression and all that and i learned a strange amount about the phases of teenageness. i also learned people at my school don't neccesarily suck. >>" i was all happy 'n stuff die to the evils of having a girlfriend then. after that girl left to the wilds of texas, i was dumped by my girlfriend. i went into depression and all, missed a lot of sleep, and memories of that class cheered me up 'n stuff. cheers to ya.
