yes, i got a bike today  i finally choosed the treck 3700. i tried it for like 20 minutes, it seems pretty cool :-)) but i didn t know i would get tired soo quickly, i defenitely need to exercise more often. anyway, i am quite happy. btw, as expected i didn t get the free helmet, but i managed to get a free kick stand. well it s not much (like $8) but it s symbolic. actually it was just to show roxie that u can always get something free :-)
