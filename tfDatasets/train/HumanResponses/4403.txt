i recieve lots of email about accelro and askin me what happen to the server. like what i said im busy this past few weeks! and dont have time to manage and maintain the server. i love ragnarok online, that game is totally addicting, though sometimes i got bored but still i'll love to play it. i down the server for now! and i dont have any idea when it will be up. i know it's very disapointing, but i have my own life and not just to play and maintain the game for the whole day, i have lots of things to do. maybe i'll open the message board again and it will be your guide to find a new server. it's really a great time playing with you all folks! see you again someday! and have a blessed life for you all :)
