allright, i have a job again. i now am the secretary/customer service/first level tech at lakeshore computer consulting, llc and midview internet services. my little brother is a tech there, so he got me the job. it's going allright, but the owner tends to swear a bit more than i am comfortable with. he kinda flies off the handle about really stupid shit, and has a tendency to make you feel like crap, so hopefully i'll just learn to let it go, and get used to it.
