there was a nice mail fight going on at my office about copy rights and intellectual property rights violation. a teacher of mine was saying that by copying entire web articles in to mails and publishing them on private special interest group mailing lists, we could be violation laws. and some friends of mine were saying we are not. i found an article about fair use of others' work which says some could be justified and some not. the mails were really interesting and educating, but unfortunately can not be published in the blog as iâ€™m afraid i might be violating laws!
