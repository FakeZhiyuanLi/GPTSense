this weekend went by fast, even though it was lacking in things to do. despite the budsmoke it was a kinda sucky weekend. i dunno.i haven't been going out with sarah long and i don't know her very well, but i feel like its always gonna stay that way. we never seem to spend more than a half an hourtops together and theres never any conversation. i wish we could talk or see each other but maybe shes just too busy.guess i'll just have to wait for that one day when i call shes home or she calls me to see her.that one day.somewhere down the road. i came home early tonight to do some make-up work and im glad to say i at least got some done so hopefully i can pass grammer, i don't know about ica though those essays seem to be amongst the missing. well going back to my bed and the one thing i can always count on to be comforting.sleep.
