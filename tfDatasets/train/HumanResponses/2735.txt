i figured out why i love dogs so much today. i had to be gone today for much longer than i originally thought i would need to be. consequently, my dog was left in her crate for about 10 hours. needless to say, because i'm a big baby, i worried about her. well, when i came home, she was fine, and she was ridiculously happy to see me. that's why i love dogs. she wasn't pissed off at me for leaving her alone all day, she wasn't mad for being locked up. no, she was just happy that i was home. they are always just happy for the time they get to spend with you and for the love that you give them. while growing up, i had a few dogs. i was going to write about chance, who died a year ago. and about charlotte, who left us last week. i find the idea of writing about them makes me sad. i don't want to be sad, and i know for sure they wouldn't want me to be. so, for now, i won't write of them. instead i will pet the puppy in my lap and tell her i love her. she makes me so happy.
