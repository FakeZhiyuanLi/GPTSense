i've recently been looking into renting an apartment (once i start work in august, most likely. although i'd like to move out now). i've narrowed my locations to sammamish // issaquah // south bellevue, due to the nature and location of where i will most likely be working. if anyone knows of any good apartments with few problems (if any), please let me know your recommendations. mucho gracias. :) ~~~~~~~~~~~~ now onto the next portion of my post - how do i edit these crazy tags on this crazy template so that i can make links to friends' blogs? i'm trying to make sense out of the help pages, and you'd think that for someone who used to be so into web pages that i'd know what to do, but i have noooo idea! it could be that i'm just too lazy to read up on it and really understand. in any case, if you can help me with this, it would be great, too. but i'd rather hear about the apartments. or both. ;)
