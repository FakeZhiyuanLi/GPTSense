pat aka tfc macky moose hairless kiwi mr p mr t mr c pat island patch adams fort apache the cat castorking beefstock bof (or any day) i once asked pat what car he thought he most resembled. he replied “probably a nissan micra convertible kid. nothing on top, no hidden extras and no redeeming features”. ha ha, yes that’s pat not a very funny man but very honest about his somewhat limited abilities. he has a face that only a mother could love. a tempered brow, a proud chin and a cruel nose. but deep down he’s truly a humble if not lazy man. who else would keep a bottle on one side of the bed to save on water bills and his hair on the other to save time. what a character patricks hobbies include dancing badly, golf, lying down, football badly, ju jitsu, food, and lying down. his favourite films are ealing comedys and he likes nothing better than watching babs winsor over a nice bottle of red wine.
