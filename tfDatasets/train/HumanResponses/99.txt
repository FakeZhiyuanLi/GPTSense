had another down day with some great thoughts. actually only a down afternoon and evening probably. have been working all day long on a translation and watching tv at the same time. i just can't work when it's quiet. well, thought was - "if i could just end it all." not in a way to do anything to myself. rather only to. i don't know change my style of living, my living situation, my no-boyfriend situation. i just feel so horribly lonely sometimes, including today. as talking is none of my favourite hobbies i prefer to keep everything to myself. not god, i know. but that's how i am. i just wish someone would find me.
