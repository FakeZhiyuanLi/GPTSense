i have known this girl about three years like that.but she became my classmate when i was in p 6 back then.she is a nice and dilligent prefect i know.very sensitive feelings stored deep inside her.se is a very kind and well-respected studet by every student in ahmad ibrahim well she was the head prefect.and she was so serious in her duty that she got no time much to study until her malay teacher talk about her.but he shouldn't have said that cause nadia seems to be very good in her studies.during her clasmmates with me she was so kind to help all her classmates in their weakness.she never complains but she is strict.she is especially strict in teaching us so we can get the right tactics.she never fails to do her homework while she was having prefect duty every after school hours thats all about nadia.
