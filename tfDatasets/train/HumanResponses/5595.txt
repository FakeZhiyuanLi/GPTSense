so this is the first email i got this morning. cristina: have any of you been in the attic recently? the door has been open for days. if there are rats, mice, birds or any other animals, the attic is where they will be. chantal: have not, was open when i got back last sunday night. maybe it happened due to wind or whatsoever, will climb up there and close it. cristina: let him do it, with a bit of luck he will break his neck. i think cristina accidentally put me in the cc. you know it always surprise me how low and nasty human can be. i was thinking of writing a nasty reply but in the end i only wrote "that's very nice of you, cristina, it's great to hear 1st thing in the morning that someone who shares a flat with me is wishing me dead!" am i pathetic? i should have go slap her in the face or something, hahahahhaha
