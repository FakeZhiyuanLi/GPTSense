i realized that everything i've posted so far is pretty bitter. i'm really not an angry person at all. i just happened to be in a bad mood. i sound like the total opposite of who i really am. not gonna apoligize, because i'm just being me. i just wanted to explain that i normally am a nice, friendly, happy (generally) person. everyone has their days :)
