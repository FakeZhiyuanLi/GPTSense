just got home after a 2-hour session involving grad pics. i actually went all out on this one, justification being that i have been in school 6 years and counting. might as well get the nice package so i can finally prove to one and all that i am a bonafide graduate. :) i did the whole shebang, formal shot, toga shot, sablay shot and one creative creative being capoeira, no surprise there, though i did wear a pair of angel wings. kunwari anghel ako. hehehehe
