what really is depression? whenever i think of it, i think of someone who sits in a dark room and cries all the time contemplating doing bad bad things to themselves. when you're officially depressed, you can't function, am i right? or is depression broader than that? can you be clinically depressed and still be functional? if so, then i think i might be. you see.i've been through a lot of crap in the last 10 months of my life. i'm at a point i'd thought i'd never be and it's becoming really scary. i know i'm strong enough to get through it, but i wonder how long it will last. will my fears and emotions end up crushing my psyche? when does someone get to the point that they seek professional help?
