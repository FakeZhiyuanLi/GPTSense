i've tried this a couple times before but never really got into it. maybe with all my current free time ill be able to maintain this bad boy. its memorial day today, wahoo! i really can't say i know a whole lot about this holiday so i asked my butler jeeves to tell me a little about it. appearently it was originally called decoration day and it was meant to commemorate the people who have died in our nation's militaries. sounds good to me. i don't think i have any relatives that have passed away who were in the service. oddly enough everyone that i know of who has served is still alive. what about you, what do you do on this day? is it just a day off from work or school, or do you actually do some type of annual celebration/family get together type thing?
