hey gang. this is my most recent attempt at keeping some kind of online journal. hopefully it is a tad more successful than the last, and by that i mean that i hope to update this more frequently than the old version. i want this weblog to try to keep a close focus on the evolution of my first movie production "service with a smile", which i hope will begin shooting soon (reading this, rita my dear?). but i won't be surprised if some other aspects of my life find their way in the door to this site. i hope i will not go into rant mode too often. today i'm going downtown with eva. i gotta return a shirt my brother got me for xmas (it's a shade large), and the plan is to go skating after some shopping. say a prayer for me.
