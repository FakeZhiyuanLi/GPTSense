buenos dias, what a beginning. no mails in my inbox, thats one thing which simply spoils my mood. have loads of work to do. these days i am getting this feeling that i am like one of those extras in a play, one who is required to be there but the presence doesnt particularly lend any meaning to the play. i mean it can be anyone doing that part. so my own contribution is insignificant, another person would have done it equally well.dont know lets see when will i get promoted to a more significant role.
