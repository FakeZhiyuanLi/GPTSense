for my beloved cat: in the midst of the bustle, two souls collided. disregarding derision, two souls connected. the joy of empathy once found, soured when one refused to be bound. exquisite pleasure became exquisite pain, yet how a soul yearns for both again. how could the healing ever begin, above the deafening ache loss brings. understanding is lost, a bond goes awry. could it ever be restored before a soul dies? the allure of vast pecuniary gain, brings about a loss previously ordained. what is a heart that is being bled? a product of a liaison gone bad? arose from myriad snowballed events? or simply an organ that continues to rant? the anguish unbearable like the noonday sun. those who care matter not, save one.
