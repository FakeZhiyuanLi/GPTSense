the past three days have been a drag,only a silver lining tough,i actually passed my first test.well,it's not really a legitimate cause for celebration,but,what the heck,i deserve something good out of this.i believe i have settled in class quite well,i have successfully mingled with students around me and although our conversations are not really constructive,i guess its a start.
