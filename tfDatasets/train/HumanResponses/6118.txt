that's 2 weeks in a row, winning from the pole. jeff gordon won from the pole in sonomo and now again in daytona. awesome runs for the hendricks teams. dei still out performed everyone but 2 so they don't need to be down on not winning. that move jr. made near the end three wide pass from the top was one for the history highlight reels. c2 who? only kurt busch got airtime and they still didn't mention the sponsor. lots o' bucks spent by coke to no avail.
