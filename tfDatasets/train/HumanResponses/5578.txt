i was out of the house this afternoon and i came back and on the porch was a box. i knew that it was my router. so i opened it and then found a brand spanking new router sealed in a box. i was purley suprised. i was expecting a white box with the refurbished router inside. wow. i was very happy. i am going to sell it to my dad(if he wants it).
