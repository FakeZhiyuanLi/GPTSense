i fucking dont know what to do. holly left me. she says we dont ever get to see eachother. its not my fault. the stuff that keeps me from seeing her is the stuff thats going to get me into college. i dont even know what to do. i told her it wasnt what i want. im just so. pissed of and sad and . i dont even know what to do. im just so frustrated. screw it. now im just going to focus on my work. im not even gonna bother with anything else. because its not even worth it. she didnt even seem upset by it. whatever. i dont even care. well i do. but whatever. whatever. but as meghan said, everything happenes for a reason, which was verified when i got a 41 directly after it happened. its still shitty though mehh
