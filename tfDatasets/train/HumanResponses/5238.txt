solving puzzles, its always been fun - working with the pieces in my hands. has it always been the easier ones? to the same puzzle - again and again. has anything changed? has it been a few years? already! so set - am i? in my approaches and solutions. so dependent on the same set of tools. are these shackles or is it just me - have i turned into my own enemy?
