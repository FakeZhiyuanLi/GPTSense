first post. first off. firstly, i dislike the term "blog," but i understand that the economics of language are such that frequency trumps aesthetics. i'm pretty sure that anything that ends in "og" conjures up smoky, rhyming images from childhood phonics lessons. dog on a log in the foggy smoggy bog, soggy frog in togs. this will do, i suppose. i'm quite keen on the idea of having a website, and max says that this is a good one.
