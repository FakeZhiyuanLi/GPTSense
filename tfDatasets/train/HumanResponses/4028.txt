i do not know how much updating i will be able to do this week because i'm helping out at a music camp from 8:30-12, going to school 1-6 and doing homework/ getting ready for camp in the evenings, maybe i'll try during my personal computing class again. so how is everyone, what are you up to. shout out to those at lmc this week, brady i hope you did well. congrats stefi! i think that guys should share the remote, coughbriancough instead of making their girlfriends fight them for it! if someone calls shot gun, they sit in the front. poor gracie had a panic attack at six flags today riding the boomerang. when i came home she was nearly drying because she couldn't ride the superman because they were worried it would happen again i talked to her like half an hour ago and she seems sort of out of it. but it is kind of late for her anyway.
