u know what? i think i hate sunday! sunday for me sucks! haha that is becos i will be bored as hell. (but then again, who says hell is bored? haha) anyway sundays @ home usually means staying inside my aircon bedroom either watching tv or surfing the internet (which im doing right now). it's really no life. haha i shld do something ! forget it. we shall see next week whether i still be rotting inside my room. but then again, next sunday i probably chill out with jessie @ sentosa. we shall see.
