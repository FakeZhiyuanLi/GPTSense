ok. so michael calls. he wants to do dinner. is this getting more serious? hmmmm . i'm always sceptical. we all know i don't "do" dates. it's not my style. so i'm getting ready and mark messages me. mark is another boy i've just met. he seems so nice! he's the sweet, kind, gentle, down-to-earth, how about i shower you with gifts type guy. although he's younger, he seems older beyond his years. quite refreshing from the usual brain-numbing morons. mark is churning out the compliments like they're going out of fashion. hmmmm . so i chat to him for a while, then i'm on my way. dinner with michael was great. he's funny. he's cute. still don't know where i stand. but he's invited me out on the weekend. i want to go but he'll be with his friends so i don't want to be a third wheel. always a dilemma. isn't that always the way? i'm happy in my little sex rut. now i have two at the same time and i hate choosing. it's poo. grrrrrrr! i'll keep you posted.
