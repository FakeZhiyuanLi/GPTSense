until now, i haven't been able to think. i sit here aimlessly looking at the sun with my eyes wide open. do i see spots? no, but then again i have been blinded by reality for too long. question everything? i know i did that when i was a child, but somehow i lost that through the years. we all lost that. why do we silently slip away and never wonder anymore? peace
