my life is so screwed up right now. my emotions are play with me too lol. ok i hate school until it really gets goin, and so im not gonna be in a good mood about it, but thats too be expected. band has been taking away so much outta me, my ankle is like in constant pain, but i gotta suck it up lol. and heres the big part. im like all confused about these 2 people that i feel like i cant live without. and natalie knows why, and she cant even help me lol. but its sooo funny cause ive never felt this way and it messes with my brain, cause i try to think of what to do, but i always end up doing the wrong thing when i run it through my mind. i really need some help. and the best advice ive gotten is tell them both how you feel, and go with the one that doesnt laugh in your face. neway ive gotta go read some stuff for english lata.
