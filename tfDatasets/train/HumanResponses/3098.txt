today i had two slices of pizza for breakfast. i really love the food. we went to town and on our way back we stopped at the lucky wok and i had an order of the chicken and broccoli which came with pork fried rice yum! then later on i ate 3 small slices of italian bread fresh from market basket. then for dinner i had 2 mamwiches. they were somewhat filling.
