i was going to dedicate the title of this entry to my mother, but she isn't worthy enough. somehow she convinced my brother she was "just seeing the dog." so yeah, my dog is gone. my brother is only nine, i suppose i can't expect anything else. he doesn't know any better than to fucking love her still. so yeah, i just called her on the phone and harassed her. "what are you talking about ?" i hang up. in english today i found out that my current average for this semester is a 31. :) wohoo. so yeah, i have a lot of work to do tonight, and i'll probably get my average up to about a 50, at a minimum. so i won't fail for the year  woohoo.
