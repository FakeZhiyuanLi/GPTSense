guess what? my boss left the country without 'confirming' with my new status. uh, so i'm technically in the crew, but not quite so. but i know my boss no.2 is being real nice. got a call from him and i actually received something important which i've been complaining about previously! woo hoo! yeah. so i'm still gonna live with my motto, "love my job, hate my colleague."
