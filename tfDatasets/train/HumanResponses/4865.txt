the day started like any normal day. spent quality time with cow shit in the morning and then came home. but when i came home, i had the pleasure of trying to inform the soccer team of our game in de pere that evening. that was an adventure. called 10 people, left messages by all but 3. we ended up cancelling it anyway, thank god. so instead i went in my yard and kicked a ball around for a while just to pass the time because the brewers are in the midst of a horrendous offense stretch. i actually caught adult swim tonight. family guy, futurama, and aqua teen hunger force were all of good quality. so until something interesting happens, everyone who reads this will be forced to be as bored as me. but i'm assuming it'll only be bob. sorry bob. i'll try harder tomorrow. bacon out.
