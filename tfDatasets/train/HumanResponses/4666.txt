first day with my honda dio. couldn't get to kickstart it for nuts. eventually gave up and used the electric start. that worked :) will try kicking it to life this evening. when its running, it purrs beautifully - must say i've taken to it like a fish to water. now i hope it doesn't take to petrol the same way. ;-) sheesh! i just realized i'll have a ball locating it in the parking lot. i forgot to note the registration number. groan!
