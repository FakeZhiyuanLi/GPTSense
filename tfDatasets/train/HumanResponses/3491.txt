i just finished doing dishes. i discovered a while ago that cleaning is easier when you have a vision of how pleasant it is to live in a clean house. every action you take you can see the reality approaching that dream. so you really aren't doing work, you are discovering a dream. i discovered a clean kitchen. very pleasant.
