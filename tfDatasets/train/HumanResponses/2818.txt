tell me if i'm wrong, but aren't kisses suppose to mean something? it did to me, i thought it did to him. i guess i was wrong. he was suppose to come over tonight. he didn't. he never does. gosh, i hate him for messing with my heart like this. i can't take it any more. i think it's over between us. i think it was over the minute he gave me that meaningless kiss.
