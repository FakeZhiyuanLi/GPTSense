yesterday i worked on hats and i bought some nice cream worsted weight for a sweater. i'm not sure what style yet, but, i want it to wear under the poncho i'm working on.(a.k.a. "the beast") if you have any suggestions i would love to hear them. (this thing is huge.)it's 62 inches wide and 32 inches long . it doesn't help much that i'm so fluffy. :) i finally finished the neck so now it's down the back then the trim and it's done. whew!it feels like i have been working on this forever. half done! it's very similar to the free bernat pattern in "family circle easy knitting" fall 2004 issue. when i'm finished it will also have a hoodok, i guess i'm not half done.(it sure felt good to say it though.) i think i better go get busy.
