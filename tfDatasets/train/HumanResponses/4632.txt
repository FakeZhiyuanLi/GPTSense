life is a precious gift. hold on and celebrate life. i was just thinking about how quickly life can end. how life changes with just one call. "mykal? chris. drew's dead. fell asleep.i'm at the hospital.can you come?" "i'm on my way." just last week i had dinner with chris and his partner, drew. they have been together for 8 years. yet, as of last night, drew is no longer here - he fell asleep at the wheel, crashed into the highway divider, and was killed instantly. only a mile from home! hasn't it been said that many of these "falling asleep" accidents occur within three miles of one's home? so, today is a day of memories, tears, anger, consolation, and sorrow. please keep chris in your thoughts and prayers. peace! drew m 1968 - 2004 requiescat in pace
