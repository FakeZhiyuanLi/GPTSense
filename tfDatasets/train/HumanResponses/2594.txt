well, this was bound to happen, but so far no pregnancy. i can feel my cycle approaching and although it's very early in our adventure, i feel somewhat disappointed. i also feel silly since it would really be a stroke of luck if we got pregnant this early into the game, but i still feel some disappointment. i've also learned that two of my friends are pregnant, two whom i'd least suspect. i'm envious of them, but very happy. i can't wait to chat with them about babies. i've been buying needlework patterns to stitch for when my baby comes. some of them are just gorgeous, while others cute. i guess in a way, the time that i'm not pregnant, gives me more time to prepare. still i'm impatient and have been the type of person who would in anticipation for a birthday get sick to her stomach, so i'll have to see how i do with this baby thing. afterall, being sick to one's stomach in this case might be a good sign!
