everything is going better now. gaby came home yesterday and i'm glad because he's part of the reason that stuff is better with me and mikey. we went to his house last night and just being with him like i was made everything feel better like we had started over fresh. there wasnt any pressure it was just us watching a movie. it felt really good. i really hope that jonah can help us out. i'm not sure how thats going to work out though. oh well it will definately be an interesting night wednesday.
