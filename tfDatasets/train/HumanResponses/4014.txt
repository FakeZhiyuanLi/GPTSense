havent posted in a couple of days, not much has happened. however, i am setting up my own web hosting company. gunna be a lot of fun, and hopefully make money. also i'll setup a reselling electronics store, where i sell a warehouses shit to people on my price. people do it all the time and make money at it, so i figured why not, its cheap and may benefit me. just tired now, planning everything out, thats it. ttyl
