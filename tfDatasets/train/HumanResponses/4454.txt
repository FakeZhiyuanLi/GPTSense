hi all, today, i hung out at the montclair swim club with some friends and stuff. it was pretty cool. afterwards, we went out to dinner, or most of us did anyways. we went to eve's hunan on college ave. we ordered kinda sucky food, i think the place just wasn't that good. it's on my bad list for now. also on my bad list, laura, she threw a fortune cookie at me and hit me in the eye. i think i did something to provoke it. i said her fortune wasn't going to come true or something. anyways, we hung out after and lauren gave me a totally unnecessary, but greatly appreciated ride home so she could get a cd i owed her. but still, that puts lauren on my good list. so let's recap: good list: -lauren bad list: -eve's hunan -laura that about sums up the day. so i'll talk to you all later. see ya, jack
