well, i have this craving that i cannot fill. it's called gmail. it's google's new email service that they will be using in the near future. right now they are offering it to oh so lucky, blessed, chosen ones in a beta version. i read that they even offer the random user of blogger and opportunity to join the elite. alas, i am not one of those. i will be checking every day to see if i should be looked kindly upon by the gods of google. oh well, this soldier/net tech-head will have to wait and see. there's always tomorrow. aaron kyle swancey
