now i can easily see that the name for this post seems far worse than the actual reality of it, now that's nothing to worry about. see the point of this "rant" is that this blog is much more effort than i previously thought. it takes a lot of time to think of rants and then a solution to them. now this is blatantly just a rant that i thought of to complain about rants. the answer to this would be to never rant again, and i don't want to not do that. so i cant solve this rant. once again my thoughts confuse me. i'm going camping again on sunday till whenever i don't know. it works out at just over Â£1 for a night so i could be away for a long time. enjoy your weekend, don't go shooting out the back windows of any cars like the bastards around my area do to me, and yeah. whatever enjoy trilby
