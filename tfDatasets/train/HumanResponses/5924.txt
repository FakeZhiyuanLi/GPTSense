is 45 to young to die? to take your life as others wonder why? is 45 long enough to endue the pain of the past? to stay alive for others sake's? is 45 not long enough to wait around and pretend your not in pain? it seems to me that 45 is just right to say goodbye to all the pain as nothing is to gain by staying around to be 46.
