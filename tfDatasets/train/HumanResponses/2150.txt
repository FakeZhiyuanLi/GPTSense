and they rode like it, today. it must have been amazing to see the pack catch the 2 lead riders withing metres of the end. what i am always most struck by are the camera angles and perspectives. when thor won the other day, the camera at street level facing the riders did not show the difference in distance between him and kirchen. you could not really see how fast thor was moving until they showed the replay from overhead. then, you see the distance between kirchen and the pack when they round the last turn, and then the burst of speed that thor put on up that street, to overtake him right in front of the line. very exciting finishes. tomorrow, though, they separate the climbers from the grupetto, as it were. with 9 categorized climbs and the longest stage distance of the tour, i predict we will see some movement at the top. i don't look for lance to go off the front, but he will be reeling in anyone that threatens him, for sure.
