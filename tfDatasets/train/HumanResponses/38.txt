video games rule my life not only have i been obsessing over doom 3 and spending way to much time playing ultima, but the coutner strike source beta has edged in now too. it looks absolutely astounding, theres a video benchmark mode which shows off the best bits of the source engine, and they look good. it even supports surround sound. can't wait to play half-life 2 on it. thing is, cs:source just doesnt look right. i think it's the player skins, they look a little too cartoony, too polished. the ragdoll physics looks a bit out of place too. maybe i just need time to adjust, but overall i felt like i was watching inflitration on the unreal engine. still it is only a beta. it's my last day at aurora today. can't really say i'm sorry as i'm sure most of you know how downhill this place had become so it's probably best that i'll be out of it real soon. still i can't help but worry about the new place
