today the whole sec 2 went to jalan bahtera moe adventure centre. i brought my camping stuffs into my backpack. well i can't really wait to reach the place itself. the first activity my group did was kayaking towards sungei buloh. it was quite fun. at night we have a night walk. the surroundings were quite creepy.
