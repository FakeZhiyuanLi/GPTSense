yeah today was my 8 month anniversary with michelle. yeah we went to the mall. didnt do anything special walked around and got dinner went shopping and yeah. i bought her a tee shirt and jeans and she bought me a cd. (beastie boys- 5boroughs) good cd! and yeah we went to the movies to finish it off. we saw the the bourne supremacy. good movie! the plot wasnt as good as the first but the stunts made up for it. ^_^ so over all the movie was as good as the first. yeah well i realised again today why i am deeply in love with michelle. she is such a good person. she is beautiful, understanding, smart, and more than i can ask for. i know ive said this before but i gladdly call michelle my one and only! and to restate the obvious i love michelle!
