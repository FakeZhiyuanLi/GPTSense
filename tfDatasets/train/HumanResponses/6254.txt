it's nothing much today. but at least i completed something that i'm proud of. i've managed to finish the da vinci code. it's a fantastic book but i have to say it contradicts christanity. notably and claimed as a free thinker but in a way a christian i was quite surpriesed and irked by the way this book depicted christ and about the holy grail. who knows whether it is true or not but i being christian, i'm quite against this ideology that christ was not divine but just pure human. but then this book certainly could cliam its righteous position of #1 international best seller for its great contenta nd suspense. a thumbs up for it. religiously, it's different. by cheif executive of corporate services and ceo of baboon designs corporation (bd. co)
