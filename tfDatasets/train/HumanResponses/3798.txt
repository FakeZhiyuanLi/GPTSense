i watched tom brokow's interview this evening and something stuck out as he was asking all the 'lefts' questions. if there was ever any doubt that many commentators and reporters which deliver our news are liberal a look at their questions should settle the question. here is what i mean. why is it that reporters are always asking president bush and members of his cabinet the questions which democrats are asking? why don't they ask the full range of questions that are available to them? for instance, why is it that the never ask the questions of those who are on the right of the president? is there a rule that the press must always take on the role of the largest adversary? i think they assume the mantle because they wear it so naturally. s.s.
