i finished the baby blanket i'm making for my friends heather and chris. it's the first baby blanket i've made. the baby isn't due until october, so i got it done in plenty of time. i will post pictures of the blanket as soon as i figure out what's wrong with the digital camera. i ordered a bunch of yarn last night. some of it is to make christmas presents, and some of it is to make this scarf for myself that i am completely in love with from the vogue knitting crocheted scarves book.
