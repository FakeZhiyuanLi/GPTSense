ok so i just went shopping with my mom, and i couldn't help but notice that women wearing curlers in public is growing at an alarming rate. what is it with the curlers ladies? are we really in that much of a hurry to get to the store that we can even make ourselves presentable before we go? is it that important to have curls for tonight? shouldn't we at least cover our heads if we must be out and about with the curlers? i saw some poor woman today who'd lost a few curlers in her travels. is she going to be a mess tonight or what? save yourself the trouble ladies - invest in a curling iron for days that, well, you don't feel like running around with plastic cylinders attached to your heads. that's it. thanks for listening. :)
