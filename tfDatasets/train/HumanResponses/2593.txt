i hate people who bitch about thier problems all the time.i just hate that.no one cares what you think.same thing for me. you thing anyone cares what i think?hell no!anyway,i'm at the store looking at video games and cd's and shit like that.then some lady start's bitching at me because i didn't stop her son from doing something. she's like"why didnt you stop my son from throwing thishe is a very troubled young boy!he misbehaves all the time and his dad dosen't pay child support" when she stops bitching i say"he's not my problem so i'm not worrying about it.if you were a good mom you would take care of him and not bitch to other people about your problems.so stop complaining and shut the hell up." she goes away then 3 minutes later,wal mart people tell me to leave the store and i say no.so they go away.nearly got banned all because of her and her damn kid. the lesson:shut the hell up and don't complain.
