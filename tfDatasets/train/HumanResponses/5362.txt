ugh! what an immense waste of time. i knew i was a shoe in for peer ministry at my school, but unfortunately for me, good old head of the sfc and peer ministry program decided to do a points system. of course the problem that lies within this system is that the kids with the best grades, always get in. i do not have the best grades, but i am a good student. i also have a great deal of leadership experience, which many of the kids who were elected to peer ministry, by this nutty points system, do not! this whole week has just been terrible for a litany of reasons. well actually more like the past five days but still. life just seems to suck, well, the life out of me right now. it's really quite disheartening. well, to those peer ministers who deserved to be where they are (and you know who you are), good luck in your endeavors. to those who don't shape up, because you have taken on a serious amount of responsibility.
