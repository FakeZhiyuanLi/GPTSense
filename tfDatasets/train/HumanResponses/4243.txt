why are there cows roaming the street? just this morning, while heading for school. heading for school? on a weekend? yes, adam. i'm at school. my head was just pounded flat by questions involving inverse hyperbolic functions. happy now? maybe. now, back to the cows. you live near an agricultural area. isn't that reason enough? then why are the cows roaming around ? shouldn't they have a pen or something?
