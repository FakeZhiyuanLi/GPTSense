the web was created so that computers can connect to one another without a central point, a web of computers that can stand alone yet each is no more important than the next and is only part of the bigger picture. its value as a whole becoming exponentially higher with each additional computer connected to it. in retrospect, friendster is similar to the web. it is 'connecting' at its best. its true value being realized more and more as your network of friends grow. i joined friendster a while back, but never really got into it. about a week ago, with the urging of my cousin, i finally decided to work on it. what i got was a lil bit more than what i had bargained for. with each old friend i found and successfully added to my network, i became more and more driven to increase my network. one friend might seem trivial to add, but collect all those trivial additions, suddenly you have a network of friends that span years and multiple countries. just like the web. i am addicted to it!
