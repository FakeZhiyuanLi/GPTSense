danny was back. he has been off ill for the last two days. he said he has been thinking about me, and we talked all through lunchtime sitting on fag bank (a grass verge where all the smokers go because the teachers can't see it from the school). he was smoking when i got there, but he knows i don't like it so he stopped. it was sunny and so chilled out. then after school, he ran down to my bus queue and pulled me round the corner, gave me a quick kiss, then ran off to get his lift home.
