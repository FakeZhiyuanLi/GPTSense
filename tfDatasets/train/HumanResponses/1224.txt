well, here i am with a new blog. i figured that most other knitters seem to have them these days, and i might as well jump on the bandwagon. also, my "normal" (i.e. non-knitting) friends were getting a bit annoyed by my constant knitting talk in my regular blog. now i can talk about knitting to my heart's content, and no one can stop me mwahahahah! i will be trying to figure out how to change things. i know next to nothing about html. i don't even know how to insert a picture into a post. i hope to have that figured out soon. oh, well, done with this entry. i will try to have more intresting things to talk about next time.
