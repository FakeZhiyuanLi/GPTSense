here i am. i just wanna explain today my situation right now. i think that this summer may be the borest summer that i have ever had. i´d like to flyin' away from spain to.los angeles or miami where i can speak "my english" and make it better (but i don´t really mind the place while it was away from spain). don´t be afraid! i love spain but i am all the year here and i like change my way, u no. so, the problem is that i have no money and i can´t spend the holidays that i was thinkin' in. by the way, here in spain i can spend a gr8 summer but at north(where i live) the sun doesn´t appear for ages! (almost it seems) and i can´t go to the beach and do sun bathin' :( sniff sniff as u see, this could be the borest summer holiday i have ever had.but i must wait until september to check if it was. so, wot do u think about this send me ur comments pd: scuse my english ;d
