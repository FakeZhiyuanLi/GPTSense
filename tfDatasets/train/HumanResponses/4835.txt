guys, come on! are you just being indecisive or what's going on? i've proposed a chance for all of us to hang out for a weekend, and nobody has made a peep about it. are you forgetting that we haven't seen each other in almost two years? let's go to lebowski fest and have a freaking good time! i should've known better not to expect an rsvp for lebowski 6.19, since i never even got one when you were in my wedding.
