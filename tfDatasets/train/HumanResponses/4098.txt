well today started off great. woken up at 5:30am with a nasty thunderstorm. it was hitting right outside the house. alarm went of at 6:30am. well today is my late day at work and the wife has to get up first. she didn't want to get up. she decided to stay home cause she was tired. well it didn't help she kept us up to after 11 last night. oh well. must be nice to be able to just stay home. tonight i am helping nick do the oil changes in his car. that will be fun. work on 2 vehs that i haven't before. makes it more interesting at least. softball is almost over. 4 games to go unless for some unknown reason we make it to the playoffs. now that will be wild. i really want to play longer. guess i will have to find a fall league.
