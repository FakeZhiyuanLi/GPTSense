yeah, so i wanted to get a job since mid-july, but my dad finds some weird ideal where i need to be in something for school from my freshman year to my junior year. i don't get it, and i actually didn't have a headache before he told me and the day was going pretty good, but he just comes out and says dumbass bullshit and makes me try to find reasoning behind it, and i begin to get a headache and it gets the point where i don't want to think anymore. man, my dad is fucking loser, and he probably wishes i would just start running or something, that's why he's doing this. i don't think my dad really understands me at all, and he thinks i do drugs and am irresponsible and immature for some reason. well, that's all, i'm done.
