i've been trying to update this blog for awhile, but i couldn't actually type in the text box! i don't think camino likes blogger. anyway, here are the long awaited pictures. my first attempt at intarsia. i want to make my future sister-in-law a scarf with an airplane on it because she is going to be a pilot. but this is too wide to be a scarf. i finally made some hats. the orange one is for the fiance. orange is his favorite color. i hate orange . . this is for my little sister. the color is off in this picture. the blue is really sage green. here's the baby blanket i made for heather and chris. they came over last week, and i gave it to them. they seemed to really like it.
