well i did have to pay for that bike trip cause 3 weeks before i broke my wrist. that was bull i had to stay at home. but the worst part was that i lost all the musle in my arm. so one is all big and toned and the other looks like a womans arm and that just sucks. but i still get to go on my trip to scott afb
