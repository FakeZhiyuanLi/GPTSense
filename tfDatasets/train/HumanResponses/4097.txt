well we finally won a close softball game against the number one team saturday. 11-10. it took i think 10 innings. normally softball is 7. we kept tying the game. made for a great game. i had close games. always gets you going, lol. it was a fun time. nick, merrie and baby alex made it, so that was great to have them there to see that. my uncle ed from nj was up and made it there as well. it was good game and great to have butts in the stand. 3 more games and the season is over unless we can sneak into the playoffs. that would be great but i am not counting on it yet. we are 6-9. i would like to finish at .500 but we will see.
