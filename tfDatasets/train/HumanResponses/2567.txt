well, it is now monday, and not only did i not work on my novel, but i did not finish my assignment by thursday. it seems that my vacation did not attract my muse, afterall. on the plus side, i did make it to the library, to do my research for one of my programming projects. i did not get the answer that i was hoping for (although it was the answer that i expected). at least i know how i will be proceding from here.
