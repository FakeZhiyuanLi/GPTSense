happy 39 the singapore!the parade was great,but it seems like deja vu as it was almost a carbon copy of last year's national day celebration.but hey,i ain't complaining.although i only criticism would be that singapore should roll out its impressive display of armoured tanks and vehicles,just to evoke some kind of security and patriotism amongst sinaporeans.the russians and chinese are famous for their grandiose display of weapons so that would be aggressors will think two before confronting them.
