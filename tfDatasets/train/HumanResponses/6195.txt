last night i had a really bad dream. it seemed so real; i literally was crying when i woke up! i was in this wierd house, old style, and me and people i have never seen before, but in the dream i was very familar to, were hiding from strange persons. it was scary. the "bad guys" were going to test bug chemicals(funny but not) on us, if they found us. we hid in an attic type place. spiderwebs and all. it was so real. i was hiding for my life. we saw them catch family and friends. i told them that i thought that if i showed myself, then it would give everyone else i chance to escape. this all sounds funny, but it wasnt. it really made me think about my freedom! i never have to worry about dieing or someone comeing after me! and i dont have to hide from anything! ever! so i guess i just wanted to tell everyone out there that i am very thankful that i am free! amen!
