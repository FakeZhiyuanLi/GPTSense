in athens, we visited the market which was mostly a meat market and the smell was absolutely appalling. a butcher pulled me aside so we could have a picture together with his pig. we had lunch in a small place within the market where the smell continued to waft in and i had no appetite from all the sites and sounds. before i knew it, a 40-something man there was asking dr. romanos permission to ‘caress’ me so he bought us all wine and chicken and when we were leaving he handed me a dead fish, fully intact. i did not know what to do with it. his counterpart, who took our picture with his photo phone, had a toupee that was so warn it actually had a significant bald spot. we wanted to visit the archaeological sites on sunday, but it was voting day and everything was closed but the huge flea market which was neat. monday we visited the acropolis and the agora and managed to go shopping – much better than ohio shopping.
