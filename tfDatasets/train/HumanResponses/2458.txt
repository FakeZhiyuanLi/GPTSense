the beachi should be going in about an hour or so. lisa and her mom are so nice for letting me go-i'm really looking forward to it. i miss her so much. last night, we got a call at about 11:00-it was my brother.drunk. ugh. i'm so sick of him being stupid about it. it's one thing to do that, it's another to get yourelf caught. so i had to drive my mom to some kids house and we pulled him out of the couch, brought him in the car, and when we got home, he passed out on the couch. he doesn't remember a thing. all i know is that his life is going to really suck nowsort of. my parents are used to this kind of thing. i bet he was embarrased though. i felt bad doing it. somethings missing right now-but as a whole, i'm feeling really good. things are going great.and as far as i know, i couldn't be happier.
