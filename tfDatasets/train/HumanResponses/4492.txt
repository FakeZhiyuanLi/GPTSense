we went to harold park today, to feed the ducks some bread that we had left over. me, mum, troy, debbie and brandon. so.we got there, and there was this dog with a ball, she went to debbie, and dropped the ball at her feet, so debbie threw it for her, and she caught it and came back, so i had a go. we found out that the dog was called misty, i loved that dog, she was so cute! misty's owner had another dog called burny, he was cute too, and then their owner threw misty's ball in the lake, and misty swam after it, but then dropped it when she was near the edge, so i had to get myself wet and get it back for her. but then, troy got attacked on the way out of the park by a large alsation. he went for troy's neck! and at first, the owner did nothing, and mum had to pick troy up to get him out of the way. that was just.horrible. hopefully, tomorrow won't end like that.
