u know usually my thoughts r on myself and ways to get laid but for once there has been something else on my mind.(actually i should say someone else). i'm sure u like 2 ppl who actualy read this thing know who im talking about. d'mari. well its all my fault that all this stuff is happening to her. it is also my fault that her and hunter broke up. and its all because i couldn't see passed what i wanted. but now all i want is for her to be happy even if it is without me so here u go ppl. my thought for the day.
