i love ashleigh, i havn't updated in a while. so here it is. ashleigh is the greatest, and i would do anything for her. umm. today i woke up at like 10:30am so i missed ashleigh buy a bit ;). i spent the night before last night at ashleigh's grandparents house, while they were house sitting :d. when i got back i went to ashleigh's house and we watched a movie, she fell asleep and then her mom gave me a ride home. at 2:30 in the morning. well i didn't do anything terribly important today. lovingly loving you, ~sean
