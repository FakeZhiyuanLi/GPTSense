jesus gave all. so what can i give? jesus was willing to sacrifice himself so that we might live. so how much am i willing to give? could i give up what i want? so. it remains to be seen. the struggle is within me. could i devote my entire life to him with no holds barred? or will my desire for earthly things win out? many times, it is not so much a struggle with supernatural evil as it is a struggle with our human nature. selfishness. laziness. weakness. rule me, oh god. take away my selfishness and laziness. make me complete in my weakness. god.
