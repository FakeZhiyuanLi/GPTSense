films that are based on age-old classics truly are magical, even if the story is nothing like the original. take, for say, [confessions of an ugly stepsister], which was just shown on television. cinderella is 'clara', and her two stepsisters are actually nice people! clara's not so obedient after all. in the beginning, clara thought that her fairy godmother was a witch (she had a black cloak on)! oh, and clara's father is alive, too. one of clara's stepsisters, (ruth) is a bit dumb. the other (iris) is very much intelligent and quite an artist at that! the stepmother's still a horrible person.
