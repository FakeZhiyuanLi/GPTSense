hahaha. yes, it is gay. gayer than a vicar. and everyone knows those mofos be gay, yo. the day after tomorrow. that is another thing that is gay. that film was gay. big brother is also gay. especially this year, when the house is so gay, i swear if you turn the volume up, you can actually hear the hiv viruses (virii?) rattling their happy way about their hosts' gay little bloodstreams. this was a gay message. you are gay.
