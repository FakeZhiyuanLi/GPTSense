so yesterday we had a geography test which went totally better than i thought! it was soooooooo easy! maybe cuz i studied haha but then in the afternoon we continued with the test because we didn't get finished in the morning and we had a supply teacher so everyone was like "what's the answer for this?!" it was hilarious. but of course i didn't do that -shifty eyes- so total sweetness here cuz there's 11 days left of school work! yay! and grad's on the 23rd (i think i said that  before ) and so yeah. :d i'm all hpyer and stuff all the time cuz i'm so excited. yep so that's all. later dudes
