it has been awhile since i updated this blog. since school started, i haven't had much time and i kind of forgot about blogger. but i hope to update it on a regular basis now. probably not every day, but hopefully at least a once or a few times a week. please try to look back every few days (if you care at all). i might have interesting and fun facts. or maybe i'll post my blog on my new website i'm building. it'll have a brand new, clean, crisp, organized interface. well, it is a school night, so i better go.
