within a week i found myself twice in a little discussion about differences between msuic from the 60s/70s and even 80s and music nowadays. we wondered if today musicians are still making legendary music, like led zeppelin did. the sad conclusion of most people was that the answer must be no but i don't want to be so pessimistic! yes the record industry decides/d which musicians make it and who don't for a great deal at least, but somewhere on this planet there must be musicians that 'invent' new music, something we've never heard before. do you know any? where can we find them? where do they hide?(they must have a website or something like that?)
