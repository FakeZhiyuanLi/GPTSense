3 things: * i saw "the village" let's just say. actually, i don't know what to say about it! good (story wise)/ bad (if you had high expectations on how scary it would be) only watch it if you like a movie with a good story, love/romance, comedy, thriller, adventure, costumes, drama, serious talking , and skinned animals! * god works in mysterious ways. last night, he got me a double chocolate chip frappuccino with blended cream from starbucks! * hate: preventable mishap/ what happens after. cleaning up the mess! >: (
