the title isn't as catchy as "the joy of cooking," but it is a fairly accurate. i got my septum punched last night to a 0 gauge. it didn't hurt near as bad as you might think. for a few seconds i thought i was stupid, but now i really enjoy it. it doesn't hurt at all hardly. it feels like i have a rock for the end of my nose. i keep getting worried that it is plainly visible. it's not but i'm paranoid. this type of thing would probably not go over well here at the office. i hate being a "grown-up." back to the salt mines.
