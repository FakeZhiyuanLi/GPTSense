today i went to church at 9:00, and that was un eventful. nicholas gave me a ride there, so that was cool. i have a new found respect for him; regardless of how fricken retarded he can act, he's hella-smart and we share the same views on alot of the same subjects. there was a bouncy house that the church rented! it rawkded! i felt all fat and sluggish when i couldnt get up the slide part the first time, but i took off the socks and bam (sound effects were actually there this time) i could do it! joy! so that was cool. wurk is wurk. so meh. im gonna buy a ps2 next week hopefully wif my monies frum teh wurk! then an xbox so i can buy halo and halo2! (when h2 does come out)  i think i have projects i didnt do due tomorrow. wow! i bet that was almost semi-difficult to understand! byebye!
