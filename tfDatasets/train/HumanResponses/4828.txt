i spent the extended weekend moving katie back to lovely olean, ny. she will reside among a plethora of white trash americans, including hapless single mothers, and toothless wonders who cruise the pot-holed streets in their 1980's camaros (sorry deirdre). in years past, katie and i ventured into the mountains via escort wagon to indulge in various pleasures. a particular pleasure that comes to mindcounting "dead" or otherwise nonfunctioning motor vehicles. simply put, we count the number of decommissioned vehicles adorning front lawns of residences city-wide. anyways, the weekend was interesting. katie and i also spent the evening at the holiday inn hotel in hamburg, ny. nothing struck me as particularly interesting in hamburg, ny. i ate breakfast on the beach of lake erie sunday morning. i partied on the fish's porch with ginny, corey, maggie, etc. most importantly, i had the opportunity to spend precious time with my beautiful girlfriend katie.
