i hate that feeling of 'just floating in the air'. uncertainty prevails. is my string still at hand's reach in order for me to be pulled back to ground? on the side. i'm reading "blindness" by jose saramago. i've already read it in the original language, now i'm reading the english version. reason? simple: does the translation do it justice? is the story as captivating in another language? so far, yes! highly recommended novel by everyone that has read it. just a quick note: armani mania, also recommended to the boys out there.
