i love my roomate. don't think for one second i don't. but sometimes it's hard living with yourself. you see all the shit thats bad about you in them. like we constantly steal each others clothes and stuff and then get mad at each other for it. but how can i get mad at her for taking my belt when i stole her headband? i also wish i was a better poet. i also wish i could get with a certain barista. i also wish i could get with a lot of people i'm not getting with right now. i wonder if anyone is going to read this. i wonder if i'll be better at keeping a blog then i am a real journal. probably not. love renee
