the united live concert on saturday night was pretty cool. they were selling stuff there, and i bought a wristband! now i'm so cool. the church world-wide is getting a revelation that there is a new song to sing. it's bringing the church together, bringing unity among denominations, life and relevance to churches. people are turning their hearts to god, their focus is being renewed and they are realizing that we were created to worship god."â€”reuben morgan of united there's a picture i took of it, not very good quality though, it was kinda dark in there. and i took it with my cell phone.
