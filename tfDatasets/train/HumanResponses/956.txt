well, i've never done a "blog" before so you'll have to grade me on a curve. today was another fun visit to the dentist. turns out, that tooth #27 (yes, it's that specific) needed a root canal. to really be able to focus on that particular tooth, my dentist found it neccesary to use a dental dam. all i could think of was sex ed. in high school talking about dental dams for oral sex. if anyone i was with pulled out a dental dam, i wouldn't be able to run away fast enough. my day was quite uneventful otherwise. other news: i am missing someone that is very important in my life. recently, i had to "restrict" a friendship with someone i care deeply about because her fiance isn't such a big fan of me. it really sucks but i know that things will work out for the best and that nothing is impossible :) until next time, god bless and good night.
