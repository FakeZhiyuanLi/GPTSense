summer vacation has barley started and already i'm bored. i should be studing my music for band, but i'm not in the mood. (which means i'll never get memorized.) not much to say because not much has happened. no one to talk to,and there's no where to go. well there is but no where i can get to. i wish i was old enough to drive, o wouldn't that be nice! well i think i'll go read, good bye!
