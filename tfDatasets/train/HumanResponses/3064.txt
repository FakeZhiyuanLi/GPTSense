i hate saturdays because there is almost nothing to watch on tv, even on cable. my hunny went to apple valley today to help his best friend move. i stayed home. i have been incredibly bored since 10:00 am. i hope he comes home soon so we can go get some desert. we made a deal, i stay home, he goes by himself, and when he gets home he takes me out to go get a piece of pie from bakers square. i hope they have strawberry rubarb. i can only seem to find it in hillbillie towns, but i will cross my fingers and hope. i am also hoping on lemon cream. it is hard to find a good piece of pie these days.
