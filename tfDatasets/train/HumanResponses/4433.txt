i miss whats gone it hits me now alone and forlorn it never mattered somehow out with the old in with the new clichedoverrated leaves me without a clue where do i go what will i be if i had some idea abt wats in store for me if i had an idea something to hold on to something that wudn't go away something as familiar as you u will be gone so will the rest leave me with the memories some of the best leave me with the days leave me with the nights the moments shared the laughter the fights gave me all u had now give me all u've got it isn't long before our footprints in the sand will be washed awayalone.forgot
