i just finished reading 1984 , by george orwell. as usual for me, it was hard to put the book down after i started reading it this morning. i would call the day wasted, but it's summer and it was a good book. now i can sleep, as long as i make sure i don't mumble "down with big brother!" in my sleep loud enough that the telescreen can pick it up.
