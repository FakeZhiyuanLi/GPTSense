what should i do what should i say does he like me or does he just think i'm ok? how do i know because its really hard to tell i feel like i should go into a shell. its really starting to annoy me now how he could just sit there like he's thinkin the same thing. the phone starts to ring should i pick it up or act like i don't notice anything. do i look ok do i need to freshin up. i think i should act like i'm ok or do i need to say hey should i tell him. but what if he don't feel the same way. i guess i'll never tell and crawl back into my fuckin shell.
