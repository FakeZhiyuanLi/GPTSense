i couldn't think of a better title. things are going pretty tickety-boo at the moment. i mean, the '2' on my mobile phone broke, and my courtesy mobile has been blacklisted; bt has been really out of sorts, possibly because he has a hairball lodged in his throat; and ed's away, but i'm feeling rather emotionally sprightly. i've been tidying my room up a bit, coming up with big plans for oddblog. i had some weird dreams this morning, but i can't think what they are. some probably had to do with next year and what it'll be like. actually, the night before last i got into two massive msn convos - you know the ones, where some bone-head (usually ben) invites hoardes of peeps who you don't know for some kind of nerdy kick. in the second one i met a couple of gays from the west country/wales, so i kind of got into that mood - with people from school like ben and dave still in the convo. i think next year i'm definitely going to be outed.
