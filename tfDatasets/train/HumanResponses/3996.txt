i saw a 747sp take off today from twenty feet away. i had a ringside seat; the wings drooped with fuel weight until they picked up speed and flexed and lifted that aerodynamic impossibility off the ground. i grin as i realize very few people would know that a 747 with rolls royce engines is odd. a bigger grin surfaces when i realize that most people wouldn't know it was a 747, sp or no sp. that's what today was all about.
