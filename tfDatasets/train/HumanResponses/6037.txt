got up, went into town, met two friends who i haven't seen for months. had a great laugh with them. got stopped in the street by an old man who stood there pointing at me and shouting "your a punk!" :/ yes old man, i'm a punk. lol. ran into 2 girls from my school(one of whom, once threatened to stab me.)a grand total of 8 times, if i didn't know that they hate me i would have said they were stalking me, although they probably thought the same about me. missed the train home, stood in the freezing station for ages. got home and had a nice conversation with a nice-sounding random (a friend of a friend of a friend(don't ask.)) hmm.wonder what interesting things will happen tomorrow.
