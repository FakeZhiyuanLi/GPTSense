june 19, 2004 2:19pm current mood: frustrated, stressed have you ever been mad at someone that you don't want to be mad at? i hate being angry with the ones i love. it's something i can't help and it annoys me more than anything. my mood swings. the smarter part of me always goes "kara, quit that. you know you love them. no reason to be angry" and then the angry part of me is like "cut off all ties! you don't need this shit! this is what you've trained yourself to do!" -_- *slaps self* maybe it'll finally all end when i get finished with this move. i'll be able to blow off some steam later this afternoon when we go horseback riding. it's been so long. i need to have an equine underneath me again, it's like, the only place that seems right for me. when i'm riding, or when i'm with horses, the puzzle seems to finally fit and everything else vanishes. god, i've needed this for so long.
