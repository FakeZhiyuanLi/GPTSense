the rigors of professional blogging are not well documented. long hours spent thinking of something meaningful to say, the endless typing, the yearning to be heard above the incessant and mindless media chatter. but hey, thats why we expect to get the big bucks. after much thought i have an interesting question to pose - who are the people that actually read blogs ?
