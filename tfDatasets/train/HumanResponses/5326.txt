so i started off my monday just like everyone elsestaff meetings checking emails andnegotiating the price and schedule of my ow personal cook and cleaner for the month! rock on. for the low price of $60 a month (which is all i will be here for) i get a lady to clean and cook for me. plus the price of groceries, which for this week is only $15! i knew this no-profit lifestyle would finally reward me. my laundry lady only charges me $5 a day to clean my clothes - no matter how much or how little there is to clean. any one want to send there laundry my way ok - i must get back to work. at least writing this blog makes me appear busy:) email me folks - i am getting a bit homesick :-(
