my last few days in perth have been a bit of a rollercoaster ride. not only had i been having some pretty horrible nights sleep, but friends kept on turning up at my door and reminding me why i really wanted to stay in perth. so, inbetween bouts of nervousness characterised by the feeling that a giant hand was crushing my stomach, and hyperactivity that made whoever witness them wish i was gone already, i have managed to fit in a few sobs and tears. all round a good last few days.
