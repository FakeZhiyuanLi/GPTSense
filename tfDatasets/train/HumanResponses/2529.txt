i'm so pissed for 1,000's of reasons but i think i'll just write about the least important ones. first off: virgin records sucks serious butt. they don't carry the jinxed cd called beyond the obvious or any fall out boy stuff, so now i have to pay $40.00 to order each specially. it's not my fault that all the best bands are signed to small record labels and are not particularly popular, so why do i have to pay extra because of it? life sucks. anywho, tomorrow is grad. i should probably go off and waste my time removing my turquoise nail polish, but i'd really rather not.
