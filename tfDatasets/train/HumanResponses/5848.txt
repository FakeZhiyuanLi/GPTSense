yeah, i thought i was okay with the fact that i'm working this receptionist job and doing design for them sometimes when they need it, but today i realized how much they don't appreciate the crisp attractive designs i'm putting out for them. no, i take that back. two agents do, they keep coming back for more and are more and more excited each time, but the ones at the other office, for whatever reason, come to me cuz they hear good things and then go behind my back asking the other receptionist with no design skills to do it over again, or make any changes on my designs why why do people insist on liking gross designs? i get sick at the sight of poor designs, and boy are her flyers poorly designed. may sound mean but just proves that i'm in it for real design or something. right? hehe
