i've just started writing yet another fanfiction. i'm clueless as to what to name it for the moment, it's a harry potter story. harry's not invited to stay with the weasleys, because of the newts, so mrs weasley won't let ron play over the summer holidays (harry's in his 7th year). so harry leaves the dursleys early, and takes the knight bus to diagon alley. nothing about voldemort in this, but there's gonna be something about draco malfoy. second chapter still in production. this fanfic's gonna be a really long one, almost like a novel!
