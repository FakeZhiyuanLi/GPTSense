yes i managed to get myself a gmail account. i am so excited. after two full days of searching, i finally bought one off of ebay for $45. if you ask me it is money well spent. the way i look at it is this, if i get an invitation i can just sell it on ebay and make my money back. i am so excited to have 1 gb of memory. i have been telling everyone that i know, they are all like, "what is a gmail account?" oh, the unlightened. it is kind of funny because i keep checking it over and over in hopes that i will have email, the only problem is that only like 5 people know my address, so i have not gotten any mail yet, but i am still excited about it. i think that everyone should have a gmail account.
