the most surreal sunday ever - played 3 sets with 2 different bands today, both outside. it absolutely pissed with rain. i mean, god opened his bladder and fucking slashed his load all over us. we were under (a very small and technically inadequte) cover so all the power leads and stuff got drenched (thank fuck for plastic coating!), but the show had to go on! it's very strange playing in the middle of a hail storm, and there were actually people standing under umbreallas watching us (bless em!) but, we got paid, my pedal board got broken by a clumsy singer (bloody divas!) and we went down really well, so there you go. not all bad. oh and sandwich of the day - sausage and ketchup from the bbq when it wasn't raining. very tasty.
