infatable truth searing black flames licking at the toes of my past. suckling tasting teasing, it infects my most intimate thoughts. my eyes fill with dry painful tears for the lost unfortunate believers. memories gently beat me into submission as i curse reality. i deny the facts and preach the only significant truth. but does it fall on deaf uncaring ears? take off your mask. let me see your naked inner child. could you survive without your lies? twist and contort the pain into a comfortable sedated numb with the doctors love. we must all realize and endure the rancid stench of mortal truths. as my pen confides in the paper i still refuse the terms of reality. revealing my raw emotions and weaknesses to myself the mirror becomes a window of turbulent embrace. can the injustices be exposed in time or are we destined to live in societies forgotten cage. rotting in our own innocence. a killer walks among us while you cheer the victory of the mislead masses. where do you fit in?
