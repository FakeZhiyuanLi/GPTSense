i'm at work, working on a project. it was supposed to be done by 3 this afternoon, but that didn't happen. my boss won't be mad though because it was kinda the client's fault that i haven't had much time to do it. . . anyway, it's not working, and i'm frustrated. and i don't know what to do because i've tried everything to make it work. ugh.
