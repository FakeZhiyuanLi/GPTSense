it's difficlut to continue to work like normal now that we know were being closed down. i go into the office everyday knowing that it is one less day that i have a job. management keeps telling us that nothing has changed, and that we need to continue to work hard. thats easier said then done. yes we need to keep working hard, however the desire to go the extra mile is now gone.
