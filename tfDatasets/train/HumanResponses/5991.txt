hey. finally, i get around to having my own blog. these things take me a while. from thought to action.eventually. that's me. lets see how long i keep this up. today i feel rough. i may have given myself food-poisoning. tomorrow i have to be up at 5am, to see someone off at the airport. i should sleep now, but i wont. i'll hang around on here for a while, and watch some tv and read some mags, and then i'll drift off to sleep and i'll get 2 hours sleep and in the morning i'll look like shit. i don't like sleep. i always feel like i'm missing something. sleep is what i do when i want to get away, when it all gets too much, so to do it on a regular day seems wrong. but until they figure out a way for me to do without sleep, i'll do it my way, and i'll look like shit. so what.
