first period is rediculously boring right now. we're talking about blogs.how ironic. i thought this class would be fun and easy, don't get me wrong, sitting down and doing nothing isn't too hard, but it sure isn't entertaining. did i mention this is boring? o well, i had some donuts this morning so i guess it's all good. can't wait for something eventful to happen for me to post.
