caare-group was great on friday. i really enjoy our group. good fellowship, good conversations. i can't wait until we go to the lake together. it'll be good to relax together! the girls are awesome! most of us have known eachother for years and years and that helps make it a really laid back group. in the pix is brittany, judi, jess beth, lauren, me, kristie and karyn. i love those girls! he he
