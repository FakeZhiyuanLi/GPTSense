had a horrible physics exam but whats done is done, cant change now. recently a bunch of us started up a limbo radio station, and its soo coool. we got about 5 dj's lined up and its great. i did a bit of djing using the mic and a few songs, but once everything gets worked out it will be a lot of fun. only 2 more exams then i am finished, should be good. hp3 should be good tonite, i am really looking forward to it, im also looking forward to see my bev again, becasue i dont know where she is lol. mom and her went flower shopping 3 hours ago and they were suppose to be back. if anyone wants to go to the radio station go to holletts blog (link below) and click on his link for the mylimbo radio, and it will tell you how to get it to work. in the next fews weeks things shall be different, but in a good way.
