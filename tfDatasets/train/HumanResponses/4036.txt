i hesitated before getting a blog. i don't like the sound of it. "blog." not much good rhymes with it. but more importantly, i know someone who writes a livejournal, and he's got some real problems. he likes to use his livejournal to tell folks what he buys at the supermarket. that's not that interesting. it's a little interesting, because he buys a lot of food, but really not all that interesting. i think you have to be a little arrogant to start one. who cares about what you think, unless you are macauley culkin? maybe it's just important to be entertaining and not take yourself too seriously. all i know is that i need a distraction from work.
