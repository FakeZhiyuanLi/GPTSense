my home computer has been out of commission since saturday afternoon when my apartment was struck by lightning. image: me in my baby pink pajamas, pink yankees visor on slightly sideways, dancing with my roommate's cocker spaniel puppy to lil' kim's "how many licks," when suddenly we hear the absolute loudest crash ever. pan left to window where an actual lightning bolt is visible. it would be hard to tell whether my screaming and jumping around were part of my reaction to the lightning or the song. i think i scared the dog more than the lightning bolt did. anyway, apparently my surge protector didn't do its job properly. i'm not sure what scared me more; the freakish six-inch-wide bolt of white energy three inches away from my bedroom window, or the fact that i now have no way to post on my blog from home.
