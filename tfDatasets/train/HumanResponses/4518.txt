i've been sitting here thinking about what i could do today. prom is today, and everyone is busy doing that, and since i am not going, i am stuck here hoping to at least go to a party or something. i thought about going to kurt's but i don't know if he is still on that because of stuff that has been going on the past few days for him. as for me, i wish, now that i could have went to prom, but there is only one person that i wanted to take, and she is with someone now. doesn't that always happen. maybe i should go to the races again, but it is raining now. wouldnt that be my luck. i can not catch a break in anything. one day, something might come together for me, but it is not this day.
