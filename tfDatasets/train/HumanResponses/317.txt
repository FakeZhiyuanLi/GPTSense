have an old clamshell ibook that i found on consignment. works pretty well. it was cheaper than what was being sold on ebay and those were slower models. added more memory so could upgrade os. now runs panther decently. added a bunch of games that i just trashed tonight to make more room on the hard drive (only has 10 gigs). also am trying to find replacement products for the microsoft products on it. took off office and installed openoffice. use netscape and safari instead of ie. not exactly su re why i'm doing it though. it risks screwing up my computer, but i find it a fun experiment. i am such a mac geek.m
