actually i had a dream. last night. i was organising a birthday party and i decided to get led zeppelin to play at the party. wut? yes led zeppelin. so i sent them a letter asking if they were up for a gig in belgium. the next week those buggers show up at my door, all of them. just to tell me they were interested but they charge 150.000 dollars per concert. wut? yes 150.000 dollars. that pretty much ruined my dream. then i woke up with a dry mouth and smog in my head.
