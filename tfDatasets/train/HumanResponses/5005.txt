skin deep what is love when barely there and i can stare straight through do you know what to do when so shatters your heart you dart and dash around any truth to set you loose rend your heart of all the dark and let ignite the living spark how hard is it to guard against all you know are lies cries out from the pit, lord of the flies, his trickery dies in one done to him all we do because he is the one life is through knew it inherently but blew it away like feathers from his wing oh to sing when saved from the eternal grave of spirits hear it, loud and clear, but fear it not for he is love dove wings flap and then you leave behind all that is divine find him where he was all along and sing for him a song!
