i came home today at around… 9:30 pm. we had a group project. we interviewed an entrepreneur. i tried a construction worker’s hat afterwards. when i took it off, my friends started laughing because my forehead suddenly became dusty! haha =p it was fun. we rode a ford ranger(courtesy of beat). as one of the leaders of the group, i did a lot of things. it was laborious. i learned that even though there are factors that hinder you from attaining your goals… you should never give up… life is about taking risks… and i will take em’… anytime… anywhere. i don’t want to have regrets. i don’t care if i commit mistakes because you will indisputably increase your knowledge from it. it is where you will be able to learn by yourself. toil and endure is what it takes. you have to persist until you succeed.
