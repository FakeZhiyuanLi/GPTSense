hey guys sorry didnt get to post yesterday. well today went ok. besides my paws teacher saying to come see her tommrow morning for something i have no clue what, my history teacher get mad at me for answering too many questions, and a kid dropping my ipod in math. you so just want this day to be over. then tonight i had to study for my history test which should be a cake walk, and my geometry test which should be ok. i also had to finish my german project because my partner never got online like he said he would. winmx is ok. downloaded it last night but its just a thing to hold me over until someone gets another p2p system up. got some songs off there to put on my scratched ipod >:(. well tommrow is another day. i just wish i know what my paws teacher wants. really not that happy about being left in the dark about anything. well bye bye.
