i meet a guy about a week ago that seemed to be okay. but lately i have been spending a lot of time with him and i think that i have found a keeper. he is the most sweetest guy that i have meet in tallahassee. i fought to tell you his name is dwight or d.j. for short. we have been having so much fun this week, that i forgot all about all of the other guys that i meet and i want to be with him. we laugh about everything and the most important thing is that he is honest. i really need someone like that in my life. this weekend we are going to west palm beach, fl to visit my friend zeanique because she got in a accident and he is going to visit my family. this is a big step for me because nobody has been home with me since anthony(me ex-boyfriend). so as you can imagine i am very scared. i hope that this is going to last because i want a boyfriend. but the really question is does he feel the same?
