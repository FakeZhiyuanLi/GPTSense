day three awaits, but i dunno if i have 3 sports available. -ima play sum tennis in the morning, maybe w/ meryl (lol. i feel so bad, i woke her up when i asked her. i deserve to play w/ myself. lol) -ima play sum golf w/ adam franscioni, i need sum confidence back after my bro beat me. lol. but i don't think i'll do as badly as i did yesterday. -i'm stumped!. maybe we'll pick up a game of ultimate frisbee @ ty's bonfire. oh well, i hope soo, i won't have anything to do there anyways, i don't wanna drink, so i'll be a dd.
