blah! it's already mid-july and i've accomplished close to nothing in terms of that anime website. i did and redid the layout 3 times. i've finally got it almost done, besides a few small complications. i'm going to need to find some people to work with me on it. i also saw king arthur, the movie, a few days ago, and i must say it was basically like troy, it had a few parts i didn't like, a lot of parts i did like, and a few characters from the movie were pretty cool. the actor who played arthur is very good, while the guy who played lancelot.is.well mediocre. still go see the movie and be educatedabout. a half-mythwell, yeah. i need to keep working on that damned website, and i need to remember to post more stuff here. so.farewell until i get bored enough to write more.
