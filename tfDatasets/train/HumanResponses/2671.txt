so a couple of weeks ago my friend, p, and i got to go to the clay aiken concert. we were really excited. here we are before the concert, feeling all giddy: then after the concert, or course, we went to wait by the buses. we not only caught a glimpse of him, but all of a sudden he was walking towards us on the right, like this: everyone was freaking out, and pushing and yelling. then he walked closer, and he was right in front of us. i touched his arm, and i remember feeling his arm hair (weird, huh?). p had a mini conversation with him. he said, "thank you" right to her. we were very excited, and this is the great picture i got: hey, we're all in there, in some way.
