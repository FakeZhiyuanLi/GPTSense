i got to see beatiful fishes and learn more about them. i think it could have improved by going on groups of 5 or either just exploring on your own. i didnt really have a chance to see what i wanted to see. i also thought it would have been fun to explore on my own. next year for the next theme i would want to go to moody gardens. that tells you both about animals and fish.
