my garden is much like me everywhere you look—something different grows it’s sporadic and changing green without bloom no form and no reason not one portion more beautiful than the next as a whole it’s strangely understandable but just over the fence something red is in bloom mocking color on the skyline and i can see it from my garden it stays in its space never accidentally spreading color to my world and it seems better somehow more enjoyable more pleasing to the eye i could try to plant those flowers in my garden but they would not grow they would be smothered and hidden by the ones there before green on top of green and no one would ever know that something deep down in the madness had once tried to grow
