boring. that is the only word that describes this class. basically you have to sit for three and a half hours and learn how to drive safely. that wouldn't be to bad because after about two classes the time begins to fly. no, the real problem is the language. swearing is almost non-stop and very very strong. driving with the instructor, however, is fun and actually exciting. you get to learn hands on how to drive, and the fun of being behind the wheel is pretty cool. my main problem with driving is positioning the car in my lane. this ends with the car grinding into the gravel on the edge of the road. after two hours i was getting better at driving and hopefully i'll do good tommorrow from ten to twelve in the morning.
