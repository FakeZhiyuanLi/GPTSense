and so he really didn’t call me. well, now he’s used to not calling me anymore. but he should’ve dropped calls on my hand phone, at least. just so i know that he’s home safe. it’s funny that just yesterday i shared our story, and now we’re not in good terms. maybe it’s just a petty fight. i couldn’t even consider it as a fight. it’s just me who’s trying to talk to him. he seemed to ignore me. he is always like that every time we get into a situation like this. he always tends to be quiet, not uttering even a single word. annoying. how can we fix misunderstandings if he doesn’t want to talk things over? for him, it’s a mortal sin if i am not able to put in the buttons on my blouse the way he wants it to be. and if it’s not what he wants, he vehemently thinks i did it on purpose. and by the way, let's not talk about me wearing skirts. it’s like me eating the forbidden fruit.
