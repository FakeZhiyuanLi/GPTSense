the title basically describes my day. it's been good, tennis was fun, i've played like once in the past month and that was 2 weeks ago and barely played at all this summer and i still hit the ball pretty well. i was moving a lot better than i have in the past, probably cuz of all the conditioning and activities i've been doing. then i came home and ate some of our homemade pizza, and i must say it's wasn't to shabby, gets better everytime. then i ate a tun of ice cream. it was so good (and it was fat free and no added sugar so i was aloud to eat as much as i did, atleast in my rules, lol)! now me and my sis are watchin "lord of the rings : return of the king" good movie but at home i don't have the patients to sit and watch the whole thing straight through, i always get on the computer or start walkin around. i'm tryin to figure out how to put some of my favorite pictures on this site, i think i've got it but i'll get back to you when i know for sure. god bless
