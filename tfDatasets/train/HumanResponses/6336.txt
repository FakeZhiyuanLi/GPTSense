now i understand how to make a blog i can post more blogs and make the looney magnets a place to remember! this old woman looney sounds weird. the thing about old women is that they spend an unusual amount of time at bus stops. this is where the elderly gather to enjoy quality moaning time. however, i think it is unfair to classify all old people as loonies and instead the old loonies will just be the weird women with the son who eats rice (who i would like to meet) and old men who wear string vests. i mean how is a string vest supposed to keep you warm?
