cleaned, washed, arranged all day preparing for this surgery only hours away. i'm i worried? who knows. my baby has clothes for a couple of weeks and two organized closets. my mother has maps to daycare, hospital, wal-mart, winn dixie. scott has a mounting 'to do' list. i have hives. everyone said dinner was good and the carrots to shield the chicken from the grease wasn't a bad idea, but my dad ate them. just before the midnight cutoff i had my last sips to wash down benedryl for the hives (new allergy) and lortab for pain (old cramps). now i'm soaking and surfing. (wireless networking in the bathroom rocks!) i will spend the remaining hours watching a movie and curling my hair.
