the thing about living in the desert is that there really isn't very much to get excited about or to look forward too. there really isn't anything here at all, except for sand and old people who like to golf alot. i keep asking myself why im here, why i came to live here. there must be a reason, a purpose to all of this, because, although i like the hotel and the people i work with, there are lots of aspects of my life that are shitty and extremly hard to deal with. i'm pondering with the idea of just leaving, but i think there may be an underlying purpose to me being here. there must be, otherwise i'm just punishing myself for no reason, because as much as i hate it, there are things keeping me here, i just don't know what or why.
