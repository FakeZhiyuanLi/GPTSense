well my plans almost worked. me and annie met, we had a fun afternoon and saw alien vs. predador. it was good. i got a size 10 in kids t shirt for my goth costume. its gonna be awsome, we got lots of safty pins cuz there hardcore. me and annie had a fun evening, it ended in me falling asleep. again. i didnt end up going out with my friends and getting drunk because i ws too damn sleepy. i fell asleep the first time at 8:30 i think. well, plans where not followed but how is that any diffrent then usual. so as far as a quote of the day, while swe where entewring the movie theatre we heard a man say to his child "no, you cant have any. they dont make ice cream with beans" so we found it amusing. also i was mauling annie infront of the theatre and someone yelled get a room. it was fun. all in all yesterday was pretty good. i wish i had have had the energy to go drinking though. oh well too bad, ill make up for it in college.
