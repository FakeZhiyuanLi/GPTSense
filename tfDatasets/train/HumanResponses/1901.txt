i went for a walk yesterday( sunday, july 25, 2004) with hope and frank, by the sea wall in narragansett. i hate when frank has my leash. he never lets me stop to smell what i want. all he wants to do is walk. what a pain in the.! hope lets me smell whatever i want. she lets me wander in circles if i want to. she also picks up my poop. she carries these plastic bags just for that purpose. we walked for about 30 minutes, then i started to pant. so, they led me back to the car and we went for a little ride. when we got home, i fell asleep.
