i am homeschooled so i started school two weeks ago. some of you probably are homeschooled. the symtoms are overprotectivc parents, of religios ones, or both. thankfully mine are just christan. lots of people i meet say that im the most normal homeschooled person theyve met, which is sort of an insult in a complement. most people think that homeschoolin is fun. hey, you get up when you want do a little school and hang around all day with out chanin from you under wear. let me et one thin straiht. this is not how it is i get up at 7, i start school at 8, i et half an hour lunch and get out at 2:30, and have to go swimmin for two hours. by the time my mom picks me up (because i cant drive yet; 1 year 5 months and 26 days to go!) late as usual by then it is five thirty and we eat dinner, i finish whatever school i have left, then it's 7 and we have "family time", which in m ho is a "waste of time". there. so screw yu school goers. >:-p
