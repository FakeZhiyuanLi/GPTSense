well today kinda sucked as usual but what else is new. best part of it was getting to talk to dd today. i really dont think she believes that i love her as much as i do but i can understand that. i havent really been presented w/ a chance to prove that what i say is truely how i feel but somehow i will figure out a way. well ne*wayz aparrently i spelled d'mari's name wrong in my last post and i apologize for it. well time for me to go. later dayz!
