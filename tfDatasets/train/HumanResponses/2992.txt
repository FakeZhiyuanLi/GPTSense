i had one of the most vivid dream in my entire life.the dream will seem wierd but try to read on.let me explain to you.i dreamt alyssa milano(bear with me here) actually wanted to marry me and i agreed.it was all set that we would wed at 8 in the evening.everything went on fine until i got a wierd phone call from.my ex!just as she told me she still loves me,we got disconnected.i was shocked.immediately i sought the help of amin.he tried to call her again but to no avail.both of us then,if i remember correctly,ran to the railway of jurong mrt station to get a better and clearer signal.why were we on the railway is still bothering me.
