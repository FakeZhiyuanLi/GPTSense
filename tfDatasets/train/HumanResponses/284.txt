wow, crazy bastards coming down the stairs. not in pajamas, though. but then again, they're not bananas, they're crazy bastards, and crazy bastards can do anything they want. well within the limits of the law, at least. how funny. whatever. damned technology. you would think that something that can process millions of pieces of information simultaneously should be able to remember that you don't like it when it screws up all your window sizes and when it insists that you only have two speakers and then proceeds to making horrible screeching noises out of the back two because, well apparently, they're not supposed to be there. my ass. die.
