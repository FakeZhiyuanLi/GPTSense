went to the esplanade today to watch 'faces by horta van hoye'. the theatre studio is so hard to find. it took me 15 minutes to find the place! and when i got there the doors weren't even open yet. met roxy and sum yi there, so we went out to the rooftop to view the scenery. really beautiful! you can see the whole of the bay, and there's this tent where people play live music! they were playing jazz, really great. why can't i live in a place like that? gotta go back to the esplanade sometime.
