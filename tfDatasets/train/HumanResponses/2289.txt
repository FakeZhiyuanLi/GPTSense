when a room is dim, there tends to be a reason for the lack of light. generally a bulb has blown or not enough lights are in the room, but when you replace a bulb you once again brighten things up; the shadows are crisper and the light is more clear. just like when you add a new light to a space, it takes away the darkness in the same way. in the exact same sense, when you're feeling dim, in order to brighten things up you need to replace the broken things with new, and add more light to your life! i'm a snazzy blue light, 100 watts bright bitch :-d
