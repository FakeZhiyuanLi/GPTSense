so i took the time tonight to make a couple of dishes. first up was a sun-dried tomato pesto with penne pasta: 1 bottle of sun dried tomatos in olive oil 2 gloves of garlic 1/4 cup of pine nuts roughly 15-20 leaves of fresh(hydronated) basil combine all ingredients in a blender or food processor including the oil from the tomatoes. blend well, remove and fold in a 1/4 to 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese. cook pasta noodles al dente and combine with pesto, add roughly 1/3 to 1/2 cup of hot water from pasta to the pesto and stir well. my other recipe was just a quick salad i threw together. i took a couple handfuls of baby spinach, 1/3 head of red cabbage, 2 small cluster tomatoes, 3 apricots cut into 1/8ths, and combined them into a bowl. then i made a vinegrette using avocado oil and sherry vinegar, seasoned with salt and pepper to taste. if you make 'em, let me know what you think!
