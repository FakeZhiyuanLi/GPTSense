did i mention i'm doing eee in bits, pilani? what do you get when you take people from all across the diverse regions of india and stick them in a village on the outskirts of civilisation well, come down to pilani and we'll show you the place has a culture of its own the strong dravidian influence has lent itself to bitspeak in the form of a 'da' after every sentence almost as a punctuation mark! bitsians don't waste words, or letters. "ob" is used for obviously and "laccha" for laughing and chatting. to study all the time is to "ghot" if you haven't yet figured out why i am redifining your english, its because i might use a few of these terms in my lated blogs and you ought to understand them! the queen's english is rarely spoken in entirety anywhere in the world so why should i have to stick to rules?
