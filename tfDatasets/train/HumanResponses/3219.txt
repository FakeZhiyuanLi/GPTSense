move me where i live words cut like ice through the warmth i once had, piercing the skin, and burning the heart like colored paper. you melt the ice and set a pleasant fire to my skin searing away the pain that slashes at my face…hands…heart. if only i had known the ease in which i would give into your stalking fire, willing to bear the pain for one more moment. my mother used to sting me with memories of her white picket fence, flowered wallpaper, and the storm. but here, i can smell the peace in the autumn leaves, see it in the dried corn, taste it in the air; and i am dizzy with it. nothing would please me more than to hold that feeling in my cold white hands, and stroke it, keep it, live from it. these hands. but everything runs like water through those tiny cracks and crevices leaving these hands empty and dry. where i live the words cut like ice killing me slowly, piercing my skin, and watching my heart turn to cinders.
