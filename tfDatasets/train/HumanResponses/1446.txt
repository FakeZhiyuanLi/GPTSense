what an update. i'm now totally done with this evil piece of junk they call highschool. huzzah! anyways, went to la ronde this weekend. awesome time. got soaked to the bone on this one ride. and it made my shorts see-through, so everyone got to see my sexy ass boxers. it so turned kathy, diana, christine and matt on (that's right, even matt). so yeah, i've got the darkness in 7 days, which will so kick ass. and then qaa prom. fun times a brewin for the summer.
