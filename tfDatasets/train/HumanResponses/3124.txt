congrats to me. i'm a illegal alien. all thanks to the company pro for this achievement. this points to the question of racial discrimination and company policies in dubai. though a liberal country, the labour ministry and it's policies are often critised for it's in-humane treatment towards the working labour class. employees find their basic rights "over-ridden" by tough and inexplicable labour laws. personally, i think it's a sham. while the countries' top visionaries "dream" globally, little attention is paid to the expat communities.
