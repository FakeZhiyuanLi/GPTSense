it's getting to be that time of year already. school is a little over a month away and there's always planning that needs to be done! deciding which classes to take and making sure everything adds up to the right credits can be quite confusing. but in a sense it can be fun too. it looks like this school year isn't going to be too bad for me. only one semester of math! no science at all. sounds pretty good to me. it's going to be very busy at the beginning because of oneighty opening on september 22nd, but everything will work good. ps it would be nice to have a little feedback from you guys. at least let me know you're taking a look at my blog. thanks.
