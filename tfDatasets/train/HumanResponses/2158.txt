yes, i spent the weekend at the cabin, on a lake. it's great to have a cabin, the problem with cabins is that manytimes they're packed with relatives. i love my relatives, don't get me wrong, but i love to be able to relax somewhere and smoke my joint, rather than going off to hide somewhere. i supposed it shouldn't matter, shouldn't my family love me for who i am. well, yes, but i guess i just don't want to put them in the position that they have to say "hey, wanna go do that somewhere else?" that would make me want to say "no, i don't want to go do this somewhere else, right here on the beach is just as good a place as back in the woods." but that would never fly. so, i guess i'll just have to deal with woodsness.
