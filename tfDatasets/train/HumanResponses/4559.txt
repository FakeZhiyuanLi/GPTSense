just added an illustration that looks like me to the profile page. i nicked it of a site and modified the illustration to look a bit like me. one day i will have the guts to put a real picture of myself. till then please settle down. shoot me an email at neildsouza@msn.com and i'll see if i can send you a photo personally. it would really help if you sent me some details/photos/links/websites/blogs of your self first. you know sign of good faith and all that bull. till then
