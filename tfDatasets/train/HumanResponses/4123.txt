you've change, your sweet memory long forgotten. the body that was once yours, buried and rotton. morbid and done, your soul moved on. on to explore eternity. soaring in splender, drowning above. going, leaving me all to see. the one i love gone to be, lost i am with out thee. shallow the wave my heart's forgotten, my eyes blink to thee. i'll hide behind the moon, quietly, patiently waiting to see, if you, if you will notice me. me, who has come to join you in our destiny. so when you arrive and i am there, it will reveal in love again. again in love with you.
