as stated last night, i found that best buy carries the universal remote that can control my tivo as well as (hopefully) everything else in my room. i'll head out in a bit to take care of that and then i need to pick up a belated birthday present for my friend jen. her birthday was the other day and i havent had a chance to get her anything. i feel like such an ass, as i consider her to be a really good friend. after all that i might be meeting someone new. this girl, patti, that i met through my other blog at livejournal.com. she seems like a cool and interesting person, so i am looking foward to meeting her.
