today met ron in the afternoon, he went home to sleep because he worked extra overtime last night from 7pm to 12 noon. in the evening went suntec and raffles city to do my mystery shopping with wen and zac. when zac saw me in the car he asked for my handphone as usual to play yogibear or tom and jerry. unfortunately i have changed my phone and currently i don't have any games for him. when i told him that he didn't believe and wants to check my phone, so funny this little boy! after shopping send zac back and met steph and boyx2 @ punggol park. went back quite early around 2am.
