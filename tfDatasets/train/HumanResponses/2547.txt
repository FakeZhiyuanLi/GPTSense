ok, something i wrote over on swd got me thinking. are all famous serial killers white people? i mean, there's jeffery dahmer, john w. gacy, son of sam, the ut tower sniper, charles manson, jim jones, and that chick from the movie monster. they're all white people. the columbine killers? white boys. the guy that drove his truck into the luby's and shot people? white guy. what's wrong with white people? or, what's wrong with minorities? how come they don't fester like this? minorities get mad, they just shoot you right there. i can only think of a couple of hispanic serial killers. the one guy here in texas that would ride the train and kill people in towns along the tracks. and a guy in california a while back, who killed white girls. but we don't usually keep freezers full of heads or have boy bodies buried under their house. i'm just saying.
