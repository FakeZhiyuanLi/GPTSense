today had to be the funniest morning ever, my cousin came sleep over because of certain issues i won't cover for you to read, but just listen. this morning i was going to make me some coffee, i put the coffee beans in a bowl(don't ask why) so i could grind them later. i went to the bathroom and the next thing you know, my cousin is eating a bowl of "cocoa puffs". i asked him if that was the same bowl on the counter, he replied with a, "i'm eating the cereal you fixed! haha!" but then to his suprise he was eating coffee beans with milk. i feel so sorry for his mom, (my aunt) who's having to put up with his wired ass as i type this. goin to waterland (supposedly) today, we supposed to get in free, but i dunno my back's kinda aching. peace
