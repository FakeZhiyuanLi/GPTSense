im not sure about this whole topic about tiger coming back to get back on top of his game to start bringing in the major wins again. today at the nec invitational stewart cink pulled ahead two more strokes in front of tiger by shooting two under to take him to -11. tiger is still holding down the two spot though along with chris dimarco and david toms all hanging around at -6. the real test is yet to come. tommorow can tiger storm from behind and get back to the top or will he have to settle for second? perhaps he will play bad and not finish top ten. only one person can decide that, and he is the son of earl woods. lets go tiger, sunday is your day.
