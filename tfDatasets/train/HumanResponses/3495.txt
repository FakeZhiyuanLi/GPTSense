ok it's 11:15 pm, my mechanical energy consumed, so here comes the brain. something just happened right now, inside of me, in that big heart of mine: i let go. when you see somebody happy, if you truly love them. you'd let them go! if you don't it's selfishness. the game, the show is over. did you notice i like to use  a lot? anyways, i'll be here. and so will they. and time will tell.
