let's see if i can figure this blogger stuff out. i crocheted another scarf today, but this one is definitely for me. i made a list of all the people i need to crochet christmas presents for. the list contains 10 people. i've made one of the presents. luckily, i know what i want to make for everyone, and i have most of the yarn i need.
