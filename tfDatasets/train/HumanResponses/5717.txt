i am really trying to determine whether being in school is worth 3 more years of nights and weekends of studying. will it really help me make more money? will a new position help me be happier? the entry level programmers here are the same level as i am. probably by the time i get my degree i will be making as much as i would over there. hmm. well, it will be portable in case we move, but we are thinking of putting in a swimming pool. if we do that, we need to be here for a while to get our money's worth out of it. a swimming pool would be nice for entertainment and exercise. i think we might glass it in and have it heated so that we could use it year-round. that would be a great way to exercise if we would do it. if we don't use it, well that's money down the drain.
