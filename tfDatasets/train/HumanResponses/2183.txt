why is it that every year, towards the end of summer, july feels like a distant memory? i feel like i never accomplish anything in the two months i have off. we went to wasaga and a couple of day trips here and there, but i never feel like i've done something worth doing. next summer, i want to take that job on a cruise ship before school. i need to be alone and experience the world by myself for once. i need to learn not to depend on anyone else and to see everything in my eyes. an entire summer without friends, family or woodbridgethats what i need. -j
