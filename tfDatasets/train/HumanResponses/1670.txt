have you ever noticed that life sucks? or was that just me? i have no boyfriend as of lately, it seems like i never will again. no one is interested in me. i'm too boring, i guess. then i have no friends. the ones i did have accused me of being a lesbian and spread it around the school. i got tormented because everyone thought i was gay. yet, in all reality i am a heterosexual, i only like guys. life sucks
