although it is a day away from sch reopens, i did not feel any excitement or any pressure at all. now i am in sec 4 yet i do not feel the need to study hard. what is the world getting into manz? i have been feeling very f*cked up this few days not juz because of sch and also because of other reasons. i feel that in a way or so, i m being betrayed. i also dunno why suddenly the world seems to change completely, i m actually ignored by somebody. yet i do not know the reason, i reali wanna know the reason and i dun wan that somebody to actually dao me. i hope to regain the friendship manz.
