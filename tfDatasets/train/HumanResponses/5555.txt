i've taken on the job of being template builder for yet another blog - roxy's. i'm already template builder for annabelle, so now i've got three blogs to work on, mine included. not that i mind, i find it fun. the only problem is trying to find ideas, but otherwise things couldn't be smoother! hehex. i'm drawing ever closer to completing [the last chance] now! i'm getting just so tensed up. things are going to lighten up considerably in the last two chapters. now i've got something new on my mind: what to call my next fanfiction.
