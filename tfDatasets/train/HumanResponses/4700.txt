i am now at the pocono's. hoooorrrraaayyyy! had a great dinner. for all of you unfamiliar with the maryland blue crab craze, (a big thing in the northeast), we had great crabs. accompanied with shrimp, clams, softshells, and fresh jersey corn. good beginning to a hopefully great week. might go boating tomorrow, weather permitting. fyi, woke up again last night crying with jaw pain. i think i just need to have it removed. going to bed and i am determined to not wake up again with pain! also, painted the the ceiling last night, but i will get into that later when i am not so tired.
