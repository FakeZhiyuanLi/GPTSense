hah, finally, i am cynical. another company called me up. gave me a phone interview, and guess what? the cynicism in the air was as thick as the smog in san fran. i thought nothing would ever make me feel that way.sigh, i wish everything was as before. everything was calmer, more serene. ever thought of reading catcher in the rye 12 times straight? that should give you an idea.
