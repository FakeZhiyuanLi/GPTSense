today my friend seed a beaver on the road. it was brown and looked pokey. it was laying on its back with its feet in the air. it looked soo soo sad. it had 6 legs and some purple spray paint on it im guessin the other feet were the babies. it eyeball was popped out. you could see it's guts too. it really was sad to her but holarious to me.that was the day we seed a dead beaver.
