i have turned my porch into "anytown usa". my tastes and love for life are well beyond the personality of this neighborhood. it's the ghetto. actually it's the grey between the black of the ghetto and the white of suburbia. so i am fighting the grey by adding some color . red, white and blue! i am 13th generation american and love the simple times of the old west. so in the heart of my pit bull biting, bass thumping neighborhood i have created a kramer inspired anytown usa . three hanging impatient plants, one bird feeder, one recovering potted plant sharing soil with an american flag, a white glass table with a wool flower cover which holds my weber charcoal grill. i grilled steaks out there yesterday while wearing my iron chef apron. and i threw some hickory wood chips on the coals for one more level of spite. i hope it was a nauseating site. "ya'll come back real soon!"
