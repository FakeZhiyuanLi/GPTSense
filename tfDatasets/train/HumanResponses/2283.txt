*yawn* i'm sooooooo tired today,but being tired makes you think about stuff,so i decided to share with you guys the poems i have written while being tired,enjoy. my eyes,my skin all of me itches for you,for you and your forest green personality,for you and your lemon yellow lips and aqua purple eyes.kiss me. drowsy,drowsy and sick,sick and depresssed for life has not started in thed morning,all is quiet and bright,like a ghost of the real day,no,not a ghost,a vision,an ancient memory.
