as it turns out, tiger preview would not install on either my powerbook or powermac. as soon as the machines booted from the install dvd, a massive kernel panic occurred, rendering the entire process unsalvagable. i guess those promised tiger screenshots and reviews will not be coming as planned. what a bummer. also, i intended to post pictures of my new ipod, but the pictures came out looking absolutely fantastically shitty. i will take some more sometime later and post them.
