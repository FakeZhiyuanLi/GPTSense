hmm.so i decided to start my own blog. i used to hate blogs. but then i thought, why not? i know no one would read this, why would they? but i'll write it anyway, since i don't have anything else better to do. i'll try to write this whenever i have the time. until i get bored of it-ofcourse. so, what should i write about today? hmm. lets see. why don't i start by telling about what's been happening to me recently.? ok. first, i recently got dumped by my boyfriend. it hurt a lot! i can still feel the pain, but i'm going to be okay. (i hope) i did love that guy.i think. but then i thought, if he loves me he won't hurt me, and he did. and i don't want to be wasting my time for a guy like that. hey, i'll continue writing this later coz i really got to go to be continued.
