yesterday i went to gwen’s party which was pretty fun… then jenna came home with me and we hung out then went to sleep. i finally got to see the t-bird yearbook for this year. hmm. yeah later today i’m helping my aunt with her dance recital production so i’m going to have like the greatest time ever. by the way i am joking about that.
