so it's been a while. sorry. got lost up in so many things. so much has happened and yet it's been so boring. haha! well i know i've talked about 2 different guyz on here and how much i've like them but i've been over them for such a long time. and yes sadly i like someone else but this time he's an ex-boyfriend. how sad! what's worse is that we've broken up and gotten back togeth so many times that i'm afriad of people might say if we got back together. but i doubt that we well, i've told him that i still feel for him but he hasn't responded. and i know he's gotten it because he's like a computer freak (but a good freak!). well before i bore you all into dream land. goodnight!
