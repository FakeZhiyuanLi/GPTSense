well this is what allways happens when i try to keep a journal thingy. but anyways where i left off. that bike was way too small so i didnt get it. but i got an ok moped instead. its fast, for a moped somewhere arround 47-50 mph tops, it will go faster when im done with it. im off work now untill school starts, so i dont gotta get up early for about 13 days then school starts and i gotta get up at like 625, thats gonna suck. ill post more later, but fornow just look for the cool guy on a blue moped on a street near you.
