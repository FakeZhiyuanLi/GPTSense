so, i went on the junior trip monday morning and it was amazing *tiring though* i had a lot of fun with my friends, but even so, i cried once. i was listening to 3 doors down and it was "when i'm gone" and "here without you" and it just made me cry because i was thinking that he's in ny and then he'll get back and then on thursday he's graduating. graduating. and even if things work out and god leads me to bbc, that's still a whole year without him. a year. so that's where "when i'm gone" depressed me. it was all good though, because no one noticed me crying. still not sure i wanted to know. laterdays ruth
