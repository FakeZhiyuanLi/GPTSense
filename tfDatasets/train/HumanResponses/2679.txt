have you ever felt a butterfly flying in your stomach? they said it was the feelings when you’re in love. last nite, a friend told me that she felt those butterflies feelings in her stomach again. i was glad, coz that meant she’s falling in love with someone. although, it might sounds a little bit weird (or not, whatever), i’ve never felt such a thing. or, i’ve felt it once, but i hardly recognized it, and then forget about it. so, i am now wondering how that things felt like. is it going to be an addiction? might be; as long as i’m not gonna feel trapped inside it. it’s the feeling that one must preserve. so, i am now wondering how that butterfly in my stomach felt like. and therefore i should get in love. but since when falling in love has to be forced away? well, i guess i’ll feel it someday. yeah, keep being optimistic, that’s the thing that keep me alive and stand up straight in this fuckin’ celibacy world.
