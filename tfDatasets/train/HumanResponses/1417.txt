you lil' ass! i told you not to tell dest what i had said! now she hates me more than before, oh well i guess. i can't be angry, no matter how hard i try i can't do it. well, not at least since me and abie got together. (abie, if you are reading this, i love you, baby!) the only thing i can be is happy . . . is that a good thing?!? if not it sure feels like it! garrett, i may not be angry with you, but i'll still kick your ass, you lil' bitch! now i know i can't tell you anything, without it being repeated! that's depressing, or it would be if i wasn't thinking about abie . . .
