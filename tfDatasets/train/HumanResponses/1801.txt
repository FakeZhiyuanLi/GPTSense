today i woke up late. i was kind of in a rush, but not really. i knew i didn't have anything to important or exciting to tend to here at work. i stayed up pretty late watching "the wild bunch" and i still got a really good night of sleep.  this is how i feel. i'll probably turn this into a song.  i've got this feeling welling up inside of me kind of like a heavy blanket wrapped around my heart unable to break free to the fresh surface air i wish my spirit were blithe and for that i strive because a lot of the time i don't quite feel alive especially when i sit and stare at a screen which offers me absolutely nothing except the green to which i'm a slave. so free me, change my life somehow save me, i need to break the chains break free, i need to work toward being free set free, eliminate the things that enslave me
