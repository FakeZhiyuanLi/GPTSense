well, tomorrow i go to mexico. i'm getting more excited every minute. i have been soooo blessed. just a little over a week ago i wasn't even close to having the amount i needed to go. i cried out to god, i didn't know what i was going to do. and even though i didn't give the lord all the love he is worthy of, he answered my call. i can't tell you enough how great god is. as of this morning i was $100 over what i needed to raise. god is so good. he has given me so many chances, so many oppurtunities. i will strive to be the man he wants me to be. please pray for me while i'm in mexico. pray that i have wisdom, courage, and pray that i do what god wants me to. pray that i hold my tongue when everyone's tired and the tensions are high. ok then, i guess i'll go do stuff. god bless you
