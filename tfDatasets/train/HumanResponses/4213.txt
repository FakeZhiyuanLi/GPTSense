bonjour! i know that my blogs are boring, but i have nothing interesting to write about. well, i have read quite a few books over the week. i read awake and dreaming (by kit pearson), the daring game (also by k.p), the great gilly hopkins, and i just finished the sky is falling. i do a lot of reading, since we don't have a t.v. when i am not reading, i am on the internet, studying, or helping my mom. my cousin, sahithi and her family are going to come on august 15th, so life might get exciting again! so au revoir!
