i had a dream last night. i was over at my friends house and people were everywhere, talking and laughing. i decided to go downstairs and i bumped into a girl and made some nonsense remark. after reaching the basement and sitting down, a girl i like(lets call her a) came over crying to me and her friends and everyone else started to stare at me. it had something to do with the girl on the staircase(i've come to realizes this girl is one of two people, a girl online who we shall call r, and a friend in real life, k.)). so i exlpained myself, with some help of demostration of the r/k, for some odd reason. and suddenly a jumped into my lap smiling, everyone else went back to what they were doing. and she looked at me teary eyed and i kissed her and she didn't stop smiling as i held her. i'm not sure what i expect to get out of this, wether i wrote this to help myself, or just remember. but enjoy a look into my mind.
