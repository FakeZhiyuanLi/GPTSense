i am sure anyone reading my other post will think i must hate people, hate life.no this is not the case. i simply get irritated easy with peoples actions. and i am not the type of person to say something, i just get irritated and leave it. but being around the general public all day is no walk in the park. it amazes me how people act, how they are rude, could care less, and what annoys me at this very moment is people who act happy, now i am not saying people who are truly happy, but people who go out of their way to be happy. come on get a damn life people, it does not get any better by pretending to be happy, you are just masking the inevitable. just a thought from one who sees it.
