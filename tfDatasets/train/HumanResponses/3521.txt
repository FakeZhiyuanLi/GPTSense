i like listening to the air conditioning in my house because it's real peaceful. it makes me feel good that i'm away from school, learning and that shit. just found out my sister's boyfriend got held up at gunpoint, then got pistel whipped. luckily they caught the stupid fucks that did it. they got into an accident moments after driving away from the scene of the crime. hahaha, stupid assholes got what they deserved.
