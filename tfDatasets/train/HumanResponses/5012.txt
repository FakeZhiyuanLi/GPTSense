today, i did absolutely nothing. i didn't feel particularily guilty about that either. i felt shitty all day and i wished that i hadn't even gotten out of bed for most of it. i haven't even gotten any real gaming in today. i did find an interesting picture though. i'm not an american, so my opinion of the presidential candidates is hardly relevant, but this gives me a giggle anyway.
