it's a pretty uneventful day. boring, in colluqial terms. boring as hell. not that hell would be boring with all the fire and stuff. but anyway, it's boring. this day's boring. nothing to do. people keep annoying me. boring. nothing to do. i could finish my english assignment early but that would be to diligent for my liking. the complete boredom of this weekend can still be saved by watching troy the second time with my friends. unless it rains. then my mum would go all paranoid and go "what if a tree falls on you?" oh well. i'm good. life's good. it better be. he he he. yeah, oliver was starting to annoy me again. wait, scratch that, he was insulting me. in a joking manner anyway if not i would have walked over to his house and bonked him on the head. anyway, i'm talking with my cousin right now. he's gay. he's really nice. so i gotta go. until next time.
