it's almost gone. my parents and my mom's brothers and sisters finally finished cleaning up their fathers house and its time to sell it. i'm going to be glad when its all finally over, but i cant begin to imaging how happy my mom is going to be when its done. she is the executor of the estate, so she's been the one that has been doing almost everything, and also my dad did a lot of stuff. i think each of them did more work than all 5 of her brothers and sisters put together. now we know that the house will be sold for at least $400,000. drool. i'm crossing my fingers that some money will come my way for something like kick ass computer. but i can only hope. speaking of computers, i am really getting sick of this one. i've decided to back up all my stuff and reformat the whole thing and start over. i'll probably do it on monday, but i'm burning disks tonight. i'm sure that i will be happy with the results after i do that. later.
