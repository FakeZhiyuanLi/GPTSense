break down the walls hear the angels call lost in a mist of haze confusion tangled within this maze my life, a complete loss you win, you lose, and it’s up at a toss where do you travel when all roads are unpaved? no way to escape these paths unscathed its up to you make it what you will run or hide or just sit still but you’ll pay a price for fortune and fame if that ends up to be your game there are choices you’ll make turns you’ll have to take heed my warnings, don’t get lost for redirection, there’ll be a cost don’t you ever feel like you just can’t win that everything s up to chance. well that’s how i feel. everything that happens is unfair. you can’t beat it, alls you can do is play its game. we have choice but what to chose, if you’re wrong you might lose. ok i hate that when i get talking i start to rhyme. it sucks.
