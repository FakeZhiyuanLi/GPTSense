we finally found out that we can move as early as june 4. which doesn't give us much time. i have been telling ny husband that we need to start packing and he hasn't agreed and now we find out we can move as early as next thursday. we probably won't be moving that soon, because we probably won't be able to schedule the movers that quickly. but we are hoping to be out of here by the 10th. (still doesn't give us a lot of time!) he is calling the townhouse place now, to see if we can get in there earlier. hoping we can! otherwise we are just wasting our time down here. we are trying to do a partial-dity move. that means some of our stuff will be packed and taken by the movers. we will rent a truck and pack some of our more fragile/valuable stuff, and pull his car. i will drive my car and stick important stuff in there including mr. tibbs (the rabbit). this is going to be a ton of work! i'm not looking forward to getting started, but at the same time i can't wait to get out of p-cola!
