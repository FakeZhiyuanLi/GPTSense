so i just found out that jen will be home around 10. that's cool. her mom doesn't know it but the "chaperones" aren't exactly going to be with them the whole time. i hope she has a great time with luke and he doesn't make any moves on her cause she doesn't even want to kiss him on the first date. we'll that's that. um. i don't know what to say about things lately other than that i've found it easier to stop feeling. i cried last night in bed. something that hasn't happened in like a week truly. all i did was fight today. chase the girls around with heavy objects. i got joanna good with a plastic chair. hahaha. i am so bad. someone had to teach her. i am messed up, i know but what can i say? jim just got home. he doesn't ask questions. why do i not help around the house, why do i not listen to them, why do i do anything? he doesn't care why he just wants it to stop, well i say fuck him. oh-so sincerely, coral
