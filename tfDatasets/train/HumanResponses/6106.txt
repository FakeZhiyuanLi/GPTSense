there are people in my life that i have deemed life suckers. they are people who have no identity at all. somewhere in the grand scheme of things they never developed a personality. they take your taste in movies, music, clothes, or any absurd personality qwerk, and somehow it becomes theirs. it is a subtle process, and trust me, it doesn't mean that you are this cool, amazing person. it just means there is at least one aspect of you that can be life sucked. i will not go into specific details unless requested. why do these life suckers exist. well, i have only been life sucked by two people, both female. this may only occur in females, but i have learned that this is usually the result of taking a fancy to a specific male. pathetic? yes. fiction? no.
