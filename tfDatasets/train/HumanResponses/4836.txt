i just thought i'd mention this. blogger now has a comment feature. so when you respond to someone's post, just respond by making a comment instead of creating a whole new post. that will make everything on this blog nice and clean. when you click to leave a comment, you'll be asked to log in to your blogger account because i have it set so only members of this blog can leave comments. one other thing: if you have not yet, take a minute to create your blogger profile. you can upload a picture and stuff. it's similar to a friendster page, but no testimonies and no desparate pleas for a date. anyway, that's all.
