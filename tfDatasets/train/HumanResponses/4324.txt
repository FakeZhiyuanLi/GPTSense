an exaggerated sms message i received one day: "oh! luk at mi! mi iz very guds at wrting shrthand. mi tink iz so kute tat it wil impress the boyz wif tis kind of shrthand sms msg. "ooooooooh oh oh! lotsa luv and mi miz u 2" ^_^ can you understand such crap? makes you wonder why we spend a quarter of our life in school. i used to think that spelling was such a waste of time, well it looks that way now does it?
