i've had a great weekend. haven't blogged in like ages but am back. anywayz, i went to enchanted kingdon yesterday with nina, julienne, jona, and franz along with our moms and dads and it was really fun. (lol-hit me if that was a run-on sentence). saturday we went to divisoria-it was allright, stinky but fun. and that day i heard my favorite song-by lisa loeb (stay-i missed you)3 times! lol. i'm waiting right now in this really cool bookstore just enjoying life.
