if you were there, what did you think? i kept looking for a familiar face on the big screen. i ran in way late, at about 11:02. as i was running up to the key, a homeless man is sitting there, looks at me, and says "you're late". . thanks buddy it was cool to see like kay rice, the art teacher lady, tad, farah, cal,etc. it was boring, but hey , as is a graduation ceremony. if you weren't there: please list your good reason here:
