i got a card today morning from my close buddy akos wishing me a happy left hander's day! :-) yes, i am sinistral,gauche or just plain left handed. i write, eat and do all that right handed folks do with their right hands, with my left hand. to think of it , in this 'right hand' dominated world i personally think i have adapted quite well and have become pretty ambidextrous. in india, the concept of a left-hand driven car is quite a one in a million episode! so i learnt to drive on a right handed car and well i am as good as anyone else. i read somewhere that there are degrees to handedness, and on that note i could be 80% left handed and the rest right handed. well, i got this quote from a site. it quite shows the plight a left hander faces in terms of deciphering directions and well in short doing things 'right'
