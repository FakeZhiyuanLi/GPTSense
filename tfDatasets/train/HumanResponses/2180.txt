have any of you seen the new moveon ad contest? it's called real people , and they're going to try to get the winning ad aired during the rnc. interesting tactic, as i don't see a 30-second spot changing anyone's mind. then again, maybe it would depend on the mind. i watched the 17 finalists, and they all seemed pretty similar, message-wise. i could see the 1st-place ad having more impact, maybe, because it's a recently-returned marine talking about the lack of wmds. i guess since my mind has been made up forever, though, they don't really have an impact on me. any thoughts?
