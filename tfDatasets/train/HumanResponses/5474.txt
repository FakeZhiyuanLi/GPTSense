is it a sin to need a scented blossom in spring or to wonder in awe at a sunset melting through mountains maybe hearing the birds sing your praises every morning or being greeted by the warm breeze on a summers day to want warmth on a winters night and to make love by the moons gentle glow if so i confess to you every time i meet your gaze i live in sin.
