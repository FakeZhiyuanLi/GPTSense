i thought 27 is a lousy result, since it did not reflect the amt of work i put in with km. thus, i thought i would be getting the lower range. however, this is not the case. many ppl got marks in the range of 24-26, and they are mostly under mrs choi. according to syc, she is even stricter than the "famous" teocm, my mentor. imagine my surprise! syc keeps insisting b4 that he will get higher marks than me, as choi will be more lenient. too bad. well, it's probably a excuse. i'm sorry that some ppl had failed miserably for mrp. i wonder how are they going to survive the storm of cpk, which i think is the greatest tests. well, they better work hard, otherwise they will continue to fail. there's no shortcut. if u dun work hard, u definitely failed. if u work hard, there's a chance.
