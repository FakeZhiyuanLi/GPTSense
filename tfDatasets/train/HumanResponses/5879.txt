i'm such a pig. i've hurt becca so bad. i do feel very terrible, ohh, man. i went out and got some action, but in doing so stupidly boasted about it to becca. damn i kicking my self right now. i do like her, but there have just been all the times she has messed me about many a time and i saw past it, we really lacked the physical side of things that really got to me. i'm not bothered about fucking her or anything i just wanted to kiss her but i couldn't cos i was just so afraid that she would push me away, as it has happened before. gawd. i would like to go out with her again, yes i would. but i don't feel like it at this moment in time, perhaps when she gets back from holiday i dunno tho, if i can wait that long. i'm going into downham wednesday, if you can come we can talk. i do wanna straighten things out, i would hate for things to end terribly now. i am sorry.
