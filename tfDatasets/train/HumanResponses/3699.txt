well i found a way to fix my problem of not having an employee for my show in southern calif. don't go to the show. hehe this seems like an extreme measure but if you have ever driven to far far away ( also known as san diego) then you know that the drive takes you through the more seenic parts of this lovely state lots and lots of open cow country. (omg the smell) i have to say that i am glad to not have to go to the show. it is a 9 hr drive at least and you can not drive on the lawn (hand carring all my goods over the lawn is the pits). this will mean missing the income from the show will not help but oh well sometimes you need to do what is best for your body and soul as apposed to what is good for your wallet. angie ps i am going to kill mike when i get the chance.
