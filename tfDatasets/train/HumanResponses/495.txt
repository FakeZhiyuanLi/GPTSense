i recently, a couple days ago hurt my neck again. its been over 2 years since i injured it at work. it never heals! doctors want to dish out pills and tests, and the chiropractor well that works for a little while and its hard to make the time. i have my good days and bad days though. i slept better last night then i did the night before. sleeping with hubby is hard enough because of his cover-bunching, snuggle grabbing self! but i couldn't live without him i am not sure why i started writing these simple blogs, i suppose so i can find things to complain about from the looks of my first two writings hehehhee. but you know, it makes things easier to get off your chest. there are times when some things cant be said to others. healing takes time, and you start with the inside and work your way out. not that i need emotional healing, i am ok there i think, but its good to express. my healing mainly is physical which would make me feel better all around.
