i have been thinking alot this summer. about the next school year, stuff i have to do, why isn't my computer working, what should i use to smash it to peices, how i should edit my last school year's group project to make it better (maybe i'll bring it in to show everyone at corps sometime), and about the website. anyway, i was thinking that you all out there might have some really good ideas for it (the site). so heres a great spot to list them. i am open to anything you can think of no matter how dumb you may think it is; it may actually turn out cool! so come on in and show me what you got!
