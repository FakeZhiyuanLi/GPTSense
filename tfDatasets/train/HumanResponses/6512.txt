do i continue my usual practise of carrying on working, or shall i walk up to the shop to get something to eat? i think i'll probably end up doing both. just received a memo from the md. he's been off sick for a while, and has just received a report on cancelled contracts. he has decided that none of his staff are capable with dealing with a cancellation, and they must all go to a director. doesn't that make you feel good to work here?
