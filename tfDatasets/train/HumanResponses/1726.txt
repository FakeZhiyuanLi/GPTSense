that's cool. i'm almost sorry i put in the damn counter! so today is a nice slow day at work. i've gotten nothing done but online grocery shopping, ebay impulse buying and game playing. lovely, truly! i did some editing on my husband's script last night. it's very good, and now it really seems to flow a bit easier. i made him work on it today since he was off from work. i think it'll make it a little smoother for him to get what he wants to get out of it. i need to work on my own next. my dog jane seems to slowly be coming around, back to herself. grief is a weird and powerful thing. i'll talk more later.
