during an intense high wind/rain/hail storm last week, i was at home, talking to my wife on the phone. i said, "this thunder is so loud it's shaking the house!" ten mintues later i called her back and said, "actually, that wasn't thunder." yes, friends, a tree fell on our house, with me and the kids inside. here are the photos. (caution treehuggersthese may be disturbing.) there appears to be no real damage to the house.although i think its ego may have been bruised a bit.
