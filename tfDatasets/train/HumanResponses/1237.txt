my office mates have been moaning that i don't work as hard as they do, so i decided to become the first person in the office each day to make a statement, which required me to get out of bed a half hour earlier this morning. my miniature schnauzer trumped me and just stayed in bed. i would walk in the bedroom and she would look up at me with her cute puppy eyes and seem to say, "ha, you foolish human. i am a dog and i get to be lazy." it did pay off. it was 7:54 a.m. as i walked into the building. and, i was the first person here. for all they know, i could have been here at 7:30 a.m.! my plan is going to work perfectly. background information: i work for a a large institution (not-for-profit) that is going through a series of lay offs so everyone acts as a watchdog for human resources so they can get your name to be next on the list instead of theirs, even though the process doesn't work that way.
