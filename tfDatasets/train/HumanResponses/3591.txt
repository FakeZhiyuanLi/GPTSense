i had quite a wierd dream last night. i was given the task of collecting all these keys from various locations, and once i had the last one i somehow managed to lose them all. upon losing them i found myself inside a falling lift/elevator, but survived by tieing my trouser belt (i dont normally use a belt!) to the ceiling and hanging from it, thus avoiding the impact. now, im not sure if this piece of physics actually works in reality, but i hope i never have to find out ;) i am however intrigued about the meaning of this particular dream.
