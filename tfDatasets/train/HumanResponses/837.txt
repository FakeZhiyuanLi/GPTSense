have you ever reached a point where you have worked for so very hard for so very long and one day it just stops? it is a very strange feeling, because every part of you wants to fail due to the stress you have put on it, while your mind still convinces you that you have work to do. i am at that point. too many long nights balancing school. research, and work. too many caffeine inductions to even concieve of taking a nap or getting sleep before 3 am. and the worst part, everyone i know keeps telling me to relax. i guess i am attempting to figure out what i will do from here on out now that my over filled life have just been reduced by two-thirds. guess i should try for some rest, maybe hawaii will bring respite and re-focus. i intend to begin posting more web philosophy here some day. just don't know when that day will be, but keep checking.
