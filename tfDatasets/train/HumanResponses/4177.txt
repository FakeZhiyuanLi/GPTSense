today was pretty boring. i half-heartedly attempted to study for chemistry. in retrospect, i really havent reviewed anthing of value. oh well. hopefully it is easy tommorrow. after a long day of sitting around and doing nothing i went over my dads and we had a wiffleball game. we were in the 5th inning, the game was supposed to go four but we tied.and it started to rain. so we will pick it up probably tommorrow. i let up two runs and so did he. i picked up my runs in the fourth to keep me alive. lots of fun. now as i sit here writing this i realize that i really should be studying. im going to go and turn on scream 2, which is on fox tonite and attempt to study. wish me luck.ojala que el examen manana este facil!
