ohm is the sacred sound, before our souls were earthly bound. ohm echoed through the mist, endless whirl and endless twist. ohm swirled through time and space, before a species or a race. ohm sang her song of one, before lord shivasâ€™ dance was done. dance, whirl, emerald spark, life created from the dark. emerald mist and emerald moon, ohm still sings her sacred tune. forest green and life abound, one still hears the sacred sound. if you stand still among the trees, sense the earth, feel emerald breeze, you will hear the sacred sound, touch your heart and life abound.
