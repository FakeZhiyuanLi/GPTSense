sch has finally open waited very long liaoz. staying at home is torture for me sigh. but then again, attending lessons isn't nice at all! not a single bit really very sianz. especially lit lessons. really extremely sianz. the teacher talk until i wanna fall asleep liaoz. how i wish during that moment of time, there is a bed beside me and then, ah~~ just lie down and sleep shiok but thats impossible. if it really happen, it would really be a moment of magic. sigh. how i wish i could go to sch yet dun study. just gossiping. talking and playing. weird rite go to sch, dun study what logic but that is what i like sigh. impossible.impossible.
