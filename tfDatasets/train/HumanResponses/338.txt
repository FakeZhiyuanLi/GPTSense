ok. everything is inscribed in stone now. she's moving here. who is she? my girlfriend.no, my wife. it sounds strange coming from me. who would have thought it would happen to me? the days of casual three month relationships are officially over. indianapolis will never be the same. the house is beautiful. the neighborhood is perfect. my son is coming back to indiana to live with us. she has a new job. life is good. things always seem to fall into place for me. sometimes it's just a little too good to be true. i'm not sure what i did in past lives to deserve such good fortune. i have to continue to be mindful of that karma thing. i also must continue to learn each of life's lessons as they are presented to me. like i tell my students, there's no use in being here and not learning anything. summer school is for suckers! i've got new responsibilities and obligations now.
