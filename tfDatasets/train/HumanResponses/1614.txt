because.i'm one of them! example. there was a box of croissants laid out in my kitchen this morning. man they smelled really good. i grabbed all of my stuff to head out for the day - backpack; documents; coffee cup, and basketball shoes. so my hands are full. but i still wanted a croissant. so what do i do? i put one in my front breast pocket! hahaha. it was funny cause it didn't fit in the pocket. it kind of just hung half way out. fucking great. i got into my car and enjoyed it.
