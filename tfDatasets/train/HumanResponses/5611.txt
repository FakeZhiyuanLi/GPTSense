i hate shopping for clothes when you know you need them, but also know that you have gained a bit of weight since setteling down and want to lose a good 20 lbs. my hunt: plain simple black pants for work, easy no no i went to 15 differnt stores and tried on every stupid pair i saw, (expensive or not) and got more and more depressed as this charade wore on. with sales people screaming, "can i help you", "oh, what's wrong they didn't fit", "did you not like them?", with fake smiles and stupid faces, aarrrgghhhhhh ! as i walked away i felt like eating a big tub or french fries floating in vinigar to drown away my pain. instead, i had a mint.
