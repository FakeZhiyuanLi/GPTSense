is it a bad thing that i can't remember saturday at all? i know i wasn't drunk, because i don't drink. i can remember being online late saturday night, but i can't remember anything before that maybe my brain is shorting out. or maybe nothing happened. oh! i went out to eat! no. that was friday night. this is bugging me, but anyways. i am going to go to sleep now. i need it, dudes and dudettes. well, ttfn. gosh i haven't said that in a while gya! going now!
