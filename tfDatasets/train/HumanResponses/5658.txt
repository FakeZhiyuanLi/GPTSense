mine sucked. cal just called me today and informed me of the numerous grammatical errors in my paper. these included missing pieces, wrong citations, etc. as a matter of fact, it is so bad that i need to revise it, re-submit it for him and the reader, they will recheck it, then if all is good, i can bind it. oh, for the love of god.
