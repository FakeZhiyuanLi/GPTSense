"it was the struggle of the century" i've got my internet back again today. it has been ´broken´ for about 14 days now, seems like forever. much has happened since last post, but mostly all small things. i've quit my ´day job´, that's a pretty big thing to do though. it sucked and i couldn't stand it anymore. strangely enough i have more money than i have had for years. probable because i know that i have to spend it wisely now. if things go wrong and i spend my money on something stupid i could allays go to the bank and ask for a loan to buy a violin box, i'll be seeing you later! happy dreaming :)
