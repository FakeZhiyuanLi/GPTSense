the skulls have holes made for a portal for evil spirits to escape from. they just drilled them in there when they were alive. how terrible. i wish someone would do that to me so all the evil things inside my head could seek out and maybe if that person is nice enough they'll take the chip out too. then i wouldn't have to worry about people reading my thoughts and getting frightened by the things i see.
