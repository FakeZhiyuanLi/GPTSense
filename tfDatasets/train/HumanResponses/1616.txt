got quake 3 yesterday. i know i know  its an old game with an addon already. but it is one of those things that i have wanted but just never could justify spending the money on it. anyway, i found it at futureshop for $29.00 canadian which i thought was a steal. my next purchase is diablo ii! another game i just loved even though i never did honestly kill diablo, i had too much fun running around the dungeons =] work on the site is going ok although with quake i think it will slow down a bit =] i have a few things that i like to do when i am not working. i probably should have more and actually get a life lately but the site has taken up all my mental power. i have been planning and scheming on this thing for months. dragon and i are getting along a lot better and we have decided not to move but save up some money and move around december. that way it won't feel so rushed.
