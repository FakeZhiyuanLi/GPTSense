how does one attain the level of performance/ maturity that we expect from ourselves? more often than not, our expectations will rise as our abilities improve. so how do we ever feel adequate? by measuring ourselves against others? i don't believe in that, it only enhances our own insecurities and pessimism. or by accepting ourselves as beings that constantly need progress and advancement. i think the latter sounds more reasonable and more in tune with how humanity works. but.why do i get the occasional feeling of inadequacy? is this inherent in our workings as logical human beings? this i have no answers to. anyone care to shed light on this?
