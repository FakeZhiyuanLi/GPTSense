maybe it's just the fact that it's almost midnight, and i've actually managed to stay up this late (it's late for me) doing school crap. maybe it's just the fact that i'm pretty sure there's something going on with me right now, something i can't pinpoint. or maybe it's just the fact that kirsty told me i had what she had long time ago - adjustment disorder (well, she had ad: depression, whereas, apparently, according to the website she found, i have ad: anxiety) that i feel compelled to start one of these things once again. but in the end, i guess i prefer - hold it. i am not going to analyze. i am not gonna try to psychoanalyze myself like i always do. i'm sick of my narcissistic tendancies. that's the problem right here. okay, i just did it again. screw it. i'm gonna do more homework in hopes of distracting myself from all this damn. whatever it is.
