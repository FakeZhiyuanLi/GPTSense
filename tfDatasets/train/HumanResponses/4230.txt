ok, in retrospect, the song should be called "plutocracy in the usa," since plutocracy is rule by the wealthy, whereas oligarchy means "government by the few, esp. for corrupt and selfish purposes." not to say that those are necessarily mutually exclusive designations but plutocracy always makes me think of "rule by animorphic disney characters."
