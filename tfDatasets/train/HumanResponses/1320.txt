hey! my first post.its basically my thoughts on wrestling and jus plain ol life in general. i catchced bad blood on sunday, i was surprised at the length of shawn michaels and triple h hell in a cell.but was impressed that they didnt resort to going outside the cell for a maniac spot i can safely say it will be better then what smackdowns! great american bash will bethts gonna be brutal. heres my star ratings for bad blood 2004 la resistacne vs edge and benoit ** jericho v tomko * shelton benjamin v randy orton *** womans 4 way * eugene v coach * benoit v kane *** hhh v hbk *** also catched the show in manchester a few weeks backwas quite impressed, i actually prefere it live as they are longer matches and better layed out then the condensed version you see on raw. anyway tlk to u later m.c
