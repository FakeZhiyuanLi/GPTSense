yeah i know i know i said i would post every day but so much has been happening in my life i forgot to post. so catch up time. i have been hunting for a job and as usual serfing the site and really enjoying myself on there. sadly one of my friends on the site had to leave. she was a great gal and i really enjoyed talking to her. i remember the first thing that she said to me was she was happly married and just wanted to have a good time and i accepted that. she was a good person to talk to and i will miss her a lot more tommorrow. i promise
