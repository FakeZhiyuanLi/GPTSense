so much to say about this one. martina and i met up with dave in brighton for breakfast and coffee while we were waiting for ben and claire to arrive from barcelona. we nipped back on a train just in time to meet them and head off to somerset. the england match took some of our attention on the journey and we could hear the penalties as we walked up to our camping spot. dixon had nicely pitched our tents so there was little to do apart from start the party. highlights were groove armada on the pyramid stage, but they were on a bit too early in the daylight. fergie in the dance tent and the chemical brothers on the other stage on friday night. saturday ceefax, dj afx, plaid and bonobo were all in the glade. also saw some amazing juggling by jay gilligan and manu laude. sunday there was a seminal performance by orbital.
