so, i have already said how much i don't like having to jump through hoops just to comment on somebody's blog. but, look, here i am with a brand new blog of my own just because i wanted to comment. perhaps this is a good thing. maybe i should divest my interest in envision's website and give it back to davin? we'll have to see.
