today, well today was kinda odd you mite say. it's the school holidays, so as usual i'm hoping to get lots done but about 98% of that stuff wont get done until ages later. and today was no exception, i was hoping to get a lot of my program writing done today and not have to worry about it for the rest of the holidays, but as it turns out i woke up thinking it was 8:30am but alas it was actually 1:45pm, and from the vast reaches of my house there were screams of anger and hatred as i realized that the day was virtually wasted. so i decided to start on something that i could finished without being awake until the early hours of the morning so i made this, my blog, i had actually been meaning to do this for a while but never got around to it. so here i am and here you are and that's about it, so over the next however long i will talk here about my trials and tribulations as an "ordinary" new zealand college student.
