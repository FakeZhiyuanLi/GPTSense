5 more hours of classroom time and i am done highschool forever. did really shitty on a math test that i thought i did good on, but oh well, i dont really care at this point. we started painting our bricks in school today, almost got mine done, the accodion is looking good. me and h-dawg went to cb today and it was pretty good. got a lot of stuff done, well not really, but it was fun hahaha. i bought training day so it was worth it. damn parents are bitching yet again at my "not so great" mark. sometimes i wish they would just relax, its not the end of the world if i get a 64% on one test. the weekend shall be a lot of fun. espically friday, since i will be with bev, and those times are always fun.
