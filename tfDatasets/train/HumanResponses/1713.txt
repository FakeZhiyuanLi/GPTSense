hey, it's sean, i just, uh, decided that to start of a blog with comedic roots, it would be cool if i mentioned a few. mitch hedberg is the world's greatest comedian, and i'm not even joking. if you don't know him*, you should get to know him. i'm not going to go on much more about him because i can tell by the look on your face that blah blah blah here's a quote; "i have a feeling that a duck's opinion of me is strongly influenced by whether or not i have bread." -mitch until next time, sean * "how many of you people know me? well, if you don't know me why are you coming to my special?"
