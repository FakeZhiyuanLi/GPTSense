once upon a time in a hole under a bridge somewhere in madagascar there lived a troll named urthor. urthor was no ordinary troll, being just bigger than the average great dane. he did, however, have quite a knack for croquet. unfortunately trolls were barred from croquet tournaments (for various reasons, the foremost being their smell). also there were no troll croquet tournaments since most trolls enjoyed attacking other trolls with their mallets rather than playing a nice game of croquet. to be coninued i guess. i sitll just dont feel like writing.
