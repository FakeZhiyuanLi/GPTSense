i bought a nice old wooden cigar box recently. it finally came in. it says "havana comrade club house" on the lid. it was apparently made in pennsylvania at some point. on the bottom of the box it says, "factory. no. 1418 1st. dis. pa." and further down: "factory no. 1418 1st district, state of penna" there is also a notice: "the manufacturer of the cigars herein contained has complied with all the requirements of law. every person is cautioned not to use either this box for cigars again, or the stamp thereon again, nor to remove the contents of this box without destroying said stamp, under the penalties provided by law in such cases." i think they were originally priced between 8 and 15 cents each. if any one has any additional info on this box or the maker of its contents, please let me know.
