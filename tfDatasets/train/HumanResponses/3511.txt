so.i learned how to post pictures. i posted them in reverse-order, though, so scroll down to the bottom and work your way up to see them in the order that i took them in. these pictures, by the way, are of the trip i took to the ise shrine. the ise shrine is where the sun goddess lives, and has traditionally been considered to be the direct ancestor of the japanese emperor (though he had to formally renounce his divine ancestry after wwii). basically, this place is the mecca of shinto, and japanese people strive to come here at least once in their lifetime. the whole place is in this really well-preserved park, and the scenery was gorgeous. i mostly included shots of the shrine and such, and left out random tree-and-mountain shots. also, i wrote another rather lenghty post just before i put up these pictures (ie below the last picture) for those of you inclined to read it.
