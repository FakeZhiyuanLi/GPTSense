looks like this will be my second post in two days whoo hoo! i'm on a roll this time! last night i worked the the bar (post office saloon) i was working the door (checking ids and such). it was kind of wierd again, since i used to work there (behind the bar) and now i'm on the other side missing all the work, and enjoying the experience. i love being the host of a party that i don't have to clean up after or pay for! i also miss having the ability to leave work there and not take it home with me.of course i probably would begin to hate it if i ever went back, because now all i think about are the "good times" and not the bad, but that is the way all memories are. well, thanks for reading this installment of nothingness. maybe i will be able to discipline myself enough to do it again!
