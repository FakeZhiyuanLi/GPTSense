happy 4th. slept in and woke up around 11. got monday off. so rare to get vacation. will probably sleep through it like every other time off. want to tinker around with my old g3 minitower. we'll see if that happens. might try to find some fireworks show to watch. ala moana is planning one. but that'll probably a whole lotta crowded. hmmm.
