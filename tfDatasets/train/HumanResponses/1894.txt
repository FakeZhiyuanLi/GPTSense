generally i do not think that i ever want to get off the dole. but then i see what i could turn in to, and it inspires me once again (college diploma anyone?). someday i will get a job that compensates me reasonably well and doesn't atrophy my brain. not right away, mind you, but i will not allow myself to become a vacuous anorexic who sponges shamelessly and mercilessly off of my father. i will be a better person and a better (read: more financially independent) daughter. probably just not this year.
