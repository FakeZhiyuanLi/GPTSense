watched some of the original m*a*s*hes today. including the one where frank and the spazz charge henry with treason. *beats frank over the head with a heavy object* poor henry. but radar tells off a general. he's so cute when he's mad :) also watched the first flagg episode. *tries to cuddle her horde of flagglets* henry also gets pretty beat up in that episode. why do they like being mean to him? *tries to cuddle henry, flagglets and radar at the same time but doesn't succeed* i love my m*a*s*h people. hi colonel koetzle! i locked frank in the bathroom today :) *is extremely proud of herself* *grabs henry and hugs him as he tries to prevent hawkeye from breaking my moms vase* thats all for now, roger will go over and out. oh by the way bush cheney 04 and go illinois
