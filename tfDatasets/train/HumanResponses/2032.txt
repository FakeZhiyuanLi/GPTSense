the hrm at my store is such a dipshit! i'm taking a leave of absence (fmla) and he tells me he needs me to come in and "meet" with him. if i wanted to come in at his whim - then i wouldn't need the leave of absence! i'm not on the clock - i'm on a leave. he is so stupid and doesn't understand any labor laws. in other news, hubby and i are going to go to an auction to try and buy a house. there is going to be an open house this sunday so that we can see the inside of the house ~ i can't wait to see how it looks! if things work out, we might be able to get this 3br/2ba house on over 5 acres for less than  well, let's just hope that we can be the highest bidder
