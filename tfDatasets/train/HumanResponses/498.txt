wisdom from playswith squirrels : "lose one friend, lose all friends, lose yourself." - boy meets world . i didn't get any sleep last night, i don't know why, i think it might be cuz i drank so much tea that has caffine in it i went to bed at like 11pm but then woke up at 1am and couldn't go back to sleep till 5am and woke up at 9am. it's a weekend and i only got 6 hours of sleep. and not good sleep for that matter. now i have to go play tennis in like 30 minutes and i'm really not up for it. atleast i don't have vb today. my sis is making pizza again, hopefully it turns out a little better then last time which might be a challenge since we don't have any sauce. god bless (you and our pizza)
