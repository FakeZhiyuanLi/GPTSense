so, today was boring. except when my sweety came and visited me at work. i was quite excited to see him. i hadn't seen him in a couple of days. he bought me a leomonade. :) i love that boy. i got to spend my break with him. i was happy. i probably won't see him again until friday when he will hopefully come see me at work again. he's such a sweety boy, so good to me! anyways, thats it. i love you sweety! muah!
