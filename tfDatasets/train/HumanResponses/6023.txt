so much for writing every day, but at least i am coming back. i'm not ready to give up on this just yet. this morning i turned on my computer there on my desktop screen sat american hostage paul johnson. the picture was gruesome, especially if you look at it as the way it must all seem through the eyes of his family members. i am not at all sure i know which is more terriblethe torture of this innocent man or the torture of his family members as pictures of his torture are displayed for all the nation to see. people perish for cold metal. alexander solzhenitsyn
