what is it with guys ? i have had it with guys. i have had it with everyone. "i want a girl who is educated." yes thank you for telling me i am too stupid to put up with your smartest. just because i have not finished college does not make me stupid, i am more intelligent than most, but don't use that line of crap on me. sorry i have chosen not to be in debt for the rest of my life. sorry i chose to live my life, then sit in a classroom and learn about crap, that will get me a job i will so hate. honesty, that is all i am asking for here, just someone to say, the real reason i am breaking it off, is because you have a fat ass, not because i did not go to college. yes pure honesty, i could put up with that, but to tell me a line of crap, please. this is me venting about the bullshit i have come to put up with. you know the whole its not you, its me thing. ha!
