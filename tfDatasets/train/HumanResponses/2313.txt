i guess i'd say one of the stupidest defense mechanisms that we ever made was intolerance. me , i'd rather hurt than be hurt. that leads to being hurt more. a very vicious cycle. i wish mine would end. i'd have better relationships then. i really wish i could go back in time. specifically a month ago. everything was calmer. i hate my freakin pride. sometimes i just hope i could be peaceful, even for once. haa, that is a load of bull.
