well, it seems as though matt pamer has died. as such, we fellas making a weekend out of lebowski fest is not looking good, which is not to say that i'm not still up for it. but if that continues to fail to materialize. jeremiah, last night we talked of you coming to mi in june. the dates for that weekend we discussed are june 26 + 27 (sat + sun). if you'd like to make it a longer weekend, that'd be great, but i'd understand if you had to go back for work or school or whatever. two days doesn't seem like enough time for us to catch up, though. another bit of news that may entice you to visit that weekend. pedro's playing at the magic stick in detroit on the 27th (of june).
