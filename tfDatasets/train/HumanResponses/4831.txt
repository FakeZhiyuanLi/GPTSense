the astute among you will note that this run is a minute shorter than the 5th one. this run was three minutes running, one minute walkingwhich is much harder than the previous run-walk ratio. i was feeling good until the 4th repetition, which was difficult, and i really struggled through the 5th one. tonight i noticed a very odd sensation. while i was happy to take the little walking breaks, i found that the moment i started running again after each break my legs felt really invigorated. i'm sure there's some clever scientific name for this phenomenon. however, i'm also sure there's no clever scientific name for the fact that i'm really, really glad tonight's run is over.
