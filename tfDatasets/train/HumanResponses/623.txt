today, at work, we had an asian waiter working instead of a usual girl. he was waiting a table of about 10-12 men, all of which are your typical "i hate the blacks, jews, and mex-ee-cans. wooo! white power!" type guys. they, together, had a $100 bill.the waiter, being asian and not white, got 50cents as a tip. that's just really shitty, yes? and then, when a different table was payign at the register, the guy paying couldn't even look the vendor in the eye because he was hispanic. sometimes i really fucking hate living in the south.
