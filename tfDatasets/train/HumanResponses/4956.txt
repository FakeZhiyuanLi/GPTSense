just to quell any stupid ideas you may have. 1. js forums was a group of forums. this is a blog. they're two entirely different things. 2. since this is a blog (see above), i'll be on here much more often and longer than the forum. plus, summer will give me a lot of extra time on my hands to do stuff with. 3. if 'little princess' annoys anyone (especially me, excluding himself), i can and will ban him. 4. you have the right to remain silent. anything you say can and will be misquoted and used against you in court. (ok i admit that had nothing to do with anything) ws
