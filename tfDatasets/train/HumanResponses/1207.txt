23:06 watching lee evans on paramount2. seen em all before but still funny. just watched return of the jedi with nelson, i must be the worst person ever to watch a film with! "i don't get it right, why did such and such" or "what did he just say." are my two faves! i talk to much. spoke to karl and steve finally. was dreading it but they were understanding ( i hope and think) phil was in bed, so will have to wait till tomorrow. all hopes now on the next project. watch this space. no decorating today, but bought my cabinet for tv etc. looks very neat and tidy dentist in the morning. hoping for a referal to have last 2 wisdom teeth out. ouch.
