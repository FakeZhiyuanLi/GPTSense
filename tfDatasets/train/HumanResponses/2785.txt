i was at blockbuster looking to rent a good movie which in and of itself can be a problem. at least 90% of what you find sitting on the shelf is complete shit and the more copies they have of something the worse the movies seem to get (quantity versus quality?). in my experience the movies that tend to be the best are the ones they only carry one or two copies of. for example, a station agent is probably one of the better movies i've seen in a while and how many are on the shelf? three. once upon a time in the midlands? one. yet to the left and right sit 100 copies of "generic, big budget, poorly written, overexposed, blockbuster". there is so much crap littering the shelves you have to pay close attention while browsing or you'll pass up the two copies of the "well written, perfectly directed, special effect lacking, meaningful" movies that most people tend to ignore. what did i end up renting? err. 13 going on 30. jennifer garner is just too fucking adorable.
