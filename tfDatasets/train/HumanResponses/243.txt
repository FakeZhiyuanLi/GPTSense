maybe one day all of this will have meaning. for now, it all exists as half-doodles in my little black canson sketchbook, a few back stories as .txt files on my laptop, and a bit of daydreaming during those long train rides. i have always had the desire to make my own comic book, and such a desire has manifested itself in many forms throughout the years. (some of you will remember, while the rest of you may have no idea.) it is my hope to take a tolkien-esque stance with my stories, for i don't have the confidence in myself yet to be as bold and direct as c.s. lewis in his stories. (hmm?)
