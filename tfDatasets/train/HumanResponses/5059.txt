okay, so i have a workshop tonight. it's my second one outside my house (where i normaly have stamp camps). 10 women. ugh. luckily i'm all packed and all i have to do now is wait till 5pm. personal note: gotta remember to stop at walgreens on the way. kids are driving me a lil nutz today, but right now they're quiet. just wish i could spend the rest of the day zoning out, or screaming at the top of my lungs. which ever. dh is crabby too. which makes me feel guilty. i'm leaving the kids behind while i do my workshop, and he's crabby. why in the hell should i feel guilty? does he feel guilty when he goes to work everyday? i'm just going to work. stop feeling guilty already! oooops. gotta go grab the laundry. btw: i hate laundry. it never stinkin ends! but i need something clean to wear tonite. so, i beeter go.
