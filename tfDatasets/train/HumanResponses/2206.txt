"good morning! we are pleased to inform you that the memorial you have been waiting for has now been installed . please examine the memorial at your earliest convenience. it is our wish to ensure that it meets your expectations." yes, this came from a cemetery, and yes, it is regarding my husband's headstone. he killed himself in june. just looking at this letter makes my hands shake. i must think happy thoughts now. i really must. i think i'll go sort my recycling now. that's somewhat therapeutic, and even cathartic, when you can shatter glass and whatnot.
