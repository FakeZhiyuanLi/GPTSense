its a sad thing when you start to feel nothing sucked of all emotion you start to wonder why you cant find beauty even in a flower in full bloom or feel the warmth of an infants first laugh to feel guilty for a moment of weakness to second guess oneself not knowing how or why complete bewilderment but still knowing the only reason for this is love that is the only emotion i can still truly feel you gave that gift to me and i am thankful my muse, my love forgive me.
