what to do with myself sometimes. i drive myself totally insane by constantly thinking about things. driving a truck doesn't help either as i have a ton of time to think. i'm not going to say much right now, other than i've had a totally shitty week. thank god i only have to make a short trip tomorrow. i did change the template to something a little less lame and even though i don't care much for the colors i'm leaving it this way cause i'm too lazy to figure out how to change shit. ciao fuckers!
