it's final today - i am officially a divorcee - lucky me! i have had four people including x excluding s call me and congratulate me on my divorce. it's nice but really depressing that so far more people have called me today about that than called me on my birthday. i guess people are just genuinely happy for me that i have made it to splitsville. how sad is it when you tell people you are getting a divorce and their first words are i don't see why you married him in the first place. he was always. or i saw better things for you. you were meant for the catwalk not that, that. it's about time. why did you ever marry him. i never saw you two as a match. i told you you were too young. and so on. i mean i know i made a mistake - hence the divorce. so rubbing it in - really not that necessary.
