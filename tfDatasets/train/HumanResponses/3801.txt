on finishing my constitutional law final, the only thing on my mind is how i'm one step closer to freedom. no, that's a lie. the one thing on my mind is nothing. after 4 hours of writing, what else can there be? taking the final is a lot like having your mind pulled through the anus of a tapeworm: your mind comes out stretched, and both you and the tapeworm are worse off for it. i hope he can at least understand my essays. his exam was brilliant though. a metric assload of goodness: all the questions were clear and concise, and he even tied two of them together - pitting republican against democrat in the brutal partial birth abortion arena. would christians v. lions be an appropriate title? or perhaps christians v. loins? at this point, i dont even remember any of the cases. 2 days till civil procedure and i'm outa here!
