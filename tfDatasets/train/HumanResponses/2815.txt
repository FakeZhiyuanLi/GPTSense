well since i hadn't read any books (other than history books and whatnot for school) for over a year, i finally decided to go to the library and get something to read. so i got a stephen king book, and it's really interesting. it's called from a buick 8 i've only read one other book by him, but now i think i'll read some more. i'm almost done with the book already and i just got it yesterday. yeah so anyways.i'm gonna get another book from the library today i think.
