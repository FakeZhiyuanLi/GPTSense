i wake in the night with dreams of you wishing you were here just so you knew the way i feel without ever touching your face if you could only see how my heart can race i imagine the way your voice sounds in the morning just the thought of it sends me soaring the way my name would sound across your lips the chance to touch you with my fingertips i think of you taking away all this pain of standing with you at dusk in the rain to hold you and watch the sunrise in your eyes to look deep to where this trust i have lies i dream of touching you, feeling you knowing what your breath on my skin would do of falling asleep in your embrace and sensing that this is just a taste
