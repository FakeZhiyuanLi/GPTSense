a spring love hail to our treasured mother earth embrace us with your warmest cure of the winter love and not dearth and to christen our soul so pure o my beloved mother earth; hail the heaven to cry on land to sow on meadow of flowers to dream a trail of the spring love and steadfastly grow o my sweet winter, you must sing a poem to offer us a way to groove our brand new season; oh my king please relinquish me your eternal love ah allow us to embody and ring our tender hearts; o my fair spring ~kekua april 2004
