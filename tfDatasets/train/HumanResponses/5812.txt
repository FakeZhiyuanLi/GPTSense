firstly all five of my black tulips have sprouted. not that it's a big thing, but it's pretty cool. after writing about my cat i have to say that everyone seems to have really interesting and unique pets. (but only my pet has a blog article about them.) i'm sure other people have other ideas about this too but pets play a really big part in our lives. i can't imagine life without pets or plants for that matter. maybe it's because i've spent most of my life in the bush but i really appreciate pets and plants. it's just something about them that is really cool and special. i can't explain what it is but hopefully someone else can. i'll have a think about it and hopefully write again.
