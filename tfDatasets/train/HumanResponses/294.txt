today i feel like i've been hit by a bus. the combination of yesterday's news and the drugs from the dentist ensured that i feel drained today. but on the plus side, at least the tooth is a lot better. in other news, i discovered that my student debts will finally be paid off by october 4 this year - hurrah!
