okay, i will admit it. i am very tired of hearing this back and forth regarding john kerry's record in viet nam, and how these "swift veterans for truth" are being no blatently used by the republican campaign to elect bush ( remember that he was selected in 2000) . i'm simply astounded that they are so ready to attack john kerry's record, when their candidate can't even claim his 'service' in the texas air national guard is on an equal playing field. so rather than doing what senator mccain ( a legitimate veteran pow and a fine banner carrier for the gop in his own right) suggested, they continue to refuse to repudiate such an un-american attack, and claim that all the 523's should stop their messages. gimme a break!
