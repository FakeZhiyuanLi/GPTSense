well all is well here in montana. we just had a thunderstorm run through, but we didn't get all that much rain. as you've probably heard, this morning i got sick on the airplane. it's really beautiful out here, and now i'm just trying to get used to the time change. we had dinner at what would have been my 900. it was really weird and now we're all dead tired from the long day. i don't know what we're doing tomorrow, but i guess we'll find out soon ttyl.
