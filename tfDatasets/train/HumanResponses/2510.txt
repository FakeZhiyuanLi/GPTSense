up working on a friday night, the glory of being in business for yourself. too many bills to pay, too much stuff to do. i must get a life. i live in a quiet place, but there is lots of traffic around tonight, i wonder what other exciting things people do on friday nights. can i really be bothered with it all is really the question i guess. not really is the answer, i just enjoy working from home. am anxious re husband coming home, i hope he doesn't, it would be so marvellous if he was gone for the whole weekend, then my darling daughter and i can just have a nice peaceful weekend at home. with no car i might add, in one of h's more glorious moments, he took my set of car keys off me, oh what a seriously unspecial person. aaagh, we are a happy chappy this evening aren't we. i look forward to happier entries. smiles. :)
