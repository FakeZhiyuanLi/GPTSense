today is the second and last day at jalan bahtera. the second activity for the camp activity my group did was rope course. out of 4 i only did 2 of the rope course. after rope course, we did our third activity that was orienteering. orienteering is basically about finding hidden things with the clues we have. after lunch we went for a trip to little india. the trip really make me exhausted. at night, we have a campfire. my group presented two songs, father abraham and five hundred miles.
