well it has dawned on me now that i am 23 and very very very old, hmmm and what have i accomplished with my life. not much it would seem, so i've invented this wonderful concept where, no longer will i remember, count, nor keep track of my age, as of this very moment may 27 is dead. the new modus operandi will be. press on, hussle hard, worry not and mi must bust soon. don't? anyway me feel so. so here is to 23 in 2004,(enter bounty killer song: big tings a gwaan 2004) the last birthday hurrah. *sob* *sob* *sniff* *sniff*. may 27 used to be such a good day.
