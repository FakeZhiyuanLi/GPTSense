i, like all other people, often wonder how other people see me. yesterday at work a lady was telling me about how my boss raved about me to her. how would he know how good of a singer/piano player i am? he's never heard me sing, and only saw me direct and accompany a choir at choir festival last year. i'm pretty sure he's going off the recommendations of a couple of my friends who love me, and therefore think i'm wonderful, apparently. just for the record, singers hate it when people say, "sing something", and piano players hate it when people say, "play something, and singers/piano players hate it when people say, "sing and play something." all are something that are best in performance, or spontaneously. i'm very bad on demand, in most cases, anyway. hmmm, that could be very bad. i smell like mosquito spray, because there were mosquitoes eating me alive, so i sprayed some on. good story, eh? i wore my glasses most of today.
