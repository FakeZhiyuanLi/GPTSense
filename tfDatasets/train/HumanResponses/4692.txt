back to nothing welll, i cant think of a single thing that happened all day that would be worth commenting oni suppose i could say something about my recitali was pretty damn nervous because i hadnt had enough time to practice it to the point where i was totally comfortable. while i was practicing, i kept getting stuck in spots. well, at the recital, i played it, and i played it well. no mistakes, other than a few off-notes because of clammy hands and slippery fingers. there is no sweeter sound than the burst of applause that comes after playing a piece and knowing that u fucking nailed that bitch. huge weight off my shoulders.unexpected phone call, took up some time, so i guess i'm done, off to bed.tomorrow's finally friday. this was one of those endless weeks.
