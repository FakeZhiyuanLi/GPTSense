so i got the room at the john street house. i can't wait to move in september 1st. laura and darcie seem awesome, so it should be all good. i think this well be move number 12 in the past 4 1/2 years. we're also playing our first show with the atomic machetes from fredericton on august 12th. i can't fucking wait for that. me and bruce have been friends for 15 years and have never played a show together. i've never played at ginger's tavern before, but it seems like an all right spot. i missed hissy fit last night. i wanted to check out sars and spincycle squared but i got lazy and tired. next year i guess. gonna go to stage nine saturday and see the stolen minks. i've never heard em but have heard great things.
