i'm a little bothered by the events of the past few days. all i remember is that i was sitting at my desk, installing windows xp on my desktop and surfing channels and watching saved episodes of star trek: deep space 9 (ds9) on my tivo. then all of a sudden it was gone. since then, i have not been able to locate my tivo remote control. it has completely vanished into thin air. i've cleaned about 75% of my room (and those of you who have had the honor of seeing my room, know that that's not an easy task!) and it's still nowhere to be found after calling pc richards and circuit city and about 10 minutes of searching i finally found a universal remote on yahoo! stores that works with tivo. so of course i ordered it for $14 plus $11 s/h (outrageous!) then i proceed besy buy's site to find they carry the same remote for only $19. and i can pick it up tomorrow. well, i called and emailed the yahoo! store and told them to cancel the order. we'll see what happens.
