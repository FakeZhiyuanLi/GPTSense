wow, i cried last night and this morning, and i think i may cry again at any second. somehow i don't feel as bad, though. maybe i'm accepting this, maybe i'm at another stage of my grieving. it's still hard to eat, i've lost something like three pounds this week. cosmopolitan says that if a guy isn't ready to make a commitment after being in a relationship for several years he really isn't in love. i guess that's food for thought. the female mind is a scary thing. mine makes up all kinds of weird scenarios. i think things like "what if he was lying and he did dump me for another chick", even though i know that's really unlikely. i get angry too, i think things like "he's a selfish coward"; but two seconds later i'm wondering what i might have done to drive him away.
