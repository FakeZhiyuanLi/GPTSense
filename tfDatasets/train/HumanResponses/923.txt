ok, so today was fun, i woke up, watched ping pong on the olympics, then around three i had to go to my trumpet lesson. when i got back i had the sudden urge to skateboard, so i went out back and started messing around as usual. but thats when it happened i landed an ollie on cement. it was my first and i was jubilent. so i was outside for two hours just doing ollies. then i went in side for a bit. then i went back outside and did more ollies then i landed a 180 ollies i was jubilent again. then, accidentally i did and ollie to pop shove it, what had happened was: i was doing an ollie, then as i landed the board did a shove it so i went with it. at that point i was extremely jubilent. i haven't really stopped smiling since. :d theo p.s. an ollie is a skateboard trick in which you jump with the board. and a pop shove it is another skateboarding trick in which you pop the board 180 degrees while you don't rotate at all.
