alright i now know that omry is at a jewish summer camp and is coming back on the 19th. unfortunately that is the day i am leaving to go to north carolina. i told juan, my friend who i am planning on making the manager, that we will hold our first meeting a few days after i get back from vacation and to tell zack and omry about it. i am going to make up for me being gone by getting a lot of song writing done in north carolina and being ready to do this thing as soon as i get back.
