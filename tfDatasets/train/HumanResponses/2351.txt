have just made it through my first day having probably broken something in my wrist (the scafoid bone was mentioned by a doctor; something in the thumb which doesn't show up in an x-ray). it hasn't been as bad as it could have been, but i guess i'm a bit concerned about my gigs later in the week, and that i won't be able to enjoy them as much as usual. things go pretty slowly when you can only type with your left hand. at least it's been helping me break my addiction to msn messenger during the working day, through non-realtime-ness being introduced into my typing speed.
