well tomorrow night at this exact time my senior friends are gonna be freshmen once again.but not in high school. a new chapter will begin in their lives. every senior for the past month has said how much they will miss mount carmel because it is such a great school. then they mention the lifelong friends they have made at mc. i wish i were that lucky; i only have one friend that will be lifelong. i wish i had more but i dont, probably because of all the crap thats wrong with me. im really looking forward to tomorrow, but in some way it scares me. will these people keep in touch or will it be me just trying to call them all summer? i'll just hope for the best.
