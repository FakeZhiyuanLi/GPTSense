hey ya'll! well, the sleep over at crystal's was much fun. we watched chicago, some of center stage and some of drop dead gorgeous and then just talked a lot. talked so much, in fact, that i only got about 45 minutes of sleep since we had to wake up at 6 to go down to the centre for load in. it wasn't too bad though. we got to leave before 10. ah! courtney and i were supposed to go see the notebook yesterday, but i was half dead and slept through my alarm.ding it i gotta see that movie like asap! thank god for no more skirts at practice. we take over the centre starting on monday, and i really hope i can get my own mirror this year. practices start going til 11:30.yay! or not. we'll have fun playing around and having the "theme days." (can't wait for "attitude t day!) but its gonna take a lot for me not to scream. or cry. gotta go run some errands, then get ready for the freedom festival parade.later!
