i see you've found my web journal. how many times have i come up with a joke in my head, and not had anywhere to write it down. i'll probably use this place to post it.because of course if i don't have access to a pen and paper to write down a joke, i must have be near a computer, right? don't question my logic, just smile and nod. actually, the real reason that i started this is because i've moved to the northeast side of baltimore, which is pretty far away from most of my friends, so i have a lot of free time.not that i didn't have a lot of free time when i lived in ellicott city. or college park for that matter. anyway, i'm not going to be one of those morons who puts his or her heart and soul out on the internet and then bitches about it when people read it. i'll also use this place to post things that are going on in my life, updates on house renovations, updates on chester the kitten, and updates on the show that i produce. that's it for now.
