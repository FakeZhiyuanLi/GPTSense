i've just been to school. seems mum forgot to inform me that there was a week-long induction at another school. brilliant. just what i needed. after four hours of sleep, i was woken up and told that i had to go to school. not even my school - some other one i might go to if i crap up my exams. met a couple of cool people, but it still doesn't balance having to get up at 7 after going to bed at 3, having to wear a suit (even though it is nice), and having to spend 6 hours at school. not working, but at school just the same. at least i'm home now. life has become sucky again. oobs.
