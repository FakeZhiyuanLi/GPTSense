well i found a home for my dog. he'll have 2 kids to run around and play with and 5 acre's and a new dog to play with. i know he will be well taken care of but i am so upset that i had to give him up. is that wrong? i hate to see him go and i could go visit him but i know i can't it will be to hard for me. he was such a good dog we were always together i took him everywhere and now a part of me is gone. i hate it. i dunno what to do with myself i just hope he knows it wasn't his fault and he didn't do anything wrong. i love him so much.
