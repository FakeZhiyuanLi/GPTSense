that is the song by paulina rubio that i've been obsessed with for 3 days now. heard 5 seconds of it on a commercial on vh1 and searched on yahoo for the title. paulina rubio apparently sings it. downloaded it from itunes music store and now can't stop playing it. but i have to play it on my ipod 'cause roommates are sick of hearing me play it on repeat. aaaahhhhhh
