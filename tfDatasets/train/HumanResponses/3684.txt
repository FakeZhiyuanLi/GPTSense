i have this huge craving to get a new cd. i don't know why, i have plenty that i don't listen to. anyway, i went online to see what music was out there by artists i liked already, and ones i had never heard of. i get to borders.com and type in the killers, the darkness, the vines, the shins, modest mouse, and a few others i had heard on the radio and liked. i listen to several clips from their albums, and guess what i hear. most of it is useless filler crap. i like one song on these cd's of twelve songs each. what's wrong with music? am i wrong to want to have a cd that has at least three good songs out of twelve? no wonder people download songs legally and illegally in and effort to prevent the pollution of their brains with meaningless boyband wanna be songs. the word of the day is: disenchantment
