forget limitations for a few minutes. does anyone believe that things happen for a reason? well forget that; you have to make your destiny. you have to make things happen. you have to control your life. no one puts a gun to my head commanding me to sit on my ass and wait for that big thing to happen. nothing is stopping me from being the next big thing. one thing i believed in my younger years is that i make my life happen. i never lost faith and i never gave in. now i sit waiting for things to happen, my faith broken, and my dreams on the sidelines. there is no bloody spoon. i have not seen things clearly.
