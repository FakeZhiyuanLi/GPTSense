i work for lilac window cleaning and this is my story. i started working here back in 1988 and left after a year and came back 6 years later after i let go by main window cleaning after a medical problem. it was a good time to move on so it was no big deal. me and the owner seem to hit heads a lot but it also happens with the other guys too. jim (owner) is not the easiest person to get along with. at the beginning of the day jim gives us a route sheet with all the information about the equipment we need for the day and a list and addresses of the jobs and who we are working with and the truck we will take. most of the time he has to remember who won't work together that week because of arguments we have had the last few days. it's not easy doing his job most of the time. that"s why most of us call him daddy.
