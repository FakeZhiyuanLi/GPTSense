so photography! i know both my readers will be upset that i kept them waiting so long. so here it is: the way i see it - and i apologize to all u aspiring photographers out there - all u have to do is press a button, and the picture is taken. duzn't seem to hard. now i know that there r many things to do and know for a great picture, and i have to admit, that of course the camera is a very amazing and complicated invention. but all things considered, the results aren't much better than a random old disposable camera. those were my two cents. p.s. for more pointless dribble, see my book: exploring the faults of everything
