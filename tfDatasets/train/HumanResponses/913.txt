well, that was fun. i'm so damn glad i chose not to do physics next year. that exam was so fucking boring it was unbelievable. and to top it off, they decided to concentrate on the bits i couldn't be arsed to revise so much. here's a tip for you all - don't spend your revision time chatting to people on im. at least i only have one more exam left - history. lame as hell, but it should be easy enough. gotta revise crime and punishment in the early modern period of britain. iow, witch burning. fun fun fun. ok, maybe the burning was fun, but revising it ain't. later, oobs.
