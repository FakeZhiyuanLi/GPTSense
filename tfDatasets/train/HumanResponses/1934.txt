ok, right now, i'm really hyped up on like.10 pounds of sugar and it's late at night, and i just want to get this in before i crash for the night. one day, a portal opened between two dimensions, our universe, and the fruit universe. in this "alternet universe" there are talking apples, grapes, bananas, lemons, limes, oranges, and many many other fruits and cheese, but the apples and grapes are evil! what they do is go from planet to planet, cutting down all the trees to take it over. then, when that portal opened, they tried to take over earth. "how?" you ask. well i'll tell you. they cut down all the trees, causing global warming on mars, making it crash into the sun, where the source of all cheese is, making it implode thus, making earth spin so fast it swings all the humans off. but thankfully we had the hippies to save us. but luckily for us, the hippies saved us
