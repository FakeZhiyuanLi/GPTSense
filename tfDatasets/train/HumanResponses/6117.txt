this week is pocono - 2.5 miles of superspeedway-road racing. it's a beautiful setting for burning rubber. i look forward to pocono - i was at a race there 2 years ago. highly recommend. i look for mayfield to do well. maybe it's bobby labonte's turn this week though. f1 is in montreal - i hope schumy does another brake test during a caution so he can get knocked out. look for bar to win.
