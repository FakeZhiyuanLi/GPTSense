well, i have my french and religion finals at 9:00am and 11:00am respectively. i haven't studied at all for religion, but if you've read my other posts, i've obviously done some serious work for french. we'll see, plus its going to be a bit weird to have my forensics coach proctor my final, but i guess it doesn't matter. i am really looking forward to getting to nationals and seeing this year through. speaking of, this whole thing is going to be one massive party, even though its in utah. hoping that something will happen there, i'm looking for semi-finals, and if i'm really lucky finals. ten four hour prelim rounds over five days is going to be tough, and so will the eight remaining hours of semis/finals. besides winning something worthwhile i need to have some fun there, its supposed to be one big party, i don't see how considering how tired we will be. but maybe i can get some action, if not i am just going to be pissed. but thats how life goes i guess.
