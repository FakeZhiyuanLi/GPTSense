tomorrow i shall return sunburnt and happy, because the lewis and clark birthday bash thing is tomorrow, and i have a date! yay! and famous and amber, along with jake, chelsie, and abbey, and matthew will be there. i hope dinger shows up, because i miss that kid. ive found yet another bestfriend, whom i think of as seth and shanes brains mixed up, put into a 14 year old andy petersens head, with willie mcsweeneys hair, and loyal penningtons fashion sense. yayayay! jake peterson!
