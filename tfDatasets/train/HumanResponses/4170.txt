so its my day to bring in breakfast to the office today, which is a whole lot more stressful than buying bagels should be. plus, i woke up late which sucks and sort of threw off the morning schedule. but i ended up buying 2 and a half dozen bagels, 2 packs of muffins, a dozen bagels, 3 tubs of cream cheese and a tub of i can't believe it's not butter light. and then the cashier was grumpy! come on, smile for your $5.15 an hour.
