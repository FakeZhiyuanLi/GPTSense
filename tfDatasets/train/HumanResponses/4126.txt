i went for my ogd today. it was an experience that well, while it was pretty unpleasant while it lasted, it was pretty exciting nonetheless! i had never had an iv line set on me before! let alone had endoscopy done! and i didn't have to pay a single cent! professional courtesy i guess. i am a doctor too after all.
