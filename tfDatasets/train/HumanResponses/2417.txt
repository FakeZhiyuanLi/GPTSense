today is my first day of work. it is very exciting. to think that i am actually going to work in the real world. no more summer jobs, i am going to get paid. keep checking back to see how the transition takes place from excited college graduate jumping into the workplace to disgruntled employee who hates his boss ;). i just keep thinking about the movie, "office space" for some reason. i think that i should get a job with google, that would never get boring. not only that, but i could get a gmail account. i think i will look into that. check back on how the process is going.
