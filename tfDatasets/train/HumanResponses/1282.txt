i recently spent 4 days (july 23-27) in new orleans with my girlfriend and my cousin, derek. i must tell you, it was probably one of the best times of my entire life. i fell in love with that city, and for a couple days after coming back i was seriously having withdrawals about being away from it. it's magnificent. there is so much to do, and so much that i wasn't able to do. a plan is already in the works for a bunch of us to go back for mardi gras. new orleans has got to be the greatest city in america, as far as i'm concerned, anyway. and the locals are great  except for one lady who was running an expensive mask store, but she can bite me. you can seriously wander around the french quarter for a full day and not do everything it has to offer, which is surprising because it's only 7 blocks long and 4 blocks wide.anyway, i'm looking forward to going back and i'm getting nostalgic just thinking about it. sad, huh? not really if you've ever been.
