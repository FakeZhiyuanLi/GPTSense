i feel like i’m in a small ball in a dark corner. just when i think everything is alright reality hits me. i wish people wouldn’t hurt me. but i let them…how do you stop it, how do you stop the hurt. every time something happens someone i trust breaks it and hurts me. some times i think if i die i could change it, i could come back better then what i am. everyone thinks i’m strong, everyone depends on me. it just makes me weaker. but i have to hide it, stay strong for them, stay strong for me.
