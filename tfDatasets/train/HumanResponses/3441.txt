after a day of great accomplishments and yet of none a day of never leaving and not being worldly a day of not accomplishing anything of material value that will be of benefit to my material progression after a day such as this i look and with great wonder i regard the accomplishments of revelations revealed of friendships deepened and of some renewed of bonds re-claimed and spirits lifted a day when i can see around me the souls i have touched and in so touching have blessed and made happy the joy i have added the light i have shared and then i wish that every day could be like this one. jo smith, august 2004
