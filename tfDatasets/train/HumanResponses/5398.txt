i was thinking i was going to have a nice, relaxing weekend (a 3-dayer), but, alas, that is not to be. i have pet-sitting all weekend (only 1 job, so not terrible), and dinner plans every night. saturday we are going out with jason and gail (they might sleep over) and sunday it's barbara and david. so much for rest and relaxation. i feel like we have just been zooming around. i just want to sleep the entire 3 days. oh well. it could be fun. i might go check out some memorial day sales around. i have been selling so much stuff onebay i have nothing left to wear. i will be sending out my resume this weekend too. i think to 2 places. we shall see what comes of that.
