it's 7:45 am. i have to work at 10 am. why  oh why am i still awake? 7:45 am is evidently a great time to start a blog. blog  sounds kind of neutrally derogative. im tired. blah. i know my boss is going to be a dick head if im late. he can throw the biggest sissy fits. what a baby. i think his wife owns his ass he works to escape her. that's so horribly depressing.
