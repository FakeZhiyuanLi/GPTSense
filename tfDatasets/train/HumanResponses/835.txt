we went to his keynote this morning. interesting guy, definitely not what i expected, but not by any means in a bad way. of interesting note is the temptation inherent with apple's rendezvous technology. berners-lee was on the same wireless hotspot i was on and using his laptop during his speech. if you have, or ever have had, an apple anything, you know this could be very bad if i was just a hair more malicious. his name popped up on my rendezvous buddy list and i so wanted to im him, but held back that urge. would that not have been in the middle of his keynote muhahha.
