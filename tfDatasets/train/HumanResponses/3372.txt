here i am, just a few days into my blogging career and i can already see myself losing focus on everything that is important. sorry hun, "i've got to go do some research." which in essence means i need to search active bloggers for like intelligence and interests. hopefully i will completely lose interest in the bond market, lose my job, and be forced to blog professionally. does anyone know if there are blog offs? much like dance offs? they should make a movie and call it "you got blogged". or as my buddies would prefer to say.stop being such an f-ing nerd.
