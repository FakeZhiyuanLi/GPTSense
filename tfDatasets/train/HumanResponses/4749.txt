here's my lovely ear. the majority see it and say, "ewwww, how the hell did you get that in there?" nice, huh? if you're wondering, the actual earring is one of those little tubes that hold glow sticks in a loop so you can wear them round your neck or whatever. i can't afford real plugs :( random crap for the day: swaying to the rhythm of the new world order and counting bodies like sheep to the rhythm of the war drums keep your head down go to sleep to the rhythm of the war drums more lyrics. i am boring.
