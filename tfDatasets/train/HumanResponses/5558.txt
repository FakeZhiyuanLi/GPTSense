the finals to [euro 2004] are here! by right i should be sleeping now. but i don't care, soccer's more important. update on semi-finals, portugal won holland 2-1. portugal - ronaldo (26), maniche (58). holland - van nistelrooy (63). czech republic against greece, greece won, 1-0 by dellas in the 105th minute. very unexpcted, but i'm certain that portugal will knockout greece at the end of it all. the next tournament will be the [fifa 2006], i think. rooting for england to smash the records, when that comes! beckham can't let all us english fans down!
