well, i'm not this old yet. went for a drive yesterday w/ a 80+ year old man. i've never feared for my life as i did that day. crossing lanes of traffic, blinkers - what are they good for?, getting on parkways at 20 mph, going from 2nd to 5th and about that. old folks should move from the stick to the automatic, just for reactions sake. but the best for last. "can you find me a parking spot to pull through. i hate backing out. my last 2 accidents were from backing out." jeeze.
