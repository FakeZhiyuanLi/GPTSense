an instinctive step for other people, but a massive step for me: making friends.i can safely say that i have managed to make friends in my class,although i think it's just superficial.guess a close friend of mine managed to convince me that i need friends to get by school.at first i scoffed at the idea,and i still do,but maybe not having friends would compound my sufferings.so,what the heck,i opened my mouth and voila,people actually wanted to talk to me.i consider myself an anti-social and most probably alot of anti-socials face this predicament too.however,i prefer to keep my 'friends' as that;just friends,no more,no less.i reckon they will just be a fleeting memory in my mind because personally,i'd rather forget about ite if and when i move on to real tertiary education.
