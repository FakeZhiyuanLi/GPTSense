this week i have been through the worst storms of my life. the kind where you sit and watch the window and outside it looks like someone is standing above your window and turning a spot light on and off every two or three seconds. except the spotlight lights everything into day and it is accompanied by a crack and a rumble that shakes the house around you. every time there is a lightning flash it freezes the water droplets in the air like in the matrix revolutions. the kind of storms where you sit and you really don't want to touch anything because you know that the next flash will strike you. those are the thunderstorms that have been coming around the last week.
