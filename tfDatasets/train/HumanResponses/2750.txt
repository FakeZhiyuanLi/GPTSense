today after school i had to go to the orthodontist, where they just reminded me of everything i already fucking know about my teeth. i'll probably never get my braces off. around 8 pm i fell asleep. of course, no one fucking woke me up, so i just woke up on my own about 10 minutes ago. i tried setting an alarm to wake me up after an hour, i guess that didn't work. doesn't look like i'll do finishing my essay or project . i'm too exhausted to care anymore. this weekend i need to get new shoes.
