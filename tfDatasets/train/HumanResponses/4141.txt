i am not a great fan of sport. neither is my family. but somehow my dad is watching the table tennis match for bronze, starring li jiawei. heh - can hear screams emanating from the tv. actually it's pretty sad. the north korean player screaming like a fruitcake must be pretty tiring, like gerald tay going "twit." do international sport competitions encourage hatred of foreigners?
