when i first moved to sanford, i transferred from the shaw's in auburn to the one here (obviously, right?) anyhoo, they didn't need a seafood clerk or really anyone, so they kind of squeezed me back in on the front end as a bagger/carryout and bottle clerk, but they can only give me 20 hours a week. yesterday when i got my check i got my schedule, which was for a little over 30 hours and i am being trained on the register. what's funny is that if this had happened when i worked for shaw's at first, i would have been so hyper and spastically happy. now i'm just happy that i'll be working inside on the register instead of outside getting sunburn behind a load of carts. so that's cool. more hours = more money.
