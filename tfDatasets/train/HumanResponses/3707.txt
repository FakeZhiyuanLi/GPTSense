they say that the first man a girl falls in love with is her father. although, i may be my father's third love - next to my grandmother and my mother, the bond between a father and a daughter is quite special. unlike his first two, i am a product of his love and guidance. thank you dad - for teaching me that it is okay to laugh at yourself, for living for the moment, for being able to speak my mind, for respecting myself and others, for teaching me family values and for humility. if it wasn't for you (and mom) i wouldn't be the woman i am today. am i daddy's little girl? always. happy 60th birthday dad! love, shanna
