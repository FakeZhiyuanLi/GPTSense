blah blah bliddey bliddey blah blah blah. such a good mood. lifes pretty neat sometimes. my friends are all miserable, my daddy is being more protective than ever, and my mommy doesn't like me very much, but im okay with all of it. i keep feeling like im still in florida, just laying on the white sand, soaking up the endless sun. warm. happy. perfect.
