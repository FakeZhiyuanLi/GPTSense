i wish i could say something in the blog to make it intresting.but i can't. it was the same old story at schley. teachers talking to students about trucks and fishing.sad really. i skipped lunch because it's just awkward in there. the principals are all men.that's not cool. the more i go here the more i really want to go back to assbad. i don't know anyone here and no one here is worth knowing. oh well, i'll try to last through the first semester. sadly yours.
