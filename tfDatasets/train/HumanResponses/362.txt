on the agenda today is a variation on being unfairly judged, and i like to call it: being analyzed by someone who thinks they know how to analyze henna, today, has decided to analyze the fact that i asked her advice about my problem before, being unwanted. so she said im trying to subconciously get her to talk to poire fore me and im like?no thats not it and anyways we got into a big fight where she continued to make judgements about me and anything ive ever done. yup. my response you dont know everything henna ok? i know youd like to think that, but oh well, you dont. you try and try to stay one step superior of everyone around you, but guess what? by doing that you sound stupid and patronizing. i asked your advice. on a problem i was having with a mutual friend. i didnt ask what my latest feeling was. you pass judgements on me based on little or no evidence. your all washed up hon and you know it.
