my sunburn is stinging so bad.i'm kinda glad its not sunny today. we're going to the stream again, we were meant to be swimming in it today-no way. i have 3 bruises from last time, when i fell in. there is no chance i'm swimming in there. if it brightens up, i might dare to dip my toe in, but the memories of falling flat on my face while sara practically falls off the bridge because of laughing at me, and j and meg screaming away like hyenas. ah well. spoke to dad.new plan, grandma arrives on friday. great. and she's taking me to see the god damn lion king musical and then she's taking me to madame toussauds. great. so anyway it's nice and cold so of course, we are going to go and sit out in it. our logic is amazing. when its sunny, we sit there looking bored. when its cold, we go and paddle in the stream. our intellect knows no boundries. i'm going to go and get a wooly jumper and brave the weather.
