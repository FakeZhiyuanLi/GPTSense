yeah actually the post yesterday i didn't finish. so i'm in team studies right now doing another one of these thingys. yesterday was our metro north performance thing. it was fun. i think we messed up on the last number though. other than that it was pretty good. tomorrow we go to branson though, then to silver dollar city. we're going to be judged on the performance, but we're not in the competition, although i think we should be. performance is around 10:30 or so, and whenever that's over, we go straight to silver dollar city until whenever time and we get back home around 11:00 or 12:00 pm. so it should be fun. yeah i'm going to go now. bye bye.
