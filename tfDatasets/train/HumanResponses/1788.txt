staying up late is screwing up everything. when i don't have enough sleep, i want to drink coffee, which i don't drink, and i want to eat chocolate, which i don't want to eat. at the very least i want to eat something . i think i should go home and take a nap. but, i rode my bike today, and i the thought of riding home right now is pretty daunting. i can barely hold my head up!
