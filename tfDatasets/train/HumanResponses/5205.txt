hmmm. went on a blind date last night. first time i've ever done that. it was. interesting. got a good meal out of it. sushi. yum. the guy is nice enough, but i'm not attracted to him at all. seems to like me a bit, though. how do i tell him i'm not interested? i would love to know. just came home from a bbq at my parents house. luckily my dad is in california. it was mom, stel, max, and his girlfriend kim. if she married him, her name would be kim kimbrough! i think it's funny. anyway, i'm just rambling. nothing important to say. saw farenheit 9/11 yesterday. it was amazing. i think everyone should see it, democratic or not. it was very powerful. i felt emotionaly drained when it was over. very proud of myself for not crying. was close a few times, but no tears (which is rare.) i guess that's it for now. if i think of anything revelent to say, i will be back.
