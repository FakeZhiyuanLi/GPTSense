21:42 how hot is it! oh hang on i have thermo on my telephone. 26* ok it's been up to 27*, but still is really warm today. waiting for the storms. spoke to phil, last member done, just need to wait on cancelling the room and that's it, end of an era. dentist this morning. nearly 20 quid for a check up, but got referred for wisdom tooth. bonus. got to work at nearly 11, even better. work got revenge with an afternoon of scripting (i'm not even going to begin to explain!) my back door still smells of cat pi$$. no idea where it has come from or a cure, tried scrubbing. my door is rotten anyway so perhaps it's soaked in? a new door may be the answer. anyway, all showered ready for another day. let's hope last nights insomnia doesn't set in. holiday shopping wednesday lunch.
