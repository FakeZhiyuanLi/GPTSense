well, i've noticed that a lot of people who blog here write like they are expecting someone to read what they have said. fuck that. i don't care whether or not anyone reads my thoughts. actually, i would probably be happier if no one did. others are writing like they know they already have an audience, and they really care what they think. i am writing for myself. so screw all of you pretecious assholes. sorry, i'm just annoyed in general right now. although, aqua teen hunger force is about to start, so i should be ok in a minute. funny show. carl's my favorite character. he cracks me up. so i'm gonna go watch this show and go to bed, cause i have to wake up at 8:15 for the 9th day in a row god that sucks so, good night my imaginary readers. sweet dreams if possible.
