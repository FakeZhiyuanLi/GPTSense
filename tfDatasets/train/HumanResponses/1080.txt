yay! i just got back from one of the awesomest trips i've ever been on. i went with my puppet ministry group to kankakee, illinois to the international festival of puppetry and ventrilliquism (sp) or "i-fest" for short. it was a blast, we learned so much and were all really inspired to continue furthuring our ministry and spreading the word. i got so many good ideas for props in the skits and really developed a desire to want to do puppets myself. i also want to learn to do live puppetry and create my own character with all sorts of manorisms and life in its own. i think with time, this could be something really awesome, and i'll be praying for it. god bless, nick
