100 million legally download songs have been purchased and downloaded on apple itunes. apple will have a list of the winners in a few days so just wait it out and pray you were one of the winners. although this is all great i have been submitting every time it gets close to every hundred thousand song and i had been submitting but i didn't check the the number of songs downloaded counter and totally missed the 100 million song.
