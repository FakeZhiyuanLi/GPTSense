rockies tell stynes to go elsewhere the colorado rockies are apparently telling chris stynes to hit the road. stynes hit .255 with 11 homers and 73 rbis last season. stynes, never known for his power strugged since his fluke 2000 season with the reds. styles smiled his way to 550k of the rockies money last season. he started 111 games at third and 4 at second base. quoted from the denver post "the rockies, feeling confident of signing vinny castilla, have instructed chris stynes to pursue a starting job elsewhere." apparenly the rockies are dumb enough to think stynes could be a starter.
