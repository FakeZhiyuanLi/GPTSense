holy crap, im so pissed off, i just wrote my best blog ever and just finished and it kicked me off. ahhhhhhhhhh! heres the short version, spilt nesquick powder on floor, put it back in container along with cat and dog hair, i still drank it all, got in trouble. congrats to phelps, first gold medal for the usa. would you rather stare at the sun until you go blind or have 5 finger nails pulled from your body? ouch and animal hair tastes weird.
