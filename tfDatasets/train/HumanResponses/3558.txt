at this point in my life it feels like i'm going through so much. like idon't know who i am or where i belong. i also am feeling depressions and inner pain i never knew. i don't know why, it's not like my life is bad or anything. i full of nothing but a bunch of mixed emotions and just really upset. i dunno why.but well.who knows.
