thank you nick for pointing me to this profile creator. having a normal webpage got really boring so i decided to try this out. anyway, welcome to my profile. i'll post more things about halo when i get around to it. responce to comment: i have that old 50free host that i've been using for image and movie hosting to host pictures and the actual profile itself (as you can see by the filename).
