the calm within the hurricane is where the peaceful soul resides. amidst the worry and the turmoil, a womb in which to hide. it’s the sun, shinning brightly above the clouds and storm, burning with desire it heal, caress and warm. the soul is like a prisoner constrained in life’s decay. but love can free the peacefulness enslaved beneath the clay. resting deep within you like a child yet to be, lies the soul of all tomorrows, yesterdays, and in-betweens. listen to the moments in the calm within the storm. let wisdom guide your love to help the peacefulness be born. this is just my get away, my peace. there is not very many out there for people to run away to. my peace well i guess a lot of others peace is difficult to get to like a storm, and once you reach the eye its calm and quiet.
