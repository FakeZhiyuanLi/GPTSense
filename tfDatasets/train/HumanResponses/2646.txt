ok my couple of days off from work are about to end soon. i felt i was getting some things accomplished on line this week. i still have to fix the mistakes at the other diary page. no, no i won't drop the name here. i found some more graphic resources this week that was a plus. i must admit you can go only so far with the kind of graphics i am doing. which leads me to my next project making the graphics myself. in my frustration i tend to do things my own way. it takes me a while but i eventually do it. god i need more hard drive space! i need a new computer! don't know when my next day off is? got to go, wishing wet dreams for everybody :p
