thank god for that result, it will give us the world of good, rooney will be a bonafide star after that game, am currently watching france losing, and i cant really decide if thats a good or bad thing. im currently wit steph at the moment, and im gonna get her onto football by the end of the tournament, watch this space for that. shes so perfect, i can honestly say that since being with her i havnt had a stress moment like i usually do. that usually results in chairs gettin thrown, and my cat being kicked, well attempted to kick, cos shes very agile. i wish id neva let ross see alan partridge, all he bloody goes on about is corby trouser presse's have nuting on now till nxt wednesaday, history, or as i affectionatly call it, boring bollocks! tlk later m.c
