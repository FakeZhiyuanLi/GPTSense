cum on the elevator floor a blonde, a brunette and a redhead enter an elevator. as they walk in they notice a small puddle of white liquid on the floor of the elevator. the brunette bends down for a closer look, and states, very matter-of-factly, "it looks like cum." the redhead stoops down a little closer, takes a deep breath through her nose, and proclaims, "yes, and it smells like cum." the blonde stoops down yet closer, puts the tip of her finger into the puddle, touches it to her tongue and exclaims, "well, its nobody from our building."
