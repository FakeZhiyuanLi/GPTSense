when i met you i was hypnotized because i saw the beauty inside i didn't know what to do i just knew i had to be with you so i wrote you a letter asking if we could ever be together you said ok i'll give it a try and i said i'll be there to dry your eyes and all these years you are still in my heart it would just tear me up if we were apart so let it always be me and you i promise i'll always stay true by troy
