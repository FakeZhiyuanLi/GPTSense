finished writing chapter 3, 4, 5 and 6 of [the last chance], currently midway writing chapter 7. i'm slightly in front of schedule, i didn't plan chapter 6 to be written 'til tomorrow! i haven't gotten any reviews other than the original four, though, which were written about the first two chapters. hoping for more reviews! trying to get dad to find out the scores of the [euro 2004] for me, can't wait for the quarter finals; channel5 is gonna broadcast live! (i don't have cable tv.)
