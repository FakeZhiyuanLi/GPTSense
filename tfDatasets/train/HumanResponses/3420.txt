piffle and humph. alright, perhaps that's a shade harsh. after all, blogger's never been anything but kind to me, though i find the house rules a bit antiquated. registration to comment indeed! i've gone along with it, but i've taken umbrage. as you can see, i've broken down and registered. but be it known that i only did so because i wanted to be able to post comments on other people's blogs and couldn't unless i got a blogger name of my own. i was happy that my web nomme de plume wasn't taken. one of us, one of us, gabba, gabba, we accept you. yeah, i know. i'm the only one who's seen "freaks." oh well. vive live journal! vive quebec! vive jay sherman! i'll stop now.
