god bless america! they've given us so much. mcdonalds, for example. the right to invade another country just because we don't like the way they do things over there. the american way. i'm not sure if this is why i'm expected to really give a toss about completing all my work before my leaving date, for the good of the company of course. while i don't want to drop my friends in it, i could just swing the lead for another 6 weeks, take some holidays and do as little as possible. they're not going to keep me back after my leaving date are they? some kind of perverse, grown-up detention
