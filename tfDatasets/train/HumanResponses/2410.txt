though i've tried before to tell her of the feelings i have for her in my heart every time that i come near her i just lose my nerve as i've done from the start every little thing she does is magic everything she do just turns me on even though my life before was tragic now i know my love for her goes on do i have to tell the story of a thousand rainy days since we first met it's a big enough umbrella but it's always me that ends up getting wet every little thing she does is magic everything she do just turns me on even though my life before was tragic now i know my love for her goes on i resolve to call her up a thousand times a day and ask her if she'll marry me in some old fashioned way but my silent fears have gripped me long before i reach the phone long before my tongue has tripped me must i always be alone?
