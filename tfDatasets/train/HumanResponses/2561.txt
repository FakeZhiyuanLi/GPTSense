this movie hit in japan and i love it, too. i like bruce willis he is sexy and charming. i like the most characeter he played the role in this movie, i cried very much at the scene which he decided to leave a planet alone and he pushed his daugter's fiance back to the ship and he told to him that he thought about him like his son. i like sf movie from childhood. the movie's song hit in japan, too. "i don't want to miss a thing" by aerosmith when i hear this song, i remind this movie and i'm impressed. also i like liv tyler she is beautiful. maybe i'm japanese so i like actress with black hair i feel they're beautiful. i like sandra block, too. sometimes i see armageddon again and again. i don't get bored even if how many times i see this movie.
