i was 2 1/2 hours late for work today. nobody really noticed. i couldn't sleep at all last night and didn't fall asleep until 6am. my alarm went off at 8am and i knew right then i wouldn't make it. i hate doing that, but whatever. i gotta talk to chris tonight. i'm dreading it. he turns everything into an arguement and makes it impossible to talk like a reasonable person. i gotta do it though.
