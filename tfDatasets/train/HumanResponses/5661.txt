hey former cohorters, i thought it would be cool to set up a weblog so we can communicate and keep in touch with each other. please post comments and let us all know what you are doing this summer/ job status/ etc. also, some funny, inspiring and interesting student teaching stories would be good. i realize many of you are probably on vacation. not me, i have no money, no job, and nowhere to go. hence, this weblog. anyways, hope you guys will post on here. click on a category on the right that fits your post. may the road rise to meet you, amy n.
