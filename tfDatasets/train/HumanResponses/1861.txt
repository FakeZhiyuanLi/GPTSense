to whom it may concern, folks like me, you used to burn. you’d do it all again today, if given the chance and you had your way. you call yourselves the christian right, spreading hate, your “god given right.” prejudice, unknowing, diversity naught, where in your book is all of this taught? really only the names have been changed, the faces, ideas, and beliefs are the same. matthew shepherd tied to a fence and burned, after all of these years, no lessons you’ve learned. the vile words spread, the beliefs that you share, encourage these actions, the blame you shall bare. ignorance, closed-minded, spreading hate, i fail to see where exists a debate. i am not sure to what god you pray, however, it’s clear that you’ve lost your way. some peace i feel, wisdom reveal, hatred in words your godly device, what you send out will come back to you thrice.
