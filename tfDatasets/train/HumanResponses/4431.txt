i've been thinking about my "friend." he is someone who has been hurt by others in the past, and so tends to think the worst of people. he often finds things wrong with others when there is no cause. a few weeks ago he made some wild accusations about someone. i did not respond well. we had a huge fight. we worked it out, and he realized the problem wasn't with this person, but was something else entirely. i had thought we had gotten past this, but i guess i was wrong. this is probably for the best. i get migraines when i'm under stress, and with him i was averaging one a week. the whole experience made me realize i need to take care of some things in my own life. i can't have friends who continually bring me down with a negative outlook on life and humanity. life is too short for cynicism.
