i've been working on the fence in the backyard. it incorporates a retaining wall which cost us $2,000 and won't be going anywhere soon. the fence sits on top of it. i also had to repair the neighbors dilapidated fence as it fell over when i took mine down. i had to tie some wire on it to keep it from falling over. update: i'm done with all that i can do. now it's on to taking out old vegetation that we dont' want. there is a shrub and some rosemarry and a thorny blackberry vine that need to make way for a vegetable garden and some grass. :)
