i know i'm way past my blogging limit for the day (3 entries now), but i finally found my lipstick yesterday. i've been searching all over the place for the color i like and haven't been able to find it (revlon colorstay's fig if you're interested). well lo and behold, they have it at shoppers food warehouse, about 5 minutes from where i work. i might be pissed except i am so overjoyed to have found it that i can't be.
