u know with things not goin my way these days, the only thing i really have to look forward to is doing my work. even though there are certain reasons at work that are not helping my situation, doing my work is the different story. lets just say i had a chance up to the plate and i struck out. i'm kicking myself cause i know i can handle it but i didn't swing the bat fast enough. i know if i get a second chance i won't miss again.
