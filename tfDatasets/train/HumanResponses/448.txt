these days mummy always nagging non-stop 1st about daddy's company2nd me playing too much games.3rd sisters not giving her enough allowances. blah blah i act deaf and dumb but sometimes just too much can't take it. guess sleeping is the best solution! dear it is not because i want to pig. just that pigging i can't hear. then at night i can stay awake enjoying my peace. though i can only play games and watch tv. better than hearing those 'music'! hmm dear hope you can take me away. you know i hate all these nagging. and asking me for money when i haven't even start work yet. wondering now if my salary is enough to survive paying my bills. food transport. mum's allowances if she don't make me angry. how i wish i am living alone by myself nobody to bother me. am i insane or what.? i am also a human  got my own worries especially now embarking to a new stage.
