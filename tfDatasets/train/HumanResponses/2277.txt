that's today right? yah it is. anyway, i got up at 8:00 and then went to the track. i ran really hard for one minute then ran at a slow pace. i did this for half an hour. then i went home, took a shower and did some chores. after swimming at my neighbors i came in and used the computer. this has been one boring day.
