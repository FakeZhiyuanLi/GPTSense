^sadness^ still thinking of him. don know why. everytime i hear this song. my tears will flow once more. even he is just beside me. it will not be the same anymore i hope that we will be together again but a hope is still a hope i must still face reality when i am awake from the dream he gave. i think that we should't have met so that reality can't hurt me once more.
