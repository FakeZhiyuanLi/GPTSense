hoping to find purpose, find direction, to end the wandering, destroy the void, why must they always be here, never leaving, how can i escape from this place, boundaries. boundaries set by me, restricted by same, walls enclosing, thirsty in a desert of illusion, hungry in a sea of emptiness, lost inside a map. needing something, but i know not what, capture by meaningless, drowned by routine, impatience persists, calculated to perpetuate, hollowness, and fear. doubt creeping back into the mind, worth decreasing systematically, shadow clouding my soul, poisoning my heart. progress past forgotten, reversion to the horizon with darkness in the forecast, and a rut in the mud. how do i escape… how do i defeat… how do i move… how do i see light… how do i avoid past mistakes… how do i beat setback… how do i step forward… how do i wander aimlessly again… how do i handle torture… how do i fight demons… how do i survive…. do i survive?
