all day i've been plugging away at the computer for work. i'm usually out and about, but not today. emails, phone calls, organizing.all very tedious. have been at my desk since 8 a.m. i might as well get my own business up and running in this manner. if i'm going to work these hours, i should be doing it for myself. that's it. i can't type anymore. i have thai food in my gut and my cat and man ready for bed. one sidenote: i'm not a fan of michael moore, but he may have something to say lately that's relevant. if only we could get through all the lefty/righty hyperbole and find out what the fuck is really going on.
