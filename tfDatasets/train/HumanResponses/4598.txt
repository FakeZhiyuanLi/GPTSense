for the last two days, we have had a monsoon cloud cover in jaipur. nothing like the ones in assam or the western ghats, still, it has been such a relief from the searing heat and humidity for several days earlier. don't really know how long it wil persist but prayers, even official, are being sent incessantly. however, agriculture experts believe that the damage has already been done because the showers didn't arrive in time for the sowing season.
