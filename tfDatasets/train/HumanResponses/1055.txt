i went out shopping this afternoon, hence why i wasn't online - sorry em. i got some really cool long black boots. expensive but awesome! plans for the holidays? well, obviously there's reading festival, and then in early august i'm going to italy for a week with my family. but that's it really. what about you others? anyone up for a get together sometime soon?
