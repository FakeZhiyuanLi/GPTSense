holy shit there are so many god damn ants on my desk, gotta keep flicking em off listening to vietnow - ratm right now, kcik ass song, but i cant listen to it loud cuz my moms having a "o my god the neighbors are coming in 1/2 an hour and im not even ready" fit. i saw avp (alien vs predator) today, and i thought it was pretty gud. i like sci fi for some reason, specially the alien movies, but i wanted predator to win, cuz hes just as kick ass. the ending was kinda confusing, but wat teh hell you gotta go with it. hella tight action scenes tho. wohooo still listening to ratm, awesomeeeeeeee.
