i'm not sure if mum is going to kill me because i didn't get home last night until 12, after she went to bed and i told her i'd only be 20 minutes at 9:30. but she has been pretty good with those things lately. i'm really bad at losing track of time, or ignoring it, lately. it's kinda a bad habit to get into. well so far this morning i haven't done much. i feel bad about yesterday, maybe i did over reached a little to jen's comment in elle's blog but that's just part of who i am.
