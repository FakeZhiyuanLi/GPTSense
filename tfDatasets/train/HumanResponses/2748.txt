this is my first entry and have nothing to say. im hoping i could do this everyday so i can journal my life as i am going into a great bordedom and uncertainty about my future career and relationships. everyday for me is a routine, quite a cycle of very little assortment, less variation, but i am already used to it. no complaints, just ranting, i guess.
