i'm about to head out to see elvis and thought i should write a little about yesterday. i've begun to fully recover from my eye infection and the flu seems to have run its course. i was able to make it to football practice yesterday for the first time. it was nice having the whistle around my neck again. i got myself beat up pretty bad by the players in a hitting drill where i was the tackling dummy. i then played a full contact game with them, scoring two touchdowns, but paying the price in bruised arms and ribs. after a short nap i was ready for a night out on the town with some good folks. it was an all right night but not busy enough for my liking. even though i was sick and had pounded myself through a football practice, i outlasted the group, finally going to bed at 4:30. i'm headed out again tonight alone this time. greggie is in lethbridge. i'm going to catch the elvis show and then maybe head over to the heritage depending on how i'm feeling come midnight/1 a.m.
