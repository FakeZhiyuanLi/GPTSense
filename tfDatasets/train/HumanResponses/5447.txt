it is the first day of classes and i have had to many problems to count. first i was told to come to the counseling office to get a contract for a self-pace course. but when i get there i can't get the course because my grade point average is to low. then i we sit down a try to find solution for the problem but another obstacle gets in my way. we can get any classes for this term because classes have already started. luck me i have to deal with the fact that all of my classes are in the same term. i tell you one thing, this is going to make for a interesting term.
