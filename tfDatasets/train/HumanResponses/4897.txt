not much new here. i've been working on my resume and cover letter for ideo. hopefully i'll get that off sometime this week. i'm really excited about the possibilities of working for a place like that. it's too bad that they're not really hiring right now. still, i think i have a pretty good shot with a lot of the experience i have from my masters thesis and working at motorola this year. we'll see how it goes. i had a good conversation at lunch today with another friend from work that just confirmed again that i really do need to get away from motorola. there's just so much wrong with the labs there right now, and no hope of getting better anytime soon. so we'll see where this next year takes me!
