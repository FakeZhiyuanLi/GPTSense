lately i realize that my problems are not the worst thing in the world . . . does this mean i am cured? not likely, but i have realized that despite what i may not have, that does nothing to devalue those things i have had all my life. my values, my beliefs, my principles . . . whatever you call it, i have them. i have friends, i have family, i have my physical health . . . all things i should be grateful of, and i am going to practice for the future. i only hope that this doesn't end up in a 'only down from here' mood :)
