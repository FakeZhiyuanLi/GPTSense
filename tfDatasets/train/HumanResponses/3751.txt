oo na! mababaw na ako! i just don't like it when people do this. yes, it is my pet peeve. i can't help it. i was born this way. some pm here borrowed my pencil kasi gagamitin daw ng director. kanina pa yun. when i checked again, they're both gone.with my pencil! i'm so attached pa naman to that pencil.it's my favorite. it's a rotring 0.5 mechanical pencil. it's only my second rotring in 10 years. my first just gave up on me. ganon! and i just can't accept na mawawala lang itong isa dahil sa kagagahan ng pm na ito! burarang old maid yun! pweeehh! leche grrr i'm so inis! *murmur* *grumble*
