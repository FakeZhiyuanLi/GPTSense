sitting here and its quite late. i'm listening to snow patrol - run, well i was and now i've got evanescence - my immortal. don't know why i'm listening to such sad depressing songs, i ain't even feeling that bad. had a good night on thursday - even if she did keep the lion lol. just reached into my pocket and pulled out the tracing paper. i guess i'll have to work on that next week. one thing i knew, is that you love me. another thing i knew, is that another loves me. and i'm so sorry. i hope you get over me, and realise that i'm not who you need. eels - i need some sleep. i seriously need therapy.
