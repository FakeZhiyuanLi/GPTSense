i never did get to meet patti today. last minute, she backed out claiming to need to babysit. around 3:00 pm, we planned to get together around 6:00 pm. i called her at 5:00 pm to get directions and arrange where we would meet and she suddenly had something else to do. this is not the first time recently i have been cancelled on last minute. one day i will find someone who isn't this flaky. it's a shame that there's so many people like this out there.
