it’s a beautiful day on cheyenne river where the people are smart and funny, where they gather the first weekend in september to whoop it up with carnival rides and cotton candy…. where the best of show of cucumbers to photography can be seen all day long…. where there are play days, fun runs, and floats with beautiful native people all bright and shiny…. where the cowboys come to ride late into the night and cars are backed up past chinatown to see the fancy feather dancers strut their stuff…. where horseshoes and softballs are pitched with pride and jackets on the line…where dancing feet are seen all over town, in boots on the street and in moccasins on the grass…where each year the weather comes in different guises - hot, cold, wet, dry, windy, calm – unpredictable and unaffected… where they cook up taniga, hotdogs and funnel cakes for your dining pleasure… where no matter where you have wandered, come fair time you can always find yourself back on cheyenne river.
