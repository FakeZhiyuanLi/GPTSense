i have someone close that i love, i don't want to loose him. i don't like to be thinking about what is going to happen to us in the future, the only thing that i like to be thinking is the present on the moments we are having together. sometimes people that have boyfriend or girlfriend, when they are arguing or have a problem the only thing they are thinking is "are we going to break up or what is going to happen" this is the main thing that you should not be thinking. some people when they are thinking about it they break up. when i get mad or have problem, i just tell him that i want him to be with me and to hug me, or to live me a moment alone to think. when this happen to me i just try to forget, and go have fun by playing soccer. having a boyfriend is someone that is there for you, loves you, cares about you, understand you, and most of all someone that you trust.
