after discussing things in a chat room with jackie, michelle, and myself. we have all come to the conclusion that we needed a fresh start. jackie jumped at the idea of having a sister sight to kakutama +3. i agreed to join her new "cartoonish styled website" under the circumstance that my cartoon character didn't look like a retard. i don't understand why this is called a "cartoon" website in the first place. it is more like, switching profile pictures to cartoon versions and just talking about different things. but, i will not rain on jackie's juggernaught of a parade. i will just tag along and ride this thing as far as it will take me. on another note, i have noticed that this website is very. pink. i am unsure why jackie wants to "pink" it out, when she knows there is going to be two men joining the damn sight. i actually don't care though, she is in control on this one. so if she decides to run it into the ground, it is all her.
