i am screaming your name. don't leave me. my love. my star. hold this rose tight up to your cheast. surender your heart to me. these dice we role turn out to be only the love square. pain pumps threw this hart. lungs strive for this air. so soon my eyes are watering. pain and love. watch these falling stars. both hands break but still i carry you. "for what its worth those blue eyes reveal the best of me" these tears. these heartless cries. we find our hearts mended by string. not know these knots have came undone. for i know those cursive letters have burned. between me and you. as you say goodbye. the last look back. sends shivers through my hopless heart. these tears. these heartless cries. we find our hearts mended by string. not know these knots have came undone. lights out. fly across deserted skies. you drop your knifes from a mile high. but still you seem to beable to punture hopless hearts.
