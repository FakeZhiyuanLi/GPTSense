"in your seed all nations of this earth shall be blessed, because you have obeyed my voice." -genesis 22:18 god was speaking to abraham then. abraham obeyed god even when it didn't make sence. he trusted god. he didn't question god. and look how much god blessed him from it. jesus is the one god used to fulfill this promice. god used that promice to bless us today even. what will happen if you obey god? how many people will god bless because of your obidence? something more to ponder. i love you all. in christ, sara scara gaurdian of the holyflame
