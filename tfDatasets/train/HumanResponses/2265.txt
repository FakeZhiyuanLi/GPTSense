well i've finally gotten around to creating one of these things. i guess its about time. it is currently one o clock in the morning on the 13 of june, one day before mary and me's, i and mary's, mary and mine's, our 8 month anniversary. i took her out tonight to see the day after tomorrow but ended up seeing hp3, not bad but crap ending. then silver diner until they kicked us out. but neither of us wanted to go home so i took her to canterbury woods elementary. its strange how paranoid you are when making out in an elementary school playground after dark when a car pulls up. 8 months. wow! i dont think i've even ever had a goldfish for that long. this is actually pretty cool. eh?
