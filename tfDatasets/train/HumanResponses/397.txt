i can't wait to go back to california. but i'm stuck here in texas until bryon graduates. john said that he thought that sarah is hotter than i am. what the hell is up with that? he says sarah is hot but i have a sexy voice. i think that is so weird how he said that. that reminds me about this one time i was in algebra, and mr pearce was talking about something when my friend tiana leans back and says "bryant likes" leans forward, leans back again and says "you." and of course bryant heard this and says ,in a 'what the hell are you talking about' voice, "what?" of course one of my many closely guarded secrets was that i sorta had a crush on bryant back then. what sucks is i had to move here about two months before school had ended. so, i had to start new right before school ended. luckily i had made a few good friends before the end of the school year. i still cant wait until i can go back to california, wich will be at the end of the month.
