i hate being a begger for money. people are asshole's to you because they think they can be because you need their tip. i'm going to try to get something else. hopefully more money also- found out i need glasses. not all the time, just when reading and on the computer! i picked the cheapest lenses i could find and they were still 135 bucks and 220 total out of pocket after you get the prescription and tint and whatnot out of the way! ack! like i needed more expenses.
