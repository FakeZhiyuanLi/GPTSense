today was the last day of lakeland music camp, and that's a bad thing cuz that means i don't get to see mello for a long time. *tear*. but we'll still see effort to see each other. i'm breaking the mold from all the other posts (2), and i'm doing this bad boy in the middle of the day rather than at the end of one. i'm talking to mello right now, and soon i'll be goin to the alumni football game, but that's to hear the alumni band. should be fun. maybe. until we meet again, bacon out.
