this morning i look at the news and find out that paul m. johnson jr was killed (ya kno, the hostage in iraq or wherever). thats so sad. i hate when innocent people die, especially when its someone thats singled out individually and they have to live in suspense not knowing what'll happen for days before theyre killed. its horrible. i went shopping with my mom today and then we watched win a date with tad hamilton. such a great movie. the last couple nights ive been eating chocolate chips out of the bag. pathetic. did u kno that i read today that chocolate can help with pms and doesnt cause pimples? so actually, chocolates a good thing! oh ya, me and amber and tahnee hung yesterday. amber brought her cd of pics. so i went to her house a couple months ago or whenever and we took some pics. heres one of her lovely niece. she might look suicidal and insane here, but shes a pretty 4 year old.
