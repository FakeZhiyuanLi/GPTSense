mondays.are they merely invented just so that we can experience the joy of fridays? i always manage to crawl out of bed on mondays, and rarely make it to work on time (not that i have fixed working hours). on those days that i can't manage to do that, it will usually result in me calling up to work sick :p or taking leave. this is one of those days when i manage to discipline myself. but i'm just wondering, are there lots of people out there like me? people who get so sick of the routine occasionally that they just don't feel like following the rules set by god-knows-who. till thursday n friday, sze lin
