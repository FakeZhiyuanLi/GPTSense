if you follow the path you must not follow the path itself, but rather, follow your goal, because if you focus on the path and not your ultimate goal, you may fall astray and turn back. you can make yourself believe anything. if you want to hate someone you can, if you want to love someone you can. it's actually a very simple concept, its how people fool lie detectors, all you have to do is believe the lie. so if you can believe a lie, then you can believe a feeling, maybe thats how people in the middle ages learned to love the spouse they were forced to marry, either that or they hated them and eventually murdered them in their sleep.one of the two.
