this is my first post.so, i'll tell you a little bit about me, and what is going on in my life right now. i build fighting robots (battlebots, robot wars, etc.) for a hobby. i am the vice-president of my school's audiovisual club. the director is retiring this year, and the town is not going to be hiring someone in his place. so, no more av club. i am very disgusted by this. i think that, next year they will be looking for someone to fill that position, after realizing that there will be no band concerts, no chorus concerts, no plays, no channell 17(and they are even paying $$$ to upgrade the studio) no equipment repairs, and many aggrivated teachers.
