bj started mooing today. at first i thought it was my "cow alarm clock", but i relized it was bj! i told her how many types of moo's that there were. we were sooo haapy! bob went out to the milkman (rabbi o) and bought 10 bottles of milk and we all slurped and mooed away! then like i told you in the first entry, we played pocker with all the other cows (while siona and danielle weren't looking). bj won 36 cow bills ($1,000 in human moola). yay! bj's rich! that night not even one cow could get to sleep because they were all so drunk from milk and bj would stop mooing! oy vey! i told her in the morning i would give her 3 scoops of cows cream (ice cream) if she went to bed. i really don't like bribing my children, but a cows gotta do what a cows gotta do! got milk? -betsy
