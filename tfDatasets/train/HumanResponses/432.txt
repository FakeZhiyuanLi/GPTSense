i read a few pages in my book today, it wasn't the best. it just talked about the different positions are in sorroities and how when you get a "big sister" you can be very easily disowned by them. say you don't spend enough time maybe pledging for a position in the chapter, then they can say they don't think that they are dedicated enough and disown them. i can't say that this is a very interesting part of the book that i have read so far. i think that the author told us this story because he wanted people to see that something as small as a butterfly can hold so much beauty. we take things for granted and kill of things that aren't doing anything to harm us. butterflies are beautiful creatures that actually bring a lot of people hope and inspiration.
