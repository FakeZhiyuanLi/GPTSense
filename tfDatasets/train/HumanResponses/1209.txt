met someone at the weekend who talked about meta-heuristics for network optimisations - so now am trying to learn about any colonies. funky stuff - going to write a program next week to play with the traveling salesman problem using ant colony techniques to try and solve it. still don't know what meta-heuristics really is but will start with the ants and build up. had a good viola lesson last night - can't wait to master vibrato then may be able to make a decent sound out of the thing! mozart next. :) also had a poor game of go - started well and was up, but then white started playing better and i got worse and eventually white thrashed me. however, a 14k observer gave a great review afterwards. white missed last half of the review some next time he better watch out ;-) 18:15 - still at work got to go and chill trying to get mfc to work with time in millseconds and it ain't having it :-( that's all for now will think of something interesting for tomorrow. byeee!
