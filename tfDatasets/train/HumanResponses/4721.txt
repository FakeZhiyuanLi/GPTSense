why ask a question when you are going to argue with me about the answer? asking means you don' know, right? so i tell you. then you question my answer. what the fuck is that? why ask me in the first place? i told you. and then again. but no, that wasn't good enough. you're a pain in the ass. fuck you too! all y'all motherfuckers! fuck you, die slow
