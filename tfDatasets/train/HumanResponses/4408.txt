i had to come up with some rules to which i would compare existing software and gather ideas. since i'm developing a multiuser geovr i've come up with: 3d editing 3d viewing (visualisation) multi-user editing multi-user viewing since collaborative/multi-user gis and 3d gis are still in their infant-stages, a lot of interesting research and ideas are to be found in that area. within those 4 categories things like ui, navigation, communication, implementation etc should be somehow fitted, but i think that's possible.
