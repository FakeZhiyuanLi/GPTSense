today was pretty sweet, woke up at like 12pm. (that's the eraliest so far this summer) went to the ol walmart and bought a cd binder to hold my freakin growin collection. my newest is slipknot's vol. 3(go get it). went to jess's house after, she seemed ok, but then i went to work. candace came and visited, it was awesome. then i went to buurger kang and almost got kicked out for complaining about the "anus burger". then i tried to go to jess's house, no one knows what the hell was wrong, so i left. now i'm writing this thingy cuz i'm awesome. holla back yung'n woowoo.
