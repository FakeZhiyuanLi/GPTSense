i heard a story on npr while driving in to work this morning. it's memorial day. congressional cemetary is the final resting place for many veterans. one of the men buried there was obviously gay and there are usually flowers on his grave, especially during gay pride week. his marker reads, "they gave me a medal for killing two men and a discharge for loving one." if that doesn't sum up american values, i don't know what does.
