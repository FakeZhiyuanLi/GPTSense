when ronald reagan took office i was just 12. his presidency, however, was the first that i interacted with. when he left office in 1988 i had served for two years with him as my commander and chief. it was ronald reagan who had taught a whole generation of youngsters that the struggle against communism was worth the fight. in 1986 when i enlised in the usaf the cold war was in full swing, when i departed in 1990 the berlin wall had come down and we witnessed the beginning of the end of communism. he gave his famous speech at the berlin wall in 1987, and in 1989 the day it began to fall i was in germany on leave from my base in turkey. ronald reagan. persuasive. bold. principled. thank you mr. president for teaching a generation about faith. s.s.
