bored, so why not post again. nothing exciting going on. went to my grandparents 50th wedding anniversary sunday, that was worse then getting teeth pulled. spend monday and most of tuesday at the uncle's house. may move in there after school starts, we'll see. already have my own room and bathroom there, plus a dresser full of clothes that are mine. so, it's worth looking into. new school, but, hey why not. tomorrow hanging out with some people got lucky and have thursday off too. who knows what ill do. more later.
