just saw garden state.it was so good. i really liked it. in the punch drunk love - lost in translation - eternal sunshine. vein.semi-realistic love stories of people who don't have it all together. solid dialogue, likeable protagonists, pine-worthy love/attraction. it made me sad and made me laugh. i start school tomorrow. i didn't smoke today or yesterday, and no caffeine or sugar today. yuck, i ate so much yesterday that eating anything gross today would make me retch. i'm going to try and make myself tired soon; i have to be at school for "professional development" tomorrow at 8. i paid off my mastercard today.only $800 left on my discover. beautiful.
