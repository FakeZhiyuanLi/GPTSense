hey everyone. this is the first day of summer break for the kiddies. they both have playdates this morning though. and tomorrow and friday i am off cause the family is going into dc for the weekend! so i'm pumped about getting to sleep in and relax in the middle of the week. then next week starts camps and swim teams and fun times. only 9 days till i get back to ohio. i will be in columbus from 9pm friday night until around 3 or 4 on saturday. brent and i have to get back for his friend's 4th of july party. it's this really big deal. and then brent and i are volunteering at camp on sunday for registration! i keep forgetting we are doing that, but luckily brent remembers. alright, time for my shower and then off for the day of running around with the munchkins! love you all
