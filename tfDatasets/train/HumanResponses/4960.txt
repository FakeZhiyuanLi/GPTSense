well, last night i did infact make the pic-chip write "hello world." on a 2x24 lcd display. (the display is controlled by the chip hd44780a00.) since i have made this, it seems only natural to incorporate this into another project. i think i will make an alarm, or something like that. i will also be making a small robot (read this : robug). it will be self-powered, and search out light and avoid obstacles. this is a project lying quite a bit into the future, but i will make it. the jal language is the best thing that has happened to me since i discovered the turbopascal language. now i can write my own stuff for the pic, instead of building projects already made by others. i believe i will be starting the alarm tonight, and working on it during the weekend. i will also document the project with schematics, code and pictures. i don't have a homepage for electronics yet, but this will be up and running at a later time. the address to my site will be posted here on my blog.
