hey everyone! today we woke up early and were on the road at 7:00 to go to yellowstone. we drove for a long time today. we got all the way down to old faithful and it just pained me to not go to my grandparents ranch which is like 2 hours away. we had so much fun today! sarah and i sang a lot on the way there, which people either enjoyed or hated. oh well. we saw bison, elk, birds, and a little black blob which everyone said was a baby black bear (i didn't have my glasses on). we stopped at mcdonalds on the way back and got here at about 9:00pm. i showered and we are going to finish the movie we rented last night (gothica). tomorrow some people (including me!) are going to hike up a mountain which is close to here. it should be great! hope all is well to who ever reads this
