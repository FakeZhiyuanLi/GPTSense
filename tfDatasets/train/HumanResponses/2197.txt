hello. sorry back of news recently but i've been busy, yes that's right me busy. firstly been in slough for most of the last 2 weeks doing training for me new job with these guys, try the egain assistant on the site (click here to get straight to it) and ask her silly questions like what's you favourite film or what's her favourite position, some of the re-actions are amusing. well was me birthday last weekend and it seems much fun was had by all concerned. here's a selection of the photos: yes that is me up there in a feather boa, with anna, although i dunno i think it suits pt and dan better! ;p
