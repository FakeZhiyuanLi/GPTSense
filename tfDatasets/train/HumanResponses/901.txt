today i stopped by the armory to find out more information about what's going to happen next week. most of the information is still sketchy, but that's to be expected from the military. i think they should write down information in invisible ink, for all the changes that come along. i'm also repacking all my gear according to the packing list i received from the company. it's gonna be tough getting all my stuff into duffel bags according to the list, so i'm planning on getting one of my storage bins to put extra stuff in. tomorrow is the barbecue, so most of my family should be here. i doubt if i'll have a chance to post for a few days, but hopefully i'll be able to write something down early next week.
