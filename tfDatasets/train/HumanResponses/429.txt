today i left my book at home. i took it with me to orlando when my mom and i evacuated because of the hurricane. i took it with me because it is a good book so far and didn't want it to get ruined. i left it at home next to my bed. instead i wrote a note to my friend. i will make sure i bring my book tomorrow. i miss reading it. it was getting so good too! gosh!
