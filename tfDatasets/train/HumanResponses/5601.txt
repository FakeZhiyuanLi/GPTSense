it's about to happen! sophomore student government elections for the 2004-2005 school year are quickly coming upon our class. i'm one of roughly 15 students who is running, so getting a position on the four-person government will be difficult. i am prepared for a loss, even though i hope i win. i hoped i got into blue key. i hoped i got a 4.0 gpa. but it just doesn't turn out that way.
