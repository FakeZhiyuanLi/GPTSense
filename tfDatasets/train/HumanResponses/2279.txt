new bands usually sound the same. it's a fact. so why would a band choose to sound like another band from long ago? because then they don't sound like any other bands from 2004. enter secret machines. their album: now here is nowhere is easily the best cd of this year so far. it's completely swear free and is reminiscent of the pixies and flaming lips as well as other references. just thought i'd tell you to pick it up. it's amazing. well, i just got back from driving and i did alright. now i'm off to go swimming in my neighbors pool. later.
