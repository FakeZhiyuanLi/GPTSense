well, i just found out that the bill to fix my car to pass inspection will be $500. i hate living in a state that inspects cars. plus, i drive a pretty nice car, and i see beaters driving all over my neighborhood that pass inspection without problem.makes me wonder if i'm being held to a higher standard because i drive a newer car.if they think i have the money, their terribly mistaken.
