i'm overflowing with it today. last night i hurt someone i love dearly. it was unintentional but i did it. i've lied to people i care about and to myself. there's not much to be said on the topic right now. i'm so disappointed in myself and my disregard for another's feelings. i'm nauseous with disgust for what has happened. sometimes i'm a very slow learner. my other blog has been permanently deleted and this one may disappear very soon. things are not good here. things are not good at all. and to the person again i'm so, so sorry.
