i can't imagine a world without coffee, its 9:00 am 2 cups of coffee, the fog is starting to clear in my head. trying to put off my responsibilities. i just want to keep on web surfing, and playing collaspe. escape from another load of laundry,ah yuck another fun filled day! here i go again,in robot mode. i think i'll blast the stereo get a little grove on. ah, the beat of the drums so primal. my feet start to dance to there own choreography. up up in away in my beautiful balloon. here i go to begin my day. see what this day will bring.
