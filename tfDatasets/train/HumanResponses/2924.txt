exama are not cool. in actuality, it is a measure of how well the teacher hasd taught, and not the student. so if i get a bad grade, really its the teachers fault. ha. haha. i win! five exams are killer. i went to a homeschool picnic yesterday.umm what? you're asking? i know sarah's mom works at a homeschool school (i know it defeats the purpose) and she signed me up to go. sarah and i stayed about twenty minutes. i had better things to do. color coding my laundry came to mind. my life is your entertainment.(i hope its good)
