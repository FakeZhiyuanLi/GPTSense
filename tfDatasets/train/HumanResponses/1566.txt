every once in a while, after i've been sitting around bitching about eating to much top romen and not anough sushi, something comes along to remind me of the perks of living my life. like having a beautiful woman sleeping in your bed with your cat and being able to do a pen an ink drawing of them while they're still asleepi'll eat top romen any day!
