i don't know about you, but one of my favorite things are cars. sports car, race cars, regular cars, trucks, and motorcycles. i always think to my self in my spare time how i want to be really rich and buy a ferrarri or a lambraghini or some fast car when i grow up. but, the one thing i really want to happen is, i want to get like a 100 billon dollar check in the mail so i don't have to work for the car. but, i know that the odds of that are not very likely.
