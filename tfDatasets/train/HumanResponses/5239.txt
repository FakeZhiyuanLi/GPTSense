with my back to the wall the wind in my hair i stand poised, about to take off into the open wide skies some exhilaration, a little trepidation my mind is made, a chance i'll take - just to find out what it will be like it is his voice, barely a whisper, that calls my name - i stop to consider. the view is nice, from this ledge on the twenty fourth floor of idx tower, i'll step away for now - however.
