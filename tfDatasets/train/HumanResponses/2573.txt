wow! that was interesting. well i kissed her for the first time in the five years i've known her and it was great well we started by median up at the hotel, you know the usually parent see us together and tell us how cute we are together and we did that, then we went to go see shrek 2 and we sat there and held hands and just flirted and everthing, then we found a place to sit and then we sat and talked awhile but then i leaned over and kissed her! and it was like fireworks when we kissed.but anyways she cut her hair its cute but i liked it better when it was long, but i still think she looks good.but there will be pics of me and her on my picture album. well its late so laters, shaun
