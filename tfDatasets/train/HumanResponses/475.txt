you play the lead in a specialist team of us green berets nicknamed 'ghosts' because they move swiftly and without detection. you're in control of a group of six soldiers, and are able to switch between them at the touch of a button. the squad management has been handled well, as have the controls. the variety of commands at your disposal is limited but my view is that this is a bonus, as it keeps things nice and simple. the enviroments look pretty good, without any mind-blowing visuals, although the attention to detail on the soldiers themselves is impressive. as a single-player game it's completely immersive, although on xbox live it is promoted to must-have status. this is what your xbox was built for.
