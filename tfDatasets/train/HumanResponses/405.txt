at last.i have my own blog. now i can become obsessed with low-level sex scandals and talk about lindsay lohan's breasts and talk about how i saw some guy who's in publishing who only 50 people in park slope has heard of at some party for some magazine that 25 people on the lower east side will read before it folds. and i can waste more time at work. this shit rocks.
