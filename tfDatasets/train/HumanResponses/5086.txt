this last weekend was very short! i spent most of sunday in bed with a migraine.i am getting so sick and tired of these stupid things! just when i think that they are stabilizing.wham! they come back and seem to make up for lost time. i get kind of scared when i think about the cause for the sudden recurrence. i hope that it is just my body getting used to the meds that i have been taking, and maybe simply increasing them will help. don't really remember saturday right now.maybe later it will come to me. i do remember eating at taco bell, but that was late saturday night. other than that though, it is all a bit hazy.oh well, it will come to me eventually.i hope. :-)
