we all know that anyone, anywhere, for any reason whatsoever can find that there is no evidence to support anything. data, thusly, is meaningless. only the latest "there is no evidence" is the real truth, and how much they were paid to make their claims. bottom line: money talks, truth walks. so, dear readers, remember always that there is no evidence until it happens to you, but by then you will have become a statistic, your data is thus meaningless, and you are thereby forgotten.
