i'm in some kind of crocheting slump. every time i start a pattern i end up stopping and ripping it out because i'm either disatisfied with the way the pattern looks or with the way the yarn looks in the pattern. i think i want to make my grandma a shawl for christmas, but i've looked at every shawl pattern on the internet and in my books and none of them are appealing to me. sigh. maybe i should just use my cotton yarn to make her a potholder or a dishcloth . . . the only thing i have been succesful making are some little granny squares. i think i'm going to edge them in black and put them end to end to make a scarf for someone. christmas update: 6 down, 5 to go (if i can ever settle on patterns/stitches for them)
