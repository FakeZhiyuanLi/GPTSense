speaking from real life experience, mould does not taste like anything. in fact, the particular greenish, disgusting fungus has a taste so mild you will not be able to identify it, especially in between mouthfuls of ham and cheese, until you actually see the greenish, disgusting fungus. in other words, you will have absolutely no idea that you are munching mould(y bread) until you look down on a bright monday morning and notice a whole colony of mouldy spores, residing on the bread you are currently eating, peer back at you. other than the whole disgusting relevation, mould really does not have any taste on its own at all.
