well, here i am, at my sister's house. nothing going on really, hence my appearance on the computer. we went out and ran errands yesterday, and last night i acquired a bag of cd's to go copy onto my computer, but other than that we've just been sitting around the house. i saw this interesting show called 'faking it' on tlc, where they take some random person (in this case a sheep-sheering kid from colorado) and give them a couple weeks to learn a different profession (ie hairstyling), and at the end, stick him in with a couple of seasoned pros to see if a judge can tell the difference. it was actually pretty cool, so i might have to watch that show again some time. anyway, i'm off now. i think i'll be home soon. current music: cranberries - linger
