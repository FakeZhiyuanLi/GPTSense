today a friend just turned me down and he didn't want to go out with me tomorrow so sad he already promised me 1 week ago and now he just backs out like that. anyway, i don't think anyone would know that this blog exists so i might as well just write my inner thoughts and feelings here if you chance upon this then you're lucky :) there's four more days left to my mid-year examinations and i haven't started studying yet i don't think i'll do well for this exams and i didn't know that a birthday present could be so hard to find two birthdays are coming right up and i already spent like a quarter of the holidays trying to find a nice one
