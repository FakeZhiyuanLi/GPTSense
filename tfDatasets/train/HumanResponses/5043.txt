today was my very first time at the great mall! i must say that it is 'great' because it has almost everything - like a moooooooooovie theatre. i called jason around 8:00a.m. to awaken him, and of course he didn't wake up until around 9:00a.m. have i ever told anyone that i can't take the bus by myself, because my mom thinks its unsafe (wtf mate)? very embarrassing. and jason lives so far away, and no one wants to drive me. so what i had to do was meet him at pga (paramonts great america), my dad drove me there. then once i got there i'd meet jason (which took 2 light rails to meet me) and take the light rail to the great mall with him. ahhhhhh to many things of public tranportation, and parents driving. god i had fun though played at cyber cafe most of the time. awesome stuff. after, went to his house (took another light rail) and chilled like an ice cube. tomorrow i'm going to go see a movie with moogan! my cell phone works finally! night!
