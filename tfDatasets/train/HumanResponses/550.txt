you have a plenty of opportunities to feel "tacit rules" in japan. for example, you can see people standing on the left side on every escalator in tokyo though there are no rule that you must stand on the left. sometimes you can also see a foreigner standing on the right side of an escalator and others behind him trip on and frown at him. they think he stands on the wrong side.
