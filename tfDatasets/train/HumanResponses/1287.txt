decisions, decisions…. sometimes they can truly be a pain in the derriere! when a friend of yours operates on a family member who also happens to be one of your employers and performs the surgery wrong, the question then becomes what do you do? well of course the surgery needs to be performed again, but who performs this time? do allow the prior physician to rectify the problem, or seek out some other surgeon? it’s a situation that places you in an awkward position for future work. it was not a life or death situation, and mistakes seem to happen often in hospitals today. what i am saying and believe is that you should not let friends or employers operate on loved ones. if anything goes wrong, relationships may never be the same towards each other. it may cause problems in the work place, which is where your personal life stays out of the equation!
