well, it's been a long time since i've bothered with one of these things but last time i kept an online diary, it seemed to help me sort out the mess of thoughts and ideas that are constantly flashing through my brain, with a non-stop ticket to drive-me-insane-land so maybe just typing things in here will help keep my thoughts on what i'm trying to achieve rather than messing my head up into a void of half-realised dreams.
