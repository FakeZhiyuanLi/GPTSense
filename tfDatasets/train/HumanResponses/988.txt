recently my form tutor, mr foo, has been strucked by dengue fever. all i can hope is that he may have a speedy recovery and can be back in the classroom teaching us again. this is his last year teaching, therefore we wish that he could have a good time first before he retire. the tests are also coming up soon. the history test is on 19, which is next week. i wonder how can we pass this test. looks like this time we will have to learn everything ourselves. maybe this is a test to us, to see who can really have the discipline to really get down to hard work. this time i am preparing to teach my friends maths, since our teacher cannot put points across then i will do it.
