friday the weather turned grey again, feeling rather sleepy, i hope that will pass quickly. yesterday afternoon made an attempt to rearrange the chapter on current literature on 3d and multi-user gis and the problems attached to it. it started out well on 3d gis, now i just need to find more on the multi user bit.
