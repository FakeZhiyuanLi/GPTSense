aaaah, last few days i've done nothing, what-so-ever. sure, sure, it has been rather dull, but at the same time, it has been rather soothing too! i've been watching a lot of babylon 5, which is such a great show. i didn't write anything in the blog yestarday because, well, i was watching babylon 5, and now that i've written one log each day of the first week, i feel i'll only write when something interesting happens. and well, now, i write, 'cause i figured i should tell ya'll (all you people who read my blog, all 0 of you). i miss my girlfriend so much i don't think she misses me, she has other things on her mind (she's in england, good for her, bad for me :p). oh well, till next time, tata
