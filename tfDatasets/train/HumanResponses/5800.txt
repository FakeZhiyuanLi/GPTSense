listening to "a new morning, changing weather" by the (international) noise conspiracy this morning. quality stuff; all very revolutionary and i want to have a political agenda. so, i go read "the quiet american" by graham greene to calm me back down again. i dislike structure, and i find anarchy lame. too lazy for both. as for the rest of the day, jonno's gone to work, so i'll just sit about and play halo. the sarge is the man; and, according to the sarge, the master chief is "almost the man". just take my word for it. the sarge is the man.
