sleep deprivation has kicked in. for some stupid reason, i could not sleep at all last night. i laid down, and my eyes would not close. so i was up all night long, and watched the sun rise. got kim up a little after 5:30, we packed most of everything, and then she took me to work. i don't really think that i should be driving right now. i drove here, kim riding in passenger seat, and could feel my head bob to the side and stuff. and i hit the curb when i pulled a u turn in front of the building. anyway, if everything goes as planned, kim and dad will come and pick me up from work and we will head to the cities. we will eat dinner, and then i am going to sleep i am not saying cheers this morning because i am too tired.
