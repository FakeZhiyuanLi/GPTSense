i hate mondays and everything they stand for. the person who created them should suffer a fate worse then death. everyone is grouchy on monday, everyone. every patient i see, every person on the phone, every doctor i work with. the monday blahs are horribly contagious. so, how does one fix this. one comes home and has a nice stiff jack and coke, then blogs, then plays some online blackjackahhhh alllll better. i forgot to blog on sunday, not that anyone knew but me. i was so busy doing nothing that i forgot to do anything. carl and i just laid around the house all day, watching movies and eating. it was grand, but i think it made this monday even harder to swallow then usual. but oh well, its all done now, on to tuesday, which i hope can only be better.
