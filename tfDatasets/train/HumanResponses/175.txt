wassup! bonjour and the like! c-ing how i am a computer freak and spend virtually all my waking hours growing fat on the net, thought that i'd use my time to find something to entertain my readers! i'm gonna put in sum gifs that would be cool for u guys to use if you want. the spiderman wallpaper was drawn and coloured by my borther by himself! feel free to use it cos that would be cool too! if u wanna copy them, here are the steps if you don't already know: for pc users, its the usual. right click on the image and the little options bar pops up. click "save image" and save in in a file. for mac users, click on the picture and hold until the little bar pops up. click "save image" and save it in a file. hopefully u guys know all of this but for the newbies, just in case ja? here they are then! ok then fellows, get copying! luv y'all! evernix
