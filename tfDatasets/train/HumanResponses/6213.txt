mozart's active imagination ensured he rarely encountered boredom. many would be frustrated travelling so much in the days of carts and horses. wolfgang, at the age of four, created for himself a kingdom, where everything went his way. everything in this imaginary land caused amusement to its creator. place names were the names of real towns and cities but their names reversed. london given the new title of nodnol etc. it's after the infant mozart's kindom that i name this blog rucken. the spiel within is of my hand alone unless otherwise stated or quoted from. it willl be at times profound, often amusing and occasionally zany to boot. welcome to rucken.
