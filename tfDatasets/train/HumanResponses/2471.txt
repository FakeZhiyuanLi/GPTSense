i got up as peach was getting up to go to work, (she gets up at 5:00 because she has to be at work at 6:30) told her i couln't go back to sleep but i guess i did because at 7:00 my alarm was going off and i still wasn't out of bed, got up, took a bath, decided i would stop by bob's restaurant and get me some breakfast, when i got to the office about 8:05, i noticed there was no cars in the lot except the ac guys who have been installing new ac all week for our office he was apparently still waiting to get in and i'm like "biddit should be here" so i unlocked the door and let him in, about 5-10 mins later est came in and i asked him where biddit was and he said "oh, he's off for the rest of the week" i'm just wondering why our qa person/project manager doesn't like to email people telling them this info anyways i think that's enough for now. i'll write more as things happen. acid
