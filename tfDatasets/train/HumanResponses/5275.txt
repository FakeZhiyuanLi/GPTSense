that's right, joey harrington. i'm talking to you, you piece of garbage. i don't know why people like you, but i can't stand you. you look stupid when you grin. you look stupid everytime i hear you say, "i just know i can succeed in the nfl! i just know it!" and you look especially stupid when you try to play football. remember how you played in all 16 games last year and passed for only 2,880 yards? that was crappy. and remember how you threw just 17 touchdown passes but 22 interceptions? that was also crappy. and hey, remember that game against minnesota where you threw four interceptions? your quarterback rating that week was only 30.3 were you even trying? i know you had a good preseason opener last night. weren't you 5-of-7? i hope you had fun, because that's probably the most passes you'll complete in a game this season. you're dog meat, joey harrington. if you were a birthday present, i would send you back.
