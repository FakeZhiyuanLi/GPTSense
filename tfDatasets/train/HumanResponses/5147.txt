i've started e-mailing a guy i've meet over the internet. his picture's really cute and he says in his profile that he's into fantasy. i put 'buttercup seeks her westley' as my headline to see if people get it and he did! he realised it was from the princess bride so you never know, things could happen. tommy has been really flirty with me. i was on poker and was in the middle of a coughing fit when he heard me. he asked if i was ok and i said i had a bad chest at the moment. he said doesn't look bad to me. but that's just tommyi guess.
