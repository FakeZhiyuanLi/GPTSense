it’s almost eight-thirty in the morning. i don’t see any sign of the boys outside, and kevin is asleep. i figure it’s about a hundred yards to my car – back out through the condo complex along a narrow walkway then into the open lot. my car’s on the far end. i’m going to carry a cup of hot coffee with me. boiling hot.
