so nothing exciting has happened lately. however, i did go to lsu for fan day and saw coach saban as well as many great tiger players. i also saw some of my friends from last year who graduated, i'm gonna miss those guys. well, i must say that short day is the best thing to ever happen to high school. it feels great getting out of school two hours earlier than everyone else. that's about it for this one. oh yeah, i love you jen.
