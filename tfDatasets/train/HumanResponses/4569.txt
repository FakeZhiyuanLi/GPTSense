yesterday i sympathised with cyclists but today i witnessed a display of fuckwittery which caused me to reconsider my feelings. i saw someone cycling in the road, right next to a bloody cycle path, with both hands off the handlebars and holding a mobile phone to his ear, while a van tried desperately to get past him. i've been trying to find a suitable word to describe this particular idiot but i can't think of anything strong enough.
