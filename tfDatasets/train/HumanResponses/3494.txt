yep! when it comes to lebanon. if you don't have social connections with "people in places". you don't get anywhere and turns out we're not the only ones. in a few hours i'm going to meet a somewhat influential man i'm told in the instituto tecnológico y de estudios superiores de monterrey. he's 60ish, algerian and the coordinator of internacionalización de la división de humanidades y ciencias sociales  whatever the hell that's supposed to mean! i spoke with him on the phone a few days ago and he sounded a bit nostalgic to speak in arabic. hope this meeting goes well.
