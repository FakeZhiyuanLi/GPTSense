holidays at last. this year is the longest year ever. but it's no the worst. i think it's the best one. i just hope the next one would be better. on the last day of school all the beautiful memories came back to me. like our class trip to lake kenyir, my birthday party with mario, my crush on patrick, the trip to jakarta, when i met alex, how lisa and i became best friends, meggy's and athi's fight, meggy and mandy, robin and sari, theresa and marc, me and kevin, our romeo and julia play, the valentine's party, how i got to know marvin and robin.everything came to my head. next year won't be the same. why? because ami, athi, anna, maia, farah, chris, lisa, so menay people is leaving school. it's so sad. dskl is like a home to us. it's a small school and we know everyone in this school, so when someone leaves, then it's really sad. well, at least i have something to look forward to: christine's brother. i sure hope he's coming next year. :p
