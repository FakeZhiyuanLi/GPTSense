have you ever wondered how life can take a twist of its own? i had a shock this morning. a very surprising shock. not to be disrespectful, i hope that person is happy with the choice he made. as for me, i need to do a synchro check on what i have been feeling lately. i don't wana lose another friend, not now when i am truly happy. i hope the decision that i'll make will benefit all. truly. this weekend i will be at pd for some campus election course. i'm accompanying zaidah there, as a representative from pju. hope my mind would be cleared up by then. my master's application has been good as well. completed the form, now just waiting for my certs to be verified by utp. i received an ephiphany on the meaning of life.you just have to move on.
