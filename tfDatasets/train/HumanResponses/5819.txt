why should we be judged just because we are girls? where good at something but the males don't think so some of the time, most the girl i know can play basketball really good, just the boy don't think so. so they don't past the ball to females, only cause we might mess up or miss a shot we're there to play and have fun, and some just to show off, but we don't desever to be treated like the way we are treated. in this upward bound program i'm in most the girls don't play bastetball cause we know we won't get past to, but i really think it should change. what do you think?Â¿
