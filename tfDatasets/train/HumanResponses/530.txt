well, it's officially decided. i'm going to do it. write the novel that is. the plot is thought through, i think it's quite solid. the lead and principal characters are laid out, well most of them, i'll leave the rest to the story to reveal. next comes the storyline, and the actual writing. why, would you ask, all this organization? well, i find that this particular "writer" ( moi ) is not the kind that can just sit down without any preparation, except maybe buying a few packs of blank paper, and birth a whole book. i lose the thread after ten pages into the damned thing. every time, the idea's gone, like it never existed. a short story, yes. but never a long piece. i really wonder how some writers do it. just imagine, armed only with a typewriter, you sit down and punch out a masterpiece in just two weeks time, voil√† . man, i wish i was talented like that. anyway, the ship has sailed, and we can't turn back, boss, oh no.
