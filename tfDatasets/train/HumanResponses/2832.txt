well. i have needed a lot of sleep! i crossed theroom, and what ou did was to feel my hair over and over again and in different ways, touch it, with the palmof your hand. felt it strands of hair, with your fingers, touched it as if it were cloth, the way a child touches it's favorite surfaces edna o brien. all right. it would be nice to have more direct interaction, but i guess you don't want to do that right now. the way i feel is that i want to talk to y o u. i want to feel y o u. it's the way i feel. i don't want more things inbetween us.i want less things inbetween us. is that sooooo bad? love, wanda
