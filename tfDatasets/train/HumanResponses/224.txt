sometimes i stand back and watch you with your fake smile and forced fashion sickening sometimes as you're all talk and no action trying way too hard at everything you do cant handle the fact your being is inadequate you live to love and love to live in other's eyes not being cool makes you cry going as far as to take that social hit no one can see the real story on the inside afraid if they do the charade will be over then maybe you'll grow up and feel older wishing only one would figure out whats in your mind the latest single by a faceless band gotta have it gotta get it livin up to the status whore gettin tired and disgusted cant take it no more practiced at it so long you know it like the back of your hand
