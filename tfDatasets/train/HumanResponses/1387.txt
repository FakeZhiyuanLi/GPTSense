cheered up considerably now. my burnt meal has made me realise light-heartedness is the way forward. i'm in a really sarcastic mood now. my parents are listening to some classic 60s cd and it's made me look at life differently. who am i kidding.life still sucks. ah well, my new, refreshed point of view is guiding me towards the tv.
