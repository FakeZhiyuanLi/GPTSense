the goldfish are watching, through a world barred by glass, and when you least expect it, they will turn their fins on you- and devour every move you make. laughing at our primitive ways, they secretly gather during the night, to plot the biggest plot of them all, to rule and conquer the world- and the end of our "superiour" race. the goldfish are watching, taking note on your every thought, there are no halos over these creatures, and if you listen you will hear them- soft whispers of evil and death.
