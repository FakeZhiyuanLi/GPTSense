i think i know why i have been in a blah mood all week. seems like a cold virus has worked its way into my system. i couldnt figure out why i was so tired. now i know. hopefully i can get over it before too long. i am usually not one to lie around when sick, but right now i could sleep hours. ok enough belly aching about being siiiiiiick. i am looking forward to the weekend. i seem to miss that certain someone. but thats not really any thing new. saturday doesn't look so great for weather, but sunday looks pretty awesome. i want to get on my bike hillsborough i guess is the destination. i do like it out there. interesting to see if i have improved any skills. doubt it. i seem to have the "divide and conquor" attitude when biking. mash and bash over everything. grrrrrrr! i don't think its agressive but more stupid than anything. no skill, just brute strength. yaaah all 115 lbs of mehuge brute.
