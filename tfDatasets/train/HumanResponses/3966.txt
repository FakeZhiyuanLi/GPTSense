we had another great work night at oneighty. the walls look alot cleaner, as well as the duct work. carpet was cut and placed along the outside of the auditorium. it's looking great. all of the fabric that's going on the sound panels in the auditorium is cut, and it's ready to be painted. and i think that's about it. if you guys don't like this little section of my blog let me know. i'll probably do it every week if i don't get any comments saying not too.
