so, i go to the bank today during lunch, and while the teller is helping me, she says, "i have to ask, where do you work that you have to wear steel-toed boots?" i laugh and tell her i'm an engineer at the gm plant down the road and not only do i have to wear steel-toed boots, i also have to wear safety goggles when on the factory floor. the goggle are prominently displayed on my head as if they were sunglasses. i then tell her it's really hard to find anything that goes decently with either item. i became an engineer again why? i thought it was for the money but i'm not making nearly enough.
