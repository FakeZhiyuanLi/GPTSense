well i finally got around to trying out this blogger- even though i've had the google toobar for ages, *and* was a loyal googler long before that. silly me. i first tried to blog with a different blogger site, and to tell you the truth, i didn't like the feel. oh, it was simple enough, if awkward, but the 'home' page of the blogging site was so darn busy i felt lost there. this place is so much better. i should have gone with what i knew was a tried and true service. anyways, this is my dumping ground. stuff i find on the internet that i must squawk about (good and bad), late night frustrations and nightmares, and the occasional proud parenting moment (or self flaggellation over same) all will be posted here so i can embarrass my family and bore strangers. i hope you'll drop in occasionally.
