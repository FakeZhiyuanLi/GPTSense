wow.i've just seen smallville movie seasons 1, its kind of cool. i can't help watching the next episode continuoslly. they are all playing good, and i like those all characters, i love it. why don't u try to watch the movie with anyone you like, for me.it's better with some u love, and likes wathing movie :-p, come on wake up! ups! :-) i'm thinking of something else:-(. anyway i just want to tell movie, musics, poems, good smells can bring you to other world but do not expect to much, get real, life is sometimes painfull and beatifull. explore it, you'll know how it feel. watching you outside there without me by your side it makes me full of pain and never end with happyness, but hopes you are happy there.c",)
