that fake tennis racket i was talking about, i have the best place to use it. my brother and my dad fly their planes and helicopters somewhere between goose bay and nwr, and there are a lot of mosquitoes up there. i was testing out the racket tonight, and every bug i saw got shocked *w00t*. so every swing at the flying field will be a bright flash and bad smell. after shocking about 10 bugs in a row, it made a strange smell. holiday tomorrow! july 1st :p canada day if i remember correctly. :p i only remember fun holidays, christmas, summer, days without school, etc. 04dop0630
