today was wonderful and so much fun. it was the first time i was in wyoming and the first time i peed in the woods this trip. it was a blast with everyone and seeing old faithful. there were beautiful mountains and animals. also with mcdonalds and ice cream it doesnt get much better. tomorrow we are climbing a mountain. no blisters today so hopefully i wont get them. hope everything is well in sc.
