boys are such odd creatures. it would seem that if one likes you, then suddenly they all like you. it's either all or nothing. for the longest time it seemed that the entire population of males strongly disliked me, but now it would seem that quite a few think im pretty cool. why is that? is there some secret meeting where they all get together and decide on the flavor of the month? grr. they're rather confusing. i think that spring is the instinctual mating season, so now everyone feels the need to couple up, but even so, there must be more to it than that. i refuse to believe that my actions are dictated by hormones and weather.
