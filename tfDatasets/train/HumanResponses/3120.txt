i dislike my computer to the greatest extent. my modem got struck by lightning and i can't get online anymore. jess came up a couple times this week, alysia came up with her yesterday because she just got home from florida. the lucky shit. i wish i could go on vacation somewhere. she looks like a nigger she's so god damn tan. i'm going up to joe's today hopefully if he or my dad can give me a ride. i kinda can't wait because i'm sick of being at my house. nothing has really been going on. i've just been watching my summer slip away from me. i'm dreading going back to school, but i'm not going to elaborate on that because then i would sound like whitney. gah, boredom.
