or so i am going to convince myself of this. i highly doubt anyone will actually read this, and if you do, i must question why? i mean, do you not have anything better to do than to surf around and read peoples thoughts that they put on the internet? of course, i must question why i am even doing this. let's just say it's an experiment. an experiment in how long i actually post here, and what i post. don't expect me to come and lay all my sad, teary-eyed stories of failed loves and hardships in life. i can never understand why people do that. you are putting yourself up for an uncaring, unknown audience. heck, that's even worse than acting in a movie. someone could come up and tell you that you did a bad job in a movie, but any anonymous moron could say that your blog is a pile. ah well, enough ranting for now.
