warning: boring numbers ahead. the nonpartisan congressional budget office released a report friday evaluating the changes of tax laws upon real-world incomes. john kerry said the report shows that the middle class now shoulders the largest tax burden in this country, while george w. bush said the report shows everybody got a tax cut. what bush didn't say is that the richest americans got a much larger tax cut. not just in terms of actual dollars, though, but also in percentage. the top 1 percent of americans paid 6.8 percent less in taxes than they would have in 2000. yet someone making about $15,000 only had their taxes lowered by 1.5 percent. what good is that? john kerry's tax plan, as you may know, is to erase the tax cuts for americans making $200,000 or more. according to this report, that would apply to about 22 million households. by rolling back those tax cuts, kerry would immediately inject nearly $180 billion back into the budget.
