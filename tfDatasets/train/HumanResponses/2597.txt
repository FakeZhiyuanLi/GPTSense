our arrivals were miles apart and destinations, a big question mark but now, together we travel and so many things together we unravel you, as a person i know a lot well enough to read your mind and thoughts but still puzzled about your personality as it stretches me beyond certain rationality sometimes soft and emotional as a child yet many a time, bold decisions coming from your mind i see a true and trusty human being, unmasked and not far in you dear and i like you for all that you are. frankly from my heart i admit you are someone special to me, my friend.
