i cancer vive come into your body there to thrive, hide in your deepest corners to torment you. i cancer vive without your help will crumble, sleepless night can seem like a nightmare. am i awake am i dreaming? chances are i’ll make to see tomorrow but i cancer vive will not be beaten. your strongest will can give its best shot but you know better than that. a battle ground where fate’s soldiers fight an epic war inside of me. a place no where to run, out in the open. if i won’t survive than someone’s going down with me, but friends and family may come to your aid, i’m so scared i don’t know where to turn, and when i look up at the clouds they look like the devil’s pitchfork now, what more can’t i ask of you i think. back to when i cancer vive will fall if not climb higher down, down back to the top where you can’t reach me, if you try hard enough you’ll just lose your strength when it seems you’re trying to tackle a sound.
