hey guys, it's been a few days since i posted anything, but i have been consumed with french classes, packing, selling items, donating items and making plans to go home to see family before i leave. yeah, i know it sounds like i'm an over-achiever, but i'm leaving in august and i have to be out of my current apartment by the end of the month. i'm still waiting for that damn academie to send me something so that i know they are trying to get things situated and such, but i wait in vain because my mailbox is empty every evening when i get home from a long day of work. i'm here at work now sitting, bored and sleepy hoping to get home to find my arrete so i can take off from work, drive to houston and get my visa. well that's as good as it gets for now, but i'd love to hear from some of you other people hanging around here and there. feel free to drop me a line or two or a nice, enchanted email. catch you soon. sam
