my polling station was inside a catholic nursing home. the door was locked and the lady at the desk was talking on the phone. i stood there waiting for someone, anyone to let me. finally, a nun passed by and after convincing her that my voter's card and lack of any other reason to visit a catholic nursing home was proof of my legitimacy, she opened the door. i have the feeling she's been doing that all day. she craves the power. i'm not happy about my choice but i've known what i would do for the past week or so. i toyed with the idea of using the last-minute-menu-ordering system - when unable to choose between several menu items, you wait until the waitress asks what you'd like and then blurt out the first thing that comes to mind. lucky for me (and canada) i made up my mind before then. i was surprised to see a marxist-leninist candidate running in my riding. if the election wasn't so close, i might have voted for him. instead, i did all i could do.
