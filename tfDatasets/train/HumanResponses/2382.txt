i had a lovely lunch at the taco stand. not so much a taco stand as a little booth built into a wall in a non-descript office building in midtown. the security guards, however, are fully away of who is there for the tacos, and they are happy to guide first-timers downstairs into the crystal pavillion of 805 3rd avenue. tucked away in a corner is pampano taqueria. get the $8 lunch special, make sure one of your three choices of taco is the pulled pork, and take lots of limes. snag a seat in the sunshine, and enjoy a truly filling and fabulous meal. the chips are worth the carbs, and you can wash down that hot habanero hot salsa with your free soda. good company helps as well, and they can also tell you if there is a cilantro leaf stuck in your tooth.
