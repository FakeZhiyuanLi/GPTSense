i caught the premiere of the graham norton effect tonight on comedy central and i have to say i was happy with the show. so far it's the exact same formula as the original british show. the main drawback of the comedy central incarnation is that most cable channels in the us, even though they aren't regulated by the fcc, censor their shows. i can't see anyone watching graham norton being offended by profanity or a little nudity. if you are offended by such things, you probably aren't going to be watching the show to begin with. let's hope it lasts a little longer than the us versions of red dwarf, men behaving badly and coupling. those three turned to rubbish on the way over. tgne so far hasn't. let's keep our fingers crossed.
