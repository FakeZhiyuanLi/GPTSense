amazingly better than you'd think. the incense, that is. john's almost done gutting his room. removing his entire existence from the household. it's really rather depressing. i came home from work today to find a pile of stuff on my bed that he had borrowed over the years. yoga books, green nail polish, and this lovely incense were among them. i just lit some. it's almost nauseating if it weren't for the headache it gives you. but it's a good headache. if that makes any sense at all. this incense is making me dumber. that explains a lot about john. considering he used about 10 sticks of it. but that was back in his pot days. haha. back. i joined girl scouts. i amaze myself sometimes. but hey, we get to go to europe next summer, so that's pretty cool. hopefully i can go visit david over winter break. that'd be so tight. and hopefully alli can still come out to visit me. that really needs to happen. peace out.
