this has been one weird week i was accepted to the graduate programme i wanted on thursday and every day i've been wondering if i'll be able to make it over there, and that's what i've been wondering all week, then today one of my best friends informs me that he has been kicked out of the programme i wanted to apply to after finishing in barcelona, it's scary, i can't believe it's gone to that level, now i'm more woried than ever, it seems that we weren't prepared nearly as good as we should have been. and that means that i won't have a summer vacation because i'm going to have to kill myself to learn the math and economics i need not to travel that same road. now i don't know if i should wait another year and do a math course here or simply take a chance. i'll think about it in the next couple of days and study like a bastard. i guess that's all i have
