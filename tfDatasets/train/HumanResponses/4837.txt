dear michaelgabriel, i actually got that new ptl album about three weeks or more ago. dave and i had been emailing back and forth about some things, and he ended up sending out a free copy for me before the release. at first i didn't like it as much as the last two . i really went in for the whole concept album bit . but after listening more i have to agree that it's really good. really good. i don't know if i think it's better than the last two, but i do think it's as good. have you heard the new mum? who else is on this blog? love, jeremiah
