wax, like honey, rich and emollient -warm and golden, spreads so thin. so, i was waxing my friend the other day; this time she wanted me to clean the whole thing up. i was speecheless as she suddenly stood naked before me; i felt priveledged that she would show me her body in that way. i could not help but notice how beautiful she was, and sexual, too. somehow, i felt erotic, staring like it was ok to but looking like a virgin does at the sight of her lover's body for the very first time. i was overcome but i took to my task like a worker bee and strip by strip i ripped her hair away; i could see her body tremble, the way she bit her lip -to hide the pain. as i went lower, i noticed something shiny and tried to ignore it (i thought it was woman juice) so as not to embarass her. i wasn't sure whether i would have liked to smile or cringe. eventually, the gleamingness become unavoidable, and, i finally realized what it was. turns out my friend has a clit-ring.
