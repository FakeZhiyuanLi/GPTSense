so we rolled into new york, new york last night around 12:00am. long journey, but nonetheless very fun. we entered into the city through the lincoln tunnel, which was amazing to see and to go through. we, naren, michael, sammy, and myself, are staying at the sheraton new york and wow. it was amazing walking through the doors. this morning we got to walk the streets for a bit and so far, i have to say. not incredibly impressed. i mean yes the buildings are huge, the city is vibrant, but something in me (maybe the 5 years of college) still thirsts for the smaller town scene. either way, this week will be an incredible time. i am sure of it.
