yay! i just received a phone call from ku inviting me for a job interview on wednesday! it is for the public service supervisor position at watson library. this is very good news because i have been trying to get an interview with ku libraries for almost two years. not to mention, a new job might get me out of this cubicle. the only thing is, this job pays less than the one i have now. so, this poses a dilemma; an extra $200 a month, or a job i might enjoy? i think maybe i'll just focus on the interview for now.
