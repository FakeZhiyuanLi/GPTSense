i just heard a colleague of mine get threatened by a customer. she followed procedure for his own security and that's what she got. a big fat ugly uncensored speech. screaming is rude. what have we come to? keep your money under your mattress if you don't know how to control your nerves. arsehole! man, more and more i wanna leave. or maybe sleep for a really long time.
