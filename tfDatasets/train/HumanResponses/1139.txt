not entirely sure what to write. i have tons of work to be doing and all i want to do is sit and eat pizza and watch tv. i have essays to write and lessons to listen to, but all i want is to stuff my face and sit on the couch. i guess that is nothing new though. it is only 5 days in and already i am felling burned out. even after a weekend of recuperating i want to go to bed. my boyfriend is gone and all i want to sleep with him for around 200 hours and not get out of bed. that would be nice. oh well. looks like i am just going to have to get to work. i will put my laundry in and then just write those evidence essays. i hope this is what a blog looks like. we shall see.
