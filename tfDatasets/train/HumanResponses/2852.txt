my day ended up being a really good day after all.now hopefully all weekend will be the same way. i really hope it doesn't rain on sundayairshow at langley. i should get some sleep.i have to put pilings back in my uncles dock that got screwed up back when isabel was here. hopefully the water won't be cold.
