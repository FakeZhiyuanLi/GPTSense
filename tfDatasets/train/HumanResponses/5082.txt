hey i got my independent hat! it was easier than i thought. i didn't even have to make dad feel guilty or anything. dad is cooler than i thought. can't wait to tell mike. he'll be shocked dad said he understood because he used to date girls back in the day, before mom captured him and made him stay at home for the rest of his life. my new hat is soooo cool. it's black and has the red independent logo on it. i called mike and told him i got it. he said to be sure to wear it backwards, because that's the cool way to wear it, not with the logo in the front like i've been doing. he says that's ghetto. he says girls see the cool logo behind you, then they have to look at the front of you to see who's wearing it. mike really knows everything, that's why he gets all the cool girls. i'm glad he's my friend. i hope this works. wish me luck! peace out.
