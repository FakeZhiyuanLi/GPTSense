what's up everybody, i got church again tonight, except tonight we're just watching a movie. no lesson, thank god. doug's lessons are less than interesting. hopefully doug'll let me bring the movie so we can watch dickie roberts: former child star. i love thatr movie! i'll post again later. i love you katlyn!
