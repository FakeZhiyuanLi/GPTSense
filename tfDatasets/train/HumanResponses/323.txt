i hope that's how you spell it. but just had that for lunch. really good. had it without the round onions though, can't stand the after taste of round onions. green onions are fine, just not round onions. it was from jun bo. nice little hole in the wall restaurant. is behind the blood bank in downtown, down an alley way that smells of urine. of course most alley ways smell like that. alley ways and stairwells. no matter what kind of building, all the stairwells seem to smell of urine. very odd, and disgusting. but the shrimp fu yung was good. very good.
