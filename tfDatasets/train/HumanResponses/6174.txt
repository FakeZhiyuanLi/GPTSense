earlier today tiger woods finished 2nd at the nec invitational four shots behind the leader stewart cink. tiger shot a -1 69 today and stayed ranked #1 in the world where vijay singh, ernie els, and phil mickleson were all out of the top 40. tiger finished the four day tournament at a total of -7 under par and seems to have his game under more control than in the past few tournaments. my question: has tiger got out of his slump? is he finally starting to get back up to where he can play? should we look for a win in the next few tournaments? it all remains to be seen
