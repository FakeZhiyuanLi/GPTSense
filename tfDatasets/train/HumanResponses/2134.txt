"this child of god" is a poem that was written by my mother and i'm adding it on here because it sort of sums up how i've been feeling lately. here it is: this child of god i thought today, as time went by, the many times i've failedit made me sigh. hills i thought were important to climb causing nothing, but more wasted time. a relationship with one to heal this heart mislead through blinded eyes, tore us apart. another scar appeared on my soul falling down too many times takes its toll. i'll stand once more and clear my view love comes so seldom.if i'd only knew.
