this goes out to all the parents out there. for the love of all that is good and holy , no that's not enough. for the love of all that is good, evil, holy, unholy, big, and small do not bring your kids to movies! ok, not all movies. i understand that kids want to see movies too, which is the reason for movies rated g. i for the life of me can not figure out why parents bring their 1-4 year old children to the movie theaters. i went to see spiderman 2 tonight(7pm showing) and the theater had a lot of children in it. not kids aged 5-10.children! there were 4 or 5 children barely out of the womb. what kind of parent does that to a kid? hell, why would a parent subject their child to other people when they know for a fact that they'll cause a disturbance? in other news, spiderman 2 is a kick-ass movie.
