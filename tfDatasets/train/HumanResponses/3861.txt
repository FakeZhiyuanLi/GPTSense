artist: incubus title : i miss you. to see you when i wake up is a gift i didn't think could be real. to know that you feel the same as i do is a three-fold, utopian dream. you do something to me that i can´t explain. so would i be out of line if i said i miss you. i see your picture, i smell your skin on the empty pillow, next to mine. you have only been gone ten days (it's not actually ten but who cares?) but already i´m wasting away. i know i´ll see you again whether far or soon. but i need you to know that i care and, i miss you.
