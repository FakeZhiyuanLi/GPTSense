why is life the way it is? i want to hide and never come out. can't someone just tell me this? why am i here? what is this all about? i think in one way and then i don't is what i am seeing only my dreams? maybe life is one big joke. is there an answer for what it all seems? so much to do in this life, so many questions, so little time. am i ever gonna be a wife? am i supposed to learn in this amount of time? if you tell me the answers, i won't forget. if i do, remind me! otherwise i'm in deep shit! god send me an angel to keep me out of trouble. you can take your time, but please make it on the double. what am i to do until the day i die? i can't just sit around and ask myself "why?". what am i to do if i take the wrong path? look back, say "oops", and then just laugh?
