what did you gain from today's training? what strategies, ideas, or lessons do you already have in mind to use in your classes? what are you most excited about? what are you most concerned about? what questions do you still have? who are you going to turn to for support? additional ideas on what the curriculum is supposed to cover. i have done much of the goal-setting strategies, computer lessons, learning styles and many other areas in my connections class. that i will have one hour instead of only 1/2 hour to teach the class. that the students will hopefully be in there for a full 12 weeks instead of 4 or 8 only. none this evening. rhondashe is fabulous and very knowledgable thank you all for a very organized and thought out in-service. fran
