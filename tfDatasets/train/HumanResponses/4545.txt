so, i got up early today (6a.m.) and my mom told me to take out the trash. i got out there and what do i see? maggots all over tghe trash ("it stunk so it couldn't stay in the garage")after taking it out i cleaned the cans and took a long shower. what relevence this has to anything else i know not but i thought i'd write it anyways. my computers on the frizt right now so i'm stuck on this one, my dads. right about now i'm watching "skillet - savior" on steelroots which is this sweet christian music show. i'm not usually all about that kind of thing but i do like steelroots. humm what to ridicule oh yes, i remember from last night. i was watching tv (bad choice) and what was on, reruns of full house i think that says just about everything. wow, i'm so nice i cleaned my whole house today.
