chew your word; i am so upset with myself right now. less then an hour ago i raised my voice in a conversation with my mother and now i feel absolutely awful about it. i donâ€™t know why is it that speaking of the cuff bugs me to no end? the fashion of thoughtless speaking almost like thinking out loud really bugs me. when someone jumps up and finishes my sentence saying exactly the opposite of what i wanted to say, i fell more insulted then if someone had spit in my face. and when it is done by someone who i care about it is even more painful. may we all learn to chew our words before speaking them.
