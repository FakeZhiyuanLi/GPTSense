okay, so today i was in the office building's locked bathroom and heard voices outside. to be helpful, i opened the door so that they didn't have to use their key. the middle-aged white woman smirked, pinched my brown arm, and said, "i hope you don't want a tip for this!" i don't know, do you think i should have let her live?
