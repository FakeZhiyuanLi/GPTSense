i'm not sure who will read this, as i write this and time goes by. i'm not really sure who really knows me. most people don't know how truly depressed i am. as time progressed so did my depression, and i eventually turned suicidal, twice i attempted it. i never did succeed, i don't know what turned me away, i believe it was like two different people that i didn't want to do it too. after all of this i had to go to therapy and i still go. i don't really think it is helping me. and to tell you the truth i think i'm getting worse than i use to be. i just don't know what to do. everything i want to happen never does, so i just don't really want to keep trying. this may come as a shock to some people, but all throughout my life i have had to hide all the pain i was going through, so i thought it was necessary to get it out in the open, before i don't get the chance to. how do you sleep when its still alive never to deep take a look inside
