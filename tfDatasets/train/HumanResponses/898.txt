so, here i am. first post. nothing to say. i suppose i could recycle things i've said in the past, but not right now. i find myself wondering about the etiquette of blogging. i'm sure it's mostly stream-of-consciousness stuff, but are there unwritten rules? is proper grammar frowned upon? good spelling? shrthnd? no time right now; the 5 year-old terror is awake and demanding my attention, so i'll hop back at some point in the future. or not. bleah.
