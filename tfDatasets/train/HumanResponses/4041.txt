with the summer of satan (2002) and the catastrophically fantastic summer (2003) safely behind us, we now move in to the yet to be named summer of 2004. i think it would only be appropriate to begin the summer by requesting submissions from all of you so we can identify a name that best represents the debauchery that this summer will bring. as you can see, i am finally making good on my promise that i made in 2002 to get us a web page that can document all of the ridiculous things that we do so here it is. enjoy!
