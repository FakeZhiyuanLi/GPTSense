hi, my new frind. im a secondary school student in studying singapore.its my pleasure to start my own websiteand i wish that i would be able to continue writing here as long as i live ( provided that i do no forget about you). anyway, im a skinny male with a height of about 1.8 metres. wooooo. quite tall isnt it? however, this had caused me to be terribly underweight (so sad), leaving my report book with an sarcarstic comment, " need to refer to doctors for advices". crap! before i stop typing, i wished that i could score an a1 for the coming o' level mother tongue. see ya.
