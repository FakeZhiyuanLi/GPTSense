i'm dying inside somebody help me out cuz i'm losing my mind. where do i go, where do i turn get me out of this whole before i fucking burn! don't be a fake and live a lie be yourself, it's as good as being hi you wouldn't like to be me so live your own life and just let me be i'm lost in time and i can't find my way if i ever get back what would you have to say? do you still love me, are you still mine? if not, i'd rather stay here untill the end of time. in this world, there's too many lies. in my eyes, too many tears to cry. i look in the miror and ask myself "why?" is this the end, is it time to say good-bye?
