i'm probably going to start fencing next year. the ministry's got some new rule, pupils need to have at least one sports cca; if it suits, fencing for me! it looks really cool. especially after [pirates of the carribean]! i've been wanting to try fencing for ages. the only problem - i'm quite packed already, with something new to fit in i think my timetable will start bursting at the seams. i'm already taking chinese orchestra, piano and whatnot. well, there's nothing i can do about it. for science today, watched a david attenborough documentary; no doubt, they're excellent! no wonder he was knighted.
