i had the opportunity of watching saturday night fever at istana budaya last night and i must say, that was some of the best dancing ever seen on a stage, so much like a fever. of course, i missed the original cast, adam garcia, who played the part of tony manero - as made famous by john travolta back in 1977. however, jon adam fiorentino who played tony manero was just different, but none the less sensational. and he can dance. the whole team can dance. with such energy and skills. storyline aside, it's the music, particularly the dancing which became the main reason people were there at ib. and it so fresh, and boogiefying as it was all those years ago when we first saw it in the 1977 movie. and in between the show, i already found myself giving the show a five star.
