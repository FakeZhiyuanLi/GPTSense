worked 7 days a week for 3 weeks. w/end 1 to see the chilli peppers @ hyde park. absolutely brilliant. w/end 2 managed to walk straight into george micheals 41st birthday and stay until 0730hrs the next day. included a number of silly stories i won't go into right now. you'll have to ask! w/end 3, went to a very good friends new flat nr clapham common for a meal and wine, ended up partying at local cafe. this then turned into a next day outdoor venue called lovebox, absolutely awesome, saw groove armada, mr scruff, and some pixies when we overdid it. w/end 4, back to the 7 days a week thing, holding out until our next major blowout in august/sept. help!
