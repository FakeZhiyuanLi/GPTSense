she can stand ! and prefers to stand instead of sit. this is joli's new "trick". she likes to see how long she can stand (well over 15 min.) and when she finally falls she expects you and everyone else to clap. this will be a new treat for jarad tomorrow. today we went to a 1st birthday party for samantha, she is the daughter of a college friend of mine, jody and her husband mike. it was a lot of fun. they had pinatas, games and even clowns. (we won't tell jarad he missed it.) we only have one more week left until school starts. that means jarad, joli and i all head off to classes. the summer really seems short when you are not working!
