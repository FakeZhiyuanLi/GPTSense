well, well find me! and find me fast! find me, but find me not here. find me, but not over there. find me, i am right here. here? there? where? for who can find me but me? and even i cannot always find myself! there is only one who always knows where i am.yes, you're right! it is he who created me! thank the lord! sometimes i dont always understand myself or my life but i know that jesus does, and that he cares.and i know that whatever may come i am ok!
