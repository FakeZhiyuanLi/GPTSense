currently wanting : to be home, still watching : ed, edd, and eddy feeling : disturbed wearing : same thing as last time, seeing as i've been to lazy to change thinking : hmmm*yawns* idolizing : no one listening to : nothing ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~ hmmm, nothing special to talk about today. just a plain old boring day. talked to my mom on the phone. other then that, nothing. rp maria finished drying off and started to dry off her board cause she didn't want it to soak the interior of her car. after she was done with that she sat back in her beach chair and watched the waves crest against the shore. the tide was coming in, it was only a little while until the water would reach where she was. when that happened she'd leave.
