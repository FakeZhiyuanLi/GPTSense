this is about missing sombody i miss you already. the flame which burnt for us has about come to it's end,you can't even be a friend. where did everything go wrong? hours spent together,are now only minutes. soon,will be only seconds. time has drifted,with it, so have we. the pain of separation to be. what's going to hurt the most, the thought of you in someone elses arms. the intimacy that was once ours, now belongs to another. i never gave you the things that you wanted or needed. i dragged you through a fantasy dream,only to fail in that too. things won't be the same, but i hope our paths cross again, i do. maybe our friendship will last longer, because, i miss you already.
