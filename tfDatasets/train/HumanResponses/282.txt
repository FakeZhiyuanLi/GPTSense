momentous occasions are fun. i mean, who doesn't like to see someone go something horribly stupid and yet horribly dangerous at the same time? par exemple , when someone decides to go cow tipping while on speed. and in flipflops. yes, something like that. they'll be glad to know they made a momentous occasion after they've recovered enough to comprehend you, that is, if they recover at all.
