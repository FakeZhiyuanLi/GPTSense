have you been watching the olympics? i have. i got really nervous before the 100m hurdles today. they were putting so much pressure on the canadian to win. i kept seeing specials on her and everything. so i kept flipping the channel while they were setting the race up. then i had to watch, and our poor canadian fell before she hit the first hurdle. it was so sad. the local channels had set-up cameras where her family was watching the race, and they were so devestated, poor girl. very sad.
