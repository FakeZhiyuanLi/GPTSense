my day started out nice with me waking up early and finally checking out that church on main street. the pastor was korean and the congregation composed of eh, non koreans, mainly elderly people (black, white, whatever). yes, an interesting and rare combination. he had organized the sermon to the best of his abilities and he seemed really sincere. and i can tell that he's a praying man but dr. keller is still worth traveling to the city.
