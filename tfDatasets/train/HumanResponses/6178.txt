i n the second round of the nec invitational stewart cink was one to be reckoned with. he started the extremely long day with two consecutive birdies. it looked like a runaway until tiger came storming back from behind. then the reains came down and the greens became slow.but that had no effect on tiger, who before the delay ended on 3 straight bogeys. then he came back focused as ever and knocked in 3 birdies and missed another by just a tad, which brought him back within three shots of the lead due to cink's boget from the sand. tiger said he just wanted to make a couple birdies to get back into the mix so three was a bonus getting him back to -6. can tiger get back on top of his game with a win here? can he lengthen the difference between him and ernie els for the #1 spot.the next two rounds leave us wonderingwhat will tiger do next?
