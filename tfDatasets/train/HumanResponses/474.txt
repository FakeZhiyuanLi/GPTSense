not much to report really. the usual bullshit. got my ass kicked on rainbow six 3 last night. still waiting for half-life 2. must play counter-strike source soon. doom 3 released next week. yay! some films to watch: spartan, gozu, infernal affairs 2, anything else, the bourne supremacy. dvds too: the girl next door, vol. 2, dogville, it's all about love. played manhunt; must be a insane obviously. lazily blaming videogames for society's ills is not the answer. fuck off, the daily mail; fuck off, the sun. excuse the rambling. i'll think of something more interesting to say next time. honest. ;-)
