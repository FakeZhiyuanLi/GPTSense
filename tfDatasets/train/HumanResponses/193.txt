woke up this morning and had my coffee on the lanai overlooking the edge of waikiki and the discusting ala wai canal. it has just occured to me that i'll be 25 in 12 days?!?!?! what is the point in getting older? the only benefit of becoming 25 is that there is nolonger an added fee for renting a car when i need one which will be nice. beyond that, what is there? why can't people just stay 25 forever? maybe there are reasons out there that haven't passed through my mind yet. let me know if you have any ideas. today is my first long day of many, probably a summer full atleast. my work day started today at 7:30 and will end tonight at 10:30, with a 1 1/2 hour break inbetween jobs to walk home and change from one uniform to the other.
