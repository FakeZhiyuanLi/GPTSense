well poop. we finally have a day off (sunday) and i have to go to church. true i get to "sleep in" but not as long as i want. tomorrow is the last day for the people that we hired to help us with our show. yay! things may be a little easier for us. boo! i hope that we don't start doing bad again after they leave. that's really all i have to say -chocolate pie!
