only about a week and a half until i can go back to california! i'm so happy i could scream! ahhhh! dad should be home today. he went to oklahoma on friday on a business trip. i found another evanescence song called anything for you. john said he doesn't like evanescence! i had to hold back from saying "what the hell is wrong with you!" but i didn't say it. he's got a problem if he doesn't like evanescence. he's got bad taste i guess. well anyways. melissa 1: so how r u? melissa 2: i'm not good! melissa 1: why not? melissa 2: because i'm gonna be in california only for a few freaking days! melissa 1: i know i hate it too, but what are you gonna do about it? melissa 2: nothing! i've given up a while ago. melissa 1: i want to go back home and stay there. melissa 2: face it! this is our new home. we're not gonna get to go back! melissa 1: i'll never accept that. never.
