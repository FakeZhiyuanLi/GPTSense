bloody hell. really feeling like shit. been pacing up and down for hours, can't relax, can't sleep, can't stop thinking. can't kill myself just like that because it will fuck up my family. nope, think i'll have to wrap my car around a tree or something. why must i feel so lonely? i can't keep going feeling like this. day after painful day. why can't i get better? why can't i be normal?
