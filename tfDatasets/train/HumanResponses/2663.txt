i've just realized how much certain people piss me off! i won't name names because i'd rather not start anything. i just want to vent. the stupid little things that they can't say to my face and the way they act like nothing is wrong. if you don't have the guts to say whatever you have to say about me, to my face, then don't say it at all. talking behind someone's back is so juvinile. are we all in grade 2 again? *marge-like groan*
