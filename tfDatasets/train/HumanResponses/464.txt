spent the weekend down in rhode island with shal, james and lana. fun stuff, ate like a king, went to riverside during the day saturday, rain managed to hold off, and i experienced what was possibly the most disgusting thing i've ever seen at a theme park. first, i hate the fact that they've renamed riverside, the place used to have charm, now it just seems like another disney knock-off pushing as much themed merchandise as possible. i'm not going go into the disgusting part, figure some of you (one of the 2 or 3 people that read this) may be eating while you read this. if you curious just ask, i'll tell you all about it.
