well, first off, my class got into a really heated arugment over a incident. my disabled classmate got his bag into the trash bin. there was quite a number of people in this case. the disable classmate got bullied and then *inserts alot of blahs*, in the end we got abit of detention class ( the whole class! ) for as far as i know, im not in this case. im far away from it. man.now everyone hates that disabled dude. ( not everyone.mostly. ) - poor guy :/ as for my great side, is that im happy to know that i had helped my friend and tried to defend him. well.thats all im gonna say.
