hawaii is a mecca for all waterpeople. the scuba diving, surfing and windsurfing is incredible. i was living there for 6 months and did my thesis, but i was a poor sucker without a car. no car - no windsurf. but i bought a cheap surfboard and went for the windless action. diamond head is a good spot. kailua is the prime spot for windsurfing. the massive trade winds hit the west face of the island dead on here. on this day, there was little wind though.
