dreams. they can sumtimes be so real. sum turn into nightmares and sum into wishes come true. well not really, cuz they are only dreams. i truly believe that all my dreams mean sumthin. y? well here's an example. when skool ended i never heard from this sumone ever again. all throughout the summer i kept having dreams that sumhow i had lost them or for sum reason i couldn't find them. then finally after summer was almost over i recieved sumthin from them. that night i had the best dream ever. i'm not gonna go into all the details but here are the main points. this person and i were together and niether of us would let each other go. we couldn't be seperated! i really think it means somethin. i guess you have to kno all the details to all my dreams to feel as strongly about this as i do. or u can just go bak to your own dreams and go through them like i did. then you'll understand. (if u don't already.)
