cold i'm cold so very, very cold. heart and soul frozen, and afraid. what once was warm, lie after lie has turned cold. what once was, was more than enough to thaw any man's heart. i await the sun. the warmth. the feeling still lives, in my heart and soul. i am afraid, i long for warmth, but i am afraid if the chill comes again. i will not survive.
