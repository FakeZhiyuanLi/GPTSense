geezi nearly forgot that i had this blog like 5 minutes ago i was like oh yeah i really should post a new blog sohere i am. i want to go and paint the bat cave tonight but i don't have a ride home so i'm porbably gonna have to stay here all day. i've recently started skateboarding and i'm not very good at all but if i want to get better i have to keep on looking over my shoulder for the cops, because its now against the law to skateboard without a helmet fuck i hate the cops! whats next? you can't play soccer without chin guards? no baseball without cleets? i mean what the fuck all a helmet is, is opional equipment if i want to risk brain damage for a good time then it should be my fucking choice.christ! oh well now that im all pissed off i'm gonna go shoot something.
