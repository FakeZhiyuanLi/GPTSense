today i practiced the devil's tounge. and i got through about 110 kanji and about 440-500 compounds. mostly new compounds too- but none of that set in. it was hard sitting in the heat figuring out how to pronounce compounds i've never seen, plus a few kanji i never knew. like bugs. so now i'm about ready to hit the reset button with my trusty ice pick- my brain is too full, and i think i'm risking seizures looking at all these black little lines. so tip of the day: don't learn kanji in the sun!
