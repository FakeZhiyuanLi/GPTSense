 and not because of football i watched the 10,000m race today on the olympics. holy god those guys have stamina! if i ran that thing, i'd have three glasses of water by the 5th lap, and i'd be out by lap 10. but these ethiopian guys are superhumans! none of them even grabbed a sponge! they went all 25 freakin laps around that beast of a track, and they got a little winded. running 50 yards gets me a little winded oh, man, do i have a new respect for the crazy olympians who did that. hats off to you guys. i got tired just watching them. whoa!
