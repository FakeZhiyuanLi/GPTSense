there is, perhaps, one guarantee in life, that is that you will die. there is also one fairly safe bet, that it will be painful - and freedom and property are illusions that can only exist in the mind. it is only when you realise this that you have true freedom - especially in this weird increasingly 1984 world meh - i don't feel well.
