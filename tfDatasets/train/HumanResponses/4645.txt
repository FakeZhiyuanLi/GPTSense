even though today is sandwiched in the middle of a week-it is unique. my body, mind, and spirit are refreshed and rested. it is amazing how i savor the quietness of today. my mom is in town and is such a blessing to me. we are like bffs. i really don't know when this happened-but i am so glad it did. i am looking forward to another weekend of spontanity. i just like to have nothing on my plate and it just turning out to be incredible. no plans until the minute of. i am glad that some parts of life can be this way. it seems as if everything is already planned out. i know my upcoming months aremeetings, interviews, trips i am savoring today.
