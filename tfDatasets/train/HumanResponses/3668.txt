so, as anybody who knows me knows i had a party last friday. weel, i didn't get p1ssed which was good seeing as i had a theory exam the next morning. i only had a couple of archers aqua, a couple of beers so i was ok. i love archers aqua. its sooo nice! i must have been a little pissed though, because in a game of spin the bottle i got off with 3 people, two of which were girls. 1. kathryn, as in mrs squeers (who is a great kisser) 2. jenny (who is a baaad kisser) 3. hector (i didn't get off with him properly though) i feel grief for him, i cannot seem to help it, i wish to do more violence i love angel, and illyria. it doesn't help that it was the last ever angel on saturday. lame. poor wesley. gotta go to lameass registration know *bangs fists* see ya xxx
