today is memorial day. if you see a veteran tell them thanks. because if you think about it, withought them we would probably be under a rule of another country. and we wouldnt have the freedom that we take for granted in the u.s. so please if yous ee a veteran tell them thanks for all that they have done. it will make their day a little brighter.
