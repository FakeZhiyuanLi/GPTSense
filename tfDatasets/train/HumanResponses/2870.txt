hola everybody i am gonna introduce to you one of the love poems i wroteplease enjoy them with the beutiful classical music. a life with love love can be complicated yet, nothing is as beutiful as love love is also soft and delicate like the swaying motions of a dove if you make one silly mistake your love is already at stake betrayal and trust are the two sides undiscovered you would alyays end up unhurt or perhaps severed trust is earned not bought it is an obstacle made by two which their minds chose to be thought to trust somebody is not a difficult thing to do as love always comes from the heart and nothing can make it depart.
