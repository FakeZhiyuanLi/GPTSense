today has really been boring, not to much has been happening just homework which is always fun i woke up at like 7 because the stupid construction workers are pouring the curbs on my street. i seriously cant wait till all of this is done with. its a pain in the ass! but ya i should get back to working on my seminar that penner decided to change on me a week before it!
