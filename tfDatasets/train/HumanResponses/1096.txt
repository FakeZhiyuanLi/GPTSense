after reading michael moores 'dude wheres my country' i finally see that it is not through a company i will achieve my ambitions in live. i, like most people aim to be rixh enough to live comfortably (already a bit vague that) but i can see no sense in following the hoards into industry, which is fundamentally always economically orientated. i think that the system does not allow for everyone to become what they desire, but like moore, i see that people are easily tempted by get rich stories or company high risers. instead i think i want to do somethink on my own. something new and innovative. my motivations are not exclusively for the better of mankind; i am being selfish in my goals. but moreover i think that if you want to become successful you have to go it alone, because the system is not a failsafe conveyor belt to glory. it just isn't that easy. thats the problem.
