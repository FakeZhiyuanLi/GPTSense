ismiaji cahyono, this isn't the gentle kind of day that you librans may dream about having, but it's time to step outside of your regular role. playing the perfect host or hostess is not what the planets have in mind for you now. it’s time to get down and dirty, or maybe even a bit crazy. jump into your fantasies and let them come to the surface. of course, you don’t have to express every single thing you imagine, but it is okay to say more than you usually share. that, by the way, was my astrology of the day. hahahahahahaha. how ironic! by the way, i saw the village yesterday. despite of the critics, i liked it. this bali photosession is beginning to get on my nerves. now my boss wants to come along. shit! more postings tomorrow
