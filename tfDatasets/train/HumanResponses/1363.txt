mirrors are meant to be fractured. i look at my reflection and fracture it in my mind to what i wish it would bea flat belly, a small waist. the only part of my body i wish to fracture and re-build. would she do that for me? an operation to fracture and rebuild. they are out there. expensive. to fracture. the mind is lost. i am 47 and wish for a flat belly. otherwise, i am content with the reflection in the smooth looking glass. content
