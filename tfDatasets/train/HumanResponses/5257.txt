i can't stand the leaders' debate. i wish i could just stand up there, ask a question, and say "if anyone interrupts anyone else, consider yourself having lost my vote." honestly, it's so completely unproductive. paul martin seemed flustered, and jack layton does a super annoying hand thing, and is also the absolute worst at talking over everyone else. stephen (ugh) harper seemed composed and calm, but he just can't disguise his agendas. you know, it's really too bad gilles duceppe is a separatist, he seemed like the most reasonable, logical and well-mannered one there.
