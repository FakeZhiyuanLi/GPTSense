it's amazing how torturous doing dishes is for me. i don't even know why, but for some reason it is the worst thing i've ever had to do. i just had to do dishes and i would have rather run i mile (i hate long distance running). but oh well- they're done as long as my mom doesn't yell at me for not doing a good enough job.
