well, i am still here.kind of in shock actually. my suspicions gave in, and i downloaded a video off of kazaait was the beheading of the us carpenter by the terrorist group in iraq or afghani am so sorry i did, it was horrifying. i can't believe that i would watch something like that. my heart beat was pounding, and tears about came to my eyesi had just watch a person be murderedi wish that i never would have done that. i give my condolences to the berg family. it was the most horriffic thing that i have ever seen, and i hope that justice will be served to the bastards that did that.
