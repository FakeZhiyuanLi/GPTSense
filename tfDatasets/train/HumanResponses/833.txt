wow. today was an early day for me. i'm glad aaron convinced me on prgs. at 9:51am est i bought 633 shares of prgs at $20.15. at 10:10am est, it spiked to $20.90 and automatically sold. also, since i made such a great gain on prgs, i decided to lower my limit order on wb. it sold at 10:45am est for $46.14. today's percentage gain on investments: 2.145% overall balance: $26,188.25 overall gain on total investments: 4.753% average days per trade: 1.33 so, after 6 trading days, i've scored a overall 4.753% gain on my investment. in a regular savings account at bank of america, the apr is 0.75%. that means if you would have put your $25000 in 6 years ago. you'd have the same return as my experiment. booyah. -bo
