today started like anyother monday. i woke up crabby becuse i didnt get to sleep until about12:00. i know that doesnt seem late but i need about 9 hours of sleep in order to be in a good mood. when i got to school my i heard an announcement that we had to meet in the gym at fourth period to listen to our new vice principal ramble on and on about all the new rules. then when i got to seventh period my class got in an argument with our teacher about how to organize our binders. after i got home i did my homework and then bbqed some hamburgers for dinner. now i'm starting a blog for the first time.
