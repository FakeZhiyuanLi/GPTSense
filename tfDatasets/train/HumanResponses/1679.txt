my favorite texan, noelle, came to paris recently for a visit. we hit le bon marche, paris’s swishiest department store, just for the fun of seeing the pretty clothes in the pretty lighting and eating some of the famous macaroons. now i love this department store, but it is also the type of place where every third customer is accompanied by a dog-as-accessory. the only left bank department store. lots of locals. very bourgeois. it was, for all these reasons, so refreshing and funny when i held up a really skimpy pair of hot pants made by pucci, retailing for about 300 euro, and noelle said at full voice, in her saucy, southern-direct way, “i’d be lucky if i could get my pucci into that.”
