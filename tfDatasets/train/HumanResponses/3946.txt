music on the crappy radio station from nyc: james "laid" hilary duff "come clean" some metalica crap and other total crap rock/rap bands. (i really miss l.a. radio stations) had a long talk with my new guardians. it seems they are concerned; waiting for me to have some sort of meltdown. i now picture them looking at the ceiling beneith my room, waiting for the slag to fall through. but what do i tell them? of course im not particularly happy at present. who would be? just burried mom, dad lost it in the process, and im living across the country trying to build a new life. i'll get it, but give me some slack! yes, they are wonderfully caring people (they are my god parents after all), but i don't know what they want to hear. it's as though they want me to just loose it all of a sudden. but i cant seem to communicate to them that i am just trying to move forward.
