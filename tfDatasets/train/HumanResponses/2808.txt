rants and virile are not for me. i'm done. no more. kaputski. all gone. from now on i'm going to post content based on what i'm doing and what i know. the internet is no place to work out my angst and misguided journalistic sentament, no matter how sincere or 4th form english in style. there will be no more heated exchanges between either of my opinions. thankyou.
