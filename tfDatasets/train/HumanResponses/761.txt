as you have guessed, we ended up watching the bourne supremacy. it was a very action packed movie with great visual effects. the first movie was slightly better, although this one was also quite entertaining. back to work tomorrow, totally sucks. i still have today to look forward to. it's almost time for some dim sum. what's after that you say ? c.h.i.p or p.m.s ?
