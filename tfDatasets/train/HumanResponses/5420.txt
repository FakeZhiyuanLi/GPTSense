friday, 130804 - i got replies regarding the forms. some of them were not alarmed yet. yesterday, i met the boss, never smiles. what should i do? did he do that on purpose or what? if all of these are about the website things, then i can say, go to hell hahaha. now, today i've got nothing much to do. just have to prepare for the tuition in donggongon. i went to likas to look for the school (exam venue for kpli). then, i did my pray in ums. met the boys. promised them that i'll stay over night there. it does make sense though, because the venue is not far enough if i go from there. so, let me think first ok. confirmed. lagipun duduk rumah pun bukan hebat sangat. plus, i have to study for tomorrow's exam. what else, i met 'cikgu' at the mosque. my girlfriend sent me a picture of her when she was in kl attending her friend's wedding. i spent rm20 for gas using my cc. i went back at 2. else? hmm not much. headache plus worried. wanna get some sleep c ya
