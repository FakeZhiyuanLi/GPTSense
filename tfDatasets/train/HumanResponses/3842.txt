man oh man, i dont think i ever want to learn html, its hard enough putting a links part to this page(look below). but thanks to holletts smarts in the html feild i got it done, i may learn it if i get bored. brutal math test today. dont think i did good but i dont care, 2 more days and its all over. booyah! once exams get over i dont care. then its off to work then off to qatar, woohoo. only 67 more days till i leave. it may seem like a lot of time but its not. way to much stuff i have to get done in that time, but it will all be done. started the brick at school today, the accordion looked like garbage, but i think it will turn out ok once i paint it.
