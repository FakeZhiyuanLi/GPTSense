~this is a note by the author, lesley richards. an odd setting for a story, i'm sure, on blogger.com, but i figured what the hell. this will be a story written by a fifteen year old sophmore about her life in general. it's like this entire blog was written by her, except for this - and this is me. the real me. my main character, ginny, is only a snipet of me, who i'm going to agonize and dote over in this story. called orion. you'll see why. do read. i'll post soon.~
