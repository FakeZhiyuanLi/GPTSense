today i went to two graduation parties which i guess where fun. well to tell the truth one wasnt but i won't say which one because i dont want to offend anyone. one of them i went to a pool and had alot of fun. ok i gave a way which one was boring but i don't think anyone would get mad (hopefully). the pool party was fun and i ate too much of the cake so i think the grad student mom disliked me becuse she was eyeing me. so i stopped. both parties had their advantage though. the first one i went to everyone knew me so i didnt feel left out but the second one i was kinda ignored. boo hoo goodbye for now kiddies ill be back soon
