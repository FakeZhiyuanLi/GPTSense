5 days to the olympics! i'm planning to go to tao nan twice next month (september). once on teacher's day, which falls on september first. then, i'll return again on the 25th, when the school's having the annual mid-autumn festival celebrations. i heard from miss heng that we'll be staging a [tao nan idol] - something i simply cannot miss! i wonder if they allow the alumni to join in as well. no, i rather doubt it. just me trying to be ridiculous again. before i forget: though i'm not mentioning my writings that much anymore, it doesn't mean i'm quitting. contrary, i'm deliberately keeping the suspense!
