lots of people find arrogance to be slightly appealing. who doesn't want someone who's loaded with self-confidence, can put a value to their worth, and doesn't feel ridiculous letting other people know how smart they are. i guess i'm not "lots of people" because i find modesty in person to be quite sexy actually. better yet, lets stick to 'appealing'. a modest person is likely to be the one with the most self-confidence since they don't feel the need to continuously attract attention to how knowlegeable they are. nor prove their self-worth to anyone but themselves. ah here i go again, procrastinating. i have a million other things i should be doing. (one of them is sleeping). css and i are having issues this week.
