got home from no thrills. i let eazy-e drive home, and we had a good time trying to teach the parallel parking. she gave me a super sweet note, which made my day. i was supposed to have exchanged gifts with the posse today, but i heard paul and debbie got in late from their folks, so i guess that is held up until later this week. i did get my gift from capt and heather; in addition to a cool book on moviemaking and a simpsons clue game, i got a ric flair dvd set. not something i'd want too many people seeing in my collection, but i know i'm gonna watch it! :p
