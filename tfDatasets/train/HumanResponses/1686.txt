pom wonderful. we know what you're thinking: wonderful. yes, that's what we were thinking too. starting with the way we nurture, handpick, personally squeeze only the best fruit, to the way it is beside the rest of the refrigerated juices and not on the juice aisle, we admit that we are a little smitten with the fruit. but who wouldn't be? it contains the most antioxidant power of any drink, and other than just being really pretty, it tastes really good too. sweet and tart at the same time, it makes you smile and pucker up at the same time. it's wonderful, astounding, brilliant, and just downright cool. we would have liked to use all the cool adjectives to describe this juice, but we thought "wonderful" just summed it up nicely. pom perfect could have been better, but perfect just seems a step under the reaction you'll have to this drink.
