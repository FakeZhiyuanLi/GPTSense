so, here i am. noon on friday, working from home. completely hungover. (thanks to nancy.) i'm supposed to be doing pre-training for my real training next week in st. charles, but i haven't quite started. i sat down to enter my artes (this dumb time report i have to turn in every two weeks - its a total pain in the ass) and i'm trying to lessen the blow by doing other creative and positive things first. like start a blog - also inspired by nancy. anyway, my next post i promise to talk about something, but for now, i just need to get the ball rolling.
