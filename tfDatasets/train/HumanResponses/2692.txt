the interim ("canada's pro-life, pro-family newspaper") has an article on some of the newly-elected young conservative mps, including a couple of friends of mine who managed to get themselves elected. interestingly, it shows that these young mps are ardently socially conservative, thus mirroring recent gallup poll findings which shows strong support for traditional family values amongst the younger generation, a rebellion against the permisiveness of the 1960s and the legacy of horror that it left. as discouraging as the election results were on many fronts, it's certainly encouraging to know that the tide is turning and the party is in good hands. read the entire article by clicking on the title of this post.
