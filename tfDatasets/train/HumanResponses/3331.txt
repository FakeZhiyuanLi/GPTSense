i have a english poetry research project due on tuesday. i've got this long weekend coming up (memorial day) to work on it. it's pretty easy. other stuff going on: well, theres not much else going on this weekend. i'm not invited to brendan's lan party (see rrunner290's profile) on friday because i went to the last one so nick gets to go to this one. i can't wait till halo 2 so then we can have more than two teams and more than two x-boxes. well, whatever. out.
