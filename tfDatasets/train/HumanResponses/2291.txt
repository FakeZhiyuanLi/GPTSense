jojo, the 13-year-old girl who has the at40 hit "leave (get out)" that's at #1 for five weeks now, is retarded. she has no clue what she's singing about. she doesn't know the sting of being cheated on. she doesn't know the true love. the only love she knows about is 'omg he iz soo hott' puppy love, none of this soul mate stuff. it's this way with all teenage girls: every guy they have a crush on is thier 'soul mate'. hey, you can't have 30+ soul mates! get a grip on reality! she doesn't even make the song believable! if someone like usher or someone older sang something like this, i'd believe 'em. but not jojo, because she's 13 freaking years old.
