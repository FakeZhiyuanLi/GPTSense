today was pretty uneventful. we went 2 the vlas, which were kinda boring. they wouldn' have been so bad if we didn't have 2 fill out some dumb worksheet. the drive there was like 2 hours, and everyone took their shoes off and all of our feet stunk. then we stopped at mcdonald's on the way home, and some of us went in the little playplace. ahh, you never get too old for those things. so yeah. there's nothing much else 2 say. personally, i think this website thingy is reeeeally stupid. but o well, it's kinda fun in its own stupid way. but yeah, i probably won't post anything every day, because i have a life, unlike some people. adios.
