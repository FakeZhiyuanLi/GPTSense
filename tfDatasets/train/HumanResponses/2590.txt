well, having narrowed the choices of homes down to three privately-owned halls, we're finding it's a race against time. one is full, one has only 40 places left (at the 6th largest university in the uk!) and the third has yet to call us back. things don't look good, but as long as we're fairly close to each other it should be okay. as it is, we'll be looking around the remaining two on monday, and probably making a decision immediately. that's the main thing going on in my life right now. been shopping for books for next year. bit scary and [i]very[/i] expensive! i now have the money (from my nan) for my laptop, which i should be buying in the next week or two. if you are reading this, please post. i'd like to know.
