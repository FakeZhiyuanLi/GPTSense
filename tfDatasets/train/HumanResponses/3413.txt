i'm hungry. very hungry. bill left me at 4:30 and its been like 3 hours. he promised food, and he hasen't come back yet. if he doesn't show up soon i will go crazy. i haven't eaten any real food since breakfast.i feel the darkness closing in around me.or maybe not, but you know how it is these days. i'm going to go fight the cat for some of his little treat thingys. i hope i will be able to return and post another message, but the cat.he has a hungry and dangerous look in his eye.
