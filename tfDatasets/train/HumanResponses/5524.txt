i've been writing the whole of today. not about orlando bloom, that'll come later. right now i'm in production of a harry potter story. harry falls for thos girl he met at the yule ball. it's still a bit jerky, the storyline. so i'm gonna have to patch it up a bit. but when i'm done, it'll be the greatest! okay, not maybe the greatest. the story's really short, it seems only a chapter long. but never mind. why am i so into writing nowadays? the next one i write will be about orlando bloom! i think.
