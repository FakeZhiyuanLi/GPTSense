it's a fact. matthias is going to high school next year, same school as sofie, who just started s4. this evening i was attending yet another parents evening at his new school, if not anything else then to buy new school clothes with the proper logo on. when i left home in just a t-shirt, it was very warm sunshine, when i left the meeting it was pouring down and thunder and lightning. i was soaking wet and cold when i returned home. four weeks more, then it is summer holidays. wehee.
