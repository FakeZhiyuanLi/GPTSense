children, are you not so happy to see me again? children nod entusiastically with gap-toothed smiles. wonderful. let's have some fun. i started a new exercise regime today. yes, on a tuesday. sundays seem to jinx me. now, i'm not in it to lose weight (at 5' 5'' and 110 lbs. i can't afford to). it was quite invigorating, actually. i'm hoping i stick to it. i really can't afford to get flabby. and we all know, summertime is the easiest time to do that. i'm done with being shy. seriously, it's gotten me now where thus far. it is a pointless emotion, only holding me back from my true potential. i mean, i'm just as pretty, talented, intelligent, witty and all-round great as the next gal (not to sound vain), but i still get all fuddled and muddled around certain people. gosh. why didn't i decide to do this sooner? hmm the possiblities are now endless. yay! well, children ta-ta for now. be good. remember. i'll be back. mwahahahahahah- choke*cough*. ahem. right. bye.
