my 9 month old baby daughter, eliana aka ellie, woke me up at 4:00 this morning! not to mention she also woke up around 11 from what i think was a nightmare. the poor thing was inconsolable! i'm going to go to bed soon. i want to read some more of the bringing down the house book. it is really starting to pick up now and get exciting. then i'll finish second glance. i'm trying to decide what to take to the beach at the end of the month. you know i'll probably take 5-10 books.and i'll be lucky to finish 1! but i can't wait until we go. only 11 more working days!
