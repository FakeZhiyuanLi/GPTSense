6:44 on a saturday morning and i've just got up. christopher woke us at 6:15, we sent him back to bed, but we couldn't get back to sleep and he woke his sister up. decided to get up and leave carol in bed to see if at least one of us can get some more sleep. i had a late night anyway last night, as blade was on tv, and didn't finish until 12:20. i'm shattered. good film though.
