last night i went out with some of my colleagues, who can best be described as a finely-honed drinking machine. to say that i was drunk would be a bit of an understatement - i was absolutely legless. so much so that when i went to the toilet the staff wouldn't allow me back in the bar. i'm not entirely sure how i managed to make it home. i remember doing it but it still seems like a miracle that i didn't end up in glasgow or somewhere. if nothing else, it served as a very good reminder of why it's not a good idea to drink a lot on an empty stomach. i won't say 'never again', but i suspect that it'll be a while.
