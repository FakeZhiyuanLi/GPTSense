well,overall,today was a good day,except for the niggling aches on my chest and calf muscles.guess the workouts in the gym really materialised.started as any ordinary day,but my day got brighter when i saw the girl i simply adored.macam mat kental,i know,but watching her beaming smile from afar was,to put it mildly,enthralling.
