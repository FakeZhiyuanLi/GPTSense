all i know is my own life. i feel like i'm overwhelmed, then i stop and think about all the people who are worse off than me. but, honestly, that doesn't keep me from feeling overwhelmed. and a bit depressed. my day today consisted of getting up, getting ready for work, getting my son ready for his day, dropping him off at daycare, getting to work, working for 8 hours, picking my son up, getting supper ready, mowing the front yard (had to save the back yard for tomorrow), showering (again), folding laundry, ironing some clothes, putting another load of laundry in, emptying the trash, sweeping the cat litter out of the garage, emptying the dishwasher, getting my son into bed, and then putting the second load of laundry away. this is my life, day after day. nothing else. i'm going to bed. maybe i'll have some excitement in my dreams.
