i have done such a good job for so long pusing aside my personal feelings, wants, and desires. now they all seem to be piling up on me. part of me is glad i feel alone, because at least it means im not hurting anyone else. but there is that duality too. i cant accept that, otherwise i would not feel alone. i think about her wanting to meet my parents. i couldnt afford to give her the life i would want to give her. im so far in debt right now. i wonder if i will end up my fathers son afterall.
