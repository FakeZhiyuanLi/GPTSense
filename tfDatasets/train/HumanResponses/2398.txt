sorry for the delay in this one, i know all of you were on the edge of your seats. so summer is officially dead and is marked that way with the start of band camp. i'm not even gonna try to stop your giggles. so about the colors for my room.i got 3 to go on. and boy do they rock. the mac n' cheese is good.not sure if it would match my kick-ass lifestyle, the tye-dye one.oh, celine, what to say to that one, too cool for me, and julz with the naked painting.i have too much to say on that matter. thank you for all the outstanding suggestions, and please do keep them coming. so far julz is winning (because its naked? no, because she just said the color that i already told her? probably that). hey, tune in next time when we'll talk about masturbation! 'till then, keep it easy, and keep it fresh.
