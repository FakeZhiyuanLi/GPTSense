triduum a haunt of jackals break free from shackals blood for life no more strife wake up your heart make a new start random thoughts of chaos nothing can slay us redemtion is paid life is made pain and suffering spent your back is bent no more broken neck don't bother to check soft flutter of wings make like new things his body lays took three days he rose untarnished "it is finished" (c)crystal joseph
