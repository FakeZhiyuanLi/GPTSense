okay. crappy title and an even worse subject to write about. but really, what is the deal with the temperatures in wny? for the last few weeks it hasn't rose above 75 at best. i mean its the middle of the freakin summer. i'm used to temps in the 90s with indexs near 105. lord knows why i miss tennessee sometimes, cuz this is some nice a$$ weather we're having around here.
