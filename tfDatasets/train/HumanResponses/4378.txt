soph just found out that it is james' baby. she recognised the guy at the club, and he convinced her that they used a condom. so that's almost a relief. but the best part is that james proposed to soph last night! she said yes. ofcourse she did. (krissie) i did have sex with aaron and im still waiting for the results of a home pregnancy test.i will write in yes or no when i am finished. but even if i am pregnant, the baby is his! oh. my. god.i am pregnant. shit. at least me and soph are gonna be due on the same day. but how can i tell her? and how can i tell aaron! im gonna kill him. he showed me the condoms when i arrived for the night! luv, soph and krissie xxxxxxx
