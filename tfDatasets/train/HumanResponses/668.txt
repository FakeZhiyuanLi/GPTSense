today was boring in its own hectic way, i wake up knowing that school will be upon me in a matter of days, which made me even more tired and slept 2 more hours. s then when i finally come to be, i go to the kitchen and eat a pop tart and plop down on the couch, turn on my laptop, and watched some tv. fastforward to 5pm ok i am at main event with some of my friends that i usually see there. kinda waiting for me to seriously kick ass on the dance pad. when i was halfway through paranoia survivor, everyone was like "damn!" then after completion everyone was cheering and im like seriously fatigued (for about 3 min.) and one of my friends said "you must be very tired" but i was too tired at the time to respond
