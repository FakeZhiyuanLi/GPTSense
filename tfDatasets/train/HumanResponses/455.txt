so while dreading the phone call i was going to make i decided to procrastinate and get the mail. so i walked outside in my moccasins and made my way to my garage. i hopped on my bike and made the trek to my mailbox. upon arriving i collected the mail, skimmed through it, and then turn around, mail in hand. but the mail kept slipping. as i rode i tried severasl different grips before i finally veered off my driveway. desperate measures call for desperate actions i told myself as i push the mail halfway down my shorts and continued up my driveway.
