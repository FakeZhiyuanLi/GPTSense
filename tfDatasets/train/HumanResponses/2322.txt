sticking with my no angst rule. is great here. i guess i'm wasting my talent here, sitting down. working from 9-8. i leave home 6 even. probably the only reason i'm here is her , ha haa. lately my routine was work, home, play with my son for an hour or so, wake up ; wash, rinse, repeat. i've gotta do something about my sleeping habits. have been sleeping for only 6 hours tops lately.
