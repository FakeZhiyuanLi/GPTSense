jackie, i'm not making out with you. lol.sorry, i don't swing that way. i'm not like justin and jason.hahasorry guys, had to say that. lol. but seriously, if we're really going to do this music video thing, then we better get started. there's a lot of work put into those things, i mean they take forever to make. so we should at least pick a song and start brainstorming things we could do in it
