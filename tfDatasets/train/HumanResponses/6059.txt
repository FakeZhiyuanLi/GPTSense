ever since summer started i have been on quite the drinking binge. last night was no different from any other night, i drank way more than i should have, came home too drunk, and passed out in my room with shoes and the lights still on. but alas, i woke about two hours later because i was thirsty. i will tell you, in my seventeen years i have never been more thirsty than those times when i wake up still drunk at about 3 or 4 in the morning. then i went down stairs and chugged who glasses of water. this alcohol-induced thirst could be considered very much the same as sex. stumbling out of bed and down stairs to get the water is like the fucking, finally getting the drink is like the orgasm and getting back into bed is like returning to the party after fucking a girl you just met. getting that drink is actually better than sex i think.
