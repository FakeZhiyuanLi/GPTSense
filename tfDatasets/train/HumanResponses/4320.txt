well today is fourth of july and my family is doing nothing but sitting st home and watching movies and eating a huge meal that my mom cooks like every weekend (its the italian in her). but i'm hoping that we get this block party going thats going to happend in a few weeks, well actually next month probably, but i really want this party to happend b/c i'm gonna be turning 16 soon and want to have a tight party lol well my mom called radio stations to help us with the party and everything and hoping that goes well too. it would have been a lot cooler if i got my licenses on my b-day too, if only i had a car though, hehe. i would go on a small road trip with my friends and not come back untill 2 weeks later (yea right my parents would kill me). anyway, hope that everyone has a tight fourth of july, peace out!
