wow i haven't done one of there in years. well i think im gonna do one now because my friend joes is so cool. well anyways today i went to work at oakland nurseries from 8 till 4 it sucked it was all hot and people were being rude. the only good thing that happened today at work was i saw my old friend josh from middle school. when i got home i took a shower and went to my bud ian horrocks' house we sat around and shot stuff with our air soft guns. then i got home from there at 10:30 and ate some food. then i watched some lame ass show on tv and came up to my room and made this lil thingy. yep so today turned out to be ok.
