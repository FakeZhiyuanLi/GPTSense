it's tuesday and i feel like postingtoday sean called me from montreal and woke me up at 12:45 which is earlier than i'm used to but i can handle it.i went to marks again today, he got his ibook today 14 inch its sweet i'll hopefully get one some day soon. mark said that i can have the triumph its a beast.lol. didn't get to board much today because of the weather but hopefully tomorrow. it's looking really good about going to the warped tour as long as marks mom lets him go her friend was telling her some stories about his shady past so she's gonna have to talk to his parents.lol good stuff. i hope to figure out if we are going to the warped tour by the end of the week we just need to work out the details now. well i'm gonna go and get some watermelon.
