i've tried many blogging tools throughout my life, and i can never find one that i truly like. i like simpleness. i like things to be uncluttered, so i believe, just by only registering, that this is the right place for me. in this blog i may ramble, i may argue, or i may not say anything at all. it depends on my mood at time of post. i will not disclose any extremely personal information on this site purely for safety/security reasons. now, onto the real reason why i'm here. today didn't start off well at all. my sister little friend decided to call the house at 8:30 this morning, while, in the process, waking me up. :( i need sleep! of course, it didn't help at all that i was up untill around 4:30 last night. anyways, the point is, i'm not in a particularly good mood at the moment. hopefully i'll get better soon. anyways, there's not much more i can write about at the present time. so this concludes my first entry. later
