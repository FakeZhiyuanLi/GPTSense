so this is my blog. i just figured out in this hour that i actually have the hotts for eli. and this does present a minor problem . since her and andrew are an item, and since she is in fact not diggin' me. so i guess all thats left to do is say crushes are just a healthy phase of everyday . but for fiction sake- i love getting crushes on things impossible to have and love just entertaining ideas about the whole thing. i cant believe i just now realized what exactly was meant to happen in that bathroom at salon. and all i did was blubber about zoe. what would have happened if you had kissed me instead of andrew? would i be in the lover shoes right now? or would it just have been just a drunken fling? but i could just be imagining this whole reality. ps. if god really intended us to walk then he wouldn't have invented roller skates.
