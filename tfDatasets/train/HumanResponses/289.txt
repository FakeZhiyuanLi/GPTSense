"life shouldn`t be measured in the breaths we take but in the moments that take our breath away. " "never look back until you can no longer see forward" "there`s a light at the end of every tunnel, just pray it`s not a train." "the only time success comes before work is in the dictionary" "anyone who thinks sunshine is pure happiness, has never danced in the rain" "life is like a beautiful melody only the lyrics are messed up"
