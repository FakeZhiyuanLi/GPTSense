that's exactly what i am feeling today. well. the elders always think that their views and opinions are correct. but that's not 100percent. everyone makes mistakes ain't it? no doubt they haveexperience and have seen more stuffs than us, but we are not totally a fool. i wanna make my own decisions, wanna fight for my own rights. but somehow, this will seem rebellious in thier eyes. this is so absurd. i wanna live my own life. why must i live up to their unreachable expectations? i know what i want. i'm not going to live under their pressure and opinions. i wanna break through. to live the life i want, to be the girl i wanna be. to love and to be love by someone who respects my decision. ~jace~
