to my dear cecil gw td jalan ke gramed with my faithfull black grasshopper :) waktu abis bioskop di jatinegara kebetulan macet tuh. gila cil, ada ibu2 bawa anak bayi ngemis and duduk d trotoar padahal udah mao magrib. wah jakarta emang gila. anak sgitu ngga berdayanya terpaksa harus ngisep polusi kendaraan termasuk motor gw yang akibatnya bisa nurunin tingkat kecerdasan tuh anak. ngga adil banget girl. that baby suppose to have equal opportunity as same as we have to enjoy his life. begitu juga dengan ibu2 itu. ngga adil banget buat dia harus gemis2 d jalanan. and you know what is ironic? people surrounding me including my self couldn't do anything about it? some people may consider these as common thing. a part of cosmopolitan life they said. only she and her baby is the bad ones girl.i fell so helpes and mad also jakartaa giiilllaaaaaaaa
