i got my schedule! adv. (179) 1 - lifeline (fh) 2 - cpu diagnostics (t190) 3 - ap english 3 (361) 4 - japanese 3 (344) 5 - lunch 6 - ap chemistry (162) 7 - ap chemistry (164) [ tuesdays and thursdays] 8 - ap calculus bc (t290) 9 - ap us history (354) wow, my transcript is gonna look awesome. i'm also going to die, but that isn't as important. my mornings are pretty easy, so i can sleep in quite a lot and not miss anything. that makes me happy. on the other hand, my afternoons are suicide. whatever, i'll deal with it. at the moment, i have no classes with sarah, no classes with ilana, gym and lunch with alexa, and because adrienne's schedule is fucked up i don't know if i have any classes with her (aside from japanese). i'm bored. - brian
