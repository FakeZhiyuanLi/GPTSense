since i probably will kill the sy_helpdesk website and list after the summer break is over (nothing but a pain and everybody giving me negative vibes on it), i decided to create a blog site instead. if you care to know what's going on over here at my desk, or away from it, check in and read my blogs and feel free to talk back to me if you want to. not sure how i will get the site info out to people, probably wouldn't be too ethical to use the schools email addresses; will have to hash that out with the powers that be. more later as interesting things develop. see ya! ;-)
