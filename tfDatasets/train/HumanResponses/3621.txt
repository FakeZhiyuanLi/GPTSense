today i saw a guy with the name "aragorn69360" i bet thats how many times that name has been used. i mean, come on people, think up some original names here! my friend and i made a mutual account with the name "enky", thats original. so if you're gonna start playin runescape use original names, not ones that have already been used 1,000's of times before.
