ok so yesterday was warped tour and it rocked my socks. wow! it was so great the best part was seeing taking back sunday for the first time and ::drum roll:: crowd surfing for the first time. it was great! a wonderful experience. the adrenalin rush when you are surfing is so great, because two seconds before it looks like they are going to drop you. they catch you and hurl you back in up in the air. its so awesome. i love it too bad ashlie and i are damn sore today. thats the only bad thing. as much as i hate to say it. new found glory was pretty good. i honestly thought they were going to suck but they didnt. yellowcard was good, story of the year was good. coheed and cambria really let me down i expected a lot more from them. oh well! but the highlight of my time there was definatly taking back sunday. its great. but yeah, i've ranted enough about this so im going to go. hey ashlie- bend over and take it like a bitch! haha!
