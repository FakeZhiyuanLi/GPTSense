an open letter. it hit me with the force equivilent to a drop kick in the face. you're a total asshole. you've been one all along. how could i not see that? maybe i had some rare form of brain cancer. i don't know. you grate on my nerves. every little thing i overlooked for the sake of it just irritates the sweet ba-jesus out of me. from one manipulative bitch to another see you in hell.
