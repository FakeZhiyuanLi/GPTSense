omg my partner at work is driving me crazy! why can't he be normal? why does he ask me such stupid questions? why does he freak whne the word"juvenile" is mentioned on the radio? agh! i keep thinking to myself it'll be ok. it's pretty bad when shaclair and jason want out of here so fast, but yet i have to work the whole eight hours with him. i don't dare ask him something or it'll end up in an half to hour long speech. sometimes i don't understand why people are the way they are. i'm not trying to judge but is he really that ignorant? when i work with him i feel way cool and normal, but if he goes and asks an officer or another employee a question it makes me look dumb. he asks the most stupidist questions. help i'll update in a bit more on the day.
