this being the first post i will explain things. this blog is different from my other blog which is mainly for how i feel or felt that day. instead this blog is mainly for talking about whatever topics i believe are worth talking about. that means anything. be it news topics, school topics, or just anything around my life or other lives. anything is subject to scruntiny, critizim, or maybe some praise. as of now i am just currently trying to get this blog setup and ready to go. so nothing else will be posted until i can get things ready.
