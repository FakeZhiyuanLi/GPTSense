i wonder what kind of software pastors need in other countries where mission work is being done. pastors in overseas countries are often balancing another job. they work extremely hard at both jobs to make it all work. i wonder if a church management software suite would help them or if they would say they would rather have a pastor's library on a cd-rom. gathering the data of needs on the mission field would be difficult and would take wisdom. a lot of times i find that when you are attempting to define a software requirement, people have an extremely difficult time understanding their own needs. they also have a difficult time understanding the cost associated with a whim. articulating what they desire is a challenge. no answers today, just questions.
