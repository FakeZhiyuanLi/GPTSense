there is thunder outside. it brings me fear. there is music within. it calms me. if i had the artist’s strength and ability, i’d paint the window. it is beautiful. droplets of rain having run furiously down are now moving with calm. each drop assumes its own direction, its own life. some are still, some still moving. they tell a story- once started, but never finished. the sky is orange. it is indifferent. it is dead. it gave all its life to these fine droplets of nature. these little miracles. no i am wrong. the sky is not dead. lightning just struck in the sky and spoke out in its defense. then calm prevailed. darkness is crouching on me, but really slowly. i don’t know which is better…light or darkness! looking out the window, i find peace. in the music i find peace. but peace comes with a dowry of memories and sadness. but i embrace it. it is only through this sadness that i will discover myself, befriend myself and purge my soul.
