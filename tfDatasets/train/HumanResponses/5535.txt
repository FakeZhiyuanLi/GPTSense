bought [the diary of anne frank] today. i've read that book once before, but i liked it so much that i decided on buying it for myself in the end. plus, also got a cd, [borrowed heaven], by the corrs. i can't decide which track i like best! wish i could keep up with the [euro 2004], but i don't have cable tv. it's fascinating to watch. before i forget, england lost to france 2-1, 13 june. but i'm hoping that england will score croatia (june 21). on a more delightful note, england won switzerland 3-0 yesterday
