my book briefly touched base on the different parties the sororities and fraternities have. they tell how when they tell people they do service work, they really just throw an awesome party and have an outrageouse cover charge and demand the sisters and all brothers to attend. this os course, however leads to all the date rapes, and social interaction forced upon the sisterhood of many sororities. fraternities aren't as bad, because they are the one's doing the raping and interactions payed to them by the "big sisters."
