this went better, mr piercy was there. it was quite funny. we did a lot on a bit where jenny has to shoot a 'gun' around, but everyone does it now, and jo dies and falls over, and then i catch her, and realise it's a guy (the character), and then drop her (not too far). i think the rehearsal went well.
