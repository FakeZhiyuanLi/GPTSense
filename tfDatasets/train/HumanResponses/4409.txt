got some comments from my supervisor on my first chapters. although the ideas are good, they need to put into a framework and the ideas need to be ordered and presented better. he suggested i should add some drawings, tables graphs etc if that would make it easier to explain. might help, since i already have a lot of those and couldn't get them into words properly. furthermore my software has arrived, jay :), but the sysad is sick so it can't be installed, boo :( oh and my brother suggested to not call it (tue dec 09, 03:35:53 pm) "gravity" but something like auto-balance. i agree it's a bit better, i don't really need the user to fall down everytime, but the get upright if floating upside down.
