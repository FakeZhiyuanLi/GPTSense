my roommate geraldine and i decided to give our bathroom, entry hall and her bedroom a makeover. after 4 hours in the mall, we ended up with some great stuff! all crimson! didn't think about it until we got home, but our apartment is really showing my cougar pride :) my roommate goes to hawaii pacific university, but she isn't one to own a t-shirt that says hpu, let alone use the school colors for decorating. oh well, i'm really liking all the red in here though. 2 months until the coug's football season getting excited already!
