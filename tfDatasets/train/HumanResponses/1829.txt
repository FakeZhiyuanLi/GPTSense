why is it when something negative comes my way i run and hide? i push away all the people that i truly care about and i crawl in to a dark closet with in my mind and slowly shut down. i still to this day don't know how to take rejection when all my life its all i had you would think id be used to it by now, i was never good enough for my mother all the guys i dated treated me like shit what did i do to deserve this? all i ever wanted was to be loved unconditionally, now i see my self unable to give the love that is needed to my beautiful daughters, why cant my daughters love be good enough for me? why do i need the love and approval of a man to fulfill me  i just don't understand where i went wrong in my life!
