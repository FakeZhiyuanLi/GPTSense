today i went to relay for live with my mom and met up with chaley. her and i walked back to her house because we were gunna swim. chaley's boyfriend doesn't want her talking to boys and most of all me. so she was a little worried. but we were swimming for awhile when the dog started barking and chaley's boyfriend can out the back door. i couldn;t do anything but laugh i thought it was really funny but apparently not her boyfriend. so though it'd be best to change and leave so i did.
