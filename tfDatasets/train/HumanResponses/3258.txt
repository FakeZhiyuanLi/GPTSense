there is always a part of me that hopes that i'll know the truth of her feelings. i hope or should i say, i dream that she has feelings for me too. well, i constanly tell myself to forget about, i guess the "out of sight, out of mind" thinking is not working for me. i just hope that i'll survive the depression that may come if i ever know the hard truth.
