the sky becomes an arena and the stars fill the stands as the giant settles in the west, casting its delicate orange glow across the horizon. the eternal enemy appears in the eastern sky, the silvery harbinger of the black future, a menacing crescent cutting through the dark blue abyss. uttering a silent roar, the bringer of day and life unleashes a brilliant display of pinks, purples, oranges and reds. fading. a golden ray kisses the earth, as if to say goodbye. a crimson tear explodes, searing the clouds as it falls behind the earth, turning them into firey embers of the heavens. a last glorious flicker, a mighty farewell. gone. shadows slowly sweep across the land, minions of the victorious, the ruler of the night. warmth fades. the symphony of twilight emerges. crickets, owls, all laughing at the firey demise. the glow in the west will fade, the aftermath of an epic duel, replaced by silky moonlight. thanks for watching
