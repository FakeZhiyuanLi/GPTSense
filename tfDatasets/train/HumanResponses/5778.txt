so. back home again. i've been buying some neat stuffs, in the past two weeks i've been gone. two issues of newtype usa, 4 mangas and a german anime-magazine (haha). and two cds, a south park-cd and the music from star wars:. uh, the last movie *ashamed to have forgot the name, being a big fan of it and all* i also ordered a gamecube yesterday, and pre-booked tales of symphonia. it'll most probably be here in the end of the week. all that's left's a memorycard.
