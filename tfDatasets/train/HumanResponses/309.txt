everyday is a new day. this is what i would use to comfort myself everytime i overcome a situation. for now, i'm an unemployed fresh graduate. it's been months and yet i have not found a job. but fortunate for me, i am a happy person and i take things easy. well, i have said lots of nonsense. guess i have to make things short. better stop here before i bored anyone. chao
