last week it all came to a head after months of holding it in, i quit my job and this is what happened: you know how little things can build up and you hold it inside until you can't take it any more? well thats what i did. i came back last week at the end of the day and jim started on me about something that was of no big deal but i blew up and started yelling at him and him at me and the next thing i know i quit. i stormed out of the office and went home. it hit me what i had just done about half way home. i knew i was wrong in geting mad and quiting but what was done was done. i went home and told my wife and she didn't say a word.
