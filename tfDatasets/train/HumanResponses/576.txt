man i hate the klez virus. for the last few weeks i've been getting hammered by some moron infected by the klez.h virus. for the last week or so i've been trying to track the bastard down. i figure in couple of days i should have their entire address book. tonight they managed to slip trough my fingers but i have a much better lead on who it is. it's actually the first time mail server error with their ip three minutes after it was sent, so i quick telneted into my modem banks and did a show all conn but by that time they were already logged off. son of a!
