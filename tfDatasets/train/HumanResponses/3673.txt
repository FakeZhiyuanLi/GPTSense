oh yes! last night was so great! ok so yesterday at about noon (i woke up at 10, so what seemed early to me, was really later haha) or so i saw sarahs away message asking if anyone wanted to come and i was like heck ya! so just an hour-ish before i had to leave for my orthodontist appointment, we figured everything out. so then i left for my appt. and then right afterwards, i had like 10 minutes at home or something then i left to sarahs house. then we hung out then her friends ben and brian picked us up and drove us to del mar where the concert was. we got pretty good seats and the concert was great. maroon 5 was awesome and sarah knew all the songs haha so it was really fun! then afterwards we went to chevys. then we drove home. it was tons of fun! it was a lot more fun than my bowling night.
