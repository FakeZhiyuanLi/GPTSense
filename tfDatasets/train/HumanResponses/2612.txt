i'm seriously dying for some japanese food right now, but alas, i am broke and know no one who even likes the stuff. it's sad. in other news.well there is no other news, i just thought it would be fun to post something else. boring aren't i? it's extremely hot here. according our handy thermometer it is currently 90°f, and with the heat index it feels like 102°f. yuck! so um yeah, i guess that's it. ::zzzzzzzzz::
