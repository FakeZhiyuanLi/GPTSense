tony tony tony again! yep once again "the mouth that roared" causes issues  this time in sonomo. spins out at least 3 guys, including brian vickers. and then after the race attacks vickers while he's still belted in his car with his helmet on?!?! stewart starts yapping at vickers, while vickers is like "what's your problem, you spun me out?" last year busch needed a little fellow driver justice (from jimmy spencer) but tony spun vickers out! nascar is still waiting to announce the penalty and this time it could be very severe. i think that most people have had about enough of tony's antics. his souvenir sales should start taking a hit. it was one thing for him to have run-ins with reporters at a race but attacking a defenseless 20 year old rookie is another. brian vickers should get some credit, he's handled himself very well.
