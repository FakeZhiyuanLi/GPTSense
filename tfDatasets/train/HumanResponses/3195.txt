i sit and cry, your soul is missing nothing to touch, nothing to feel you are so far away, like gold from the rainbow, from eldorado shadows before me glimpses behind me i hold my head in dispair sad that you, are not here like a frame with no picture i hang my sorry head wishing for your touch like the pollen needs the wind
