every day it has been raining. now, i knew it was going to rain when we moved here. i suppose it is still the residuals from hurricane alex. just the sky is so dark. makes it for such a brooding day. the rain coming down so hard it looks like a fire hose is on. a new development! my son lost another tooth today! :) that is always exciting. he said a carrot got it out. lol. he has all these theories about how things work, how things are, how things come to be. quite amazing actually. little mad scientist. well back to work.
