how apt to start my blog with hi. and probably introductions are in order as well. i am francis nor capule, a heterosexual single dad of a three year old son that works for a call center somewhere in makati. twenty seven years old, single, poetry dabbler , conversationalist , and bull-shitter-par-excellance. i even tried selling the sun to one my former trainors, which i did , technically, he hee. i'm gonna have to think of ways so my blog doesn't become an angst filled, psychoanalyst' treasure trove of discontent. welcome to my world.
