when are the start and stop dates for d-teams this 2004-2005 time span. i know we talked about ending d-teams at the beginnning of june, are we planning on starting d-teams middle of september or beginning of october? this can then give us a time frame for the number of weeks that we have vs. the content that needs to be taught. thanks, - kevin
