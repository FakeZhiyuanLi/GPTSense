yay, hi guys. :) i did invite katy but her invite still says "pending", so i guess she hasn't checked her email lately. your new boots sound very cool, dani - very melissa auf der maur, i bet! a meet up sounds like a great idea. any suggestions as to when? we broke up from college on friday. yay! no more getting up early! (until september, that is.) i don't have many plans for the holidays either, except the fest with you lot.
