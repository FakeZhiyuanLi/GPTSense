when it comes down to being a man around you i fall like the walls of berlin what can i do to get next to you to make you laugh to make you smile like when were children in the 80's listening to punk and new wave i could take your hand and show that i have what you are looking for make this day last forever make my breath stain the glass my finger delivers how about you? the wheels are turning i have come to a complete stop and now i stand in front of you and i lost the power of speech what ever happened to me i used to be so cool but now i play myself the fool and the world spins around this room the glare follows your shadow and to say i am here for only you i have lost control of my thoughts of my heart no more room for feeling sorry story of my life
