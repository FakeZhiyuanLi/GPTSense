so i did get another book.stephen king  the shining. it's pretty famous i think, and it looked like a good book. its a horror book or whatever, so it's probably gonna totally freak me out since i usally read downstairs in my room.at night.in the dark.all alone.and since my room doesn't have doors, there's the dark room next to it.and that's creepy. :-(
