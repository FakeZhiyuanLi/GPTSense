yesterday i visited a dutch weblog which i visit quite often. one of the posts was about how great the eighties were. well, let me tell you: the eighties sucked harder than a baby on a breast. we didn't have internet for starters. most of us didn't even have a pc yet. no mobile phones, no digital cameras, no mini-discs, no cd-roms. but we did have: the berlin wall, thatcher, a black michael jackson, a pope who could still talk understandably, etc. and this: eighties hairdos and duran duran (with wicked eighties hairdos): please leave your opinion or views in the comments.
