i have been addicted to a game called "kingdom hearts" lately. starting over a couple of times, i finally obtained a file that i did well in. instead of losing the race in the beginning, i actually won. now the gummi ship is called excalibur. i win riku, so you can go cry in a hole somewhere, but not in my gummi ship. i don't tolerate that bullshit.
