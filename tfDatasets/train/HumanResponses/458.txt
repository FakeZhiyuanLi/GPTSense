shellhammer's has a half-price cheese steak on mondays. its only $4 and its really not that bad. certainly not geno's, but still respectable. when i was in high school, and perhaps even before that, i had this little game i played with myself to get over what i later found out was depression. i'd pick one thing - anything - that i could look forward to on a given day. it could be something big like playing a show, or something small like - well like a half price cheese steak. the point was, i'd fixate on that one thing, and if at any point during the day i needed some sort of motivation or pick up, i'd just think about that day's thing and i'd feel all better. anyway, there's a half-price cheese steak tomorrow at shellhammers with my name on it. i'll be reminding myself of that around 6:30 when my alarm goes off.
