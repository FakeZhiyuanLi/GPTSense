familiar? of course. choices are hard to make. some lead to eternity, and some lead to ruin. some people choose using their reason, and some by emotions. i used reason a lot in the past. but now, i don't know. perhaps this is just a phase. did someone really say i'd rather be a king in hell than be a servant in heaven? i guess so. the choices ones make are a measure of their soul. i wish when the time comes, mine would shine, as bright as the sun.
