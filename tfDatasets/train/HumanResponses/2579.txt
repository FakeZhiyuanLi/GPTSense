as those of you who have sated your primal desires to read my profile know, today is my last day on earth as a 33-year old human being. tomorrow is my birthday. now, as happens every year, i don't know what i "want" for my birthday any more than i do for christmas. gifts are cool, gimme gimme, but don't ask me what i want. i don't know. i think my fiance is getting me a cell phone, like hers. her cellphone has e-mail, video games, tv channels, limited range mind control laser targeting, the works. hell, i don't even wear a watch, which is the 3rd most evil thing mankind has ever invented, behind #2 - nuclear weapons, and #1 - pepsi-cola. i guess it's time for me have a cell phone too.
