a handful of trollocs immediately plugged up the opening. our chances of getting in were slim. i fondled my sword and a grin spread across my face.i took the cloak off the myrddraal and wrapped it around me, pulling the hood over my head enough to hide my face. i took up the sword and motioned for curtis to climb the wall. i walked out in front of the trollocs and with a swift movement of my hand they parted and i caught a glimpse of that girl disappear. i ordered the trollocs to follow her.
