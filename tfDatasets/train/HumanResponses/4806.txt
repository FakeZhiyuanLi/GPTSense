well, i have a splitting headache, and the fact that jill scott herons band in the space below me is still on the same somg they played all day yesterday isn't helping much. the file server here at work is down so i cant acess the products files i need to create the owners manuals and users manuals for the port authority in nyc bus terminal. lol, like i really want to anyway :) anyway i guess i need to find somthing to do and play with my blog and other new toys once i get home.
