i "break up" with someone when i most need someone. i had a post from a while ago, where i just simply stated that i wanted to be held. and it's apparently still true. i sent myself a text message, intending for someone else to read it. all it said was that i wanted to be kissed. they didn't see it, and i didn't get kissed. some people are smart. when they want to be held they just find someone. but i always have emotional attachments. i wish i didn't, but i do. so i'm here alone, talking to two people that i've broken up with. and i know that if i made a move on either of them, i could get what i want. or at least some of what i want. but i want so much more then just sex. i want love, too. and that's my biggest problem.
