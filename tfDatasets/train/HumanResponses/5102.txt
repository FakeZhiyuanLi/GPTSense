hmm. this was my first day of actual summer vacation and i had to get up at like 7 b/c my sister wanted me to go with her to her chiroprators appt and on the way there while i had been very nice to actually get up and go with her, she starts getting all mad at me. im like what the heck why r u yelling at me when im doing something nice for you so anyays now im sitting here and waiting for her to be done with her appt. how boring.hopefully, today will get better so the beginning of my summer does not look so bleak.
