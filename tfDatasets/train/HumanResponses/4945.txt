almost every client i have had has asked, is avg better than norton? i used to say that just get completely rid of norton and install avg. for you people that don't know, avg is a free anti-virus system. i use it for both my personal use and we use it up at school. up until recently i got rid of norton on computers i fix and put avg on but i was wrong. factory professionals decide to put norton on new systems and i think that these professionals know quite a bit more than a 16 year old (me). the reason that i dislike norton is because when i had a p3 (733mhz) and i ut norton on there and it slowed it down miserably. now i see a slight decrease in speed but not that much. i say if you already have norton, keep it, if you don't get avg.
