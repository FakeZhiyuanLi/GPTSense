well, i was a chicken shit! i didn't tell anthony that i liked him. all i did was ask him to sign my yearbook. i pouted and said i wasn't coming back next year. he said it was a bummer and that he would miss me. then i started thinking that i should have given him my cell number. it sucked because i totally wanted to kiss him, but he looked so cute and perfect that i couldn't just blatantly kiss him. i don't know.i was too scared!
