hello people! just a little update. our wonderful cell group has got a number of members going for the youth g1 mission trip to chinagmai, thailand. hui hui, marilyn and shem are all in the performing arts category. they will be learning 14 dances within a short period of three and a half days during the boot camp. paul and i are in the mercy ministry category. we will be going to an orphanage over there to help build a building for the thai orphans. please remember us in your prayers. pray that the performers will be able to learn all the dances and that they will be able to use what they have learnt to bless the thais. pray also that paul and i will be able to reach out the the little kids out there who have lost their parents. we all hope to have a wonderful and meaningfull mission trip. god bless!=)
