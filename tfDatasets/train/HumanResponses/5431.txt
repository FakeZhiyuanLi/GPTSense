i can’t stand reading; in fact i haven’t read a complete book since 7th grade. i always get to lazy or to bored half way through the book and just look up the ending on spark notes, but today that changed. i started reading a book called digital fortress, by dan brown. brown is most famous for his book the da vinci code. i started to read the da vinci code but it was one of the most confusing books i have ever touched. digital fortress is a mystery/thriller book about the national security agency and their encryption machine that has worked for decades and one day it faces a code that it can not break. in less than 12 hours i read 200 of the 375 page book which is a record for me. i hope to finish by tonight and i have purchased another book by brown called deception point. dan brown is one of the best authors i have ever read an plan to read more of his books.
