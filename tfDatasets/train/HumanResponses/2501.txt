ziploc bags are male, cuz they hold everything in, but you can always see right through them. shoes are male, cuz they are usually unpolished, with theirtongues hanging out. sponges are female, cuz they are soft, squeezable and retain water. the subway is male, cuz it uses the same old lines to pick people up. tires are male, cuz they sometimes go bald and are often over-inflated. photocopiers are female, cuz once turned off, they take a while to warm up. hammers are male, cuz they haven't evolved much over the last 5,000 years, but they are handy to have around.
