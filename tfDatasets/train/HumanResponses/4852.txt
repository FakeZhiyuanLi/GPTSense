so summer is getting here. the kids only have 3 more days of school! then i'm not sure how i'm going to fit int the laundry and the grocery shopping while being with the kids at the club all day. i'm sure i'll figure it out but it might take a week or two of trial and error. only 15 days till i get to go home to ohio then on vacation with brent and his family! i'm so excited!
