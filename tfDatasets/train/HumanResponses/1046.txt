this is my first time i create my blog, and my class mate, khadijah, taught me how to create it. today i was suppose to go fishing with my friends at our secret place( i think), but because of we dont have any bait, we canceled the plan(hmm so sad). waaaaa! so boring, so i chat with khadijah and farhan. and khadijah, u dont mind if i put "life as a student and teenager" to? ok thats all i have to say today. bye
