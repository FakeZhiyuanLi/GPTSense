yes, i got a call today at 11:30 that i didn't have to work! that must be the happiest feeling in the world, i seriously jumped up and down in happiness. it means less money, but i needed a break anyway. i still have to work tommorow though, but alteast i have the day off! unfourntunately i only found out now, so i was still thinking about work all the time up till now :s, i really should check my messages allot more often .
