damn, i just haven't had the time to come here the past few day, with so much going on. well, for some reason i cant seem to remember what i was doing on monday, but i am pretty sure i was busy. but, anyways, yesterday i went over to mike's with luke and that was the first time i had seen him since we got out of school. by that point i was starting to wonder if he even existed and i didn't make him up. luke was feeling nice i guess because when we went out to the mall he bought me a meal, as kind of a birthday present. later that night i got the spiderman 2 game, and holy crap is it great. i love it, it's so much better than the first one and i don't suck at it. i also finally got my new memory card, so all my storage problems are over. so i guess that's it. later.
