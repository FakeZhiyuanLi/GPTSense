my days are getting really bad, sunburned, annoyed really easily. i'm tired of everybody trying to keep everybody else happy. why can't everybody just be straight forward with everybody else and make it so much simpler for everyone. everyone in this world is too easily offended and too worried about offending everyone else; they all need to simply get over their problems caused by differences and be truly happy instead of faking it all the time to make themselves look good. nobody is perfect and always happy so just be human and stop worrying about keeping everybody happy and just be yourself!
