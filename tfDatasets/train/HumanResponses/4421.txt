i've been a naughty boy. i have been out last night and i had a teenie-weenie bit too much to drink. and now i'm at work with a teenie-weenie bit of a hangover. the thirst is the worst part, not so much the headache. i tried smoking a cigarette earlier but i couldn't finish it. my mouth feels like an ashtray right now. work and hangovers don't go well together. what should be my punishment? tell me in the comments.
