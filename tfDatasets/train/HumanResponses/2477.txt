this evening when i had a shower i was walking down to my room and looked out the front window at the sunset and it was so beautiful, this sounds so stupid but it was just so amazing i just stood there and watched it for a few minutes and now i'm in a really thoughful mood.there are some people i want to talk to in this thoughtful mood(more like one)but i think that i will save it for another thoughtful day. on another note, we have sex ed again tomorrow and my venus presentation! prepare to be amazed classmates of mine. i cant think of anything else to say, which is weird for me but i am feeling spacey i will be more generous with words next post.
