good morning and good night good morning, sunshine not a darkest night only such an early light indeed potent with might paint the sky with royal blue to promise for the loyal of embracing our yellow star to illumine its mellow about ready to call noon such indeed an high time going to make a chime to have a vegetarian prime brush the heaven with pink at best and so raw to think about longingly of the sleep alas sunset's going to weep darken the azure with a knack color the night in pitch black perfect time to lie on my back good night, sweet dreams ~kekua march 2004
