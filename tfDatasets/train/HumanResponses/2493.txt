as a child, i would pray. not always, but sometimes. i had only one prayer that i had read somewhere and thought was rather neat and all that. "please god bless everyone and help me to be good". (the bless 'everyone' included me ofcourse.and i wasn't really asking for anything specific for myself either!). it's been a while since i gave up making that petition, but i was thinking about it today. and i was thinking about how i want some poeple to be 'blessed' a lil more than some others now. i wonder if this is what growing up is about.
