a tornado swept through lexington last night. it was accompanied by a huge thunder storm. 150 homes were damaged, 50 of them were completely destroyed. one of my offices is on generator power. it may be a couple of days before power is restored. my wife and i sat up on the top floor of our house watching the lightning. all the while the weather man on tv was telling everyone to get to the lower floors and take cover. i guess we aren't too smart. the electricity went out for a few seconds. it blew out one of my computer monitors. it's dead. it was my newest monitor. it probably just blew a fuse.i'll pop it open this weekend and see what's wrong with it.
