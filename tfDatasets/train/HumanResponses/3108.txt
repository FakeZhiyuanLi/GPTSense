thursday i took a flyfishing course, and went fishing later that night. as most times i'm not were luck when it comes to catch fish. friday went by, but at the end of the day i tried to call rocco about setting uo a meeting. unfortunately his was in stockholm editing his latest movie. guess i'll call him again over the weekend. sunday we had my mom and grandparents over for a bbq.
