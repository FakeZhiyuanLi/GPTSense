yes, yes, i am the one giving it, not out of spite, just got nothing to say. how could i have anything to say after all the nastiness that has spewed forth out of his mouth, i mean venimously nasty stuff, things you just don't say. forgiveness is the key i know, but how many times do you forgive, only to line up again. i am so sick of the slamming doors and the tension. i just want to take myself and my daughter away from all this, but how. i pray that god will show me the way. i do not like the impact it is having on my daughter. such innocent minds get affected so easily and i have done so much to keep her on the right track - to set her up well in her young years. what is going to happen, where are we going, what am i to do. lord, i know you will give me the answers in your time, but, the time is now to know or do or change or whatever it is you have in mind.
