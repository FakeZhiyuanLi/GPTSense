i was downstairs watching the olymipics with my father. some girl had won the gold in gymnastics, and she was being interviewed and asked if she wanted to have done anything differently and such. well, the dogs start barking, so i get up and let them go outside. while i'm letting them run out the back door, my father changes the channel to becker. as i head back, i hear from the tv screen, " you don't know what you're doing! just admit it! admit it! *slap!* " the only thing i can say is "man, what the hell's gotten into bob costas?"  i went to that "big brother" thing today. it was quite the sroty, let me tell you. however, i'm quite tired tonight after a long day. i'll update this weekend with the whole story.
