missed my job interview yesterday, due to laziness, as usual. i found myself indulging in bad habits so much that im getting slacker each day. but today, i've made up my mind to go for the interview at 9am. and i wont overslept this time, not when i choose not to sleep at all. for some reason, i feel tat i have found the ger i wanted to love.but the time is not ripe, and i still haf to wait. hope tat she can wait too.
