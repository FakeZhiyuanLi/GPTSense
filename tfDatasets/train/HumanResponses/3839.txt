well we had a monster garage sale today in which everything was outside in my yard. a lot of it sold and we got a lot of offers for out skidoos/quad so it was good. i never sold much of my stuff, but i still got $40 for helping from 6am to like 2pm. the weekend is going good. spent a lot of time with bev which is always fun, but she had to go babysitting tonight when we were suppose to go see harry potter 3 so that kinda sucks. i think i might do a bit of studying. since i havn't started that yet, it might be a good idea "dropkick murphys - never alone"
