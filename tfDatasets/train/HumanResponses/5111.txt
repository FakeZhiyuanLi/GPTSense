dream 1 - i found another black cat who was just like my old cat dolemite in most ways, the size, the personality and everything and i wasn't sure if it was him or not, but i was going to keep him. he and gunther seemed to get along. but all of this occured in my grandparent's old house in ma. i still really miss dolemite.
