and so it seems that i've actually managed to finish this layout today. many thanks to all the template authors that have submitted their templates to blogger. i learned a lot, probably more than i had bargained for. i think everything's working hopefully. ^.^ i had to completely redo the template, as it's been practically forever since i last used blogger or blogger code. needless to say, it did kick my arse until i realized i'd have to steer all of the site's content with the style-sheet. ewps. no hot-wiring this time! a few tweaks here and there, and i think i can probably make everything work in both ie in addition to firefox(the browser i primarily use). content coming soon! and there's lots of it.
