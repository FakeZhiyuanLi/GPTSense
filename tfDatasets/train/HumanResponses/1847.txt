it has been an hour in the making, but i finally finished my cool new picture to fit the whole "cartoon" theme of my website. it took me a while to find a website with a face designer, because everyone knows i am not that much of an artist. i found this one website that was so good, i decided to make all of my friends too. so i shall be asking everyone else to change their profile pictures to the cool new cartoon pictures i made.
