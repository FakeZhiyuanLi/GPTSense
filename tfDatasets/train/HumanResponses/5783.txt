my brother has been following the game formerly known as "project ego" since, well, it was title "project ego". and in the information i've learned from him i can tell you fable will be one spanktastic rpg. being the fact that rpg is my favorite game genre, fable could easily become my favorite game of all time. sure, to beat out the legend of zelda: orcarina of time would be a rare accomplishment indeed, fable certainly has the potential to do so. halo 2 better not leave space for game of the year just yet.
