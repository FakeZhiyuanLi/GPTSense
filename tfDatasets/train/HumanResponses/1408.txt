ahh i just heard that song. no matter what type of mood im in that song always makes me cry. so many things attached with that song. lol. its kinda sad, because i dont even know why i cry to that song it really aint all that serious. yennoe? i guess because i wish i had someone to be my hero, i know it sounds pathetic, but no one ever really shows me that compassionate feeling, except my mom, but that aint the same. i guess that would also be my fault, cause at times im a major bitch. then i see people who are much more bitchier then me and they have a person. i guess im just upset because no matter what i always like someone but they never like me back, which sucks. but whatever im gonna go before i upset myself more, im baking a cake and talking so i need concentration !
