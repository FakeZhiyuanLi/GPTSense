for all of you out there, the one or maybe two of you, who will miss my blogging these next 4 days have no fear. i plan to document the entire weekend via our happy little digital camera. i will have plentttyyy of pictures for you once we get back. *you should probably know here that i tend to talk a big game when it comes to taking pictures and usually don't end up with what i had originally planned* i do promise that i will take some though. have a greatttt weekend and i'll be blogging when we get back. later kiddos!
