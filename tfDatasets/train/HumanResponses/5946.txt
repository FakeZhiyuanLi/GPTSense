today brought a new meaning to let it rain. i woke up today and it was pouring rain, i got dressed as i had to meet someone ^_^. ack too nervous to eat, i went to the bus :-p praying for my life 'cause i was going to surrey :p. anyways i bussed there everything went fine and i had a very good time [ i'm leaving this vague so i get the joy of questions from people who actually read my blog ]. i had to lie to get there but it was all good. anyways :-p i had a good dinner and yeah here i am now. poo anywho this morning after i woke up the rain reminded me of a song. haha i know it's corny and everything but when i was a little kid my mom used to always listen to amanda marshall, sheryl crow and stuff like that :p so anyways it reminded me of amanda marshall - let it rain. haha so the songs been in my head all day. anyways i'm gonna get back to chatting with all you people :-p. ciao
