started drivers ed. again today. i would of already had my permit if i had not gone on vacation to florida when i was taking the class for school in feb. but i have to admit, the trip was worth it. on the bright side, i only have to go for 15 more days. july 1st i should have my permit if all goes well. when i got home, sense i'm now offically on summer vacation, i did what i've been wanting to do for a long time, absolutly nothing. i just sat around watching t.v. (of course nothing good was on -_-) but it was a good day. other than that, i didn't do anything today. planning to go to my friend micheal's house tomorrow but he might already have plans, we'll see what happens.
