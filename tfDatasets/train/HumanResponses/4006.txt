my husband, john, took the kids to claire's, the girly accessories boutique in the mall. my older daughter, chelsea (14 years) needed to buy a gift for a friend's birthday. as chelsea and my middle daughter emily (9 years) shopped, john and my son andrew (5 years) found themselves uncomfortably alone. they soon realized they were the only two guys in the shop and not wanting to interrupt the girls' shopping momentum, he and andrew sat down on the only chair in the whole shop, a high stool placed in a corner of the store next to a mica counter. unfortunately, the guys didn't realize where they were sitting until a young woman, flashing with gold from her bare midrif to her eyebrows, nose and pouting lower lip, approached them with a sharp instrument. "where do you want to get pierced," she asked. john and andrew stared at miss genx with wide eyes and then ran for their lives!
