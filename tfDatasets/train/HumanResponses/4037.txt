a co-worker of mine refers to her lover as "partner." i thought that was awesome, until i found out that my co-worker's lover is a man. i could understand the nomenclature if my co-worker were a cowboy. not only do cowboys like to use the word "partner," but cowboys are men, and if she were a man, she could refer to her male lover as "partner" because she'd be pretty damn gay. but this just doesn't make sense.
