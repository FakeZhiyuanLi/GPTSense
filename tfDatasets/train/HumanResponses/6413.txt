i just read my first blog and realized that i sound completely mental. actually, i'm a really happy person. ask anyone who knows me and they would tell you that i'm a positive person with a great attitude. i suppose because i'm so sunshine on the outside, that writing tends to bring out the dark side of the moon, so to speak. there is some yin to the yang. if i were acting, or even doing something with a play, i would be a much happier person. hopefully "blog therapy" will help motivate me to get out there an actually do it, and not sit around and feel sorry for myself and beat myself up for what i haven't done. hopefully a few months from now i won't even be writing my blog, because i'll be working on something and wont need to vent my frustations to the internet. more positive and upbeat blogs to come. i promise.
