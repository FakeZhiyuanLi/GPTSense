rather than saying hello and welcome to my little corner of the ish/www i'll just say this is an experiment and i'll most likely get bored of this and updates will all but disappear when the fall semester begins and eventually quit within a year. otherwise i hope this is interesting enough (once i get some real content up, perhaps i should have come up with some before posting) to warrant return visits.
