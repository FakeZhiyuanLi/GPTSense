polka dots appearing on these pages. i don’t remember the last time i cried like this. it’s so hard to say goodbye to something so beautiful. how can something so brief, so distant be so painfully sad. i only have tomorrow’s time to relish and i wish tomorrow would last forever. because after tomorrow, things will not be the same. why does it hurt so bad? where did all this pain come from, how did it get here? pain finding its way through my eyes. it’s like dying a bit. there’s this weird connection that we have that feels so damn right, so damn perfect and so utterly rare. . to hopeless romantics like us, all things happen for a reason. you almost wonder if it was a cosmic trick of fate that brought us together. if the end is staring us at our faces right now. i just don’t get the point fate is making. if moving on means moving away from you then i don’t know if i want to move on at all.
