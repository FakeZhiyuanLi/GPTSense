life just sucks. i've been banned from humanity. erperhaps i should rephrase thati've been banned from the pc and im actually online illegally. * shhh * the reason for this was a really stupid incident involving stupid people. thanks to them i've resorted to self mutilation and some prayers and im all done now. yes yes call me psycho. anyway, today i made the best fish and chips ever. yummy i cant wait to make it again someday. the hot and cripsy yet tantalizing skin of the white fresh flesh is truly delicious somehow. fish and chips has gotten into my heart. oh yeah orang utan's too. i hope they remain foreva! oo.i better get going before i get caught! cyah coconuts and asses!
