watched the m*a*s*h move today. it's very funny but not as good as the tv show. it was very confusing at first because all of the characters were different except radar. nice 'n sunny today, hard to believe there's a hurricane a few states down from us. trapper: "hi frank." frank: "that was totally uncalled for." hawkeye: "why don't we just drop an atomic bomb?" flagg: "hey. don't try to make friends with me."
