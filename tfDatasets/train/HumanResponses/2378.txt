here's just a few tips on making neopoints. 1. play the games. especially the featured game because it pays you x2 what you'd normally make on the game. 2. if you do not have a shop, create one. keep your shop stocked at all times. 3. if you happen to buy an item that others sell for less than the main shops sell it for, try to avoid buying that item again. but go out into the market place and buy from the ones who set prices way to low! 4. go by the shop wizard's prices to get an idea of a price that you are comfortable with. just try to keep that price reasonable. if it's too high, people will not buy from your shop. 5. i buy the scratchcards, and i scratch them myself instead of selling them.
