i got called in to work for 1:00 to 5:30. my mom's friend's relative got sick and she had to leave work. i also have to work here shift on friday afternoon. i was bored at home, but now, i get to be bored but get paid. x.x my life is so boring, my blogs are very short. those annyoing mosquitoes have something to fight against :p i got a bug zapper that looks like a tennis racket. i wanted to use it, but i haven't seen any bugs today :/ strange, when i want bugs, they disappear. . *yawns* 04dop0630
