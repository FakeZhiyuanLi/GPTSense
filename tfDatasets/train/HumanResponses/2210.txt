last night,i had a crazy dream that i was teaching in school. my teacher had turn into kids. and i laid down the rules. i gave them a hundred history books to memorize each night. and made them read on their heads, without turning on the lights. i send them on a feild trip, to the outskirts of mongolia. and gave them an overnight assighment, to grow a 20 foot purple magnolia! i asked them how many awful grades can cause how many tears. and if they got 1 answer wrong, i will just hung them up by their ears. and when they talk or laugh in class, i will pinched them to they cry. louder and louder! till i woke up, feeling very satisfied.
