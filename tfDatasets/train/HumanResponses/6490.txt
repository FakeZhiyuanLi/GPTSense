at an article remarking on the 200th aniversery of burr killing hamilton. the article talked mostly about hamilton and said basically nothing about burr or the events leading to the duel. it ignored the fact that burr was only pushed into calling for a duel by the arrogent position hamilton took in their corrispondence. it also claims that hamilton missed on purpose, something i have seen no evidence of elsewhere and something i very much doubt hamilton would do. in this view it also fails to consider the incredible innaccuracy of the weapons they were using in the duel. it does a good job of describing the period, but forgets that burr doing the killing is just as important as hamilton being killed.
