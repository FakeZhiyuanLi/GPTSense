i feel like something is missing. i have never felt the days pass so slow like this. it used to go so fast, i wake up, get on the channel and laugh and laugh. until i have to go do some work, in the late afternoon. i thought i can live without my so called friends. i thought they were just my laugh buddies. but what do i know? i need them more than i know and think. i feel so alone. so lonely. how can people, such strangers, make me feel so lonely? maybe i am clingy. maybe i am needy. but they do make me happy. i try to be happy with ray as much as i can. but they are different. they just come out spontaneously and make me feel like a true friend. like we all knew each other for the longest time. so what do i do? i wish i can turn back time. this is one thing that i can say i really regret having done. when i just let them walk away like that.
