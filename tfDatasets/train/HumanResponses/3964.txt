music, how could anyone live without it when i think about it, i'm always listening to or thinking about music. music is a constant thing always following me wherever i go. most recently, i've been listening to adore's version of "your love o lord", since it's one of our new songs for oneighty. i really must say, they did an excellent job at creating a new and much better version of the song. i think all the versions of the songs they play for worship sound better than the originals, there's just something about them. i was kind of bummed this year at elevate when they didn't play, but yancy did an excellent job! i also really enjoy her music. it's great to see them live to see what awesome musical talents god has given them. anyhow, before i bore all of you to death with my bad writing skills, i'll head out. please make some comments things you want me to talk about, questions you have, etc.
