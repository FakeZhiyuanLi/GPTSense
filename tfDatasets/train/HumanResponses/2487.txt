first dates should be filled with laughter, in my opinion, so why wouldn't we begin at a local comedy club? we met up, and the fool let me drive, and of course i get us lost, but this was foreseen, and i had a backup plan. my friend lives in the area and was patiently waiting for the call so she could redirect us to the club. he wasn't very impressed with my driving i noticed, "allegedly" i almost hit a curb. we arrive and are seated right up frontwhich wasn't the best idea i have ever had. the comedian found out it was our first date so he dedicated a small portion of the show to our humiliation, which was very generous of him, don't you think? we laughed our butts off, though. after the show we met up with a few of my friends for some drinks. all and all, it was a good time.worth repeating, i think.
