school.not that excited about it. the highlight of my day was going to a moooovie with moogan. went to see "princess diaries dos." total chick flick. ahhhhhhhh! some parts were funny though. ha. moogan was 15 minutes late getting to the theatre. women i wanted to see collateral, but it was rated r. and people over at amc14 actually care, and ask for id's. after we walked around. we some how walked into a furniture store and almost broke some stuff (well i almost broke stuff). lamps cost so much now-a-days; $212 for a funking lamp watched "bend it like beckham." best indian/english/scottish/?russian? movie i've ever seen. i'm going to bed. i have no idea what i'm going to do tomorrow. :)
