only 2 more weeks until i can go home! i still want to stay for more than just a couple of days. my dad plans on having us drive there and back. i can understand the reason to drive back but to california? our stuff is in storage now so i have just a few items here in texas. i really want to meet this jonathan in person. it'll never happen, but i wonder what he looks like. he saw an outdated version of me and sarah yesterday. why the hell did i have to send that stupid outdated vid of me and sarah!? well i have to go. later
