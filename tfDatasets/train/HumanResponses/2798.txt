whats up bitches! its friday the thirteenth! woo-hoo its so great. btu anyways i had a fucked up dream last night it was about my daevion. but the only think that is really vivid and that still troubles me is the fact that someone said it all was a hoax. i hope to god it wasnt. but then again it would be ok if it was because i miss him. and i still love him to this day. well now that i am sad again im gonna go. bye
