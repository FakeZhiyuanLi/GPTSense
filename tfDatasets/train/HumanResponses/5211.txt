tell me july is over. this has been one long, painful month. one hiccup after the other. it's been a lonely month too. good thing i have you now dear reader. i surely missed having such a captive audience. but you never write, you never call. sometimes i need more from you. sometimes i would like to hear what you think. unless you disagree with anything i say. in that case, i think it's best you stay silent. i have to go.
