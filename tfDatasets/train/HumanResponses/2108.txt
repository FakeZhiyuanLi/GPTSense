i have been a slacker the last few days, not that there is much to report. ssdd. i was "crowned" yesterday, $500 can buy you a nice porcelain crown. my sister-in-law and her son are in from cali. the kid was just fine until 9:00 pm when he turned into a monkey who has just wiped his ass with tabasco sauce. today, holland-czech rep was a classic. bombay house was hot.very hot but worth every bite of it. the sequences i am working on at the moment are driving me berserk and i feel like i am a pms'ing bitch.
