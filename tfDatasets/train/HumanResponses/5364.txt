only now has the enormity of the task that i have in front of me truly dawned upon me. this is crazy. i have two days left to study for four finals, i am going to go nuts. but i guess thats how life is, nuts. well i have to go figure out how the hell to do a redox problem and relearn my entire chemistry curriculum in one day. wish me luck folks.
