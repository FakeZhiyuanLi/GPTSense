it has come to my attention that no matter what i do, it will never be good enough to win her over. why cant i get what it is that my heart longs for? it would seem that it is my life to have nothing that i want. i love her for her, and i cant have her. destruction of my own soul seems imminent. i am not sure if i want it to happen or need it to happen. i guess that i will have to try and fight, always fighting yet nothing to fight for except myself and i dont want to fight for me. i dont want to fight. maybe i shold just let the world sweep me by and live not at all. death is looming and i will not be one to faulter in front of it. i will not allow the reaper to take me i will take the reaper.
