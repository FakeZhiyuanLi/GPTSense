so today was englnd euro 2004 match against sewden or something silly. so wht did i do rather than pop down to the local and grab some of the action there i went to see a movie. oh the laughs you can have by being the only 2 people in the whole cinema, its amazing. joke of the night being, as we left the cinema a proud supporter in his game uniform looking like a prick hurling abuse at us for not watching the gm or supporting our country. 2 idea popped into our heads. one being throw a bike at him, or two yell abuse back. i suppose us supporting his face seems like a far fetched idea to you. but belive me his face was a rape scene and deserves every ounce of support we can muster.goodnight and word love trilby
