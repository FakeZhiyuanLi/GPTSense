if only. yeah lol, cousin is here! lol hooray for michelle! yeah and besides the fact that chris emailed me and said that he may not have the time to see me, well boo to him. but at least he's trying. then my co-worker chris has seemed to move on, and the only fear that we're having right now is that i'll be next. good god save me now but other then that screwed up some squres this morning.(damnit) oh well, they'll still be good (i hope).good bye
