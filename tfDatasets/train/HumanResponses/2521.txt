today didnt really do anything at all. i watched the street fighter anime last night and it wasn't too bad. today i was gonna watch the ninja movie, but my tape player is missing. i think my mom took it with her last night (for some reason) and decided to leave it at her partying location. i just played rag all day, took a shower and washed my stank ass, and ate a fudgesicle. life is peachy.
