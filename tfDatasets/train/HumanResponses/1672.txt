well, another summer is here and i hate it already. i know that sounds geeky and nerdy, but i am not! i hate school as much as i hate being out of school. i hate having so much time to myself and no relative structure to my life. see, i am one of those people who need a schedule to survive. if i had to figure out what to do everyday by myself, i'd go insane with all the possibilities. well, i played games on the computer all day and washed laundry for my mother. that was my life. soon i will be cleaning house for my grandmother and slave-like working for her in the kitchen. isn't my life grand!?! i can't wait to leave to oklahoma and california on church youth trips. even though that seems boring, it is better than this low level of living. now the only thing i can exert effort in is household chores and the youth newsletter. wow, i can't wait
