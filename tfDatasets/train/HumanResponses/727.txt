ha! just set up my rss feed - that is so easy! why doesn't everyone do it? enough for today. the sun is shining and i should be outside planting my poor flowers (that have spent far too long in their pots) but i have 3 kindergartners and a preschooler who are refusing to go outside. little gameboy junkies. i should talk! last post today, i promise.
