it's another one of those days at work. the highlight of the day is probably the kfc i had early this morning. i was suppose to have a webconference for some job that i didn't even apply for. in the back of my mind, it probably seem like another pyramid scam where i'm selling stuff. when it came time to log in and see what kind of a scam it was, the login that they provided for me didn't even work. well, i will be counting down my week.thank god it's a short one this week :)
