i was watching a show the other night on pbs about electric and hydrogen cars. one point that they failed to emphasize is that although hydrogen cars produce no emissions themselves, that the hydrogen itself is processed and stored using energy sources from oil, coal, petroleum, etc. while fuel efficiency and emissions reduction/elimination should be the focus of the auto industry, it should also be the focus of local, state, and federal governments to improve and increase public transportation. i'm originally from cincinnati, which is probably like other medium-sized metropolitan areas in terms of bus service: limited and slow. philadelphia is much more convenient to navigate without a car,which was one of the determining factors in my decision to move here. one of the best ways to decrease auto-related pollution is to increase public transportation options.
