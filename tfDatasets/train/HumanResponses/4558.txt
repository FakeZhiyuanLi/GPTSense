nirvana: (nîr-vä'n-na) (noun) an ideal condition of rest, harmony, stability, or joy. the ineffable ultimate in which one has attained disinterested wisdom and compassion. i wish achieving nirvana was so simple. life would be so easy to those tired of worldly pleasures and requirements. a pill perhaps that would cure forever. no addictions. no hangovers. i'm tired. i'm exhausted. clocks tick. sleep deprivation. the idiot box menacingly grips my head. i'm numb, wide-eyed, trying to inhale the moisture from the air around me. a tear drop evaporates. it is a half-life, a soul existence i crave. but that was yesterday. today is different. today, i'm neil, techno, clueless geek and a hopeless romantic. i love all things about life - the good, the bad. nirvana would be good. but not a requisite. kurt kobain would be pleased. i opted for 'smells like teen spirit' instead. now listening: don't cry - guns 'n roses
