i just saw an article about how bad hair may be genetic according to a recent scientific study. isn't it obvious that bad hair is genetic? color, volume, density. when you add it all together it makes good, bad or indifferent hair. who thinks up all of these ridiculous studies and why are they newsworthy? what a waste of time and money!
