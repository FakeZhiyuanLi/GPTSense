all day long, my kids have driven me nuts. i think they got together earlier in the day and decided that today is the day to drive mom batty. right now, the four year old is saying, over and over and over again. mommy mommy mommy i've went to him several times to see what he needs/wants and every time he just wanted me to go in there. i've got my own stuff to do. i've spent lots of time with him today. apparently this is just one of those days that he needs way more attention than i am even capable of giving him i try not to let him see that its driving me nuts though lol i've spent the better part of my day scrubbing the walls from my waist down where those kids leave little hand prints and dirt tracks. what fun! tomorrow is back to work in hell. oh, joy!
