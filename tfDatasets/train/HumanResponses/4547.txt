i was supposed to be going to the gym today after work but decided against it last night. the reason? it might be raining when i have to go . this is despite the fact that i can drive all the way from work to the gym and the car park is only about 5 minutes away! i sometimes wonder if out of all the people around the world who are members of gyms, whether i'm the only one who come up some of the worst reasons not to go? it's weird, sometimes i manage to be really motivated for weeks about going to the gym but since i went on holiday in may, iive found it really hard to get back into the routine. it's not that i don't enjoy it once i get there, but it's just that mental push required to actually go. now if i could only afford a home gym , then i wouldn't have any excuse not to go.unless i really thought about it
