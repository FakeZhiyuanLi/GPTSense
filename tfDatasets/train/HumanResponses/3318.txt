so i head out thinking i'm going to meet tamar and her friends, instead i meet nikki at the frontier, by mistake no less, and i wind up after talking for an hour, making her laugh (that's all the ladies want me for anymore, making them laugh) i finally get the courage to go ask becky for her number, i walk up, am surrounded by the group, and we exchange information. she's got a lot of brittany's features, but taller, fuller breasts. looks good. now, this is absolutely bizarre, i always liked becky despite her being a year younger, and when my plans didn't work i met up with her. curiouser and curiouser. i'm certainly pursuing this, there isn't a ring on my finger. as for elyce, this marks the gazillionth time she's bailed on me. i'm beginning to see how she works in relationships, i'm not sure this one will hold on much longer.
