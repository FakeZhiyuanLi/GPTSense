soccer is the best thing that i had happen to me. there i'm with my friends and have fun with them, and i forget about my personal problems. to me soccer and my team is my family, my coach is my second dad, my two captains are my moms, and the others are my sisters. i have play soccer since i was in 6 grade, and form that day i promise my self that i will still play, and try my best to play better. my number of my jersey is 10, and my nickname is slip because i slid a lot. i play forward and midfield, and i don't like to play defense, that spot it's not for me.
