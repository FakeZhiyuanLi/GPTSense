birthday the day of one's birth. the anniversary of one's birth. this is the definition of birthday. it simply means you are 365 days older than you were 365 days ago. it also means, you've been completely around the sun once more. but suppose today is not your birthday, you are still 365 days older than you were 365 days ago. just because you were born on this day does not make it special in any sense. today i am a day older than i was yesterday, so do i get a present? not at all. i've brought this up because my friend's birthday was a few days ago. things didn't exactly go as planned, so she was sad, but what for? it was a day just like any other, only she was born on this day 15 years earlier. people expect everything to go right on their birthday. if something goes wrong on any other day, it is just a drop in the bucket, but if it is their birthday, it is the worst day in the world.
