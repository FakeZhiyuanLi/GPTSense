getting ready for work is such a masochistic task. my jobs not hard at all but im tired and want to go to sleep. harry potter was pretty good. i enjoy the new directors style. as for dumbledore he looks the same but sounds and acts different. but i like the new dumbledore better. the new direction makes the movies a little darker, just as the books do. i look foreward to the next two movies and the sixth book. my time grows short and i must be off to my personal hellwork. if it was my choice i would never have to work, but such is life.
