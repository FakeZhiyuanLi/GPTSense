i just realised that you have to have a blogger account to post comments on our new blog. i'm very sorry, and apologies to everyone. what really surprised me was that blogger is owned by google. such nazi methods are usually something you encounter in connection with microsoft ("you want to use this? make an account, give us your details and everything is fine") sorry.
