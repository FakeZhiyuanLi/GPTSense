just as the title says. it is monday, and unlike some people who have to get up and go to work.i have nothing to do but sit on my ass all day and do absolutely nothing! it is the greatest thing in the whole world! today's scheduale includes a bit of web surfing, followed by some city of heroes, followed by television, a nap, and other stuff.don't want to think too far ahead! :)
