you roam my mind free of will. driving me into an unseen force, across the asphalted sky. dancing to the tunes of graceful nature. your exquisite taste in life. living to the fullest. not missing any given chances. you strive till you think i'm under your spell. deriving from the thoughts of pure insanity. i, for once am letting you go. begone before i could cause you harm. anger within me is your untimely death. - nad -
