citi cards revealed a plan to layoff over 1,100 employees on tuesday. these employees now have to find a new job, this becomes a problem because there is not 1,100 job openings within other citi locations or the surrounding area. i'm personally affected by this, i have worked with the company now for three years. i not concerned about finding another job, i'm concerned about finding a job that will allow me to work around my school schedule.
