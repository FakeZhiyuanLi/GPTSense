ok, i know people usually make new year's resolution but i decided to make a birthday resolutioni decided to suck it up and from now on i'm gone be really really happy! yes, no more winning around, chasing after those losers, wondering what the hell i did wrong cause i didn't. i'm way too good for this, i'm smart, pretty, sexy and successfully women. i have my priorities, and a whole life aheadso i'm done with these games, it's waste of my time and a waste of energy, it's just not worth it. i'm tired of being such a pain in the ass, always complaining, and felling down and bringing people down with all this crap. i'm moving on!
