parents buh, sometimes i just want to strangle them with my own two hands. but still, they are my parents, so i love them and blah blah bla. but by mom is so damn stubborn about stupid things she treats me like i'm an five year old and i hate it. and woohoo, i finally got me some work! starting tomorrow it doesn't earn much (2,47 in an hour) but i'm glad that i can do something in the afternoon and earn money for it! :) by the way: hello :)
