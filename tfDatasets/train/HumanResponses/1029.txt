friday night and i'm stuck at home. there's a basketball game tonight, but my mom doesn't think i should go because of the weather. it is very very cold outside and the roads are all slick and snowy, so maybe it's a good idea. it was alittle hard for me to get home today after school because the hill wasn't plowed or anything and it was very scary. i thought i wasn't going to make it, but i did (going only 10 mph by the time i got to the top). tomorrow i have to get up very early, and i'm not looking forward to it, but when i get back micki will be home. woo hoo. i was supposed to try out for the musical tonight, but tryouts tonight were postponed to sometime next week. it is called "honk" and it's some silly play. not many of my friends are trying out, i think kayla is the only one. it should still be fun though.
