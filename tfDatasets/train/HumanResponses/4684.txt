hey guys. sorry didnt get to post yesterday. well i have no homework all week so that has rocked. yet i have been busy doing this and that. today after school i held clan tryouts for like 3 hours and out of all that time i couldnt find one single terrorist group that could kill me 3 times in a row on the militia map. and if you know the game being counter terrorist on that map is really close to impossible. maybe i just to high of expectations. well after that i had a hockey game. we tied 4-4 and we fount out our team names. i get to be the 'viperz' yay! yah anyways. i guess that all my $.02 for today take it for what it is.
