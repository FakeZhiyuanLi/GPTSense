i just found out that my school is putting a kind of 'ban' on flip flops. you cant wear shoes that 'you cant keep on'. ok what i dont get is why they're worrying about flip flops when there are girls walking around looking likewell lets just say its disgusting. they have never cracked down on these girls and they're concerned with flip flops. open your eyes and look around! flip flops are the very least of the dress code problem! i live in flip flops during the school year. hopefully it wont be so strict that we arent allowed to wear them. we'll see. if i get pulled into the office, i am not going to be happy.
