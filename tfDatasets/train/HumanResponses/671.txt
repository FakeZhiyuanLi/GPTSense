woke up with major hang over and found some chocolate and cookie crumbs in jell-o's bowl. apparently i mistakenly fed him with my junk food instead of his dog food when i was drunk. he must loved his meal. it was a very big one too! to confirm what i've done, i immediately picked up jell-o and checked his stomach. it was huge! and he looked hilarious! imagine a little dog with chocolate leftovers around his mouth and a huge tummy walking around like a pregnant woman! lol! fearing that he might gain weight, i put him on the treadmill to burn off the extra calories. he actually loved it! when i turned off the treadmill after 5 minutes, he kept walking on it back and forth wondering how come it's no longer moving. haha my baby's so cute
