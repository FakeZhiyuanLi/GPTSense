i know i only graduated on sunday, but already this "real world" has got me down. i weedwacked like a freakin fiend today. (wouldn't whitehouse a.k.a. the machine be proud?)u. hart calls it "weed whipping." it's odd slang to me still, and it kind of freaks me out when they say, "carrie, grab a whip and come with me." i ran a mower today for a bit also, and i took out a marker pole. at least i didn't back two of the bosses trucks into one another. already i miss the uconn misfits. i wonder what all of the newbies are like. i wonder if they miss me. i'm sure they do. i miss my sister too. sigh, i'm nostalgic already. plus i'm dead tired. maybe i'll nap before the babygirl gets home.
