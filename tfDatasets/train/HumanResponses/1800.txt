once again at work, trying to keep busy by finding stuff to do. reading "drudge" while istening to talk radio is quite depressing. i'm amazed at the way things are written in the papers with obvious bias. i really hope people don't take these stories at face value.  all of my life  all of my life i've tried to right the wrongs i've spied the tide of lies don't even try to deny me this right for i i will fight to keep the truth in the light all of my days i'd gaze in ways i've known to erase the malaise no delays in the frays in the haze in a daze i'm amazed i've been lost in this maze i'm not sure what to do i couldn't see in the morning but now it's thursday afternoon and i hope by the evening i'll know what we need to do.
