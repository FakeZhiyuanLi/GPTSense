well folks i have decided to resolve some tension here. my diaryland site is becoming more and more incomprehensible as time goes on, and it really is more of a personal cathartic thing than an acutal blog. seeing that i would like to have a place to air more coherent thoughts without interrupting the flow of nonsense, i have decided to set up a blog here. if you are reading this, you probably came through the discussion blog i have going with my church. if so, here is a place i will attempt to get a little deeper into some of those things we discuss, as well as other issues. of course i may just be deluding myself and i may be the only one who ever reads this, but then so much the better. i do apologize for any inconveniences and i promise to get this site up and looking pretty asap. bye.
