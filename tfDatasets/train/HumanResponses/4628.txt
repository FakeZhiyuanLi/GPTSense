i think i have to lay out some ground rules for myself here. let me know if anyone thinks i'm onto a loser. only use scripts that have already been published. cuts down the chance that any flaws lie with the script and not my artwork. four samples minimum . i was gonna go for three, reckoned i should go for five, but four sounds reasonable. pencils only. simply letter outlaying who i am, why i'm sending stuff (at the invitation of bob schreck) added: also, don't pick any obvious things - leave "the killing joke" alone and any other very high profile script. and er just do it. that should be enough.
