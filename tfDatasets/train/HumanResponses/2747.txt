may 14, my sleep was disturbed by a txt message from budjie, telling me that they are leaving for puerto gallera. i am supposed to be with them the next morning but desided to follow them on the same day. i traveled alone for the next 2 hours. it was a nice drive almost no traffic, but save from the occational boredom add the loss of radio signal, and a helpful hitchhiker, everything is smooth and fine. by 1 pm, my ferry docked onto the shores of white beach. the first five hours was kinda awkward because jaypee was there, but then again we went there for some good time, any grudge must be left at home. by 2 am the next morning i was tired because it has been a long day, by 9:30 am i am leaving the beach to head back home.
