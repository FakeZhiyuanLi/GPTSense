well, when i think about it, im the kind of person who wants to do a lot with my friends, but sometimes, my friends dont want to do a lot with me, but no matter how hard they try, they cant hide it from me. but hey, dont feel bad for me, as long as i have god and myself, no one can stop me from doing what i want to do. and when people talk about me, it hurts of course, i wouldnt be human if it didnt hurt. sometimes i think about what would've happened if i didnt make it when i passed out or i didnt make it through a lot of the stuff i have to go through. some advice, dont ever think like me and dont ever think ur me!
