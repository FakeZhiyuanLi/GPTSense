who… me? where did i go when i left here because i can’t seem to find my way back and i don’t know where exactly to look for me i’m not sure of where i just went. and what if i’m gone when i get there to that place where i was and then came. and what will i do when i find me i’m sure things won’t be the same. i wonder if i had great adventures when i left and went out on my own. or did i sit in a corner waiting forever not ever knowing when i’d eventually get there and do you think i should look there? perhaps i got tired and just went ahead and walked home.
