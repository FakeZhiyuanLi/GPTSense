i want to yell at how life can be i am angry that i couldn't see that it wasn't going to be prince's and fairytales that going day to day would be it's own hell driving down the road this morning i glanced at passing cars. i noticed happy people, sad people but i mostly noticed the stuffy people in their pretty expensive cars. i smiled to myself.happy i'll never be one of them.
