metal pumping, frees my soul- from the pain you inflicted and the grip that you hold. taking me to another world of obsession of sex nothing hidden, everything's bare. through the bass and rage, he gently injects me, filling me with liquid heat. taking my hand he leads me through the gates of hell the drug takes care of everything there's nothing there but him. he looks at me with empty eyes- holds me close and pulls me under to the darkness in the shadows, and safety of his world.
