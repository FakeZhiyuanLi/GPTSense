if living is an art, wouldn't i paint my life with colours? skipping the greys and blacks. the winning colours will stay. no storms. no wars. no heartaches and no broken people. no tears. well then.who am i to say. such profound decision makings are not made by a puny someone like me. peace all. - nadzy -
