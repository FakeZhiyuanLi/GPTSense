oh man! a blank box. i hate blank boxes. this thing should ask you questions such as "what's your favorite color" or "do you like macaroni and cheese?" better yet, how about those a/s/l questions chatters throw at you all the time that nobody ever answers honestly. or do they? i have no idea what this thing will be about. i've never done this before. i'm not even good at keeping a diary or journal. i even tried that artist's way program and couldn't keep up with the "morning pages." the only thing i can think about in the morning is "coffee" and getting the cat off the top of my head (where he likes to sleep) and taking the dog out for a pee. maybe this blog will become a sort of "morning page" except i'll be writing in it at all hours of the day and night whenever my brain has been fueled on caffeine and i feel the need to ruminate on whatever. so. has anyone seen the new escher-style google logo? it rocks, huh?
