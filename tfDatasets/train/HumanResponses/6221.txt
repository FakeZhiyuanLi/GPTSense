ahhh, the greatness of technology, computers, the internet, and computer crashes.yup, thats right, my computer crashed this last thursday night, and i'm now screwed because i have no pictures for mlip. i'm still trying to scrounge some up, but it's looking pretty dismal. i'll of course though, keep working on the site, and hopefully next week (4th of july, where something weird is bound to happen), i'll have some pictures. i'm uploading stuff so uh, ta.
