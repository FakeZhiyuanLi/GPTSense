recently i came to the revelation that my glass is half full. half full of piss. well at least i'm still seeing it as half full. i gave up coke a cola and my favorite extra extra strong, super sweet iced coffee. i've taken up caffeine pills, and i miss sugar. something had to be done, i am simply too fat for my own comfort. it makes it easier to forsake something (someone) when it's for your own benefit. so good-bye soda and sweets hello water and healthy food, i'm hoping i'll feel like exercising when some weight comes off. i certainly feel no energy to do it now. i'm hoping it's just the caffeine and sugar withdrawal cause i haven't felt this lazy in years. i think i'll take a shower and see if i can shake this malaise.
