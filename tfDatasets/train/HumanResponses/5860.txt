it is the morning of sun. the 23 of may. i am tired today. why is will power such a difficult thing to get a hold of?somtimes it takes all i can muster just to get out of bed. this weekend has sort of been a waist. although i am not at work, so it has'nt been a complete bust. i look forward to going to the beach. jason (my roomate and i ) always go to the same beach. we call it poppy, but its actually a wild life refuge in laguna. its beautiful there. iwill post pictures of the beach and of poppy. i hope the day moves to a more positive energy. l8er.
