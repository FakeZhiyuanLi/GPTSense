in dubai i saw the 4th genration ipod 20g for 1350 ed (108 kd) in virgin megastore. in kuwait the 3rd genration will cost you more than that so iwant to know why virgin megastore in kuwait bring everything after dubai and sell it more what it cost in dubai. its that in kuwait that some people buy every thing without wait or even if they know they can find a new one cheaper.
