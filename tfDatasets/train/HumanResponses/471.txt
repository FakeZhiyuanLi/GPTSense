well, tonight after hanging out with mike for a bit at his house and listening to music through his new headphones we decided to call ray and evan and head down to geoffs house. now originally i was supposed to do something with a girl named nikole. but again i cancelled plans due to not having nething to do with her and plus i had already made plans with mike an evan and ray. also nikole appearantly really likes.or liked me as of late. but i can't tell her that i don't like her cuz i like vanessa cuz then she'd hate me forever. so things are kinda complecated. but i'm kinda bummed out cuz i'm beginning to wonder if nething will happen between me and _______. ppl have told not to wait around for her cuz they say "shes so unpredictable" but i can't drop her. i think about her all the time. and i kno i've ruined this in the past but i can change.just wish she'd see that. i dunno not much more on my mind.besides the usuall. i'm headin out for the night
