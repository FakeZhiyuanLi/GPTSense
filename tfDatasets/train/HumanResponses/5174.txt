yeah, i'm not really going to write any more about the weekend. it was boring, but now its over, and theres nothing more to say about it. ac said she would call, but hasn't yet. on the phone last night she said she wanted to see a movie today, and i told her that i might not be able to because my family wants to do the whole memorial day thing. my dad really wants to see the day after tommorow with me, and i think that i should spend some time with him. looks like a good movie, anyway. in other news, cake's new album, pressure chief will be released september 7th. cake rocks, people. go buy their music.
