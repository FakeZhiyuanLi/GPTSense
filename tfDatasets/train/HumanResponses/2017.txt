i lie among the leaves, upon the forest floor. pungent scents of wood and moss, singing wind and dappled sun. the sun doth not hurt me!. clothed in my hair, long and dark as sin. i know not cold, or heat - but i know hunger!. warm earth cradles, living forest comforts. i lie.and wait for my calling. ~ anakya
