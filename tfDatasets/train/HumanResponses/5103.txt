i am truly and completely bored and i think that we should not have to go to school tomorrow. i think that we should all be rebels and ditch tomorrow. even though that would probably mean grade suicide b/c we would all be missing our finals/tests tom. but then again if everyone didnt go then they could give us all bad grades. yeah that would be pretty cool.so anyways today was really bad cuz i didnt study for my finals really and i sorta didnt understand any of the stuff on the tests.especially bio.why do they teach us this hanus stuff.i mean who is ever going to use biology when they get older.unless u r someone unusually smart who is like a genius and ur going to dicover something like a cure for cancer or something.
