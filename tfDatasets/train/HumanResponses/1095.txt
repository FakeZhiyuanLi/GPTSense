its a strange idea. do i really know myself? do i really want to? . a time has come and i need to look at how far i've come and where i'm going. i'm a researcher, and i spend my time at work reading/websurfing/numbercrunching or generally just procrastinating. i do a lot of other stuff though, over 250km biking in the dordogne this past weekend (!), football, cooking, guiness, drawing, hmmm . sleeping .
