the april diamond the winged bird, the king who wished a poetry "the remembering of the diamond rings" oh am i moved, indeed and yet i ennoble now "the beloved dove is a beauty and so lovely" the windy-looking diamond binds the one of the kindest minds to unite the findings oh of the careful clue of a rarefied gem that bears the hot flares of rays - so barely my oldest feeling of yin yang that bore two sides of a bold light and a cold night; oh my charming april! i told you, my april! the diamond is like being the gold! @william-kalani chevy kekua, april 2004
