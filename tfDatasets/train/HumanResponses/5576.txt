yesterday was extremely confusing to me. i tried talking with her, but no, i guess it wasn't appropriate at the time or something along those lines. she wouldn't talk to me. i sat with my buddy, and she became very angry at me. it's funny. but oh well. like i've said before, time will heal things. i fixed my guitar! i finally got a high e for my sgx. it's about time. i feel complete again. haha. i love that guitar with a passion. if it was my choice, i'd have about ten of those things. now i can start practicing with some of my pals, and possibly get this group thing going. it'll be nice to finally get that going. most of us agreed that a mix of blues and ska would suit our personalities. it should be fun. i've been trying to figure out how to get music on this thing. if anyone knows how, please tell me because i would like to know. time to go, in class. will talk more later. will work for food. i'm extra, extra hungry.
