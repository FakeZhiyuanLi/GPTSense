hello! we spent a fun day around the neighborhood. it was the annual neighborhood picnic. we did miss having jarad here. he loves the big bounce house and all of his friends. we had a large smoker full of ribs, hamburgers and wings. there was even a big bon fire to end the night. just a good day overall to sit and chat with the neighbors. i do believe the hit for joli was the oatmeal cookies and the popcicles.
