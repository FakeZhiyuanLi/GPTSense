hi, well yesterday i didn't post because i was really busy sleeping in and all. anyway,yesterday we got off because it was six flag's day at our school, so after i woke up (witch was around 2:00 pm)i just watched t.v. until my guitar lesson, witch was at 5:30. yeah i did do chores but not much, my parents were ok that day. today was a funny day at school. and when i say funny i mean entertaining. first in first hour (pe) i saw the village idiot, witch is a very short chubby person who is rude and stupid, get stuffed into a locker when he talked trash to a guy 3 times his size. it was funny because he was too big to fit in it but he's fat mashed around and allowed him to fit but he couldn't get out. well that pretty much sums up the last 2 days. i need to go to "teens", a church program that me and my friends go to. latter
