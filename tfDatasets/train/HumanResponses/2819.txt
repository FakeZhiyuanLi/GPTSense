i promised myself that i wouldn't do this- wait around for a boy to call- and i am! i hate myself for being this vunerable rite now. this changed our friendship-a lot, and i think he's afraid because of this- but i think that even if things don't work out between us- we'll always have our friendship- i think i might breakup with him- i can't pretend that things aren't different, and i certainly can't pretend that it doesn't hurt when he doesn't call- before all this started he called me every night- now, it's like never. why can't he see that even if this doesn't work out, i value our friendship way to much to let anything ruin it- the thing is- maybe it's already ruined- maybe. he ruined it by confessing how he really felt and then just ignoring it. i suppose, however, i'm the maddest at myself- i broke my promise- i let myself become vunerable- i am brittanie, and i am a promise breaker.
