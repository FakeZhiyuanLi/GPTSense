today is good i get over crushes fast. i haven't had a lot (only ones in the last month, i'm on my 3rd) but they only last like a week. hmmm. all great guys though that i still like (just not crush) ok so now i'm on this guy, who is a complete sweetheart. and umm, really likes me back like alot. i think, unless he is a good lyer, which he very well maybe. but who cares
