yeah today wasn't as bad as yesterday. it wasn't raining so i got to go out and skate for a while. i'm really close to landing my 360 flip. i just need to work on the landing. i'm trying to find some good skatespots anywhere near here so i can make a sponsor tape hopefully i can get sponsored by somone halfway decent (there is a local team called sane that i wouldn't mind joining) anyway. maybe i can find a nice 9 stair to 360 flip over if i can get my landings good! ;) talk to you kids lata!
