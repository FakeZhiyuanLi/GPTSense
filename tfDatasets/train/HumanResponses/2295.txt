i had my last interview with bruegger's this morning, and i am so happy to say that i got the job, and start monday. i could have started tomorrow but i have a sprained ankle and its still swollen, so i guess i had better listen to mom yeah i still do sometimes  and stay off it for a few more days so it can heal. the manager's name is steve, and he seems allright. we spoke briefly and then he showed me the store, which was very big and pretty clean, and then we sat down again. he said that i had come very highly recommended by his area manager, theresa, whom i had met with on friday of last week. i can't wait to work again, i quit glass doctor last week, and frankly i'm fucking bored all the time. also, i so have bills, bills, bills. so at least i have a job now, and soon the money will flow again. i guess it kinda worked out that i fucked up my ankle when i did.its not like i have any money to go out, so i suppose its good that i cant.
