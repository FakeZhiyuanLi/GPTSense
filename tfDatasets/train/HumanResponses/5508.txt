everything is so different i couldn't see anything changing but pretty soon nothing was the same isn't that how things always go nothing can ever stay the same for long the only thing that doensn't change is the fact things do what's to be done when everything is different and you don't recongize any suroundings it's not right to bury yourself away from society though so many do, only to discover it doesn't really help oftn things get worse when secluded eventually we all must come out come out and face the world times come and times go, and i'm not sure if this one is comming or going
