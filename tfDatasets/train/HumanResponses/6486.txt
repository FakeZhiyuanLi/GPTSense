starting tomorrow i shall be forced to journy though a foreign land surrounded by trackless wastes. i shall live amoung strange people with strange customs and strange forms of government (especially concerning healthcare.). i shall be in a place that can only be described as the land that god gave cain! that is right, (gasp) i shall be in canada! if i run out of stuff to do, i'll probably post some observations, probably dramatically exaggerated for comic effect. our hotel should, should , have internet.
