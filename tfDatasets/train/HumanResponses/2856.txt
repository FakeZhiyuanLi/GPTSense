now for the long story our sol tests had to be cancelled for 3 days b/c our computer support policy is not to update windows until there is a problem. sasser got in.and now there is roughly 1000 computers infected and our tech team has to walk around to every single one of them over 10 schools and patch and clean every single one in every single room that has xp or 2k.just goes to show that patch ahead of time and allow end users to patch.otherwise it gives everybody a headache later.
