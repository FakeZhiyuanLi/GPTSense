well yesterday and the day before were rather interesting. it starts with me getting off work monday to find that my engine temp was going nutso on my way home from work. turns out my car radiator decided to go bad and was spewing engine coolant all over the place. so pretty much i had to just keep refilling my car with coolant if i wanted to drive anywhere. *fun fun* at least my presentation on cuba went well at class despite lingering headaches all day. so yesterday 2 of my friends helped me out and drove me to the auto parts store and we got a replacement radiator and they put it in. all i gotta say is i owe those guys big time!. the f'ing dealership wanted $600 to replace the thing and they were able to do it for $145 (cost of the radiator itself). i must say knowing people who are car junkies really comes in handy.
