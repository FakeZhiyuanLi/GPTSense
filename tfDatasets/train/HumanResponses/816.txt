i usually eat a twix at 10:00 am at work. (that means in 20 minutes now) they currently have this thing where u enter on the web the codes that u find on the wrapping paper. when u get 15 codes (hopefully i will before the promotion ends) u get $10 gift certificate at ticketmaster if i understood correctly. a twix is $0.7 at the vending machine -> 15 twix = $10.50 . that means they re almost free ! update : actually they cost $.60 at the vending machine -> 15 twix for $9 and u get a $10 gift certificate, that s a good deal !
