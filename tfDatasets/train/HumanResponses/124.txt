so, we are all well aquainted with my obsession with track. and we all know its because i ran track, but i also have a smaller but no less important obsession with gymnasticsbecause i did gymnastics. towards the very, absolute end of my time in gymnastics, i was being recruited for trampoline, but my track coach wouldn't let me even begin to learn tramp because he felt that i would bust the heck out of my knees and then i wouldn't be able to jump. so i didn't, but i always felt i missed the oppertunity for tramp. hence my obsession. well, today we won silver in womens trampoline with karen coleburn. she won bronze in sydney. and she will no doubt try for a medal in double tramp.
