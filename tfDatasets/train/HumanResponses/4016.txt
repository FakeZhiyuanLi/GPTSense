here it is thursday and he is to be home tomorrow. hoping its by the time our little one has her play but seems when i am counting on it something comes up! i miss him so damn much - guess i should be glad, had about 3 years of him home everyday - why should i want more? the feeling of being a single mother again has set in - but won't be leaving anytime soon since he will be at this for awhile yet. i know i shouldn't be bitchin cause there are tonz of families out there whose parent(s) are overseas - but damn it he's not. why does he gotta be so good at his job that he gets sent away to other facilities?!?! *sigh i try sooooooooo hard to act like its ok that he's gone and we are handling everything here at home ok without him - so he can do his job and not have to worry about us. but its been hard - end of the year, so much going on that he's missing. oh well - ok i'm done rambling! more later or tomorrow
