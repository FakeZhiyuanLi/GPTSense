so i definitely don't want to leave. the weather is amazing but cannot even match the amazing landscape of mountain, volcano, beach, and caldera (think steep cliff). the architecture is amazing here as is the culture. our work is fairly satisfying and i really just enjoy the entire place and the atmosphere. tourist season hasn't hit yet, so the places are moderately empty. we will see the volcano this weekend on a cruise, would love to snorkel and the cliffs of the mountain and caldera would be awesome to repel down - a great proposal for alternative tourism. i can't imagine living my life without seeing such an awesome place. i will upload some pictures later on this week. so difficult to get to the internet - time, money, and motivation. ~nicole
