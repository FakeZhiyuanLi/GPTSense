woot! just got a hp from my cuzzie! the same ancient old 8210 guess i could talk to her in-camp again boy am i in luvvvvvv or infatuated. sammy says i should get 7610. little did she knew (or did i tell her?) that i really like 7610 but its kinda wasted to hide this sweeet phone in-camp since i'm staying in. but hey, i like it, she proposed it, why not? the reason keeps ringing in my head. i'm not perfect but we all know when in luv, whats impossible? "i'm not a perfect person , i never meant to do those things to you and so i have to say before i go that i just want you to know i found a reason for me to change who i used to be a reason to start over new and the reason is you i found a reason to show the side of me you didnt know a reason for all that i do and the reason is you"
