tonight i watched the jets roll all over the colts in their 2nd preseason game. chad pennington played great, completing 10 of 11 passes and throwing for 150+ yards and a touchdown. i really hope they get him signed to a contract extension soon. besides that, the first team didn't look that great. the run defense sucked, and looked mostly the same as the last 3 years. we were playing what might be the best offense in the nfl though, so it's not time to panic. the jets shutdown manning with the exception of one big play to reggie wayne. on the colts opening drive abraham hit manning from the blind side, slowing down his pass and allowing donnie abraham to pick it off in the endzone. decent performance, and it's good that we are halfway through the preseason without any major injuries. i can't wait to see this offense once moss and chrebet get on the field. btw, the following still suck: -the jets backup qb's - team usa basketball -the dolphins
