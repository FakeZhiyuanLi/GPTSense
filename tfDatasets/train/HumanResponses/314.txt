when i was ten, i went to a school trip to el salvador. i was amazed pretty much the whole time i was there: there were many things similar to the united states but most things were culturally different. for example, in the city, there was burger kings and bowling alleys. but there were also people by the side of the streets trying to sell stuff or clean your car, guys on the corners with huge guns, and huge walls with barbed wire and broken glass around the wealthy houses. one of my most amazing and impressionable moments when i was there, was when we were at the beach house of one of the girls we were visiting. an ice cream vendor came walking up to us with his pushcart. he was trying to catch our interest: he showed us a duck that he had found and "saved". his ploy worked, because we immediately croweded around the duck that had a white film over one of its eyes. i can still picture that day.
