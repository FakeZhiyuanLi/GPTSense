there's not much going on today. i start working tomorrow, so i have to enjoy my last free day today. have to be at the school @ 6:45 tonight to play for the graduation. they make us play behind the friggin' curtain. it's pointless. they might as well just play a god damn recording. cubs today @ 4:05pm on fox sports net (cable/satellite only). :)
