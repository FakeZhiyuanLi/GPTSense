i spoke to the boss at work today. i had made enquiries about taking a leave of absence from work while scott and i are overseas. it came back from hr with a no. i have been with the company 8 years, and they give me this? so speaking to the boss, he basically said i have two options. resign, or apply for 6 months leave, and if i like it too much when i am over there, then resign from europe. well, i don't like either option, quite frankly, as they both involve resigning. and i can't, not yet. so i am going to go to casual status, rather than permanent part-time, as they won't give me any hours anyway, as i am way too expensive as a casual. so there you have it, you give 8 years of loyal service to one company, and they give you the proverbial finger.
