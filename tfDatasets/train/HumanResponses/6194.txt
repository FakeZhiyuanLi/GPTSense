don't laugh! there is such a thing as an overbrewed tea. this happens when you place a teabag (or teabags) for far too long in hot water. the ideal time would be around 3-5 minutes. to get the best deal out of every teabag, you'll want to use a heat-retaining cup or mug such as porcelain and china ones. boiling water is the best for brewing tea. there are surprisingly huge varieties of tea, not to mention the ones they call fusion tea . fusion tea is what you get when you combine good-grade tea leaves and mix it with fruits, flower petals and whatever you have in mind. if i am not mistaken, the chinese also used to add tea leaves into their cooking. (chinese: what else haven't they tried in that 3000-odd years?) i have yet to find this on the internet, but if i happened upon one such, i will be writing again. now moving on to something else, but not certain what should i read now. suggestions?
