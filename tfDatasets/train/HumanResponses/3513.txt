yesterday about 20:00 o'clock i went to iduna, cause there were playing some hardcore bands, including for the glory (a portugese hc-band). for the glory came with us; (miranda, jelte, kelvin and me) to miranda's house (they were going to crash the night there). it was waaay cool! and i had a great time, although sometimes i couldn't understand a word from that portugese language, i had fun! :) today at three o'clock they went to germany for another show, too bad :( i had 26 kisses from 8 portugese for the glory band members! haha. yaaay, i'm not so tired anymore tonight, that will be round 8 o'clock i'm again going to miranda's place, to watch a movie :) well, that's all i needed you guys to know. byeee
