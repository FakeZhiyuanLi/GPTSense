i miss miss miss the anime. i need to watch it to help me realise where i am now and where i should be heading next. is life a dream? when will i finally get to wake up? yes. i am totally trapped! how to get out from this bebop web, return to reality and face the truth. what exactly is the truth that everyone is searching for? reality is self constructed
