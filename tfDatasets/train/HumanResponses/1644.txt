ya know, little kids can really boost your self esteem. really, its like they look up to you so they always wanna be aournd you and they want to sit next to you and if you ask them how you look they tell you you look absolutly beautiful and they wanna do everything you do and its just sooo cool! especially when you feel really down about yourself and the world they help you realize taht there really are good things in life and you sort of notice things more when you're around them. i odnt know, at least thats how i feel when im hanging iwht my little cousin.
