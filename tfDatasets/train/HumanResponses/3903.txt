my cover has been blown, bun-bun has discovered the place where i talk to myself and hope that nobody actually cares enough to listen. i can already hear alex referring to me as a "touchy-feely-pussy-girl" at school. i leave to do a tour of drill instructor duty at fort hunter liggett this saturday, unfortunately its advanced orientation, so i'm laying the smackdown on 15 ten-year old kids who can't sit still for a week. ao is the wild west, and seaman (airman soon, motherfuckers!) montgomery is the new sheriff in town. or deputy marshall. or a wandering vigilante whose parents were killed my marauding league cadets when he was just a wee lad. but most likely i'm the yeoman. *does his little yeoman dance*
