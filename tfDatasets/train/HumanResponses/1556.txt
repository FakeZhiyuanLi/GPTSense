as i explained in absolutely no detail last post, band sucks. here is where i go into extreme detail : band sucks, alot . thats all you must know. 3 hour band practice. at priory. walking about 3 miles. with a basedrum. one 5 minute break. enough complaining - listen to our new limelight show, its the best last show. its like a season finale for a tv show except it doesnt suck. limelight will be back next season(year)to take over the world! i mean u didnt hear that ok back to complaining - ahhh band sucks! ok enough complaining - bharats leaving fenwick. thats depressing, kinda.
