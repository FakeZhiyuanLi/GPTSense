i am off to new york for the weekend and i cannot wait to eat cafe habana. i am going to eat cubans and steak enchiladas until the cows come home. on an exciting side note, the anaheim angels are in town playing the yankees and they are staying at our hotel (grand hyatt). caroline said she saw a couple of them last night (francisco rodriguez and tim salmon), and that at least those two are staying on our floor. i will hopefully run into garrett and try and talk to him. too bad we do not have time for a game.
