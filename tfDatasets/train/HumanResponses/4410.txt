although we won't be using avatars very much for this muppet, i just read an article with some interesting ideas about the use of avatars. they say that avatars are too simple, they are just an empty shell and propose to add a mind to the avatar, a virtual agent which should learn about the user, other avatars and the environment. makes me reconsider the use of avatars in muppet. my initial idea was just to put a 3d arrow to show the location of the user and the direction it looks to. i could add more information to the avatar, i have to think abou it
