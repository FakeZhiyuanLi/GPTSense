i am convinced that i will be alone, that life will surely pass me by and leave me out to rust. i am having one of those damn days again. i am frustrated with this life of mine, needing to change it but don't have a clue how to start, where to start. i have a job that pays crap, live with my parents who do mean well, have no social life since moving to this dreadful state of oregon. oh what the hell am i talking about, i had no social life before. that is just it, i prefer no social life, if i had one i know i would go crazy. being around people makes me, well i will just try and be nice. so i am going to change it, how? you ask, i have no clue, but damnit, i will.
