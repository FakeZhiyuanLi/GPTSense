allright, so bruegger's bagels can blow me. the place sucks. the manager doesn't know how to train me for shit, and so another shift manager has been trying to, and she's really nice, but c'mon, its not her job! after about two weeks of getting up at 3:30am and working all day just kind of getting shown how to do things with a gun to my head, i can't take it anymore. the hours suck, the job blows, and i'm done. i wrote a letter telling them i quit, and i'll be dropping it off tonight after i pick up mark. done. capeche?
