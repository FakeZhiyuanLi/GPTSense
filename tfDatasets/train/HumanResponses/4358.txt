one time (it was about a year ago) i was walking down a san francisco street after work going to get some shampoo and salted peanuts at walgreens on haight and fillmore, when squinting against the low evening sun i could make out a funny-looking girl further down. she was wearing one of those india-style hippie dresses in bright purple, a pair of truly godawful sandals, plastic gold crown poised on her head, princess-like. and she was dancing around on the sidewalk, smiling and kissing some goodlooking guy with too much facial hair. something about the scene irked me and i think i forgot the shampoo. on the way back the air smelled of spring and sea, tinged with a hint of melancholy (or, in retrospect, nostalgia) and i realized i'd seen myself, five years before.
