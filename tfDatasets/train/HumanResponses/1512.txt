after work i went rowing with my colleagues marco and lucas north of the city. it has lots of canals and really beautiful scenery with windmills, cows, house boats. but the rowing coach is a real row nazi, so we have little time of enjoying the view. went to a nice brasserie afterwards with view over the lake and had some delicious garlic mussels. how expensive, but how good!
