the night could not have got any better. my girls and i decided we has going to go out, but first we where going to go out to eat at b.w.3's. as the night progress it seemed that we was not going to make it to b.w.3's. so ashlie, crystal, and i meet up with these very nice looking guys had some drinks and headed out to the late night library night club. as we approch the door i see a guy that have had a crush on since high school. his name is joe warren. by now i want him like you would never believe. so we talk and my friends and i walk in the club. if you can imagine we are on the scene. everything was everything as they say. the really cute guys were still with us when we left the club. i got one of the guy number and the rest was history. if you know what i mean.
