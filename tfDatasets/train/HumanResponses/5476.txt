every time i take my boat out my batteries get drained rather than charged. i go to flush my toilet (which is a marine toilet running off the twelve volt batteries) the next morning and it won't flush and i'll have no running water. as soon is i get the charger going, i'm back in business, but it's a pain in the ass.
