moments of anger, moments of rage, sometimes the tears take over, i sit and think about things, in my mind, turning them over. what's wrong with me? i'm a happy person until the other side takes over. am i a skitzo person? i am beautiful, i know that my problems aren't like others teen girls have beauty issues i'm not like this, i'm one of the others. this is a poem to myself to help me find myself out i need to see who i am so i can let this person out. writing is a big part of my life for me it's a relief let's me express my mood, it's a harmless sort of relief.
