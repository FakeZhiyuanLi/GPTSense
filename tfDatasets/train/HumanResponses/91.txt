it's been awhile since my last blog, because i moved into the dorms at texas state university as am ra to the caminos program. it's a lot different than it was at the high school, more walking and especially because of the hills, ut it's been cool, food's alright at the dining hall and everything. i have some journa; entries starting from sunday when i moved in, but i only have 5 more minutes to be at the library over here before i have to take the students i have with me back. i already miss my regular life, especially since i have no contact with anyone else since were busy with back to back activities and classes. anyway, looks like thats it for me today, hopefully i'll be back tomorrow.
