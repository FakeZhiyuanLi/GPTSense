i think a great way to start this, is by telling what our dreams for d-teams are. i'd like to see 75 kids involved in d-teams this year. i'd love to have 2 leaders for every 5 students, and every student cared for and growing in faith. i'd like to see 26 d-team leaders who have a passion to see our students grow. i'd like to see committed students who take d-team's seriously, but have lots of fun. i'd love to see us as the model for 'big church' when it comes to small groups. rob
