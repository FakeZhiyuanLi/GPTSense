yesterday i chatted almost all day and tried to write some of the pages still missing in my report about the "edo-jidai". i went to my favourite chat "sapporo-chat" and met up with the girl i quite like from chatting before. we did some video-chatting by msn and it was really fun - we were talking about spending a lot of time together, when we meet in osaka or kyoto. well, she is a really sweet and good-looking person! at the end of the chat, well, i asked for her age and really got surprised: she told me that she was 31 years old, once married. wow, that was something - i thought she was around my age, maybe 2 or 3 years older. but i would not call this an disadvantage, maybe if we keep a good contact and enjoy ourselves together i'll give it a try and start an relationship with her. right now, i don't know yet. i think it will all be decided when we meet for the first time. i'm really looking forward to it!
