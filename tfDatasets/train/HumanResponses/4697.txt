well, the summer has already started here, and my children are already bored, and its only been like 3 days home oh boy i'm not sure how it will be after months. maybe they just need some time to adjust to being home. tonight we are grilling with some friends, hotdogs, sausage, chicken, pork etc.i'm also going to try my hand at making margarita's for the first time. my friend gave me her special recipe. after this week of moving to the new house, it will be nice to sit down and relax for a bit a picture of my husband and i on our wedding day.
