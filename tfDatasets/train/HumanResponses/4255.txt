i have decided to issue this second salvadorean edition of ¨human attrocities against human rights,¨ in responsse to the appeal of many of my friends, both in el salvador and in other countries, that i do so. in this latest edition, i sset out to describe not only my own ordeal, but also the tragic tales of other kidnap victims in el salvador, many of whom never lived to tell their own stories. the reader will learn about the torment and indignities inflicted upon innocent victims by terrorist predators, and the overwhelmingly silent reaction of the authorities. if nothing else, we ough never to forget the names of the victims whose last moments are recorded in this book; we owe them at least that much.
