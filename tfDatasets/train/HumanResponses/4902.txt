hi all! yes, it's just about midnight, and yes, i just got back from work. nothing like a good 15 hour day :) we found out that in the end, we couldn't get our demo finished because of a piece of beta version 1 software running on our machine that we had to work with but was full of bugs. a bummer, but at least we can still do our demo in a different way :) but you know, little things like that cannot possibly get me down today! :) i just made plans to be out in boston for valentine's day - well, not exactly on that day for a variety of scheduling reasons, but "for" valentine's day for sure. but who might i be seeing in boston for such a day? good question :) some of you know :) others might be able to guess :) :) anyway, i am super super super excited about this :) :) :)
