what in gods name is going on. this blog has apparently eaten my last post, then threw it up all over the other blog i am most definately going to have to chain this guy up for a week now. the other blog is never going to be the same. right now it is currently in the corner shuddering violently. thats odd. has anyone ever wondered about why people wonder so much? why is it that everytime i have extra time i wonder? i wonder why this is. this is a wonderful topic to ponder, if you happen to have some time to reflect. wondrous things could happen to a man or woman if they were able to figure out this quandry. no, im sorry, the big bounce is no longer available for the dollar credit. leahcim
