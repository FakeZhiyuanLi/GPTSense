i've been thinking about the morality of mocking people. i think we do it because we have to appear better than the next guy in order to attract people like connie chung and david schwimmer. and the easiest way to do that is not to work on actually being the best guy, but to bring down the next guy so that you seem like you're better. it's easy to call the woman with a beard ugly, the man who gets airlifted out of his house on geraldo because he weighs eight hundred pounds fat, and the teenager who does not know the alphabet stupid. but it's not so easy to volunteer to shave the woman's beard, or pilot the helicopter hauling the man out of the house, or go down to the local mcdonalds to pick up an application for the illiterate. no one is perfect, and we should remember that the next time we are making fun of white males and others whom life has dealt a difficult hand.
