well, sort of. i have put a coat of clear primer on the dinghy's hull. it has soaked in incredibly quickly, but it should mean the undercoat will soak in less. hoping to have another bash tomorrow night, but maybe i should be home before the kids go to bed, as their behaviour tends to deteriorate when i'm not here, and carol gets the brunt of it.
