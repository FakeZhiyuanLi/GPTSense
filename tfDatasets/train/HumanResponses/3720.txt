it is my birthday today! 27! boy, i'm so aged :( seriously enough though, i had a superb birthday.the best i can remember. went to mass, ate a big breakfast, including pancakes, went for tea and did some writing there on a future project, and then home for pizza and ice cream at night. i'm so stuffed and so very content. and i got some groovy gifts. chuck e. cheese maybe next week for pauly's b-day! seriously, i want to thank everybody who gave me birthday wishes, and those who were kind enough to spend their time with me. love you all, esp. miss nitsch! please remember not to genuflect while receiving communion.it holds up the line!
