are my two little guys. sophie is just about to turn 11 months and has already taken her first steps. sebastian will be 3 in the end of september. being with them is both enormous challenge and pleasure. i am striving to be the best mom i can possibly be, and that does not seem to come easily on automatic. just this morning sebastian smacked sophie with the door on her head. but in the end everyone was scared because of my screaming more then anything. my own reactions and responses - this is what i am up to. something i did not think i would have to ever deal with. i opened this little lovely book i bought recently on waldorf education "beyond the rainbow bridge", and the author is talking about how important it is to be calm and quiet durinig a tantrum and not agrue with the child and how our inner discipline is teaching them through silence. i hope i will remember that the next time i am bout to scream.
