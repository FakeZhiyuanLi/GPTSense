imma take this opportunity to finally release any of the scattered thought patterns lying dormant in my mind. so much seems to change or happen in such a short amount of time, that i find it hard to keep up with it sometimes. it's hard knowing where to begin or express how you really feel about certain things. so this will be a place where i come to meditate on any and everything in an attempt to break free from my writers block. “ink” in the heart of darkness and the cool of night my ink takes flight black like night upon white write to release light shine bright in the heart of darkness and cool of night till next time. stay real and righteous with the written word. knowledge reborn
