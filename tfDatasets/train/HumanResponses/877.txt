yay! i just set up my new email account with google! gmail is coooool. so now i have one more account that i don't really need. i guess i can keep using my yahoo account for filling out online forms and junk, and maybe i'll use gmail for slightly more important stuff, but not as important as my hotmail stuff (the most important). if anyone reading this does not have any of my email addresses, too bad. if i wanted you to be able to contact me, i'd tell you. man, i'm sounding surly. good thing i get a day off tomorrow. *whew*
