hit it harder than i ever have before today. 30 minutes on the stationary bike, and while it was only 30 i worked it hard, staying at 100 rpm for the entire duration. the resistance was also put up the entire way. all in all a great workout there. then i ran immediately after. more than anything the issue is getting the blood out of your quads into the rest of your body. but it honestly felt great. my muscle stamina isn't the hard part at this point, it is my heart endurance. i need to keep building up my heart. but today honestly was the first day that i thought to myself.you can do this ryan. i need to stay focused on this and not let outside influences, moving, work, etc get in the way of this goal. i need to make this training a training for life, but not only that a training for the rest of my life. i need to teach myself my discipline once again.and more than anything.beat this sonofabitch.
