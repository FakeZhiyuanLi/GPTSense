something that made me laugh the other night! it was shell's comment and a couple of days later stu said "i need to get into the mindset of the flip flop" well then for those of you that know i'm still waiting to hear from bradford and su - it can be a bit on the frustrating side all this waiting. but i guess its all really exciting too. i'm so excited that god has a huge plan for me and he wants to bless me. he is an amazing god without a doubt! i'll be less cryptic soon. but i'm too busy at the moment not to be!
