well its been a normal day, sleeping till like 11 and then just hanging out. i just saw reservoir dogs for the first time today. it is a great movie, and i recommend it to anyone that wants to see a good crime/humorous movie. otherwise besides this, it has just been a normal day. i had to go see my doctor, it seems like i may be getting a little better, but its a slow and long process, but any progress is good progress. maybe i'll final get what i want. i've been avidly trying to make contact with her, but to no avail, i don't know maybe i just need to wait, maybe its fate i'm not sure, but id like to find out soon, against the grain against the odds i'll rise and i won't trip again the dawn of a new day never looked as good as this
