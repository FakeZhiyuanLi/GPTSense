well, i figured most people wouldn't know this, so i'll just explain it. you can respond to my blog by simply posting a comment (located under the post) "usually seen as #? comments " . then, click post a comment. then, check post anonymous, but please leave your name :d or better yet you can sign up ( free ), and create you own blogs, and profiles too! this means i can give you access to my blog, so you can create, and add on to my blogger.
