yeah, i know, silly title. but hey, it feels good to finally get the plasters off. i haven't seen 4 parts of my knees (2 on each) in ages. the doctor just got some tweasers, and without saying anything, just ripped them off. he was just silent. i was writhing in pain, and he just continued! i had one stitch on each on the four holes that were made for the op. he used the tweasers to pull it up, then cut it off. wasn't as painful as the plasters, but still hurt. the holes that were made were pretty small. they look like crosses, since the skin hasn't closed up yet, and it kinda seems as if i've gone and sliced it with a knife. no sport till i next seem him: 26 september. so that'll be a few weeks of school without having to do pe or games.yay
