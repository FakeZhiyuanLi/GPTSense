today was actually a pretty good day for me. i did well on my biology quiz and was great during spanish. i guess i got enough sleep last night. i was pretty tired. when i woke up this morning i wasnt very crabby about waking up at 6:30. today my web design teacher (mr.briggs) assigned us a project. we have to keep a blog for three days and then email the address to him so he can see how it's going. my bio teacher has to be the most boring man alive. he wont look at anyone when he is talking and his voice is monotone. he told us today that one of his hobbies is to go to southern california to catch spiders to keep in the class room. he also told us that his job before he was a teacher was to go through a jar of goop takeing out all the fish larva and fish eggs. he seemed pretty proud of it. i think it was pretty pathetic. oh well thats all that happened to me today.
