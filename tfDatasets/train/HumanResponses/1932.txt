just watched the table tennis semi final featuring singapore. boy was it exciting. we were so damn close to getting into the final and thus a medal. the last game was super exciting. the players kept exchanging points, 1 point at a time. we were 2 points away from winning when we cracked under pressure and lost the game. damn! looks like singapore aren't fated to win a medal at the olympics after all. we just can't handle the pressure. let's hope we do better next time.
