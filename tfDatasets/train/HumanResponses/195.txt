i have the next two days off from little people, and i'm not sure what to do with myself. tomorrow won't be uneventful because i'm starting my new job, but i have no clue what to do today. i really want to go to the beach today, i live minutes from it, but never get a chance to go play. it seems to get cloudy and rainy every time i get the chance. what's up with that? any ideas
