so recently me and damon have been having a "buff up" competition. not only because our stoning lifestyle happnes to be very laid-back but because we also want to be buff. now i know this may seem silly or very gay. but i can assure you it is for purly manly reasons only. so as ive been taking it more and more seriosuly i have made room for a home gym in the garage. bought wights, lots of weights, changed my diet completely and now i have some electronic gizmo that is supposed to tone and excercise my muscles. but the downfall of this little toy is that it really hurts. so off i go now to hurt myslf sommor in the name of dela sexiness. oh and owwwwwww! word trilby
