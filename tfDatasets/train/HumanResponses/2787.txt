i understand that you couldn't stay on the phone. the reason i was like hold on is because i never got to say 143. which was a let down but thats okay. i love you so much that only 3 numbers can describe it 143! anyways i talked with mrs. thornley and she said that the ibooks have maintance problems like on the batter it juts out. so it looks like i'll be paying 1599. good news is that i know someone who is intrested in the emac. i dont know how i'll live without a computer! oh well always look at the glass half full! i'll call asap 143 ibrad
