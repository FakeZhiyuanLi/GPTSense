man, i love turkey sandwiches. they might just be the greatest thing ever invented and consumed. sorry to you vegetarians and turkeys out there, but you're either too edible and/or unable to eat the awesomeness that is a turkey sandwich. every time i go to a place that serves turkey sandwiches (especially chilli's) i order it. i mean, i prolly could survive in the middle of nowhere with no human contact if i had an infinite amount of turkey sandwiches. as sad as this may sound, eating a turkey sandwich makes my day. you should know, however, that that isn't sad because turkey sandwiches kick ass. i saw "dodgeball" today, and chuck norris was in it. so i recommend that you watch it, because chuck norris is the badest ass person ever, and he makes the movie totally worth it. also, the movie's pretty funny.
