my lovely and fabulous tivo recorded the e! true hollywood story of diff'rent strokes. i love my tivo because i didn't ask it to record it, it just did (not that i wouldn't have told it to if i had known it was coming on). this was quality programming because the kids of the show were very screwed- but we loved them! which prompts me to say: everybody's got a different kind of story everybody finds a way to shine but no matter what you got not alot so what they have theirs and you have yours and i have mine and together we'll be fine we got diff'rent strokes to rule the world yes we do we got diff'rent strokes to rule the world! .mmmmm
