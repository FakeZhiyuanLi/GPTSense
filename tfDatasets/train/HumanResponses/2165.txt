just spent a few hours playing tropico (not played it in ages) and i forgot how addictive it is, i had to force myself away from it.if you don't know what it is, your a president of an island and you have to build things to make money ect. make alliances with countries, and keep your people happy, i always get stuck on this sinario where you keep getting attacked by rebels, i can never manage to hire enough solders to keep them away. =\
