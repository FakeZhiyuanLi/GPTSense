mrs rasmussen was off on holiday today, and she and i enjoyed the fine weather by doing little else than reading in the garden. tonight we had a barbecue, but the weather deteriorated somewhat and we had to evacute as it started raining. it didn't really amount to much rain, just darkish, threathening clouds. then matthias beat me in pro evolution soccer with a beautiful header on a beckham corner.
