just a touch about me 2 months ago i started this blog but someone from school found it and i was forced to remove it(for reputation purposes(oooo big words)) but i'm back and posting yay! for me anyways i'm way busy at school at the moment with doing my final year and all. i hate school more than i hate anything else in the world well apart from the people at school but thats another story. anyways i better go cause i have maths due on monday and i'm not even half finished and its cubics and quartics and really boring stuff like that. although on that subject when in all hell am going to use long devision of polynomials answer me that. i really better go now so bye byes
