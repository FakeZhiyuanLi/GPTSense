how to even begin today? i can feel the swampy, energy drained weight of my body fighting against me, my bones almost screaming in denial. i hate the waiting, it feels like waiting for a war to commence, baited breath and all. i am sleeping on empty dreams now, i have almost become the death angel, oh, but she is beauty, she is true purity, yes?
