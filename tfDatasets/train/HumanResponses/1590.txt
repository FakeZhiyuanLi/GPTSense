i have nothing to do on the weekends! i'd go over to katlyn's but she's at a friend's little party thing. so i'm forced to sit here for the whole day and do nothing! grrrrr. i need more friends like me who have no other friends so neither of us will be busy. yes, that would solve everything. well ok, enough of my whining. have a nice day. i love you katlyn!
