as expected, the first couple of stages are dominated by the sprinters. just glad to see teh team keeping lance safe and letting the rest of the pack fight it out for sprinter points. tomorrow's ttt should be very interesting,(edit: tomorrow duh, i mean wed. i lose track of days and dates when the tour is on) though, being this early in the race, all the teams shold be fresh and i bet more that a few teams will throw up some strong numbers. as always, i am sure the posties (what will we call them next year? the discoverers?) will be strong and not let anyone get out too far. i am sure if the conditions are right, they will go for a win.
