is anyone reading this? if so, post a comment! fished with grandparents today, as well as just hang out time. great to be here with them. fish were biting, and we caught quite a few of them, but they were all throw backs for being too small. went and ate fish at the world-famous king's inn though, so that made up for it. will travel back tomorrow night.
