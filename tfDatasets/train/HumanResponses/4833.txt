i've been reading walker percy's love in the ruins for the past few wweeks now, and the further i get into it, the more i like it. after my conversation with you, jeremiah, i made myself care less about the lapsometer's functionality and in doing so have started to appreciate the deeper facets of the story much more. i am thoroughly enjoying becoming fully immersed in dr. thomas more's growing paranoia and fleeting love affairs. i've got a chunk of time tonight by myself with nothing to do, so i'm planning on using that to get some more reading done. i thank you for giving me something to look forward to this evening.
