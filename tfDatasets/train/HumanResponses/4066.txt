so i was sitting there, minding my own business. i had just gotten back fromt he library and was soaked. there was a very heavy rain monday evening, and i was completely soaked. there was quite a bit of lightning, but it seemed far away, using the flash-time delay trick. i was talking to some people online, when all of a sudden zap, crakle, flash! my screen goes black. we spent the next couple hours trying to figure out just what had happened, and whether there was anything on fire(we did see somehting smoking on the outside of the dorm). anyway, the idea is that the internet router got fried, along with most people's network cards(including mine). luckily, stuart has the best house councilers evar, and they bought everyone who needed them new network cards. so everyone lived happily ever aftar.
