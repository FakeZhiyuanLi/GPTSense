hey again, tonight was the first night of the last week of me worrying about thankyou cards. in a feat of motivation unlike me, i confessed to angel last night that i wanted to have our wedding thank you cards done and sent by the end of this week. it's not like there's a mountain of them or anything, only 2 dozen. sometimes i can be pretty lazy. and other times i can be insanely lazy. but this week, damnit, everyone's going to know just how appreciative i can be. i'm out.
