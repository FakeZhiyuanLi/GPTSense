is anyone else freaked out the first time they try this? using blogger.com puts you right out there, much quicker than i expected. so i work on my profile, save my changes and view it, and right away there are hyperlinks between my blog and tons of other blogs mentioning whatever term is linked! oh the power. now, i'm no techno virgin. i designed and maintain our library web page using stormdance antenna web design software, ws_ftp; i edited xml code while converting the print american national biography to the online edition; i can hand code html when needed.true, i have a painful relationship with cell phones. but i am impressed and a little tickled by this blogger.com service. i had planned on developing a web page on my own, updating it by opening the web design program when needed. but this is easy, quick, and i'm sounding like blogger.com has paid me for this virtual airtime. not a bad idea! well, thank you blogger.com for making the virtual world a little more close-knit.
