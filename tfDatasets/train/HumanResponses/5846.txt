is this what life is supposed to be like? just go to work and then maybe hang out with friends after work but not really doing anything productive? i feel like i'm so unfulfilled cuz i've been in such a dry spell from design. i crave it all day long every day especially when i meet new designers or get to talk about it for one split second, ideas flow through my head at all hours of the day, but when i find time to sit down in front of my g5 i draw a blank. maybe it's the time constraint of my 'bed time' so i can get up for work the next day. that keeps me thinking i need to cut the designs short. i wish i just had a day off so i could really sit down and design
