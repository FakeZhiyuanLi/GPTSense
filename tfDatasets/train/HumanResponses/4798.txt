all you canadians here. go vote! it takes 2 minutes, and it's the one time in 4-5 years that you actually have your say in governing your country. think paul martin's a dumb fuck? throw him out! think stephen harper is worse than bush? vote against him! think there's not enough mustaches in ottawa? vote layton! i don't care who you vote for. just go. do it.
