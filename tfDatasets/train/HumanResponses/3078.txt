well, it's late as usual, and i'm just popping by to say 'night to all. i spent a few hours tonight chatting with jason (aka j) a new internet friend who's pretty neet and lives on a farm near williamsport. special thanks to j for keeping me occupied during the typically lonely hours of the evening. more later this weekend. today's link is sony - thank you for having underpaid chinese people manufacture my new portable car cd player it's very nice and much better quality than the really cheap one i returned to best buy that was also from china, ironically. nite
