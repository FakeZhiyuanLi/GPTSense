for those of you not in the know, the universe is expanding. not only is it expanding, it's been shown that the rate of expansion is increasing. why? my theory is that our universe is a 4 dimensional space-time brane located on the surface of a higher dimensional "bubble". a little girl is blowing the bubble from chewing gum in her mouth. 1 second of "her" time = 4.5 billion years of time in our universe. the bubble will pop in a few seconds and our universe will cease to exist. i call this theory maxwell's inflationary hubba bubba theory. feel free to nominate me for a nobel prize at your convenience.
