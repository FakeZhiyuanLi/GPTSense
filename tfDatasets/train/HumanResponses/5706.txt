so have you ever been in a car that has run out of gas? did you know that when you do the gas petal doesn't workat all! yesterday my best friend meagan (we have been friends since grade 8 and we have had some crazy adventures with) and i had a super day hanging out. she was driving me home when she was like i have to get some gas but i will wait and get at the shell right beside the tim's/wendy's. when she was like the car is running out of gasliterally. so we coasted down the hillsborough bridge towards charlottetown and would have made it to the shell but the light turned red so we had to stop. so we through on the 4 ways lights and laugh are asses offthen when the light turned red we laugh even more when rcmp drove by.and didn't stop. oh well we only ran out of gas not like we were hurt. so meg got some gas and we went on are way. the perfect ending to a great day.thanks meg, i had fun.
