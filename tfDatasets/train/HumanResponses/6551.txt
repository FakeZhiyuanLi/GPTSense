it's my mom and niece's birthday today, so my son and i will be making a trip to visit them. life seems too busy and stressful right now so much to do. taking next week off work so whenever i'm preparing to be gone, theres double to do before i leave. finances are sucking too. someone from church that was really special to me died yesterday. it makes me really sad. i have a note on my desk to send her a getwell card, and the note had been there a week at least :(( this lady prayed for me and my family every day for a long long time. i really really need to be better about at least sending cards
