i have this whole image of what i wanna be. but i'm not really like that. its all my parallel life that i lead in the realms of my mind. i have this attitude. i have this style. i even have the whole 'circle' and incidents too. imagination or hallucination call it what u will. but i can sit for hours on end n think up situations incidets n events that never happened. imagine everything down to the littlest detail. n they aren't necessarily the nicest things. my parallel life includes the pain n the heartbreaks. the good the bad and the ugly basically. maybe its the reason for my insomnia. maybe its the reason for my schizophrenia.
