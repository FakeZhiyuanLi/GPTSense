it's too late to cry i love you. the wind still blowing, my heart still aching 	 one side of my eyes see tomorrow, and the other one see yesterday i hope i could sleep in the cradle of your love, again cry for me, somebody, with dry eyes the real folk blues i just want to feel a real sorrow it's not bad a life in the muddy river if life is once hopeless hope, and the chance with traps what is right, or wrong it's like a both side of a coin how long i must live till i release? 	 the real folk blues i just want to feel a real pleasure all that glitters is not gold
