it's the first day of summer yayyy! i just got back from katy's house. we're going to the mall today as soon as i get ready. last night i went to emily's @ 8 and we stayed there til about 11. it was actually kinda fun. after that i went back to katy's house and we sat in her room and talked, then went in the hot tub at 12:30. that was interesting. i think we finally went to sleep somewhere around 2:30. but yeah, now i'm home. for a little while anyway. i'm so excited that school's out! this summer's gonna be awesome. we leave for virginia on saturday. i think we get back next sunday. after that, my room should pretty much be done so i'll get to move down there. can't wait. well i suppose i should go get ready, otherwise katy's gonna be pisssed at meee.
