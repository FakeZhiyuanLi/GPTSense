hi all, this is the first time i've ever done anything like this and i know most of you probably aren't even reading this, but it's kinda fun. i can write whatever i want and post it for anyone to see. heh heh. well, not much been going on here, i got a new marshall 30w amp on tuesday. it has a really nice sound. um, i'm saving up to buy an acoustic guitar, preferrably a taylor, but i'll probably get an epiphone. oh well. if anyone i don't know is reading this, please im me. i don't have many frineds. bye for now, jack
