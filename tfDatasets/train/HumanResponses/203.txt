day 2.well it was a resting day. i went through paperwork and sorted it into files. watched some tv and played on the net. nothing major. tristan finally cleaned his room (for the most part). you can at least walk in without falling on something. it was a long day. ended by a movie on tnt or something like that. the virgin suicides. that is a weird movie. well stay tuned to see how day 3 ends up.
