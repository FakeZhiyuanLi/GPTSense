well i'm back! and with pictures too. theres about 35 or something of them, and thats all you'll be able to see about my life this week due to the fact that i have to do some photo work for another website. i actually ditched sea world because it was lame as hell! i went to this place called belmont park and rode the giant dipper. it was pretty damn good. it was like built in 1925 or something. anyways after that i went to knott's and rode some coasters and crap, took a few pictures of things there too. anyways i'm hungry as hell right now. so i'm going to eat some food. ta.
