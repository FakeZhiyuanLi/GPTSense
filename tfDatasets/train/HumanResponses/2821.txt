so, today was the last day of the month. went pretty much like a big ball of crap! but that is the exact same way it went last month, and the month before that, and so on and so on. this is my first posting in my blog so im really trying not to keep it too long at first. but on the flip side of this shitty day, i do get to go and smoke a nice cigar of my choosing. this is a deal i made with myself to quit smoking the multiple swisher sweets that i do love but ultimately made me really stink and takes a little bit off of the occassional smokes i bum off of my bosses. i find myself being somewhat guarded on this blog cause i almost treat it as a journal of thoughts and suchso you won't get anything good out of me yet.
