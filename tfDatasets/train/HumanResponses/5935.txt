well, evan forgave me and i told chris to stop calling. dee and i have been talking even more than we did in the first place and everyone's happy. i've been to the mall twice this past week and my collection of summer clothes has grown a lot! tomorrow i have to go to a banquet for dee's pageant and then evan and i are going out for a bite to eat. thursday is the big day of the pageant. dee is nervous, but i have a good feeling about it. i think she'll win something. so, good luck to you dee! :) i know this post is really short, but, i have got to go and eat before i die of starvation! â™ª: jadakiss - why mood: hungry
