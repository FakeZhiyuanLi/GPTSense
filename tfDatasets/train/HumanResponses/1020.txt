saturday just a normal day in a german soccer fan's life. i am sitting here watching tv (my favorite soccr team) and just talking to some people on msn. my soccer team is winning right now-just the way it should be- and so i am really happy right now. i am also talking to this american gal, i dont wanna say names. and i am really happysoccer team scored again. now it is 3-0 and i am really happy about that. today was a really crappy day outside as it was raining all day long and i was just lying on my bed watching tv and eating. i think i will get fat again as there is nothing to do.
