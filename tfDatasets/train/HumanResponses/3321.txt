this weekend was pretty great. i mean, so many things happened, all of different levels and types of good. on friday, i talked to my baby for a really long time, she was tired, but i stayed up. i also watched fight club on friday, that movie is just so good. if you haven't seen fight club go get it.now. then on saturday i woke up and did my chores, all the while trying to call cyndi. after a while i went and chilled at my friend james' house. we played a game called fusion frenzy on xbox. very fun mingames. i ended up staying over there all night. i learned a lot of japanese from akiya, the japanese exchage student living with james. i really love learning new languages. today was so great because cyndi surprised me at james' house, i looked like the just-woken-up-devil-monster, but it was no problem. she took me to a chinese restaurant and then we just hung out together for a long time. my weekend was so great, the perfect r&r time for the long week i just had.
