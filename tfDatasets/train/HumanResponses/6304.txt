i've been gifted! i have been struggling with an idea that came to me for a book colaberation with my sister, and this morning, while watching metallica on head banger's ball, it came to me! can't wait to write it out! another exciting revelation is that metallica has a movie coming out in theaters in a couple weeks! it's called "some kind of monster"! i was bouncing in my seat at the news! well, time to don a ponytail and running shoes to run with madre ! 3.5 miles this morning.
