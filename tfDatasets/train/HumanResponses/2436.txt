usually there is a man on the train in the morning who gruffly announces the next station. today the man was incredibly happy, announcing stations with obvious glee, and announcing the final station with almost a cheer. whatever happy pills he had been taken, it affected many of the passengers too, who were leaving the train with smiles on their faces. happiness really is infectious.
