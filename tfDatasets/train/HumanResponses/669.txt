hmmm.this has been a very busy and tiring day for me.our whole rle group stayed in krissy's house last night just to finish all the stuffs and by 7:30 am we had our case presentation and we're lucky because ms. reyno is in good mood.(kahit na ang gulo ng presentation!) in fairness, yung case namin super challenging! hehehe.after that, jen, macy, karol,yana, tom, mike, seth, maycon and i ate lunch together -=:shei-shei:=-
