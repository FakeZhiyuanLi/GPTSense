the percussion concert went well this afternoon. for the most part, everything went off very well without any hitch. looks like i'm gonna play piano accompanyment for nathan johnson's trumpet scholarship audition this friday. that will be a first for me. i just sent off my student employment application to the san francisco conservatory. hopefully i'll get the job opening currently in the admissions office. looks like things are startin' to get busy again. later.
