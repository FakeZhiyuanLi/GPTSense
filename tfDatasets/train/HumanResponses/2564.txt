one of my projects that i forgot to mention was genealogy. i have been working on my family history on and off for about 15 years. i haven't done anything with it for about 5 years now, which is why it slipped my mind. but, i may catch the bug again. or i may get a call from some distant cousin that i didn't know i had. so i will add this to my list of works. now, getting back to those egyptians.
