i'm not going to write [eternally yours] just yet, 'coz i've had a bit too much of writing about [the last chance], having only just finished writing the original and all that. i'm now starting work on [secret snowfall], and i should complete it around october or november. then i can really start work on [eternally yours]! that is, if i don't start to write [four-leaved clover] instead, but i highly doubt it. i'm quite sure that after [secret snowfall], i'll definately write [eternally yours]. you don't know what i'm talking about, do you? well, guess what: i'm not telling! until later.
