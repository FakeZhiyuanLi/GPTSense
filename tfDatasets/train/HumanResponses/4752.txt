well i'm back at work and really didn't want to come today. the kid we had in lastnight finally left this morning. i'm just sitting here at being bored yet again. my partner is watching the news on t.v. i'm hoping he doesn't bug me today. tonight is the first scrimmage for football, so hopefully the kids will be good. school starts thursday so this weekend is the last before school starts. jason's aunt and uncle head back to san antonio tomorrow morning. i got to see them wednesday evening. man i really don't have much to say makes me seems pretty boring lol. guess i'll surf the net and some message boards, and maybe write some more later if i can think of anything to say lol.
