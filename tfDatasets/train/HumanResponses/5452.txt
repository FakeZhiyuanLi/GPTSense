as you remember i talk to a guy name dwight. he is very nice guy that everyone likes him. but here is the thing he believe that we are moving to fast and i think that we are moving to slow. what is the deal with guys? do they have a problem with commitment? i just don't understand. i know that i am fallen in love with him. but he always makes me question my thoughts. for example he told me that he was coming back to my house last night. but he did not return until this afternoon at 2:00. is that the kind of thing that i want to deal with or am i better off by myself. every time i ask myself that question i come up with the answer, that i am better off with him than alone. am i wrong?
