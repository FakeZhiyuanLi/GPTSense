hi. my name is stevimundo, but call me soma. please, for heavens sake. i am your average teenage boy scum emo dude who is confused about his life. no, that is not what i tell people when i first meat them. anyways, yeah, schools starting, and it blows! i have a few friends i met at the end of the year, but other than that, i'm gonna get killed. no one really knows who i am. i'm some dude who got his brain fucked up (ask me, and i'll tell ya.) and now neither knows how to interact with people, or remember to do homework. i ended up in summer school this year for failing english. and science. and probly health, never learned bout that one. i'm teachin myself to play the guitar, and wrote a song mocking those depressing acoustic song, and i call it emo song. it would be that song on the alblum you'd wanna skip, but its kinda catchy. i'll make a post bout it later. anyways, i take paypal. =)
