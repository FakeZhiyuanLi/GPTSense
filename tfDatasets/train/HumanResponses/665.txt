yes, today the hutton report was published. bit of an anticlimax, really. i was more concerned about colin foolishly leaving his condoms at home resulting in a disappointing lack of sex today. oh well. it also snowed. for about five minutes. buuuut it pleased the boy goon, so i suppose that's a plus. however, i may end up walking him to school tomorrow as a result, which is a bit of a bummer. ah well, will attempt to be a little more regular and interesting with my postings now. just thought i'd let you know i'm alive.
