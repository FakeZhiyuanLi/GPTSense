"we'll crawl through your backyard and whack your yappin' dog" - x i could have used john doe and exene cervenka last night. it's a rule that the dog barking at 3 am will always find me and then wake me up. a neighbor's mutt yapped for an hour and my sleep was ruined. and it's not the first time. i always wonder why my neighbor never wakes up. to the dog's credit, it's a loud and forceful bark. after the image of me shooting the stoopid animal with a pellet gun faded, the strains of x's "we're having more fun" ran through my head like a skipping record until i finally drifted off. my eyeballs feel like boils and i'm exhausted, but here is a promise for the next post: i'll break down what it's like to live in a small town with such a mundane name.
