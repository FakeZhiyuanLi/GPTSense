to use an old indian saying : "the dmv takes way to fucking long." oh well, i'll be getting the hard copy of my unrestricted liscence in a week or two. yay for me. p.s. you can now click the pictures in my previous post to see the full sized versions. these ones look really bad because they're resized by the browser to fit into the blog without overlapping on anything. so click away friend, click away.
