yesterday, i went to meet caroline in town, we wandered for a bit, went to starbucks (they sell the nicest strawberry frappuchinos ever.) wandered more, then got the train back to my house. spoke to paul (who is in thailand) on msn for a bit, and repeatedly fell off the sofa. we sat talking for hours (again) which was good fun. later, i walked her down the road to get a bus, we missed one by literally a few seconds. well, my night was pretty boring after that, but yah, was still good. ahh.
