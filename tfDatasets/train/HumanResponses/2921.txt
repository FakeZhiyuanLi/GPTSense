after that gruelling session of badminton.i am feeling the after effects. i have aches all over now and its starting to wreck my mood a little bit. nevertheless, i had to wake up early and attend sunday school ( talk about being holy ) then church ( talk about being holier ) then back home. the afternoon nap was also wrecked thanks to mr. sun's stupid heat that is causing me to feel extremely warm even though the aircond is switched on ( perhaps the repairman should come ) and the fan is at its highest speed. and now here i am sitting at the pc.very bored in fact.eating a bowl of tofu and soy juice. its kinda refreshing. thats the only nice thing that happened to me today. life is dull heh' :p oh yeah! i got a new obsesssion.orang utan's! those oogly googly cute eyes and those made up faces ( talk about stone age make up *charcoal* ) and those big mouths and cute hairy hairs. really they're kinda cute. if only i was an orang utan. goodbye! - blog ends here -
