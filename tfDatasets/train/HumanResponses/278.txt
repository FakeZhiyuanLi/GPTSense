well apparently today is the block party. joy above joys, how much fun is that going to be? you could almost piss in your pants just thinking about it. kind of like watching a baby crawl around on the floor towards a dead spider and you just know that when it gets there, it's going to pop the spider into its mouth so there's that pent-up excitement; yeah well this block party's something like that, minus babies and spiders.
