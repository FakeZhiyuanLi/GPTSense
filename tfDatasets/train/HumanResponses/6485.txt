well here i am, posting from canada (more specifically in victoria), using the airport on my dad's laptop. i might be posting from the seattle airport, also using airport, but they were charging $7! $7! for it and our flight was boarding in 10 minutes anyway. but now i'm in canada. not much is really different. although you can buy cuban cigars here. i'll come up with some more stuff after i've watched some canadian news tv (looks good though), slept in a canadian bed, and breathed canadian air for a whole day.
