the cops just left. the same two that were here before. they told me that sally had convinced them to come out and talk to the boys. but the boys are gone. the cops also said the restaurant is closed down and there is no sign of mama jiroles. sally is gone to. she declined to return to the condo with the cops. i called the newspaper and janis told me sally hadn’t called in. no word from her. my review of jiroles appeared in today’s paper. not a word was changed. they got a bad review on their omelets. this is the last from marcos beach. i appreciate everyone who stuck with me through the ordeal. bye.
