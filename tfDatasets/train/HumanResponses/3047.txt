yeha i know this may seem a bit odd.but hey. is there really anyone out there who really has a deep crave for anchovies? what the heck are they really anyways.for some reason i thought they were some kind of artichoke, but hey guess what they're fish.the things you learn everyday. what is the diffrence between a sardine and an anchovie anyways? all i know is that sardines got a game named after them, so they must be higher up on the appreciation scale. have you ever heard someone respond positivley to the remark at a resturaunt : would you liek anchovies with that? right you are: no. it's a sad sad thing, but i'm getting the hint that the little buggers aren't going to be swimming in the big blue for too much longer. rambling. it helps :)
