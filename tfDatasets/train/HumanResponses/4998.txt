i hate to sound like the old guy sitting on his red stool next to you in the local diner but damn, "how 'bout this weather?" it's cold and absolutely pouring here at my house. in the fifties currently. hi. i dunno if you realize this or notbut, um it's august i'm not complainin' though, trust me. this is a perfect evening. i wish there were guests here. i wish we were all nestled in the living room with candles and music and some food. sound good? come over. seriously, come on over. i feel very welcoming tonight. (this is an occasion) heh. nights like these are nights to be shared with another in your bed. mmm
