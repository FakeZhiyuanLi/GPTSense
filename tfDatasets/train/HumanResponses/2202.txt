so i am so lazy this summer. all i've done is sleep, eat, watch movies/tv, and play games. lol. i am awesome! but thsi thing with me liking steve, it's toned down a bit.i mean i still like him, but i don't get that little upsetting twinge if he doesn't talk a lot to me or im me. lea and i talk to him a lot. he's so funny. *sigh*. anyway, i've been talking to kraig a lothe's so wierd (we're so alike). we are "soul mates" haha. we do like a lot of the same stuff. and i saw a movie with him, josh, and jeremy.lea's man.lol. and it seemed like josh and jeremy were scared or something since i was there. but o well.i try to rub off on everyone gradually. i think i come off strong, but i grow on people. it'll be fun on the bus to student life camp. i hope me and steve talk a lot then. but i'll prolly chill with the my three boys. daniel ratcliffe is so hot! i love harry potter! i'm re-reading the 4th book now! wooooooooo!
