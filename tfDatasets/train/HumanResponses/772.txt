we're scheduled to meet k's dad today, all of us. scary. not completely sure what he's got to say, and not completely sure how we're supposed to respond. but it's a step in a new direction; i'm glad that what we've been doing is generating enough interest - or has raised enough concern. speaking of concern. i'm using up my hall passes with mak and ayah, walking on thin ice. just a matter of time before a slip up of chernobylesque proportions and i sink into the icy depths, the solid ground of support beneath me having finally been worn away. chait. drama lebih. nak kena jaga diri, jaga masa, jaga hati je. keep your head up. people care about you, act accordingly. disappointment is such a nasty thing to bring home every morning. i need to stop that. laters.
