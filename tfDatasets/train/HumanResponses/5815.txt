when you find someone what do you think of him/her? do you look at them and think only what they look like? or do you try to talk to them and get to know them? do you hide from them so they won't notice you? or do you show off in front of them? you try to get them but you fail you want to be with them so bad that you would do anything just to be with him/her. you fail then you find someone new but it's hard to tell that if they are true, you just want to hold them close and never let go like a person with money it burns a holes in his/her pockets. love isn't true and sometimes it never last.
