well its halloween 2003. we have a good size maze my brothers have designed and put up in our driveway for tonight. this is going to be a lot of fun. my brothers and i started years ago scaring the kids in the neighborhood, when we were to old to go door to door for candy. it started out just wearing costumes running up and down the street chasing the girls and large groups of kids. then it just slowly moved into setting up scenes in front of the house and then a maze. we did pots of hot water with dry ice, then we got a smoke machine and then a second one as the mazes started growing bigger each year. i use to make my own masks, they were simple things with buttons as eyes and a zipper for a mouth. when you wear a mask no one knows who you are or what you are thinking since they cannot see any expression on your face. so, what do they do? they run and you run after them! people love to be scared, and we have fun doing it.
