i just wanted to give a shout out to justin for being so awesomely accomodating by taking me to see the garfield movie this past weekend. i've been an avid garfield fan/collector for most of my life, so i knew when he came out with a movie that i would have to go see it (they'd kick me out of the club otherwise). so justin donated 90 minutes of his time on a saturday night and shelled out $18.50 (nj movie prices are ridiculousanother reason to live in the 'burg!) to make me happy. it was a cheesy kids' movie of course, but it was cute, and i can't express my gratitude enough to justin for putting up with the kid in me. :d
