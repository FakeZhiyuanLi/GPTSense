ode to my heart the start of inspiration, the fire and desire that yerns for your body. intoxicating to the soul, my lust grown for you even more. my eyes tempted by that satin soft hip of yours. you the solution to my vast equation. the luxurious dream i breath you in. let's shatter that chain of separation and tie my vine to you. that vine filled with intoxicating heat burning with desire for you. soon my darling you will be in my arms. my tongue will be gliding across your belly leading me to that warm sweetly filled place. close your eyes and crush em' tight. here i come, massage the silloute of my soul with thine heart, feel my river flow. come on honey, let's go! a time for inspiration.
