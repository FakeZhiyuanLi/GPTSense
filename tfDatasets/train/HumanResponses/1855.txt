i guess avp didn't go over to well. i should have known since they didn't give critics an advance screening like they do with regular movies. i was going to see it, but now i think i would rather drown myself in the puddle outside my window. it sucks that two of the greatest monster franchises ever, were ruined just like that. actually aliens were ruined in "alien resurrection" and predator ended at "predator 2". i don't know who thought a transition from the california governor to danny glover would be okay. that is the last fight i want to see, some chump from lethal weapon against a creature with an atomic bomb on his wrist, and for some retarded reason danny glover seems to win.
