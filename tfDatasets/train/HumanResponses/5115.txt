i might as well put it to good use! since i have the day off now, i figured i would conduct a "test" so to speak. everyone has seen crappy commercials, so i thought, why not do the best of the best?!?! so that's exactly what i'm going to do. i'll just watch tv on different channels every half hour, so it should turn out allot of crap! i'll post my results later tonight! stay or don't tuned . (what a bad pun).
