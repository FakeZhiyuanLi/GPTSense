it's nice to be off work! although, i read 2 things that disturbed me today. one was an email from an acquaintance talking about how the us might start drafing young people to the army and my son falls within the age range. another was my boss's sermon talking about how his son is in the reserves and he's been called to active duty in iraq. it makes me want to cry.
