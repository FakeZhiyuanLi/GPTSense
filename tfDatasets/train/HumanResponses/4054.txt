you, this is god. this is the first of many monthly newsletters, where i comment on stuff today's issue is pokemon, possibly the stupidest things ever. who would want to play with some little thing that isn't even cute and pokes you? i mean really, what's up with that! there are so many of them nowadays, and the story is always the same. i also think team rocket belong in a mental institution because they're so stupid. if the people at nintendo continue to make the games so badly i think i may smite the all! -god
