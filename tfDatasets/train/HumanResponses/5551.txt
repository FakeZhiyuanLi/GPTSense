performed at parco bugis junction today, chinese orchestra. most of the orchestra members were nervous, cheryl in particular was panicky beyond description. fiona asked if i was scared; it seemed i was the only one who wasn't! even those who'd perormed before were quite nervy. dunno why, but i've never got stage fright before in my life. the performance was about half an hour long. daniel ong was there like, he's totally my favourite guy dj! (fav gal dj is carrie chong.) he talked to me! okay, so it was only to confirm if my section was the flute section. but daniel ong talked to me
