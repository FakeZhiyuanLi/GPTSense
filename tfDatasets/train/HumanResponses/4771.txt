countdown to boston: 13 days guess what i did this morning i bought a ticket for an awesome seat at the. john mayer concert in two months i found out a while ago that on my last night in boston, before i fly back to new zealand, john mayer will be performing at the tweeter center for performing arts in mansfield, ma on august 22nd it's truly meant to be - it's perfect! so i've bought the ticket online and the seat is so awesome. not right up front, but pretty damn close! it's gonna be amazing. *sigh* how hot is john mayer? pretty damn hot, not to mention such an awesome performer/songwriter/singer/guitarist. just everything really. can't wait!
