i'm finally seeing the beginning of some brown algae. see, when you first set up a tank, brown algae will begin to grow, and then the brown algae will turn to green algae. once the brown has turned to green, the tank has been fully cycled, and the water quality is great. i guess the extra fish in there moved the process forward because there are little patches of brown algae sprinkled all over the tank. which is great because that means the cycle has finally started!
