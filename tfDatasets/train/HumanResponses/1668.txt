ok this as you hay of guessed is the girl i like. the only thing that sucks is that she hates me. i try to be as nice as possible to her as possible but still she hate me. i really dont get why? can someone tell me. on the last day of scholl this year i had and idea. our teacher gave back these journal that we had been writting in all year. when everyone went outside i stayed in and wrote that i liked her in the back. the great thing is that our teacher said to reread everything we wrote in the journal. there for she has to read it. ths is a great idea to get a girl( ont sure yet lol) but hey try it out and see if it works.
