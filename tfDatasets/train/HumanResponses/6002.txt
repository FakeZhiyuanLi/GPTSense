so darlin' i'm sorry but tomorrow i go fishing in the see. we are going up to plum island. we are leaving around ten in the morning and getting back not too late. the last time sucked because nobody caught any fish. i'm going to miss you very much darlin and will take your little bear with me to keep me company. i will try like hell to catch a fish for you even though you don't do seafood. i would like for you to come with me but i don't think you would like it very much seeing how we would be on a not so big boat in the ocean tryiong to catch things you don't like. its cool when you actually catch something but not so cool when you spend hours sitting there and catch absolutely nothing. i love you darlin' an di wish i could be with you rather than spending the day on a fishing trip. i want to make you happy i really do. anyway, darlin' i am going to end it here. so i love you oodles of oodles and i will tlak to you later.
