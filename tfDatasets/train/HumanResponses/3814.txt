god i had a shitty day today. i'm exhausted, depressed, my head hurts, my jaw hurts (for various reasons, which i can go into later). but, i just did a few lines of coke, and my spirits have been miraculously uplifted! and i'm getting hornier by the second. nice. now i think i'll take a shower; i took one this morning, but when i have shitty days, i like to rinse the day away.
