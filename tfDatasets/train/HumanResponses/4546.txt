why does everyone seem to hate staff meetings at work? our team meets once a month to discuss various problems/questions people have brought up and everyone always complains about going. why? i personally love getting paid for an hour to do absolutely nothing! i usually just sit there and let my mind wander, while everyone else engages in a fascinating debate about why we have to do use a particular colour of paper or something else exciting. i 'm hoping one day to find a job that is simply 8 hours a day of meetings, then i wouldn't have to do any work for my wages!
