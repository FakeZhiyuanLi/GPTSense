why should you worry about me and who i'm with? why should it even matter if you don't like them? do i tell you what to do? who to date? your biggest problem is that you're jealous. you hate it that i'm happy and i don't need you. i still love you, but now i have a different agenda. that really pisses you off, huh? guess what? i don't care. you need to invest in a hobby. read a book, write a poem, or draw a picture because my business is not your business. so get yourself some business and we'll be fine. and if any of this is misunderstood, then try reading a dictionary. ha!
