june 16th, 2004~ today was one of those regular, not so special days. but still i had some fun. i went shopping today, and got me two cute shirts, three sexy pairs of shorts, a new pursebecause someone copied off of my other favorite one.no comment on the name. and other stuff.lol. after that i went to kirkword pool, for a couple hours. once i got back i didn't do much more. now as i am sitting here writing this, my older brother has friends over.hehehe! even so, i'm bored out of my wits! so call me up and give me a ring-a-ling! lol
