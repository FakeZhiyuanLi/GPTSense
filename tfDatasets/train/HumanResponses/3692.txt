what a bad day. why do bad things happen to good people? well, i consider myself a good person. some stuff happened between my girlfriend and i, i won't elaborate because it's our fucking business. let's just say i was the one who unded up being upset. on to other things. i will never play no chip value poker. i don't see what's the point of not making the chips worth something. if you can't tell my by now, i lost. i guess it's the fact that i, at first, have the better hand then everyone else gets lucky and ends up beating me. to cap off the night it's raining. what a great fucking day. sorry for the explicit language but it hasn't been a real good day. stay classy san diego.
