although we've had some time apart, i feel like it was only yesterday when you embraced me with your boldness, caressing me as i longed for you. at first i took my distance, ignoring all past traces of you near and around me. making myself believe that i was better off without you. i still believe that i am. but i'm drawn to you ever so fiercely. you occupy my very first thoughts in the day, and also my very last before i drift off into the night. everytime we depart, i feel the energy, the life that you eject into me. i can feel it stir in my blood, i can feel it pump my heart. and i can't wait to see you again. i've tried to fight it for too long. i surrender to your overwhelming power. i thought i could live without you. i wished i could go on alone. but something has pulled me back to a place where that memory still lives, and i travel back to meet you. ahhh. . java.
