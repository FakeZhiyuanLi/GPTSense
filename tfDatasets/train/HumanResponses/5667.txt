today is friday, time for the weekend. there is an extremely bad storm going on, their is talk of it being a tornado on tv. so i am waiting to see what happens, it is really cool. on a lighter note, their are only four more days of school, which is both good and bad. it is good because their is a three month vaction, but it is bad because of exams.i have to do some major studying, so i can pass. next year i am going to penta, it is a tech. school, most people that go their are stupid, i am fairly intelligent. i am going so that i can get my a+ certifacation through the class i am taking. i also would like to go to college, hopefully mit, this class will make the transition to college a lot easier. well i am out of stuff to write for today, check back later to see what i'm up to. later
