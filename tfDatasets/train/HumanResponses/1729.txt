essentially, words mean nothing. ideas were expressed- accusitions were made. and a sense of regret and deep sorrow were the only emotions i could percieve through his words. i just don't know anything. all this time was in preparence for this- for finding this whole endevour was a "sincere attempt" on his part, and i wasn't an experiment. and for saying goodbye, in advance. something is coming, drastic changes are bound to happen. he gave me a taste of the future, but no deffinate plans to come. in a few months everything he said will make sense, in a few months nothing will make sense. i hate being in the middle of this- of knowing nothing is certain and anything could be true. alone we stand together we fall apart current music: the end has no end | the strokes {in other news- i rather like this song}
