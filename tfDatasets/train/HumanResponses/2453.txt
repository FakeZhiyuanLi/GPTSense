i got my license this morning. woohoo! the dmv is a pit of evil, but whatever. at least i spent just a little over 2 hours there. not bad at all! so yeah, now i can go anywhere i want and explore the world! right. well anyway, at least i'll be able to escape eventually. in the mean time, life will go on. school starts in a week and yearbook starts tomorrow ~ grrrrr. i guess lots of people are already back. sorry if it's you. have fun hehe!
