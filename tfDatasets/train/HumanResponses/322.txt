the time stamp on my blogs are off. my time zone was set for la. not that that's bad, it's just that i'm in hawaii. so i'm like 2 or so hours early for my blogs. finally fixed it though, hopefully. very odd. it's like traveling to the philippines. just got back 2 weeks ago. left manila at 3 in the afternoon on june 12. arrived in hawaii at 7:30 in the morning on june 12. i came before i left. weird. and get your minds out of the gutter.
