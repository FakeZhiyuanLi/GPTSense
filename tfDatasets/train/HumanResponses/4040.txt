dick cheney's would-be lover was at it again last night. she was in a bad mood, so she took all the toilet paper from the bathroom and went into her room. who does that? it's her house. if she wants people to walk on her rugs with sloppy bowels, that's her prerogative. i think it's kind of nasty. she likes writing sticky-notes to tell her tenants what they are doing wrong. but she didn't write one to tell us about why she had absconded with the toilet paper. it's a shame, because i would have used it to wipe my ass.
