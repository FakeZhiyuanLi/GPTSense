the [president's] speech [on the course of iraq] comes just a day after four-star general anthony zinni, who was once in charge of all american troops in the middle east, appeared on 60 minutes and scathingly criticized the administration's handling of iraq. zinni, the former commander-in-chief of the united states central command said, "at this stage, it should be evident to everybody that they've screwed up." he later added, "to think that we are going to 'stay the course,' - the course is headed over niagara falls. i think it's time to change course a little bit, or at least hold somebody responsible for putting you on this course. because it's been a failure." from democracy now!
