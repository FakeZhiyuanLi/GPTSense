"senator brownback's indecency bill that just passed the senate would be able to fine howard stern up to $500,000 per offense. so howard read how other government fines stack up to the indecency fine. here they are: - bribing an fda agent to get your drug approved - $250,000 fine - transporting contaminated food interstate - $50,000 fine - transferring money for terrorists - $11,000 fine so it seems the government has their priorities straight.
