ok. an album new to me: phoenix "united" it dates back to the year 2000 and you've probably heard their song "too young," the golden track off of the lost in translation soundtrack. the rest of the album is pretty amazing. their story is that one of the members, branco, was in a band called darlin. they split up, some of darlin formed daft punk, branco went in a different direction with phoenix. there are some definite daft punk influences on one or two tracks, but all in all, the album is a winner. its been described as :'undoubtedly the best post-french house, seventies californian, country-rock concept album of modern love songs you'll ever likely to hear.' mmmm.
