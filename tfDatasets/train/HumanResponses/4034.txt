the woman who runs my house would make a good mate for dick cheney. she is obsessive, conniving, and foams at the mouth. i live in a group house. i'm never going to do it again, or at least, not unless i've flown my prospective housemates to vienna to be examined by a random austrian. those people know how to sniff out weirdos, and when they do, they send them to america to touch boobies and become governors. i'll tell you more about dick's lover, and the formosan male housemate who gets victoria's secret, a little later.
