today there were 47 pieces of spam in my email account. forty-friggin-seven! so i did my usual: “remove me” request, delete and grab the next. this time there were 7 emails that would not allow me to unsubscribe at all, 3 dead unsubscribe links, and 3 that sent me into the middle of the pop-up window battlefield.l it’s official: spam sucks. (that goes for the meat too.)
