took apart my old computer and planning to paint the plastic parts. doing the starry night by van gogh. first wanted to do it with newspapers and paper mache. now relying on pastel sticks. seems to work better than the newspaper. turning out okay. then will cover it in a clear plastic coating.co-worker says it's called decoupage. not sure if that is exactly the technique i'm trying to go for but hey. sounds interesting. decoupage.
