music - your so last summer ~ taking back sunday hey i'm *bless* and this is my new online journal i love these because when you can't rely on anyone, they're always here to listen to you and your typing just depends on how shitty you feel though being a teenager is tough shit i miss being a little kid. i'ma cry now ok heres what happened today. today was caleb's birthday and i had ordered him balloons, you know like $40 dollars worth of balloons, but it didnt make me feel good like it should have it only made me miserable knowing i can't have him anymore. he's going out with julee, but i cstill can't accept it its so hard for me to i'm just tired of missing him, i want to be his girlfriend, not julee. he and i are perfect for eachother but thats the story of my life i really don't know anymore i have 3 friends including caleb but he seems to not want to be my friend after all he and i have been through he makes me so mad!
