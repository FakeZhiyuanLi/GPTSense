no, this is not going to be some kind of a movie title. i've been feeling a little bit dowdy lately. sometimes, when you want to pursue your dreams, but when you look back, you have a baggage to look after. this is what happening to me. i know that i am capable of changing my own future.if the almighty permits. i am single, earning my own living, a committee member of a cool organizationbut i can't take it furtherbecause my loyalty to a person who made me what i have become today. not to show disrespectbut i can't be with her all the time.i have my own life to leadsome dreams to catch and the fact that i can't pursue it because of a person.makes me devastated. sorrybeen blabbing about here. just this is what i've been feeling lately
