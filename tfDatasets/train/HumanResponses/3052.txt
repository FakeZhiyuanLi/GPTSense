ever just wake up, but you still can't wake up? i've been up and about for 3 hours now. got up, took a shower, got dressed, dragged my laundry to the car, drove to work, ate breakfast, sent a few emails, and i'm still not awake! its like my brain is still asleep. i don't like this feeling. i feel even more like crap because i was up till 1 am bawling my eyes out. i'm having problems with a guy friend of mine (well, we're a little more than friends). he's driving me crazy to the point that i just want to never talk to him again. he's putting me through too much pain! i don't want to over-dramatize things, however. i think my lunacy might be due to a combination of stress and hormones. whatever it is, it sucks. i'm sure everyone in my life thinks i'm crazy now. i started these birth control pills and my hormones are just wacky! i'm crying, i'm tired, my boobs hurt. this really sucks. when will it end?!
