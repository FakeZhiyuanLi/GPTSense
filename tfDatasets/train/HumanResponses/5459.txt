according to howie, my blog sucks because there were no links and very few posts. so i must post more often. something remotely interesting happened in band prac today. the sec 4 ex-drum major and ex-band major were er. gangraped by everyone else. i, however was but a curious onlooker so i cannot to be blamed. it was the sec 4 farewell party, you see and my seniors wanted to see off my senior seniors with something grotesque. according to jie han, a sec 2 senior, this gruesome deed happens "almost every year". their clothes were torn off and words were scrawled on their chests with markers. both their trousers' zips were spoilt. they were hysterical and it was the first time i had heard anyone shout so loudly. some perverted fellows went so far as to take pictures with their handphones. urk. sick , right?
