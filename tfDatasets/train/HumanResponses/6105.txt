so this concludes the first week here in washington and it's friday night. a bunch of us decided to go out to atomic brewery here in richland. it's quite a place. everything has weird names relating to the nuclear history here. there's the plutonium porter, the half-life heiweiser and the list goes on. i would like to acknowledge jim sinatra as the best uncle a guy could have. he is a the best! (he paid me to say that) it's good to hear from all you. i think i've talked to everyone i know in the past week. hope everything is good in c state and where ever you may be. i never thought i'd say this, but i kind of miss connecticut. it really is a nice place to be during the summer. but then again, so is north carolina ; )
