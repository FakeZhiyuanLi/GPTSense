i thought verse 1 i remember all the good times we had some of them good and some of them bad when we fought i was so sad and then you made me mad chorus 1 i thought you had my heart but instead you just tour it apart i thought you were the one for me but thats only what i believed i thought we had a good life spending time with each other everynight you would hold tight and you told me i brightened up your life verse 2 i believed every word that came out of your mouth but i just couldnt see what you were all about what you were talking about cause all you did was lie and that always made me cry i felt like i wanted to die but thats only what i felt inside it was something i just couldnt hide and something that everyone found chorus 2 i thought we had it all but i just happened to fall and you werent there to catch me you werent there to hold me so i fell so i fell fell so hard but didnt get far
