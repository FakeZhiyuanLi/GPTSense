thinking  . . drinking beer and eating caramello bars. he was very fond of both at that time. he would melt the chocolate on my lips and lick them off! we often rolled around on the floor together. i used to lay upon him, like he was my bed. he had a strong body. beautiful everything i remember one time where he was leaving late and i lay there in bed while he talked to me, i remember trying so hard not to fall asleep while he was sharing his thoughts with me. he was always full of big plans and wonderful knowledge, he was smart. this stranger of mine, hmmmm  i think of the day i met him. a snow storm, he still made his friends drive a long way to see me thru that. he wore a brown jacket, and smoked his cigarettes. he was lovely. too precious i sit here and reminisce about all these wonderful feelings he bought into my life, yet i still lost him.let him go . what was i thinking .
