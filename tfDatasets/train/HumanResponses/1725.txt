it seems to me that no matter when you talk to me i would be in love with some girl or other. maybe its just longing to be with someone. or maybe i just lust after a few different girls. either way it would seem that i can controll myself useually but when ever i am around a specific girl i can only do as she bids. i wonder why i feel so much.
