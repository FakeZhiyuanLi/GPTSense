never even thought to cry when i heard you say good-bye never said where you were goin there's no laughter in the air only silence everywhere and so much left unspoken since you been gone i haven't been the same i wish that i could seewho's to blaim without you where do i belong? without you how can i go on? and no love like yours wil ever do tell me how am i supposed to live my life? without you was so lost in you and me to the point i couldn't see that what we had was dying now its all that i can do to see photographs of you and stop myself from cryin' i should learn to live without your love got so many memories but its not enough i feel helpless and oh so all alone like i never felt before you made me feel alive but i don't know what it's like anymore
