well hello there today has been kinda slow. i woke up at 12 and it is now 12:50. i got band at 1:30 and we're beginning to write a new song. should be fun. have u ever noticed that when you like someone or want something its always outta your reach? for example i really really really like this girl, and its not that she doesn't know.its jsut likeit feels like she doesnt care. if only she knew how strong my feelings for her where than maybe she'd reconsider.but i'm too afraid of rejection and humiliation to talk to her about it cuz i don't want things to get weird between us. hopefully she'll read this post maybe and that way it could help bring up talking between us.
