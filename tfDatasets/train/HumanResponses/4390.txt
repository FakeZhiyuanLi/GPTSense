i got a sample of a script in hand from a producer. she wanted to create a new children series.i haven't got through it yetbutyeah, it would be interesting. i got farith to help me with the illustration since he is really good at drawing cartoons. ahhh.so many things have happened these past few days. but i got a new comrade. he is a guy from the game shop. last night,we talked about many things.including his plea for myself not to retire from the shop. speaking about the shop, i am missing it i really do. but i can't really go there without solving an issue i had. since, this is a public blogi don't wanna say it here. but i shall returnand i will survive
