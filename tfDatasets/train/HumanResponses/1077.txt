the trip was great, we all had a blast. i think the most fun part was denny's at 12:30-2:40 in the morning when we were eating, lol. didn't get much sleep because pete snores so much, heh, but it was alright cause it wasn't too long before we would wake up. it was fun and i can't wait to do it again at ifest.
