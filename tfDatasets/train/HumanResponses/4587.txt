hey- * finally got back from chicago! it was so fun, we did so much in so little time [i loved it!]. * we saw the 'blue man group' and they were awesome! they played pipes and trashcans and stuff! it was so fun, and then at the end of the show they made it like a little rave party! it was awesome [flashing lights, trance music, black light, streamers!]. that was my favorite part! * the rest of the trip was fun, it was mostly museums and stuff but i liked it. * then we went shopping on michigan avenue! that was my second favorite part! we only had a half an hour though! so my group just went to urban outfitters! i love that store [there were a lot of gay guys in that store :)] [haha] * oh yeah! we saw a girl that was on the show 'made'! it was so awesome! * lol well that was my trip! i will have pics later to show you! * kd
