yesterday nitez i watch e euro 2004.it is so boring bcoz portugal lose their opening match against greece.i watch finish e whole match n it is so excited tt i almost scream when portugal finally score frm corner at e 93 mintues.the corner is well taken by figo which set up well by cristiano ronaldo(manchester united player).he score frm a header which will nt let their fans feel so humiliated when they lose 2 greece.although they lose 2 greece by 1 goal but i can c tt they had done their best n at the last few minutes they try 2 break e greece defence n they lose a lot of chances 2 score.well done portugal n hope u will qualify 4 e group stage
