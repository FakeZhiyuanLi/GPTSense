hi cleo, it's me, blue. i just finished wrecking some of mommy's things and thought i'd give you a shout out. i know you pretty much despise me but i was just hoping maybe we could mend fences before i come and visit for a week (hope that's not a shock for ya). i'm really not that bad, i just do love to sniff your dean (as your mommy would say). i'll try to cut back. maybe i could help you out, i could eat your gross-ass food so your parents think you're eating it! what do you say? my mommy has more pictures of you up than me, she really loves you. love, blue
