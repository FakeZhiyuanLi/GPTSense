i'm one of the few people who are actually glad that the england team have been knocked out of the euro 2004 championship. perhaps now we can end the hysteria and get back to some semblance of normality. what is the matter with people? you'd think from the reaction of some folks that someone had died. ah, but wait - we can all just transfer our dreams of sporting glory to the sodding wimbledon tennis championship. and then there'll be the olympics. oh joy.
