went to see the office of my new prospective employer today. eveyone was really nice, the office was very openand spacious, felt like a nice place to work. still i don't know, something is beginning to feel very wierd about this whole thing. i mean i haven't enjoyed this process since it began, but the experience is leaving a very sour taste in my mouth. i think i'd feel more comfortable just washing my hands of it and moving onto something new. lets see if any of those jobs get back to me now.
