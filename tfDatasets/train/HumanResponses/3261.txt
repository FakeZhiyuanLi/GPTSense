i don't want to be considered a weakling anymore. i guess i'll have to revert back to my old self, and hope for the best that it is not counter-productive. after all, my cold, calculating, reasonable, logical self could always make me stronger. yes, i'm without emotions again, but then if its going to help my studies. why not?
