today i think i had my first morning sickness. i woke up and puked twice then a few hours later puked again. :/ i went to work today and found out that a friend of mine who is an rn has breast cancer. they think they've caught it in time though. i hope so. after work i went home and showered and napped. then, i drove the 50 miles to my fiance's house and we had dinner. i also told him i was pregnant actually he guessed. him: want some wine? me: no i can't him: why you pregnant *laugh* me: actually yes i am him: you are what? me: pregnant i found out a few days ago him: are you sure? me: yes him: oh my god me: i'm about 8 weeks him: i guess we better hurry with this wedding then after that we didn't really talk much about it. after i came home i got on the computer and pissed some people off (not on purpose). my grandmother pissed me off.again. that's about it.
