canada was, well, awesome amazing! and did i mention, awesome!? well, it all began with a 15 hour van ride that included a long delay at the border, that resulted in our group to be pretty late to the campus. we then got our track groups, and i ended up with woking with children (oh joy). our track got to run a vbs that did rickshaw rally (oh bigger joy) at a salvation army church in the, as the salvation army leader said, "projects" or "ghetto" of kingston. so i'm thinkin, "great." but, it turned out to be good. the kids were great, and apart from our track leader splitting her head open on the bus' back door and bleeding all over herself, nothing really bad happened. the services were awesome, the dorm rooms were beyond awesome, pretty much everything was awesome. well, i've rambled on for enough now, leave some comments. p.s, "ne na kulu murasula, la yasua" p.p.s, greg: "pico nala mufasa"
