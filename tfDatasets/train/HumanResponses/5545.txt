just came back from [mean girls]! it was great. but how regina ever became queen bee, i'm absolutely clueless. cady's way better looking! okay, so maybe it was because cady was away in africa for twelve years. but there's no denying, regina's lifestyle more than rocks. i mean, how many people get such a huge house and a jaccuzi in their bathroom? it's totally awesome! i wish i lived in africa, like cady did! that scene when cady was with the leopard cub was so sweet! if lindsay lohan really did get to hold that leopard cub, she's the luckiest girl alive.
