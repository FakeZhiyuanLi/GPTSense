i have this new idea of a script. well, after i'm done with "that place called wolf's" editing.i'm thinking of writing something out of a combination of my two favourite series. "ed and ally" is going to be a combination of my two favourite sitcoms.ed and ally mcbeal. it's about ed, a hot shot corporate lawyer from kl who was fired by his firm. to add more salt tothe injury, he found out that his wife is sleeping with the mailman. disgruntled, he opned up his one man legal firm, sharing his space with ally, who owns her own advertising agency. ally is a dreamer, an idealist with a view that the world could just be a better place if we just could try. what i can say, ed and ally complements each other. ed is wacky, humorous and smart.while still nursing his heart from his broken marriage. so when ed meets ally, the world just spins god.please give me time to write this. anything to keep away from that game shop
