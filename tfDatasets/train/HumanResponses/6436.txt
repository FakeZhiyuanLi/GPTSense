when enrico woke me up this morning (1 p.m. in fact ^_^) i was so weak i thought i had a flu.gah. fortunately, i was okay after a couple of hours but i gotta do something with this cough.mostly, i might as well stop keeping all the windows in the house open at the same time so that instead of feeling like i live on the seventh floor downtown - which is the undeniable reality anyway - it actually feels like i'm by the sea, or by the mountains, what with all the lovely winds and cool draughts. :coughs: ^_^ speaking of which, they said that starting on monday we're going to have the very same hot, african weather we had last summer.scary! in italy we are not used to having air conditioning in the houses but i get the feeling this detail will be very different in just a few years from now.
