my boss handed me an envelope with several hundred-dollar bills in it. i took them out and smelled them and gave them back. i can wait five days for money to get into the company account, better that than get jumped on the way home, as i'm destined to be with so many hundred-dollar bills in my backpack. my hands still smell like cash. by the way, if anybody out there needs some cocaine, i'm your man.
