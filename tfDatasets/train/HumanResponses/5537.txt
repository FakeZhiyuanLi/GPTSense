went to watch [home on the range] with ashley today! it was really funny, about these three cowgirls who go chasing after a wanted cattle hustler (a fat guy named alameda slim ), so that they can get the reward money and save their farm back, 'coz it was gonna be auctioned off. this disney movie shows, in total perfection, its the west at its best. wow. that sounded like a movie review for [home on the range]! ok. i'm a raving lunatic, i know.
