so i am bored on a saturday. i should be working, doing all those practice questions i have been putting off until today, but i just dont want to. my head hurts and i am tired. i need to just get out of the house and go to the coffee shop and sit down and just do my f-ing work. boyfriend is back. it is great to see him. but since he came back a few weeks ago for the first time, things have seemed different. i wonder if it is the bar exam that is changing things. i cant imagine how, just that i know it makes everything more complicated. at least that is what i have heard. ok, one t.v. show off tivo and then off to the coffee shop to do some practice questions.
