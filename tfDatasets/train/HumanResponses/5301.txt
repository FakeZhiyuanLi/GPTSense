why is it so damned important for people to know if someone has a website or not? if i wanted ya to know i would tell ya. for now, i am trying to figure out how to attach pictures to this stupid page and i might as well be stuck in the middle of a blond joke. and until i have this blog up and running properly, no one is getting the address! feck off.
