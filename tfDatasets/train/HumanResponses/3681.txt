how is it that one can be soo pathetically bored and still be busy? i mean, cummon. i've been running around like a chicken with its head cut off, and i still find myself feeling bored and utterly fed up. i'm sick of it. i have no energy left to do anything that i should do, example: cleaning my room. usually i don't mind, i even some what enjoy doing it. don't ask me why because i have no idea. freak of nature in that respect i guess. anywho. that's enough of a rant. must be getting back to mind numbing boredom. see you there! the word of the day is: wholesome!
