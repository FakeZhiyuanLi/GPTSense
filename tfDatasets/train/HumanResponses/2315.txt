i guess mine is really eating me up. had three hours of sleep, almost no food. and probably have been staring into the ceiling most of the day. it really does hurt. and i thought i was strong , haa. i guess that wasn't true. i really would do anything, anything. ha haa, i guess. but of course , rationality and logic should always be a part of everyone's decision making process. somehow i wish i wasn't so rational at all.
