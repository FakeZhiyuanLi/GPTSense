i'm only gonna get what i've got but yet i want so much more i'm only gonna be what i am but yet my hart is so sore i'm so confused, i don't know what to do my head said no, but all i think about is you and i don't want to like you any less so let's just pray and hope for the best if i follow my thoughts, where will i be? if i follow my heart, where will it lead? they say there's no turning back, but how do i know if i'm on the right track? maybe there isn't a right way i don't have to do what people say i'll follow my heart, it's what i want i'll open it up and won't let it shut.
