4 days to the olympics! seeing how today's national day, school's out for both today and tomorrow! such are the festivities. there's a whole load of shows that i'm planning to watch today on television, but i'm not too sure about tomorrow. perhaps i'll go watch [ella enchanted] or [catwoman]? recently, i've taken quite a liking for shakespearean plays. most of the class think i'm mad - a thirteen-year old reading shakespeare? it sounds rather odd, of that i'm quite aware. i've only read [romeo and juliet] thus far, though. i can't decide which play to read next; [hamlet] or [macbeth]?
