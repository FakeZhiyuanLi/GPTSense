we wish to see in reality, things in plenty but lose count of the perennial flow, after twenty day and nights race by swift still the counts come by drift somewhere down they become dormant or die only to stand up to remind our prayers are a lie still we hold strong and resolve to see them happen and not dissolve human beings are born to pray and wait still end up becoming just a bait sacrifice is supreme, cried the master we console the death of the counts, that seem faster at the back of my mind, it rings loud that i am trying to reach the cloud still i resolve, to pray with hope and desire as i believe god will never conspire after all, we all have the right to dream as we all unconsciously flow down the stream.
