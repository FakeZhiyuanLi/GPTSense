the title of my blog is from the leonard cohen song "anthem". the refrain reads, "ring the bells that still can ring, forget your perfect offering. there is a crack in everything, that's how the light gets in." the most powerful moment of the leonard cohen event for me was the finale of the friday night concert when the performers did a rousing version of anthem, with everyone singing along and feeling the joy of our togetherness. and so i've named my blog after that moment, thank you everyone.
