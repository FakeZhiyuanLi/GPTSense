today, it started out ok. me and melly were gonna hang out. then of course andy, the girlfriend stealing prick (not that he's going to steal my girlfriend), invites her to the movies. he knew i wanted to hang out with just her today, but i'm sure if i asked him he'd say, "well you did hang out with her." which i did, so it was still a good day. i'm not going to act like anything is different between us, because melly was freaking out because this entire semester best friends have been fighting over her. i'm just that lucky bastard in the back who hadn't been involved in any of it but suddenly went out with her. i also proved that i can, in fact, be a good person.
