i just finished my book. inside a thug's heart . tht means it was really good considering i just got it on thusday. so anyway, it's basically a whole bunch of letter's that tupac excanged with this beautiful model while he was incarcerated. it's exciting and sad at the same time because as she as she finally fulfilled her fantasy of having sex with him, he died! i was so sad! but that's all about the book. i'm about to start reading use me or lose me next. wow. today is a saturdy and all i can think of doing right now is cleaning up (which i really need to start doing) so after that i have no idea what the hell i am going to do!
