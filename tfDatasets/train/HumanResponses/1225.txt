i have finished one and a half sleeves of shimmer. i started the back today, because i was tired of knitting with dpns. the other night i dreamed that i had finished it, and was dancing around in it while my sister took pictures for me to post here of the finished object. maybe it was a sign that i will figure out how to put pictures on here? anyway, it was a pretty good dream. until a guy friend of mine, and his girlfriend, came over to my house and his girlfriend and i walked around naked and he got confused (that last sentence was a dream, if you happened to miss that part).
