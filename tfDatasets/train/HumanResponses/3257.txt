damn! i knew something was wrong the moment i arrived home! i lost my filemaker! i don't know where i exactly lost it, whether was it in dlsu, the lrt, or maybe even letran. tsk, it's not that really important, it just contains photocopies of book pages and testpapers, but there is one problem.it contains some photocopies of the lessons we are having today. i just hope and pray that i left it in dlsu.
