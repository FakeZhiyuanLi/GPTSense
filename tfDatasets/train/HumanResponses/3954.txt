today hasn't been too bad. overslept and took james to school; got mickey d's for breakfast on the way back. got at least one of my songs dled last night. (st. theresa by joan osbourne) still waiting on "allison hell" by annihilator, "is this love" by survivor, and "torture" by the jacksons (80s jacksons, not the 50s-60s incarnation). need to answer some replies in my livejournal.
