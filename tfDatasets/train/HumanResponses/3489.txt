another day in my life, nothing really new. i gotta work tonite at 5 so im going in a few hours early so i can skateboard, cash my check and get some supplies for school. my mom made me do a bunch of cleaning today, it sucked. i think im gonna swing by my girlfriends house after work and hang out. it will be good. we are so right for eachother and i dont know what kind of strain my leaving for college will put on us. one of my good friends had this happen to him and it ended badly because he loved her, but as a guy, it was too hard to pass up casual sex. i really hope i dont run into that problem. i really love my annie and dont want to lose her over some pretty girl that wants to get her freak on with me. awe well i guess only time will tell. anyways im gonna go play nintendo.
