i have grown quite tired of taking (in vain) measures to prevent getting spam on my yahoo account. recently i have discovered a way to stop repeat spammers. spam them. it's kind of like those pesky telemarketers. i recieved a spam email from somebody trying to sell me valium. so i sent a reply email to him saying: dear spam-face, i would like to thank you for offering the great deal on valium. factory price sounds great, however, i have to decline. i would much rather have diazepam rectal gel, as it gives me a tingling feeling in my anal area. though i may take you up on your offer next time i am on the phone with tech support. with love, christopher wells i then took the email address and went to as many sites as i could think of and signed him up for every newsletter i could find.
