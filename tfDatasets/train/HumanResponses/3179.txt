as a distributor (now known as ibo’s) in the yager organization from 91-94, i listened to a bunch of different diamonds at major functions give the awaiting masses the definition of insanity. 	 doing the same thing year after year and expecting different results. 	 this only really makes me want to ask current ibo’s one question… 	 if you’ve been working the amway/alticor/quixtar business for over 2 years and you still haven’t gotten to 7500 pv, don’t you think it’s about time that you listened to the diamonds? 	 the yager organization promotes a 2-5 year plan to success. if you haven’t achieved even 7500 pv after 2 years, take a good long look at your business. 	 it’s possible you need to work a different plan. 	 one that isn’t insane.
