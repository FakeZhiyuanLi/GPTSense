i feel it coming moreso than ever before. i know he is going to want a break, but this time i will not stick around and wait. there is no sensible reason for this. we never get to see eachother, or moreso i never get to see him by his choice. it seems like he loves me when its convenient for him. i hate him so much right now. ugh. -audrey
