as you can see.it's pretty late and i am pretty tired. but i just have to get something off my chest before i can rest easy. everyone who went to the show last night.has never seen the strawberries beforewell atleast all the south and crossler students. and ive been telling a few people that they should see the strawberries for a long time and they just skip out on the show. and finally when all the queers get together to see the show its with different band members. it makes me mad because they didnt get to see the original. but it doesnt matter cuz you're all cunts.
