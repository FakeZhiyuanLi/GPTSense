if all i talk about is guitars, i'll run out of things to talk about real quick! so, i decided today i would talk about the job search. i went on an interview today at enterprise and it went well. all i have to do now is get them to call back! the truth of the matter is now that i just want a job! all anyone can tell me is good luck! .if you say so! peace, love, and hair grease, y'all! -spud
