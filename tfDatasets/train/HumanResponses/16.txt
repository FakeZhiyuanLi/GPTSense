friday today so may basketball nanaman sa hapon. same smell (stackhouse!), same moves, same people, same court. but enough about that, let me share what happened sakin nung summer. we went to an orphanage. the kids were cute, makulit, playful and most of all, they drool  it was a unilab thing (my parents work there). i carried some of them (actually, all of them). and of course, all of them drooled on me. i had to change my shirt after that. we then had lunch in max's. at least wala nang drooling doon! do i look good with a kid?
