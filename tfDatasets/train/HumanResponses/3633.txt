i'm now feeling a severe panic attack coming on, thanks to having just sent an e-mail to my line manager at work, telling him i'm transsexual and that i intend to see a psychologist in the near future in order to begin the rocky road to gender reassignment surgery. i composed what i believe was as brief an e-mail as possible but which covered all the points and then sat for a minute or two with the mouse pointer hovering over the send button, trying to will myself to have the courage to send the message. and then, when i did, i find bt's e-mail server is down. is this an omen? possibly. anyhow, i was by this point determined to send the damn message, so i used their website e-mail facilities and sent it that way. but now i'm panicing. have i done the right thing, announcing this to my workplace via e-mail? i hope so.
