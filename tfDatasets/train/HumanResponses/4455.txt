hi all, for all you devoted jack fans who have read every entry i've made, i'd like to say thank you. i've never had a fan before, and i'm almost certain i'm only imagining it now. anyways, i volunteered at the rock ridge branch library again today for another two hours. for the first hour i didn't stop reading my book, "pet sematary" by stephen king. it's really pretty good. then, the second hour, j. t. slama came in and he was volunteering as well. we caught up on all the nothing the both of us have been doing over the summer. he built a six story card house out of index cards and mcdonald's ice cream cupons and i continued to read in the awkward silences that aren't that awkward if you really don't care, as i did. anyways, i had another singing lesson afterwards and i learned "take me away" by plain white t's. it's really simple. that sums up my day so far. check back later to keep up with my fast-paced life. talk to you all later, jack
