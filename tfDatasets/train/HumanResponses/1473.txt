like cold, crying clouds, pouring through the sky, sinking to the ground. like a silver dragon, flying through the air, landing in a cave. like a glowing light, flickering in a lamp, suddenly extinguished. like a star being born, than a fast explosion, and it dies. like getting a wild buzz, hiding in the clouds, dreaming a luring dream. like rain splashing in puddles, slithering in anger, stealing a metal-iron obsession. like everything that begins, something has got to end.
