life freaking sucks these days. i am having such a hard time with bills. i wasn't working for 6 months and we fell far behind and now catching up seems impossible! i'm so scared we're going to start losing our belongings, house, car etc. i need another job and noone is hiring yet. i went all the way through to a dm interview at anchor blue and they called to say they selected the other candidate. what can i say other than oh fucking well! my job i have now says that they will try to give me more shifts, but their bar manager is also a bartender there and gets the primo shifts. so i have no idea what to do , i'm trying.
