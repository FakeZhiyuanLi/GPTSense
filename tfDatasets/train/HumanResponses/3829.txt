somebody put an end to the madness.this boy needs to stop! ok, so here's the deal.i seem to be going through a nesting phase in my lifei can't enter a mall, or gorcery store without buying something for a home or apartment. bowls, cutting boards, knives, plates and even a garlic pressyou name it, i've bought it! someone please stop me before i buy a food processor and start saying demonic phrases like "and that's a good thing". next think you know it'll be insider trading and a four month stay in a women's minimum security prison. things have been relatively uneventful here over the past few days.last friday, i attended a jack and jill for my cousinsaturday i went out for coffee with steph and went shoppingand sunday, i spent some much needed time with my bed! conclusion.i really need to get a hobbyor a job (yeah right.like that's going to happen)
