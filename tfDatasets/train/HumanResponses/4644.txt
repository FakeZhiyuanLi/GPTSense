it is so interesting what comes to the surface when you are completely honest with yourself and with others. as i have blogged earlier, the issue of trust has come to the surface. i have realized that because of my lacking of understanding about what god is doing in my life, i have allowed unbelief and distrust to saturate my life. this is not a place i have ever known. through the simple fact of realization, i have begun the healing process. god, i desire to respond to you out of the intimate relationship i have with you not out of my flesh. i want so much to trust you with everything. i can not do this on my own.
