hi, my brother is like the meanest person in the world. he calls me names. well the names are too bad to be sad on the internet. he thinks that is all that just because he is the man of the house . every time that he comes out of his room he picks on me and my sister. one day i am going to show him what it feels like to be picked on. i get picked on enough at home then at school. he is always on the internet. you always have to let him on because he thinks that he has better things to do on the internet. he says that he is the best person that is in shape and more special. i'm the youngest sister so i always get picked on. i look better then he will ever look as in cute ,sexy,ect. well now he can drive . now that makes him feel al cool and better then us. he is so wrong! well i will come back later and tell you what else is going on in my life.
