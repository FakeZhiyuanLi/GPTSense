i cut my finger. to open a tin of white asparagus. i did it because my ex ate all the ravioli with meat that were supposed to be for both. i was very angry, and of course hungry. i tried to open the tin with a scout opener. don't do it ever if you don't have the experience. bam! and a deep cut. cazzo. its very painful.
