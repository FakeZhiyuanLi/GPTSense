well i haven't been wrtting in here cuz my comp is broke and its still getting fixed, and i really don't want to talk to people right now. its been a really hard time for me, and things just keep getting bad. like i haven't really been getting along with my mom and everyting thing like that. you know how it is, and it just sucks. she doesn't trust me for some odd reason. i've never done everything to make her not trust me and its really pissing me off. well all this stuff with my moom is making my vb game bad. things at school aren't that great because of stupid ass leeann. oh and to top it all off mr. yim(my band di.) just quit and now we have no one to teach us. this reminds me so much of my freshmen and i don't like it a bit. whats going to happen next one of the people that i care so much for are going to leave me or tell me that something is wrong with tme? man i can't take this anymore.
