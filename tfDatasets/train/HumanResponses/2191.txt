i was emotionally low to a great extent yesterday i'm not exactly sure what sparked it but i broke down. ranting on and on to myself why am i the way i am? i envy those who know exactly what they want i have no preferences as to what i want to do with my life. dreams push you to reach them. then it must be better to have many dreams, and realize that one cannot be accomplished, rather than to have no dreams at all. without reachable dreams in view, you tend to sit around waiting for fate to look you in the eye and tell you what it has in store for you. is that what i'm waiting for? "we don't read and write poetry because it's cute. we read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. and the human race is filled with passion. and medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. but poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for."
