i am going to stay in school. i have been wondering whether i should quit because of the time, money, and lack of sleep, but i guess i will hang in there for a little while. money, that's a different story. jen just started her new job today. sent her flowers. i think she likes them. this will really help our finances a lot, but it will take a little while for us to get back on our feet. we've been spending too much money these days. having to buy new clothes and car tags and my medical bills. they have really tapped us out. i miss jen.
