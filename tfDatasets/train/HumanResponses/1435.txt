i hate the way you look at me, seeing you through my tears, i try so hard to please, only hurting in return. i hate the way you play with me, throwing myself at your feet, trying so hard to change. do you even care? i hate the way you're there for me, when i'm scared, hurt or alone, i'm trying not to feel for you, it's only getting easier. each day i'm played a little, a hug here, a push away there, your confusion only hurts me, i just want another chance. what do i have to do, to only make you see? "give it a little time" i say: "have a little faith" i hate how i feel like a fool, i want to make you happy, i have to think of myself, and i hate letting go.
