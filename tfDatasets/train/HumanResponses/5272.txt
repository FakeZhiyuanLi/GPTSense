freedom- the ability to do what you want, when you want. but are we really free? of course not.dont be silly. if we were free would we have any laws. would we have to have prisons. would we have any government at all. to be totally free, we would have to rid ourselves of all establishments of government, which is an anarchy. now i dont know about you guys out there, but i personally prefer to have it so that a killer can not come into my house at night and kill me. soooooooooooi guess what i'm really trying to say is: "all you poser anarchists out there are really annoying and have no idea what you are saying."
