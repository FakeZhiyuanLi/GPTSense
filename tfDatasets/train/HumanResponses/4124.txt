there is a certain silence today. morning breaks and the trees sway in the wind. my solitude is my close friend that i have become so familiar with. this despair an inspiration for the untangible love. bright eyes, satin hair. rosebud lips, you don't care. in my mind your are there. holding me, breathing with me, touching me.lust desire is playing solitaire. hold my hand, cool to the touch, relizing the death that is there. come fly with me, let's breath in the stars. let's dance among mars. try me once and never forget, for my love my darling will never rest. but, this revolution my eyes do see, tangled and toiled in memories. gone for tomorrow came yesterday and today lies forever. so take me my darling, to that special place, where our minds soar above the heavens with your embace. i love you.
