today vlad and i spend most of the day trying to find anton, eventually he turns up after a 36 hour poker session. during the day we visit the mirage and see their mini zoo which included dolphins an elephant and white lions. vlad decides to go on the roller coaster at new york new york and i decide top play pi gow poker while does this, in the 15 min session i win $28 with far less effort than when playing normal poker. in the evening we go to the belligo at about 11pm and play in their $2-5 no limit game. the players here aren't particularly soft and the game is actually quite hard. i make the mistaken move of hanging around playing until about 6:30am and although gradually treading water for most of the time but manage to lose $600 in the last hour of play with a couple of bad moves i try out. today wasn't a great poker day!
