. well, i've been saying it would be really easy to do, and i guess i was right. someone came into the agency last friday and stole one of the big plasma tvs from one of the executive offices. they say there were two of them and that they came in the side fire doors at 5:40 pm and were out the same doors by 6:05 pm. (they were caught on tape) the funny thing is, people were still here! but no one saw anything. amazing. it had to be an inside job. i'm just jealous that it wasn't me.
