yeah, i figured since i listen to it so much, i might as well start playin it. anyway, i've got the lead guitar covered but i still need someone to play bass, a drummer, maybe a backup guitar, and someone to do vocals. you gotta live in or around gallatin, tn (town in the middle of nowhere that you've probably never heard of) and be 13-17. anyone got any suggestions for a name?
