after a week on my own, jen came home from toronto today. i picked her up at the airport, which as usual involved circling around the arrivals area until she came out, because they won't let you stop for more than a few seconds. we celebrated her homecoming with a sushi dinner then watched the canadian idol results show (yes jen got me hooked, it's all her fault).
