day by day things may change or stay the same, but if you look far away enough the grass is greener on the other side. don’t look down, find something to lean on but know i can be your shelter, your raincoat when skies look cloudy, and when you find yourself tumbling down you can hop on a train and come to me. unpack your things and stay for a while. embrace the feelings of being home, these chances but come 3 times a year. you got christmas time and easter morning and waking up in your own room for the first day of summer. smelling the smells you knew as a kid. the hometown has changed but seeing the friendly faces makes you know you’re home. when you’re feeling sad and nothing seems to come your way i’m just one call away from you coming to me. it’s easier when the wind is at your back your sails can be hoisted and you can be made ready to face the world again its true coming to me will give you that final push you need.
