so its tuesday. hoo-rah. i had a freaking long blog written last night, and when i submitted it, my internet all froze up. boo on crappy computers. quite a bit happened this weekend. stinedurf's parents got in a bike wreck. that sucks. i went and saw maria. she's crunk. last night me and some other people watched miracle. all i can say is, that is an awesome movie. and that's all i'm going to say. me, andrew, dooley, david, and possible michael are all going hardcore mountain biking tomorrow. it should be fun, watching everyone try to keep up with me. in other news, miss courtney croslin owes me some burger street. i hear parentals walking in, that means dinner is here. i might blog later. current listening: incubus - are you in?
