i'm a big believer in the influence of chance encounters on one's life. i feel like we are so powerless in the face of the great random dice that we throw every day. sometimes events seem to conspire against you. sometimes you feel you can do no wrong. i think it's a kind of cyclical process. you're 'luckiness' is always changing. when things are going poorly, you really need to try to keep your eye on the big picture and have confidence that things will swing back the other way. over a long enough time horizon, things always tend to work out. that said though, lady luck has certainly not been shining down on me these days. with the demise of a fantastic relationship, and now an apartment that will put me in the poor house, i have little cause for being optimistic. i will be moving in with new people soon however, and perhaps that will prove to be a fortuitous change of course for me. here's hoping that the chips start falling my way again soon.
