7/30/2004 i guess this is the newest thing on the net. guess i need to catch up. it's easy to get behind when you don't spend much time on the net but it's a little ironic that i work for an isp and i'm hardly on line. go figure! anyway welcome aboard my blog. i'll be posting thoughts, points of view on a variety of topics and let you get a look inside my mind that is often times bizzar. occasionally i'll post an original short story or excerpts from longer stories that i have written or am working on. i welcome all comments on any topic that is posted. all i ask is that we keep things civil and clean and please if you want to use any of my short stories or graphics please ask. i have copywrited all my stories and graphics. otherwise have fun and enjoy
