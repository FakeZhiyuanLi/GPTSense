went over to zhaohan's house. rehearsal for ricochet . no one was there yet so we boliaoed around in the "music room". earlier i gave him a present (2 cds) for doing acc. being the pro he is, he thought they were chocolates and shoved them into the fridge. i didn't know cos i was on the piano. he wouldn't have known if i didn't ask him to play the cds. "those were cds? i thought they were a box of chocolates." anyway, he got the entire candide by bernstein (the musical, not just the overture), and elgar's 2 symphonies + the cockaigne overture - in london town - and sospiri (sighs). nice large round pralines with small holes in them. and embedded pits and bumps too! lol later we boliaoed around with the coke. laughed and almost blew it. really boliao afternoon.
