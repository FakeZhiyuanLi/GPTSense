ok went to a public loo this morning. institute of education, ones above the student union. needed an excuse to leave the library for a bit, and went on way to buy coffee. they have very thin cubicles which makes the proces of getting in and closing the door rather difficult, especially when laden with book bag and gym kit. there was a drip of liquid (unknown) on the back of the seat. but loo roll in appropriate abundance, the sink wasn't blocked (though did take a while to drain) and nothing smeared on the walls, and choice of rolling-cloth thing or hand-dryer. no graffiti, which was annoying in a loo so small that its hard to bring reading material in with you.
