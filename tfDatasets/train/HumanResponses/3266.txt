forgot to mention that i dumped gaz last friday. i'm was bit pissed off that the bugger didn't put up a fight. i said "can we just be friends" and he said "sure, want to get a coffee". he didn't even want to know why! i had been warned by graeme and mich to stay away from the birdcage (local hangout) until a week or so have passed so as to avoid giving him the idea that there might be hope, but as that seemed a bit redunant seeing as he didn't seem to think there was hope i went up there for sunday lunch. i saw his flatmate up there and apparently gaz went home and went into meltdown and is actually quite upset. that's better!
