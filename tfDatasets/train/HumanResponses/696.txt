i sit here in bed late at night with thoughts of you i wonder when i'll be able to look in your eyes to look deep inside you and see your soul the hours pass, then days and weeks go by are your thoughts of me as fond as mine of you i sit here in bed and smile with my thoughts of you everyday my aspirations center on finding the one the beautiful love who brings out the best in me the girl who enlightens me with her existence i wonder if you might be the end to my search i still sit here in bed late at night with thoughts of you has fate brought us together or kept us apart because i'm sitting here writing these words for you to read i'm taking a chance that i feel i must take for two people in love is a goal worthy of kings maybe i'll lay here, sleep, and dream thoughts of you -troy this is for a special someone
