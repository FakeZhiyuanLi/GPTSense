i have one thing to request of all of you who read this. do you have kids? give them a hug and tell them you love them today. do you have parents? do the same. do you have a wife, husband, girlfriend, boyfriend, best friend, anyone that you are close too let them know how much they mean to you! i compose this message with a heavy heart. some very good friends of mine lost their 4 year old son in a terrible accident yesterday afternoon. it happened in an instant, and he was gone. so i am begging you to please let someone you know feel the love that you have for them today. and while you are at it, let them know that god loves them too! you won't regret it.
