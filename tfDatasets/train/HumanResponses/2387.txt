have you ever pranced around your neighborhood at four in the morning? you should try it. i figure that you should try it in the window of time from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m the clubs close down at 2, so all the college students should be coming home around that time. and people might have to get up early for some strange reason at 5, we all have had one morning where we've woken up at 5. any other time than that should be open. so what if somebody sees you? you have to ask yourself, who's more messed up? the guy that runs around his neighborhood naked at night or the the guy that drives around at 4 in the morning to catch the people that run around naked in his neighborhood?
