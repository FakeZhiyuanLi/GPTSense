yikes! i can't believe another year has gone by! my buddy ryan called me at 12:14am and was the first to wish me a happy birthday! how sweet is that. seems that everyone had the same idea tihs morning, the phone was ringing off the hook at 8am, but it such a great feeling to have people who care. thanks guys! i love you
