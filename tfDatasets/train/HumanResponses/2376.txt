my life is so frustrating at the moment, i think i've successfully managed to ruin freindships with 3 different people on separate occasions completly unintentionally. then im just getting more and more stressed knowing my sweet sixteenth birthday will be spent in the exam room, failing science and english. again! i could really do with some therapy right now. grrrrrrr
