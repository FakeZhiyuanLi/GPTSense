ok so here's the way i see it. i finally wanted to have a place of my own to post all of my random musings, fun anecdotes, and stupid adventures. along with other really cool stuff too. i would like to thank a good friend for the inspiration of the blog's name, and wish her a wonderful time in north carolina. she will be missed. now on to the blogging!
