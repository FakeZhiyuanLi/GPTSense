ok, now we've done it. ne florida has finally followed much of the nation and gone past $2.00(us) per gallon. someone told me it's expected to go to $3.00 by the end of the summer (unless the gas companies stop their extortion). my theory is: per year, bring the price up to a new high, bring it down (but not nearly as low as before) when everyone finally screams loud enough, then the following year go to a newer high. and so on this way they get the pricing/profits up incrementally. all while blaming opec.
