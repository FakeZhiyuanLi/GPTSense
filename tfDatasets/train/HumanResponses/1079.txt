yesterday i went to my friend kyle's graduation at the bayfront center. it was the phuhs graduation so i got to see a bunch of old friends step up on stage and recieve their diplomas. among them was my old friend kristine, it looked so odd to see her standing up there, accepting the diploma and walking off, and the thought "wow, she's an alumni now" crossed my mind. kyle as well was strange to see up there, though i felt more disbelief than surprise that he would ever become an adult, hehe. after graduation ceremonies, we went to arrigato's. the food was so good! i took lots of pictures too, some really funny ones. the waitresses there actually wore kimonos, it was so cool, and our chef was an old japanese man and he was really funny. he did the volcano with the onions and flipped around bowls and such and made good jokes, it was a blast.
