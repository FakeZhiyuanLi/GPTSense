oh dear what a day. first i had to get up early. then there's a dead marten near our driveway - looking very tasty. then i srove to the post office and nearly killed a cat that wanted to cross the street. and then all of a suden around noon it started to thunder and rain very heavy, not olny buckets but bathtubes full of water. well, i'm going to watch tv soon. the tour the france is starting and i'm watching this every year. the only problem is that i don't know if i can watch it all the time as i won't be at home for two weeks from the week after the coming on. we'll see. anyway, my mood is much better now. but there's still room for improvement.
