now ending discretely. please hide away, i'm so lost. i drown and slumber, fall. and arise from the ashes of my former self. now ending discretely. i am but a shadow of my former self. again. once more. and over, and over, and over, and over. and. now ending discretely. please make me invisible. i just want to stay in a closet, a void, a dark room. eternally. life is a dark hall. one. long. dark. hall. now starting discretely. i'm down to just not me. a better person. blankness. the night has taught me much. please make me invincible. now. and let me stay in this dark hall. and find another way out.
