well, it's now sat. the 21st of august, and i still am unemployed. right now, i keep hearing from numerous sources that even if i don't get hired before schools start, then i could get hired still later. also, i was told that many new teachers (not just first years) in kcmo don't last 'til christmas. that would help me to get a job you would think
