well this is the first entry of a hopefully well-updated blog. before i say anything else, please realise i can't be too revealing (with family members possible reading this!). the blog could disappear or stop being updated at any time, so be warned! (although it shouldn't affect your normal lifestyle too much) tomorrow's my second op. this time on the left knee. my right knee still pretty painful, a badly swollen, but apparently the swelling is 3 times as bad for some. i can't really walk properly, so i'm gonna have real problems tomorrow! hopefully the crutches will be good enough. this is me signing out for the first time.
