there's some things going on, not only with us but between us. you failed to recognize the problem and it's causing me to battle within myself. you made a mistake and took away the trust and continue to make it hard to regain it. because of my past you doubted my love, which gave you a reason to make the mistakes you did. when do it stop? the hurt and pain you cause. haven't you tortured my soul enough? enough to know that i would die a thousand deaths, cry many rivers and yell from the top of my lungs to the world, "amoire". when i say,"it's you that i love and want to spend all phases and a lifetime with", i'm not speaking it just to hear how it sound. i want you to know without any doubts that what i say is true. so with all concerns and an acquiring mind, what else could i say or better yet do?
