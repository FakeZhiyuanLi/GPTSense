i am not happy today! the damn cardinals lost to the expos! in extra innings even. the 'spos are horrible this year and supposedly the best team in baseball lost to them! i am tired and have to work tonight at the hospital again. will probably get stuck with a bunch of confused people that i can't stand, not to mention the patients! just a quick rant, hope the cards get their heads out of their asses tonight d
