my original ragnarok account has no game time left but i managed to lvl up my swordie up to level 30 today. i was supposed to meet zane at chaos server though. i got out of the house carrying 25 pesos and ended up here with 48. cool huh? anyway this week is so darn boring. i know it isn't over yet but i expect the rest of the week to be as dull as a noontime drama series shown on local tv networks. and hbo ain't even putting anything good on teh screen.
