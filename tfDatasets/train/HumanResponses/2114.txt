i've figured out why i'm always in a bad mood at home. it's because i'm so damn bored. at least with joseph here, it's a bit interesting. i mean at dinner tonight, my father and i just sat there staring at the wall. he's probably thinking of more ways to repeat himself. so damn boring. so damn slow. so freaking boring. i can't stand him. at least with mom, i'm in a freaking good mood. i can't stand to be around my father. so damn boring. i can't stand him.
