it seems to be another slow day at work. but thanks to liz, the day just goes by a bit faster. thank's for chatting with me. my computer crashed when i was playing doom 3 last night, i was just about to pass level 1 too, crap. the stock market is having another one of those bad days where a lot of stocks are down. the qqq is positive though, which is a good sign. since i didn't have too much to do, i went to do some shopping at the eaton centre. i found some nice stuff at mexx, pants and t-shirts :) so far, jersey girl have been an extremely boring movie, i hope it gets better in the second half of the movie. it's almost time to go home anyways, yah !
