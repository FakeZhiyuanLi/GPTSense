i am so freaking mad right now! my face is swollen from fighting that stupid ass girl yesterday! i want this shit to go down! so besides that.chris got a attitude for lord know what reason, i just came home from taking my u.s history regents in which i probably failed! and lastly my whole body aches! since i was meaning to see that damn girl, i came to school looking like a bum and it was so funny because when i just got home my father was like "where you coming from?" and i was like, "schhool" so than he was like "like that?" it's crazy! lol, chinell and tauri were and my house yesterday and they were taking some strong stabs at each other. i was hoping a fight didn't break out. luckily it didn't!
