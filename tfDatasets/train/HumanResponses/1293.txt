i wish i was like a cool character in a really good book. like the ones who are 20 ( but smoke, but i have no intention to smoke) and who has a white teacup with blue designs on it, and who uses it to put cigarette ashes in it. someone cool like that. i mean someone who is cool and carefree, and who has a really cool life. sophisticated, intelligent, and who can bake a killer cheesecake. i love the stuff. and who doesn't want a car, or who doesn't care what she looks like. but looks great anyway. and who gives and gives and gives, and doesn't care if she gets anything in return. someone who doesn't have any relationship problems. who. who can look at a situation and know exactly what will be right to do. ah is it my inner self, my inner character?
