i once knew a girl who had the brightest eyes she never understood the world was full of lies each day was met with a sweet embrace always with an innocent smile upon her face i once knew a girl who had a trusting heart to see a tear fall would rip her apart holding her hand out to each person she saw not knowing or caring that each could make her fall i once knew a girl whose spirit was light holding close those around her with all of her might putting her heart out for each person to see the beauty of her spirit was always the key i once knew a girl who lived in my soul she made me feel like i was absolute and whole i lost her somewhere along the way if you find her can you tell her to come back and stay
