woke up in a lovely mood wide awake, refreshed, ready for a good stretch and the rest of my day. felt like a new woman, really giddy and full of beans. the reason for my good mood? dennis from eastenders. oh i know, even if i did meet him i'd be the last woman on earth he'd ever bother with, but the way he treated me in my dream last night. i woke up feeling like an angel, beautiful glow and everything. thinking about it makes me blush right down to me toes.
