well, here it is friday and i've been horribly unemployed for a week and a half now. the money is gone . and karen and i are needing a good bit of money for the security deposit on our new apartment. i also need to round up $200. for car insurance. not to mention that i need to pay $325. for rent on my old placeall by the first of the month. what do i do? i was hoping that someone else would have the answer to that question, as i don't. i already have a loan out from my parents and a friend of mine and karen can't afford to support me too. (not that i want her to, but she offers out of the kindness of her heart)(i've a very lucky person). any suggestions would be good
