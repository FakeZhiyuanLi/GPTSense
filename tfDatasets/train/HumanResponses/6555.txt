i did some yard work late yesterday afternoon. i swear it was only about 40 minutes, but i am so sore today. didn't get enough sleep last night so tried to nap today, but still don't feel rested. finally got a gmail invite this week. and already got 3 invites to give to friends. yay! its nice, its going to be hard changing from eudora to a web based email, but i'll give it a try. i've always given people such a hard time for using those free emails like hotmail, yahoo etc. i feel like a hypocrit.
