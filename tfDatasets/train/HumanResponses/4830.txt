i finally got myself access to the internet after a long 6 months. the first thing that i did was watch the broadcast of the apple world developer's conference 2004 in san francisco. there is nothing in this life that makes me giddier than to watch steve jobs rip on windows and then introduce the new apple products. my wife took one look at me and rolled her eyes. she couldn't believe how excited i got when reading up on the fine hardware that is produced by apple. am i a bit overboard? yeah. but hey, if you aren't passionate about something,. anything,. you might as well drop out of school and apply for byu. if you know what i mean. while i'm sure this blogger entry is lame, i just thought i would give it a try. enjoy it. pacman
