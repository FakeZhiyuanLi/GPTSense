a lot of trailers and sneak peaks coming out of e3 today. i've spent the last hour or so watching as many of them as possible and i must say that the halo 2 multiplayer movies impressed me the most. gotta love the partially destructable vehicles. i wonder if it's still xbox exclusive for two years of whatever like it was with the first one. i sure hope not. i refuse to play games with a stupid gamepad! the new half-life 2 trailer didn't really tickle my fancy. sure, it's probably gonna be awesome, but i just get the feeling we're seeing the same scenes over and over again, just from different angles. counter-strike on the source engine did look kinda cool though. it's weird seeing one of those old maps, but all of a sudden it doesn't look like crap anymore :)
