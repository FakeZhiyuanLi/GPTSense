we were out doing errands to day and hubby and i got coffee, the kids wanted some water to go with their donuts so we asked for a couple of cups. "i am sorry, we only sell bottled water" was the gals comment. we drive up to pay for our stuff and hubby asks again if he could just have a cup of tap water for the kids. she sticks to her story that they can't do that they only sell water. if we were inside the store she could give us tap water. hubby got all snarky and told them he would not be back to this location. that everyone other one in the city doesn't have a problem giving a kid a cup of water. it really pissed me off since we were not just asking for water we were dropping at least 5$ there for other stuff. grrrrr
