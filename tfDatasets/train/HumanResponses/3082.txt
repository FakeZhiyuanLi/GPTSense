i have this urge to get to know my neighbors. they are all in some way, shape or form going through some sort of a crisis. these people are my friends and acquaintances, but i feel like i need to pour myself into them. actually i feel the need to pour jesus' love out on them. what do i mean by that? we know some of them better than others. some we have over for coffee, or we will go and visit every now and then, but i think we need to go deeper. like we are to try to form some more real, close friendships, and somehow help bring healing in their lives. i believe that it is what i am supposed to do. so i am going to try.
