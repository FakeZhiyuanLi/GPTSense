saw shrek 2 tonight, pissa no doubt about it, though i think some of the jokes are just a tad over the 10 yr olds heads. but that's good :d gmail is pretty good, liking it so far, doesn't make huge differences to me because i don't use email a whole lot, biggest gripe atm though; can't apply filters to emails already received and archived! c'mon guys, that's a bit slack, i would imagine that to be a feature that should be incorporated into the filters part of it first up hell, outlook express can do it!
