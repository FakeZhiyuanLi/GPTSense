gawd. my mom won't let my boyfriend come and visit here. she thinks that he is too old and all he wants to do is rape me. if that was so, then why the hell would he tell me something like the time that his grandfather died. i love him so much, but i just cannot understand why my mom won't let him come here! i just want to lay down and cry for a long time. wow, i am depressed again. i thank god for the 26th to com sooner music ~ name - goo goo dolls
