after a lot of troubleshooting yesterday, the sound is working perfectly, and in stereo, might i add. and today, i fixed a few problems. such as the condenser 'choral' mics requiring 9v batteries. they eat them quickly. so, i'm running phantom power now, which seems to be problem with the piano, but i just need to find a way to disable the speaker on the piano really. another problem i have to deal with tomorrow is that we need to add in an echo generater the night of a show. because the wizard just needs to have an echo. i really think the show will be a huge success, or it will at least sound good.
