love of my life you are, sunlight my shining star all of the world to me, all i could ever need. but lately i can feel you've grown away from me so inside i pray it's not too late to find a remedy you don't wanna live a lie, i don't wanna say goodbye so how can i start again, how will my heart mend now here i am alone with only memories and im searching just to find a way to keep you here with me so i close my eyes and go back in time, when our love was strong before our hearts went wrong i keep holding on to how it used to be, so lay me down and take me to a dream dreams that youre holding me, dreams that will never be, visions of loving you, wanting to make them tru i can find myself believing youll come back to me cause i'm trying not to feel the pain that lonliness can bring its so hard to make it through the day without you so i pray for night to dream you're here with me.
