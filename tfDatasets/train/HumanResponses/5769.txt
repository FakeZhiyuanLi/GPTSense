it was a good movie. you should go see it if you haven't already. it was really funny. today was a pretty normal day. i had my cousins over the night before. we got up and ate breakfast and then basically didnt do anything. micheal had to leave and play in the band fora memorial service. so me and brent just hung out. it was pretty cool. we drove the gator and got really muddy. we then jumped on the trampoline. that was kinda cool. then we took him home. i went to kohls then and then went to sams. i went home and slept for a while, then rode the gator, and got really muddy i then tooka shower and got ready to go out. then i went and saw shrek 2. it was really funny. they used some stuff from some older movies so some of the stuff some of the kids didnt understand. well thats all that happened today. i think im gonna go to bed. until next time.
