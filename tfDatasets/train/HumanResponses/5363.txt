ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! i have two days to study for a french final, this is nuts. honestly i think i can pass it as is, but i'm going in with a real strong gpa. i don't want to blow it on a big fat sixty five. i'll see how it goes, but its going to be a struggle. although, my teacher is a real moron, and i think he is reviewing specifically with questions from the final. if he is, i'll be in luck. if not, i'm screwed. anyhow, beyond that, i have a disfunctional counselor, who is so old he can't get anything done. honestly i feel pretty disadvantaged at this school. but there really isn't anything i can do about it. deciding to nerd out as of late and blowing a fat five hundred on a warhammer 40k army. i've gotten away from my nerdy roots in years past but sometimes those old urges still spring up.
