well, it's been a lil while since i have written and i've got alot to write. my feelings are soo mixed up right now. i don't know how to feel really, i mean i know how i should feel. but i just dunno.i think josh is trash and i deserve a hell of alot better then him, but at the same time i still remember good things and those feelings are still there. i mean they arent just gunna go away with the snap of a fingere. i cant even write about it i just i dont even know what to say.
