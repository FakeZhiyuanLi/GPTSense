my mom just got a new computer. so you know what that means? i get her old one. i am currently typing on it. her old computer is fine. it's from 1999, it has a bad battery and it's alt key is missing and the "g" key does not work. yay. *grumbles* for all the "g"'s i have to copy and paste. that is really a pain.
