the first dream was that my little brother brought over season three of the shield on dvd, but it was a poor quality rip from a vcr recording. the second dream is that i was out on the beach with my brother and he went into the water and pulled out a morray eel and attempted to behead it. he only got down to the last string before he stopped and it was still alive and cleaning it's self like a cat. i was pretty disturbed by this so i begged him to finish the job and just put it out of it's misery. i know this one is in connection to the recent beheadings in the middle east.
