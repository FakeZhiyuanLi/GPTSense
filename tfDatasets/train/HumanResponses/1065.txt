believing in fate as time becomes meaningless who would have thought that fairy tales are wishes? my dreams are made reality as the days blur together i am out of sequence i discovered something that was always there and tried to leave behind something that will always be with me forever yours plows through the haze outstanding as the moon in daylight meaning is not matter and my mind's infused with spirit i can feel warmth from the stars i am green with renewal i survive on instinct because thought cannot be trusted and senses are but amusements for caged imagination i long for forever as i clear away the emptiness
