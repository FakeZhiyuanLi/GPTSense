can't get moving today. like a slug. nice and sunny out tho. early afternoon. feel like being in hawaii, lying in the sun but not getting a horrible sunburn. i've never been to hawaii, but lately have been attracted to the '50's kitchsh of it all. well, you know how it is. or perhaps not. perhaps you are highly 'motivated'. i find that i am not. my friend natalie related an image to me, about how her mum would ride (a horse) through pineapple fields when she lived in hawaii. you know, my body's okay, energy wise, it's just my mind. she had a hard week. she wants a day off, and i try to tell her 'tomorrow, just wait till saturday', but she just kind of sits down, staring blankly into space, and passively refuses to get up again. sigh. just one of those days. hope you all getting a bit of this sunshine.
