yesterday i saw quite possibly the most tasteless thing ever so, naturally, i thought i'd share it with you. proudly displayed in the window of a funeral director's shop was a blindingly white coffin with the cross of st. george on all faces and the england football team's badge in the middle of the lid. the sad thing is that there are many people who'd think this is the coolest thing ever and would love to be buried in it. terrifying. truly terrifying.
