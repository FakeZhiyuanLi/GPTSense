[ ost : world filled with love - craig david ] reborn. from failure. from sadness. from bad past. from disappointment. from deep sorrow. from depression. from grief. from misery. the sun'll come out tomorrow bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow there'll be sun! just thinkin' about tomorrow clears away the cobwebs, and the sorrow 'til there's none! when i'm stuck with a day that's gray, and lonely, i just stick out my chin and grin, and say, oh the sun'll come out tomorrow so ya gotta hang on 'til tomorrow come what may tomorrow! tomorrow! i love ya tomorrow! you're always a day a way! (ost of annie, "tomorrow") this post dedicated to 2 persons i love so much. i hope you both can smile happily soon. my prayers adn supports always be with you both.
