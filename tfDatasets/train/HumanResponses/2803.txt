aliens and boredom have taken over my mind. im boredbut anyways. i was just thinking why do relationships have to be so complicated? is hasn't that way with daevion but nothing was with him. adultery, monogamy: the hardest things for any man. the purpose of why i will stay a "single cold superbitch" until the day i die. *thought* why can't people (in general) be what their not?
