i am so smart. s - m - r - t. i mean s - m - a - r - t. la la la la. damn this sucks. i am so bored. and i really dont want to go to this stupid motorcycle training course tonight all the way out in queens. that is going to totally kill my weekend. crap. looks like i am going to have to do work now, because otherwise i am going to get nothing done before i have to go to this stupid class. and yes, it is a good thing that i did not go to math school.
