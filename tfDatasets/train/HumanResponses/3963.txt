just yesterday my dad gave me a detention for two more weeks. and why? just because i installed a new program on the computer and it stopped the computer for a while! and my dad won't even listen to me that it could be something else, because that program was completely safe (by the way, it was the delphi 6). well, it seems that i won't see my computer for those two weeks and i won't be able to continue with my blog for that time >( or i'll just have to go to a internet club and pay 1 euro for hour. i just hope i wont become a mad man trying to suicide himself (the chanses are weak but they still exist), ever since my mom is dead my father is turning my life into a hell.
