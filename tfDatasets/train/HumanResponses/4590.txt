today my best friend told me to let go. i have a serious problem with letting go. after being in denial about 10 minutes, i decided she was right. so join me today in ending our chase for the unattainable, our yearning for ignorance, and our holding on to what we don't need. if i can do better, i know you can. relax, relate, release -whitley gilbert
