day 1.yard work. that's about all there is to say. all day from 8am - 8pm and it's only half done.if anybody ever wants to exercise you are more than welcome to come over and push mow my yard or rake up the grass. it's hell. i think that my next house will have only like a quarter of an acre insead of 2 acres. it impossible to be caught up ever. so day 1 i was dirty, sweaty, and smelly.
