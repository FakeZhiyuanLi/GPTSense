if i don't speak to you during august it might be because i'm in the middle of the holt holiday mission . or perhaps i just don't want to talk to you! this year i'll be leading the mission team solo. which is pretty exciting stuff. it's all based on the john 10:10 verse which is an excellent verse reminding us that being a christian doesn't mean we have to wear sandals and "i love jesus" tshirts and be dull and boring but we can experience life in all its fullness! please pray for good weather and that many kids come along and have an excellent time with all the leaders. oh and pray for the final preparations as well as they're a bit of a long hard slog. things this year seem to be taking forever!
