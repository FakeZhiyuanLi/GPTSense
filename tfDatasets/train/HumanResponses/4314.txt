why am i always attracted to men who are unavailable? mike has great eyes that sparkle when he's flirting (which is frequent). they're sort of greenish-hazel in color. it's easy for me to tell when he's switched to the serious, work mode; but then he switches back to the flirty mode pretty easily. he's very easy-going, which i find really attractive. we're all supposed to get together next tuesday after work for dinner and discussion. maybe my recent fantasies about him will materialize? until then, i'll just go to bed and fantasize more. sigh.
