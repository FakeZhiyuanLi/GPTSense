re-reading the last lines, they sound very poetic to me, however, i guess that i'd rather them not sound so poetic and get orestes in symbiosis with our broadband working. you cant have everything indeed and so i have to be satisfied with presenting the artistic side of self and be patient. and perhaps i do prefer writing poetic stuff to the boradband working. mmm. its orestes i dont want to be parted with.
