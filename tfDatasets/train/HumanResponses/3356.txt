today was horrible, i was hoping to go to student life 101 for so long but i just had to get the stomach flu! i still went but i felt lousy all day and i couldnt pay too much attnetion to the presenstations. i was puking and going to the washroom every 45 mins and i had diarrhea :/ . as always just my luck. i did get to see the campus again though, however i didnt take the tour of st jeromes. i picked up my watcard and calculus textbook and my picture looks like a mugshot, perfect :d. hopefully the same wont happen later when i move into st jerome's
