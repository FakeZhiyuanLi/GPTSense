is it that everyone feels the same or is it just me? it seems that age is some outside game. i am the same me i was when i was 7 still waiting to grow up. it seems that the world is crazy running past me with a mind spinning speed, looking sort of back on me (who is out of breath dragging behind). is age an idea in consciousness or a reality i am to accept? is it that the one who is meant to be hung will not drown? should i make effort to preserve and improve the body or should i leave within the waves of conventions? after all what fun it is to be well and alive when all your friends are gone, and no one remembers your favorite movie star? haven't you yourself looked at a granny sporting low rise jeans with pity?
