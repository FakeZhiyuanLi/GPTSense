i'm watching some pics my friend took while we were in jakarta for our school trip. but at the same time, i'm watching the w-inds another paradise pv. if you ask me, i think watching w-inds is more worth it. i'll see my friends soon when the school holidays end. but will everything be the same again? will lisa still like me? would the friendship between jess and i really break? gosh, i'm so stupid thinking like this, right? i mean, who cares? if lisa doesn't like me, i still have mandy and meggy, right? no, i won't they have themselves, becky has jess, i can forget about ami, she's off to germany and athi's going to the iskl *sigh*. it's gonna be a great year, but who cares? i won't care what others say anymore. i did too many mistakes last year. i won't make the same mistakes again. i feel kinda weird at the moment. current mood: weird (don't ask me why) current music: w-inds - super lover ~i need you tonight~ ( absolutely love the pv of this song)current colour: blue!
