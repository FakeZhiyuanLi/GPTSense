superman is one tough man but this one, not only is he tough he has a lot of strength (in so many meanings!) he is up every night saving the helpless. saving (some) people from their loneliness. one day (or night) i got to talk to him how he was nice! from then on. he has always been there my company. on my days and his nights he is funny! he is skinny! he is friendly! and most of the time he is tipsy! but whatever it is that he does the important thing for me is that he is a friend to me and to don it's him.our superian
