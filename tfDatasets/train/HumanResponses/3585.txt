haha, this shows how different i am! ok, when i'm older i'd love to own a bar, be the original coyote, like on coyote ugly. i want to have the girls dancing on the bad, the fire get lit on the bar counter, play the devil went down to georgia and some i wanna be a cowwwwboy music and just it just be a crazy as hell bar! then.i want a very cozy small coffee/juice bar hosue and have open gig night and people come and put their artwork on display and poetry and it be always a lot of regulars. i'd like it to be like a nice place for people to just go and sort out their thoughts. i picture like big red comfy sofas, little wooden tables and lamps and it be set up like it's a nice town in italy, like the walls be brick and just have the scenery of italy, street lamps, flowers, alley look, etc. it will just be a very art influenced enviroment. so yeah, a nice relazing cozy enviroment, art infuenced, and then a crazy as hell, fun, wild enviroment, infuenced by part'ay animals! haha
