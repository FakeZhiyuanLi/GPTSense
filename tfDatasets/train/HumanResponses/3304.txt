rats freak alot of people out. this is dumb. i have a pet rat name diablo (spanish for angel), who you can check out below. his favorite hobbies are sniffing and scampering. lol. sort of. diablo's way cool and doesn't carry any diseases that i know of. in conclusion, and i'm serious here folks, rats are completely safe and way off the hook. p.b. (post blog) give me a holler at the end of this message if you want more glossies of diablo.
