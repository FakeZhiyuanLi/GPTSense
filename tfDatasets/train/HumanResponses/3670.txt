so, i'm siiting here in the office, writing a blog and eating sherbert lemons after getting back from a smike rehearsal. there is less than a week to go and i am scared sh1tless. i hope i don't mess up. wish me luck! i had a huge long post to write (3 sides of a5) but it wasn't meant to be, because i seem to have lost it. oh well. i love sherbert lemons, do do do! i am very pleased with the responce to my new blog, but i think i might change. i think i might be indecisive, but i'm not quite sure. did anybody watch big brother? there was a fit guy in a th0ng, but i'm sure that would've been enough to inspire patrick to watch it, but the ever-cynical patrick probably hates it. he's so fit. the guy in the th0ng i mean not patrick. see ya. i love y'all
