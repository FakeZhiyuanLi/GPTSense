there's been so much going on lately, i don't know where to start. it's weird. i don't really have anything to complain about, but at the same time, it feels like everything is about to fall apart. i've always had big dreams. ambitions if you will. i have never doubted these things until recently. i've always thought that anything could be accomplished with enough hard work, but now i'm realizing how much what i want depends on others as well. i just want to give some people a loving punch in the face to wake them up. it's like they don't see how much we're connected, and how much their actions effect me as well. but i can't make them change. so what do i do? i don't really feel like anything i say seeps in. i either feel like giving up, or finding someone else who i can trust before moving on. i just need some wisdom concerning some decisions that i need to make very soon.
