today after breakfast, a boy from the paces (behavior issues) program lost control! he threw rocks at the windows of the pool building, breaking several of them. now the pool needs to be drained to remove all the glass from the pool! after he did that, he went into the quad 1 garden and broke the bird bath. he ripped out the sign that my students took so long to make and threw it across the grass. he is responsible to pay for all the damages. his parents are going to be paying big bucks!
