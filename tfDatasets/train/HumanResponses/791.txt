well, i don't have too much to say. me and kris are going to hang out on saturday so that should prove to be special. also, my dad's cousin and her family are coming up to visit for about a week, so that should be cool. i haven't seen them in like 10 years. me and matt have been hanging out a lot, and me and jen, since they live like right near me and i can bike or walk to their houses. me and matt went fishing yesterday and i caught a lot of seaweed. oh, by the way matt, i commented on your comment (finally) and i'm sorry it took so long. well, nothing else to say, so byebye.
