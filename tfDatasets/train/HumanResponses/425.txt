today is your last day.it was nice having you asa teacheri do have a good book. i didn't get it from the library, i don't like our library and there is too much temptation to lose it. i think the 10 guidelines helped me alot. what helped the most was pickinh out specific details. thanks, and can't wait to see you in the lab.
