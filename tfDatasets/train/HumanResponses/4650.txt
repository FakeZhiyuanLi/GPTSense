thats right, first post on my birthday. this year i didn't make any new years resolutions so i'm making some for my birthday. here they are in no particular order, well, other than the fact that they are going to be on a numeric list: 1. finish at least 3 films this year. 2. write more. (hence this blog!) 3. train to run in next years music city marathon. 4. let the people in my life know that they matter. 5. stop whining it's a pretty short list but then again life is pretty good right now. i will try to update this at least once a day. hopefully i'll get into a groove and feel more comfortable with it in the near future.
