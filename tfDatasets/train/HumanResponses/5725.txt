sometimes i wonder if anybody ever has understood what project management is all about! as long as we do forward scheduling with a deadline in mind and execute tasks sequentially we should logically be getting there on time but that seldom happens! is there any reason for us to believe that project scheduling ever works. yes it does, but only in cases where the resources are only machines, humans are either too complicated or too stupid to stick to a schedule and when they do try to do that, they act like dumb machines! so we probably need to start considering backward scheduling with human behavior in mind rather than forward scheduling treating humans as machines.
