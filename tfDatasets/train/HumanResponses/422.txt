current obsession: makena'lei gordon carnahan i think it's a very beautiful name. i'm all for unusual names, as long as they are actually names. using your child to make a statement, that ain't right. makena'lei i like, it's unusual w/o saying "look at me. i came up with a f***ed up name." knew she'd be gettin' her father's name in there somewhere. total daddy's girl.
