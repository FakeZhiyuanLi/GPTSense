so brad called the other day. i could start every blog that way, couldn't i? let me just say that he is the strangest person i know. most people have that thing in their brain that keeps them from saying certain things. not brad. so when i said, "i was bored at work. i didn't have anything to do," he says without hesitation, "damn, me too! i should have called you so we could beat off together." um. what?! brad gets the quote of the day, too: "you are dead to me now. lucky for you, i'm into necrophilia."
