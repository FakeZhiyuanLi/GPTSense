in the spirit of wonko the sane, here's a quote i have found in my 'cubicle hell' desktop calendar: an actual tip from page 16 of the hp "environmental health safety handbook for employees": blink your eyelids periodically to lubricate your eyes. for more information on wonko the sane and where the asylum is, i suggest reading the hitch hiker's guide to the galaxy's fifth book in the trilogy, mostly harmless, or you can also read the instructions on a packet of toothpicks.
