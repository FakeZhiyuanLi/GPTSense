well, i just wanted to make one more post before i go to bed. not much to say, though. actually, i might not go to bed. i haven't quite decided yet. i probably will, though. whatever. i don't have anything better to do. i'm supposed to go to katy's tomorrow for her birthday, and i don't think i can go. she's gonna kill me. ok, well, i'm going to either go to bed or find something to do, now. current music: elton john - your song
