just thinking about my homework remaining, and i was bloody scared. so much homework left and my re draft due on tuesday. haven't even finished the experiments yet. shyt. i must try and finish as much as possible of my hw today. hopefully kuang is not reading this. she says that we have not much homework even though she has given us piles. two essays, one project and one debate. wtf. this is bad. i also have to do chem creative assignment. anywae, no lamenting now. let's talk about my overseas exchange trip to perth. me and a guy called yue hao went to perth for the first two weeks of the june holidays. it was damn fun there. i wuld love to be in their school. it is way more slack and fun. our school's size is mincemeat compared to it. wth. ggs is a pro school, man. the guys i stayed with had a farm bigger than s'pore. wth. it was extremely fun there. anywae, bye for now guys, thanks for reading and putting up with my self-pity. supersonic
