it's raining hard. cold too, perhaps too cold. i can't help myself from thinking of her, dang. there is something amiss. some psychoanalists say that when you fall in love you suffer from temporary insanity, haa. probably the control-freak side of me just can't accept that. ha haa, i kinda smile when i can't stop thinking of her with me , through rain or sunshine. i pity people who love. oh yeah, here's something to think of "the greatest thing you'll ever learn; is to fall in love , and be loved in return"
