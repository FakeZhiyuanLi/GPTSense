i've been searching for you i heard a cry within my soul i've never had a yearning quite like this before know that you are walking right through my door all of my life where have you been i wonder if i'll ever see you again and if that day comes i know we could win i wonder if i'll ever see you again a sacred gift of heaven for better worse, wherever and i would never let somebody break you down until you cried, never all of my life where have you been i wonder if i'll ever see you again and if that day comes i know we could win i wonder if i'll ever see you again at every time i've always known that you where there, upon your throne a lonely queen without her king i longed for you, my love forever  all of my life where have you been i wonder if i'll ever see you again and if that day comes i know we could win i wonder if i'll ever see you again ~ lenny kravitz
