today was my first day of summerschool and it sucked. its two hours a class so that seriously sucked. it is so annoying cause i have a teacher that thinks that hes cool but hes not. on the way home from school my dad and i started fighting over nothing so i said i wouldnt talk to him anymore but well see how that works out. crespi's pretty cool. julian goes there so at least im not alone. i problably wouldnt go to crespi if julian wasnt going but whatever. 24 more horrible days left damnit i cant wait. football practice starts on july 12 so that will be pretty cool. something to look forward to. but they might move me up to varsity. that would be alot more fun.
