hmmm what should i write first of all i should just write down why i created a blog. am i following a trend? should i also have a blog because thousands of people around the world keep one. or i wanted a place where i could write what i feel sometimes and am not able to let it out. i dont know but i guess ill find out once i start blogging (is this the right word) regularly. okie i would just like to give a warning, you might not find this blog updated for days, maybe weeks. i know you must be saying "why keep a blog when u dont want to update it?". ahh but thats what im trying to find out "why in the blazes im starting a blog". one more thing i misspell a lot :) so dont mind if you see numerous errors in my posts. i guess this is all i would like to write for now. i hope i keep on blogging. have fun, take care pixel pusher
