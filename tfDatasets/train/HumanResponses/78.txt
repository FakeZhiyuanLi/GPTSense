don't you just hate the utmost totalitarian type of education we get in school? i do and i am rather pissed about it. my math teachers decided that today was officially pricks anonymous day. he got all upset when he said "we have a lot of work to do today", and i then repeated "we always have lots of work to do". he immediately became quite intimidating and started demanding i leave the classroom. its as if the only reason teachers become that but teachers is so they can have total control over students, its utter bullshit. oh well none the less this just goes to show how unforgiving education can be. damn and i was hoping the world was still a somewhat reasonably sane place.
