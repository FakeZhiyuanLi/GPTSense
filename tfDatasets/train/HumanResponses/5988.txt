aargh. sunday evening descended into a familiar pit of misery, not helped by carter's girlfriend losing her baby on er. i knew it was going to happen; the programme announcer advised me to have tissues at the ready. but i ignored her, at my peril, and wiped my eyes on my sleeve. and work today and i managed a whole 47 minutes of it before giving up and coming home. i think it was the news that there was to be a fire drill that did it. all the kids troop out, get told they were too loud or too slow, and then get sent back in to do it all over again. i can't help but wonder if they would do that in the event of a real fire; 'i don't care if it's hot! get back in there, and this time do it quietly!' fire safety officers - bless them.
