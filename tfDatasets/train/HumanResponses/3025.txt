being a full-time worker is starting to take it's toll somewhat not in terms of energy or anything but in terms of takin over my everyday life. i miss hanging out with everyone in the common room i haven't heard from some people at all in the 2 weeks i've been gone but at least this experience has shown me who my real friends are really the ones that really give a damn. i think i'm going to have to sacrifice a day a week or so and just set it aside to catch up with friends because otherwise i think i might not be able to handle it that well. i suppose one upside is that i'm going to be getting used to what others are going to have to adjust to next year still i have no idea how long it's gonna take me to get used to this and it's only been a few weeks. i no longer have 2 days off this week i only have friday so i intent to make the most of it maybe go and see some of my friends or hopefully go out that night if anythings going down it's been a few weeks since i done that.
