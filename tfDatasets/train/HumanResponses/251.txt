i am online, so i thought i would write something in this here journal thingy. scott and i headed along to the sta travel information night at the hilton. it was smaller than i thought it would be, but useful nonetheless. we spoke to a chick from contiki who answered our questions. and i decided which travel alarm clock i want to buy - yes, a big decision was made tonight! it's funky and it has a thermometer! yay! plans for this week: go to yha travel and join yha and book contiki tour!
