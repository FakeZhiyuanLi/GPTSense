england's out, argh! i get to watch my first match of the [euro 2004] and i see my favourite team getting busted!? and the refree didn't allow england's second goal! unfair, even if the ball only just crossed the line it did anyway! the refree's biased! scores as follows: england - owen (3) and lampard (115 et); portugal - postiga (83), rui costa (110 et). penalty shootout, portugal win 6-5. david beckham seems to have a problem with penalties recently. i'm guessing it's all the bad publicity he's been getting. but never mind, becks! we're all for you!
