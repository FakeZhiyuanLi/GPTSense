wow.yet another normal day. i finished my english paper this morning. chilled and played some games. played with jessica (platonically, you perv!), memorized my lines for forumor at least some of them. fished for a while. rinse. repeat. i need to wash that. strange tingling sensation. what exactly makes something sharp cut you? as i talk with one of my friends whose weekend consisted of going out with friends and having a good time without feeling guilty about it, i ask myself a very important question: do i want to live a boring life because i'm smart and realize that in the long run it won;t be worth it or would i rather live life to the fullest and make the most of every day, not worrying about the repercussion but instead milking the moment for every sweet drop of pleasure it's worth. damn.i need to wash that.
