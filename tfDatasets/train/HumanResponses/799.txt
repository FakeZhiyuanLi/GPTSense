where is my damned wallet? i couldn't find my stupid keys today. i woke up from a beautiful nap with plenty of time to walk to class but my keys decided to hole up in a bag of unpacked luggage. the stupid thing is as the minutes ticked down and finally reached 3:30 (class time) i honestly thought about just skipping the whole thing to avoid being "late." i hate being known as the late guy well.i hate it as much as someone who is to lazy to hate can hate. i'm a grad student and i still have this mental compulsion that was blasted into my brain by psycho-nazi-professors who think its a personal afront that i wouldn't show up to there class on time everyday. this is a stupid problem to have.oh.there's my wallet. taco bell here i come. woohoo!
