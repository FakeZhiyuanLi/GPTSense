i woke up today and everything seemed perfect, but as the day passed, little incidents occured, very little, but a lot of them, mean classmates, embarrasing moment in the cafeteria, lots of homework, boring classes, a chewgum stuck in my braces >. note to self: never eat chewgum again as long as i have these stupid braces, it took me like an hour to take it off!
