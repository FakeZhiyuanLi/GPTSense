look up look down look all around. another day for me lusting and acting like another person to this stranger of mine. this stranger has an empty hole for someone to fill, so i've learned. if he only knew i could be that filling . if he only knew i lusted this badly for him. lusting for someone is hard  wanting someone from the past is impossible  it's undying to me.taken over half of my thoughts, i need him, want him, oh do i wish he knew. these feeling i have aren't serene, they are bogus to another, it's real and it's an obession of mine. can't help that stalking, do i call it that, no, i call it an obession despite all this agony of these thoughts of this old stranger, it feels good to know that he needs something like me chances for me are slim, they always are  knowing this man is still out there searching, he will know it's been me all the while
