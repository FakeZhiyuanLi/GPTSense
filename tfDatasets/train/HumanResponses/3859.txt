grr.my landlords just wanna piss me off don't they? well, my dad was okay today. i'm not as mad with him as i was yesterday. but my mum.grr. all she wants to do is wallow in self pity and scream at me. she thinks that she's the only one with a troubled life. but because of her troubled life (and of course my fathers), i have a troubled life. see, my father was raised in a middle class family where he was tought that love just gets in the way of everything. so the only we he shows his emtion is by screaming them at me and my fellow tennent when it all just gets to hard to keep inside. this is a.lets just call it.yearly volcano. my mum came from a really high class and rich family who spoiled her rotten. and now, they are both fighting and on the verge of a divorce (which i hope so badly for) and they're pulling me into it. telling me to take sides. pissing at each other behind they're back to me. i hate it. i hate them. i hate life. the landlords want renttaliho!
