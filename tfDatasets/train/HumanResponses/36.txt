typical boring day at work. having some trouble with shtty css implementation, nothing worth bothering abuot though. found an old site that is well funny (tardblog.com). unofrtunatley it seems to have been taken down but you can still get to it on archive.org. spent some time looking for old sites i had done. steve sent me the new alien vs predator trailer, cant wait to see that. went home and installed avp 2 again, will have to try and arrange some deathmatch fun. shame the tardblog went down, was worth a giggle
