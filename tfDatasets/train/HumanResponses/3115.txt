60 minutes in-line skating just got back from skating for about an hour with doug and wendy. nice to have some company, though it's hard to carry on really good conversations with having to skate in single file. found a great little coffee shop on leary that's right near where i end my skating. the woman working there was super sweet and she makes good coffee. i'll head back there, especially since she doesn't mind if we come in on skates. quads are much happier today. i guess i'm getting used to it.
