friends what is a friend ? is a friend who backstabs you ? a friend who lies to you ? or a friend who used you for his own will ? a friend is a person who you can really trust no matter good or bad times a friend is always there a person who will be next to you when there is a need of care. what more can a friend be ? in life we needs friends. we can't live our life all by ourselves. if we do why bother living anyway ? trust is not can't be bought but it is earn. so if you want your friends to trust you, you got to earn it from them and they will earn your trust too. love your neighbours as yourself and love your enemies more. if your love people who loves you only, what is the reward ? remember life on earth is uncertain, is there any of your friends that you want to tell them that you care for them ? nonetheless, choose your friends wisely because friends are people who influence you or you influencing them. well keep this is in mind and take care. -kevin-
