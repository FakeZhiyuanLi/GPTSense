"sorry . i don't know why this is happening. all i know is, i miss the times that we were happy. we were. i guess the situation really wasn't on our side. i hope i could just go back to the days when you kinda missed me too. you know, it's so funny that i know i need you now more than ever but i have to go because you want me too. i want you back , but i don't know how. i need you that much i know. again i am sorry, for i can't help myself missing you." i recalled this letter. i probably just don't know . or maybe i know better.
