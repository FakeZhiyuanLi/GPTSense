i'll bet joe frazier wouldn't have needed the help of two kids to throw out the opening pitch. and is a draft dodger really appropriate to trot out in a time of war? does anyone at major league baseball actually listen to the performers before they sing the national anthem? that had to be the worst since the all star game two years ago. do you think roger clemens is blaming mike piazza this morning? will mike piazza say something about clemens? will clemens fire a fastball at piazza to "thank" him for being a distraction behind the plate rather than just catching the ball? will piazza claim that if roger didn't shake him off constantly he might have given up only a couple of runs? why didn't ben sheets pitch earlier? will ron belliard end up being the fattest 2nd baseman anywhere? he looks me playing 2nd base. hey ronnie, see reuben stoddard over there? that's your future, and i bet you can't sing.
