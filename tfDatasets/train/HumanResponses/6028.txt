when you look at me, what id it you see? is it my strength, my pride, my will. or is it my hurt, my pain, my skill. is it my knowledge, my joy, my faith. or is it my fear, my anger, my hate. is it my kindness, my warmth, my honesty. or is it my guilt, my abuse, my jealousy. is it my beauty, my happiness, my smile. or is it colour, my ugliness, my style. is it my loyalty, my success, my intelligence. or is it my pass, my mistake, my resentment. is it my respect, my individuality, my gratitude. or is it my defense, my failure, my attitude. is it my sensitivity, my patience, my confidence. or is it my temper, my animosity, my ignorance. is it my dreams, my hopes, my fame. or is it my struggle, my despair, my shape. when you look at me tell me, what do you see?
