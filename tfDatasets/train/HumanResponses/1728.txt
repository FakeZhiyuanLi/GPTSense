when i cried myself to sleep last night- i knew you weren't worth it. but that didn't change the fact that my eyes are puffy, red and swollen as a souveniur from this morning. i thought this last discussion would figure things out, rather than make them worse. but now we both know i don't know the slightest thing about you. and now we both know these last 8-9 months have been a waste, but we've yet to acknowledge that fully. when you told me you wanted someone to truly know you, but i couldn't be that person, was when i regretted everything about you. is this it? i'd like to think he'd give me another chance. but i know that now is the time to turn around, and not look back. current music: between love and hate | the strokes
