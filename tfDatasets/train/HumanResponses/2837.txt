that movie was great. kinda predictable but great none the less. my girlfriend thought it would be too much of a guy movie and its too bad she's in maryland for the weekend because it has an underlying love story to it. its not nearly as much of a guy movie as she would have thought. the movie was really predictable, every little thing foreshadowed something else and it was always the obvious. maybe its because all natuaral disaster movies are close enough to the same, i dunno. i just thought that the movie was really nicely done. special effects were nicely done as well, and i certainly hope so for as much as it cost (i don't know exactly other than in the hundreds of millions).
