i'm sitting here in the anacortes starbucks. thanks to the guys at garnet web, i get wi-fi here. i'm on a bit of a break before work. it's nice here, probably somewhere around 80. seems just about right after being in walla walla. oh, well, whatever. i talked to maggie this morning, she's returning a bracelet she got for graduation from her parents. it's really nice, but she doesn't really wear bracelets and she wants to have something she'll wear a lot. she's looking at rings and necklaces. the bracelet is either white gold or platinum (i didn't find out for sure), and had like .9 carets of diamonds, so it wasn't cheap. lucky girl. well, that's about it for now. yoga wasn't so great this morning. i think i'll keep looking, maybe i'll end up getting a video and do it at home, we'll see. well, have a good one!
