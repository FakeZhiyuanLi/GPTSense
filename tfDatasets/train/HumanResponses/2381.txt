so now that the rush of going to press is over, i can return to my other passion- searching fruitlessly in a savage city for an apartment i can afford. in a hopelessly trendy area. okay, okay, i will take three blocks away from said trendy area. i can walk it when i need a cup of artesian-blended coffee. what i won't be able to take is when williamsburg hits the shitter and everyone is flooding queens, and i won't be able to get my currently un-fabulous apartment back. my big bone to pick is that i was born within city limits, i suffered through the public schools, and i currently pay out my nose tax after tax, and i can't stay. i won't be able to raise my unconcieved/unborn children here. how can i ensure that they grow up as wise and cynical as me if they are playing in a fenced-in yard all their lives? in pennsylvania?
