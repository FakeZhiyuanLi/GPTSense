through it all i've grown a bit too apathetic towards academic records. it doesn't even matter how good or how bad i did- it only matters that its over. sure, i'll pay for my lack of effort this summer, as my parents will have their say. but somehow it doesn't seem so bad now. just two more days around the people i love, people i hate, and those i really should have got to know better. just two more days of ultimately meaningless analysis of my over stressed cranial capacity. just two more days of waking up everyday to be greated by a friendly smile and head nod. you know, i don't think it has full force hit yet. and when it does, i'm afraid. i've grown so used to the routine, the swing of things. but we'll start again next year- a new route, teachers, classes and most likely a lot of new faces. {i'll try and smile back} current music: konstantine | something corporate
