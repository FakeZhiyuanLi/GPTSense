well right now i am about to eat (yum) so i will make this a bit shorter than normal especially becauce i had a boring day. i woke up at 6:30 am :( and i at some breakfast and started to fiddle with my computer trying to get the network/internet in our new house to work. i had to work till noon cutting up the hundreds of boxes we used to move which is ok because i love my sharp knife :p the rest of the day i spent trouble shooting my home network trying to get it working with wep encryption which most people will not know.
