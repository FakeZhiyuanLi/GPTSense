we just got back from sawyer brown, and i have to be honest.i was kind of disappointed. i was really expecting a better performance. i was also extremely disappointed that they sang a few cover songs. when you go to a concert, you don't expect to hear covers, instead, you are paying to hear their music. and you would think that with 23 years of history, they would have enough songs to last the night! oh, well. i will just place this in my list of "time that i wish i could get back but never will category"! however, on a good note, they have cool t-shirts and hats!
