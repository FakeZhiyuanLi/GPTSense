well, after meeting becky, i must say, i'm very impressed. she sort of strikes me as a nitemare hippie girl to quote the song, but she quite lovely really, it'll be interesting to see where this one goes as i really would like to have a relationship with her. the nitemare hippie girl is an imperative choice in ones list of lovers, fortunately, she's a clean hippie, and seems to really tolerate my insanity well. i'll go for a hike with her weekend after next, that'll rule.
