ok. sweet child o'mine has landed safely, and informs me that it is very hot. so i send back good wishes and sun cream warnings and lots of motherly love. and i am here with just the 2.4 kids (cat equals 0.4 of a kid, in this equation), feeling a bit like a truck with a wheel missing. so i get them videos and video games and sweets, and it still feels very odd. and i am left wondering if: - a) it is entirely normal to miss a child this much? and b) especially when its only a holiday! it's not like she died, or even left home - she's only gone for two weeks! i can't help thinking i need to get out more.
