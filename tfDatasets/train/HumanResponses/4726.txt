i can't believe it's almost the 4th of july already. here come the tourists, en masse. the plan? stay out of dc. but i hate holidays anyway, including this one. i'd rather just sleep through the whole damn weekend and pretend it doesn't exist. does that make me a bad person? or just sad and pathetic? i'm not sure.
