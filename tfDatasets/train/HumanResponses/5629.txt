toady i had a troublsome day. i had to prepare for a barbecue on sunday. my mom is throwing one for all her friends that helped her through the loss of her husband. at the same time i was trying to arrange a party on saturday. so far everything is looking good. i am throwing my own goodbye party because i'm moving and nobody i know as any organization skills. at least not as good as mine.
