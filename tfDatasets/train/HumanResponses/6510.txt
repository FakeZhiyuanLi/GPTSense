preparing for a meeting with a big customer in the morning. they want me to explain their invoices. this would be easy if their invoices were how they were supposed to be, but for whatever reason, the corrections i made to their account just before the last invoice run are now not there. i've got to go and eat humble pie and say sorry, we'll credit this one and re-invoice. i hate meetings where i go in knowing we're in the wrong. the guy i meeting with is a nice bloke though, i just hope his sidekick isn't there, he's a pain in the backside.
