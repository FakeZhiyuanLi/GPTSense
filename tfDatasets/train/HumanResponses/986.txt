2day after sepak takraw com me n my frens went bowling at cdan. oh sad case man, only got 34 points!(ahhhhhh) now i noe bowling is not tt easy after all. quite a number of shots went down the drain. oh well looks lyk i need more partice. after tt i went 2 watch the air rifle com. louis was a professional. almost every shot was near the bull's eye. wat i cant believe is that acsi team can shot 1623 out of 1800 (kena shock: 1623). this means trt every target must be at least 8 or 9 to score that. omg thats almost impossible loh unless u r in the air rifle team. anyway i saw quite a few ppl who r also very good. a gal from nygh in the first lane did quite well. i have to leave at 4 so could not watch the whole competition. all i can is pray that we win.( hope so cause mr goh will wish we win :) )
