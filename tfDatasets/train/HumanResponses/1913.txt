wake up dazed, confused realizing the world around you was yesterday but a dream? or was it a sign of things to come? watch mr. coffee sereve you your life in a cup drip drip drip. my face staes back at me from the dark brown puddle not at me, through me pondereing over the origin of my place i soon realize, i have no memory of the past six months was it even there? you were there.
