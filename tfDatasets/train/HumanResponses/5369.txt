one shock keeps following the next. i imagined that both of the girls really liked me, and misa told me again that her niece was terribly excited and always kept saying that i was such a cool guy. so far so good. but the clue is that the niece in fact has a boyfriend and rejected my e-mail-address because she is afraid of her boyfriend. but then why did she want to talk to me all the time on monday, saying that she wants to have fun with me in japan and asking if i had a girlfriend and if i am willing to make one in japan?!. i'm terribly confused. but furthermore misa also chatted with some guy about 6 (!) hours always telling me that she doesn't have time now. why do girl always keep playing with me? but well, who cares - now it's my turn to fool women. i will try to no longer be the sweet and faithful guy and will try to still make them believe that i am. well, this might be hard work, but. it's my turn to strike back.
