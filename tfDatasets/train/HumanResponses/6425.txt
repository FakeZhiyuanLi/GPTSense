i want to have food in the house. i'm tired of always being hungry. i want the bills to be paid. i'm tired of going to the movies instead of paying bills. i want to be less sweaty. i'm tired of all the heat i want to go to oregon. i miss my home, my friends. i want to laugh more. i'm lonely i want to be single. i can't spend all my time with one person. i want to smell the beautiful trees of the west coast. i want out.
