i joined a site where you get to role-play as a a student of hogwarts. you get top attend classes with all the other ppl on the site, and by ur participation you advance through the years and meet more and more ppl and learn more and more things. well i registered and began to make my character when i had to go. so i went back on the next day and it was down. so i treid again the next day, it was down, so i tried again today, and it had an announcement. turns out the hosting server took the creators money and ran off. so now there is a crisis. the database may be lost along with everyones characters. this can be a good thing and a bad thing. the good is i will have a chance to gow and advance with everyone. the bad thing is many ppl were about to graduate and had over 1000 posts. but we'll see what happens
