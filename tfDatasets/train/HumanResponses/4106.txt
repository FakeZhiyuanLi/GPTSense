well me and praw hav started a riding thingy jus like the badminton thing we started as well.well we just ride around the river wen we get time.this time we went around the long-way.that's from the south perth foreshore to the graham farmer bridge in burswood, winding through east-perth, outside trinity, on the perth foreshore on riverside dve, then on the narrows bridge and back to the south perth foreshore.we normally hav 2 routes the long way and short.roughly the record for the short was is just less than half an hour and for the long way, which we've only done once is 41 minutes. we've been trying to go early in the morning to try keep cool and to ride while there are less ppl on the roads etc.
