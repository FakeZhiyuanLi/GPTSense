it's the middle of summer and i can't sleep, i haven't talk to my friends in a while i wonder what they been up to. anyways i've leaned something this summer about me. one thing being why i feel depressed and why i get irritate easily. i've discovered that when i'm not with a crowd of people i don't feel depressed or get irritate easily. which is like my brother which sucks because all school is a crowd of basically adults acting like 6 year olds.
