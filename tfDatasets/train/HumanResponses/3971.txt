and wilt thou have me fashion into speech the love i bear thee, finding words enough, and hold the torch out, while the winds are rough, between our faces, to cast light on each ? i drop it at thy feet. i cannot teach my hand to hold my spirit so far off from myselfmethat i should bring thee proof in words, of love hid in me out of reach. nay, let the silence of my womanhood commend my woman-love to thy belief, seeing that i stand unwon, however wooed, and rend the garment of my life, in brief, by a most dauntless, voiceless fortitude, lest one touch of this heart convey its grief (sonnets from the portuguese, by elizabeth barrett browning)
