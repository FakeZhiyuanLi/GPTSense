i told myself i would not fall victim to their tricks. i tried solidifying this when the manager told me i could "pick any color you like while me and your dad play with the number." look.i'm not twelve. i am aware of your tactics. so i drove, and the awkwardly large salesperson talked about the radio. he put it on "nasty girl" at first. i wanted to shoot myself in the knees. that would be less painful than that. don't get me wrong, i love "crazy in love", but really.come on. anyways, he finally asked me what i listen to, and he actually knew what channel the college station was on! so, i fell, just like i said i wouldn't. i was fratrinizing with the enemy. i hate people. the exsistance of men is only a myth.
