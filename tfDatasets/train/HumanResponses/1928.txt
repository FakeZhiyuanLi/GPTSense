so i'm back for an update. this weekend was actually pretty good. some company was over on saturday, so i didn't just sit around mindlessly all day. i ate one of the biggest hamburgers i've ever seen in my entire life for dinner. this thing was massive, when it was sitting on the barbecue i even asked if it was a steak! i managed to almost eat the whole thing though, i was pretty hungry. today was ok as well i guess. i went out with my dad and sister. she and my dad insisted on seeing spider-man, so we did. then i bought a really cool dream theater album, it's one of their best, and it was only 10 bucks! one last thing before i end this. i'm more than likely seeing fear factory on august 3rd! that's gonna be one hell of a sweet show! i'm looking forward to it too, because a friend of mine has already been to the opera house and says that it has a great sound system. nice!
