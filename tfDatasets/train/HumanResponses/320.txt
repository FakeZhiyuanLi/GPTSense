i collect those muppet show dvd's, y'know the ones with three episodes on each dvd. just got the one where brooke shields, diana ross, and rudolph nureyev guest. the rudolph nureyev episode is pretty funny. there is also this added scene where this muppet is singing how he is incomplete without his loved one. it is a really sweet if somewhat strange little song. y'all (who ever happens to come across this blog) should go out and get it. really entertaining.
