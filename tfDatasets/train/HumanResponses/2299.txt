can you see through the things that are impure? destiny, fate, should you let yourself beleive? my mind cannot desipher the signals, confused, confused. a circle we go around in becuase we dare not stop it. stupified as if by the stare of medusa herself. does it exsist? love in the truest, most pure of forms? fuck-bitch, you've played the prodigal whore a thousand times, maybe you are becoming what you never wanted to be, maybe you were always that girl. breathe in and fill your lungs with the breath of staleness, that is where you are right now, in a room full of stale air and everything is old and overstuffed and if you were to breathe in that putrid air, surely, you would choke. no one is in there with you, you are alone but the whole world knows you are in that stale room. no one moves, "hold your own" they say, if it doesn't kill you then surely.
