today, i talked to the walkie talkie when i am alone, when i can't find anyone to talk to when the world left me alone, sighing when it began to rain when i feel lonely when desperation hits me hard when the time, i need to hide my feeling when there is nobody listen to me when i feel sad i talked to the walkie talkie. my words, my thoughts, my feelings, my unhappiness, my sadness, are sent out with the radio signal. sent to unknown places, or maybe they are all sent to thin air. did you hear me? i guess not. they all gone into the thin air. no matter how long i talked to the walkie talkie. it will forever be dumb. it will only listen but never understand. when i talked about myseld so much did you hear me? did you understand me? i hope it is a "yes" but i know it is a "no" another rainy day, i hold my tears and it shed for me. i stand in the rain, nobody can see, i am crying. can you hear what i said? i hope so.
