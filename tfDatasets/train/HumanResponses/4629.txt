finally got itunes to accept payments from my visa card. unfortunately annette has discovered how easy it is to rebuild her audio tape collection using downloads, so i'm considering cancelling my visa card - there're only so many debbie gibson songs one man can listen to. in answer to rich's question (to paraphrase) 'reveal all' - there ain't that much to reveal, it's like, you know when you know you're hungry but you don't know what you want to eat? and then someone asks what you want to eat? but all you can do is say you're hungry? well, it's like that. i hope that's cleared that up.
