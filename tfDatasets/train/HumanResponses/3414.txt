these times for the posts are way off, right now its 5:23 pm and it'll probably say its 12:43 am. jesus christ can't even trust the freakin' internet these days, giving out inaccurate times.i just don't know what to think anymore. oh god, nevermind i just found the change time button thingy.good lord i'm so smart. now i'm going to go back and fix all the times for the other ones so if your reading this they have already been fixed and they are no longer wrong which means you were probably sitting there going.what the hell is this guy talking about? anyway, they are fixed.
