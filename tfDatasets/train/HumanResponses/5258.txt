my best friend in the world has turned on me she says she loves but i don’t think she does i wish i were dead she says she wants to hang out but she never calls she used to sit next to me and trust me but it has changed i used to be her best friend in the whole world but that has changed and whenever i think about it i cry i actually cry she said she was sick so i made her a card (i even got tommy gus and angela to sign it) and got her a beautiful flower from the store but when i called to see if i could go drop off her presents she wasn’t there she had gone to the store with her other friend- her better friend (even though she is always going on about how she doesn’t want to spend her money) and of course she didn’t call you can’t say this is jealousy because you know that this is hurt i wish she were here and i wish i were dead (not that she would care) and now my tears splatter the keyboard
