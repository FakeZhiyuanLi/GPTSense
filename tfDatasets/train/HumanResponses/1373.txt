hi there, where do i start, it’s quite cloudy and windy in manchester, suppose we will get some rain. the weather or lack of sun is the only thing that gets me down in manchester. been successful in getting an interview for a team leader job at work, it’s this afternoon, not enough time to plan for the interview as i was told only yesterday afternoon, will have to wait and see how i get on.
