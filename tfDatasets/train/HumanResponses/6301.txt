i've revised my topic for my first qualitative research study. i'll be working a paper that looks to explore the longevity of the dvd format. the simple way of how dvd technology isn't just a transitional format from vhs to the next new medium, such as direct download or something else even flashier. considering i've only got 28 days left to come up with something nothing less than stellar, i've got to get my ass in gear. along with this paper, i'm working on several projects at media services as well as undertaking a free lance job here and there. i'm hoping i haven't filled my plate up too much.
