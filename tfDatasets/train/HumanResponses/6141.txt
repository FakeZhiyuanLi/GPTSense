hey! so had a good time this weekend it ended up being a long weekend for me and my step bro and his chic came up so that was fun, we went to some country bar, sounds lame but it was fun, they left early cause she wasnt feeling well so my wife and i stayed a bit longer.kinda got shit faced.i was telling my wife it seemed like i was punishing myself sound dumb but man i was pounding, than we walked half way home and i was being a dick, so she was pissed, i dont get why there are times where you drink so much that you cant remember,thinking back its not all that fun and the morning after sucks too.but all in all it was a good time, i am working on posting some pics from it.
