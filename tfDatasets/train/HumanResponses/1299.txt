ok, i really like the feeling i got after posting something quasi-positive ;) i'm gonna alternate the crappy more negative stuffs with nice things. sounds corny, but it lessens the chance of me spiraling into a constant stream of negativity/cynicism. woo! woo! oh, i thought i might explain demongund, while i was at it. ok, anyone familiar with the stuffed animal company gund ? well, long ago someone kept putting a gund rabbit-thing on my computer. so having a demon gund was my jab at them. ha ha ha. if i had known that i'd have to explain the meaning for the next 10 years, i woulda chose something a little more generic. john392849123758734589741834905849058@hotmail.com maybe?
