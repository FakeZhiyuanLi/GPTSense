the tagline for this movie was "whoever wins.we lose." it should've been something like "whoever wins.moviegoers lose." this was the dumbest movie i've ever seen. i don't care how much you like the "alien" or "predator" franchises. do not go see this movie. avp is the most magnificently stupid movie i've ever seen. ever seen a "predator" movie? then let's go ahead and make ourselves a checklist so we can make sure the necessary elements are included in this plot. predators come to earth? check. a human earns predator's respect? check. predator takes off his mask for human in a show of respect? check. lots of predators show up at the end? check. edge-of-your-seat suspense? uh.who forgot the suspense? aw, heck. let's just make these predators really clumsy to make up for that.
