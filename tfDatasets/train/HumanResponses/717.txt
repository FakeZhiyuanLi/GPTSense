the best grandfather there was a man i use to know from my younger days. he loved to laugh, joke and tease in his special ways. although he's gone i'll not forget the man he use to be because he was the best grandfather that there could ever be. i miss you love you and will never forget you. you helped me be the man i am today and for that i thank you and will remember you for ever
