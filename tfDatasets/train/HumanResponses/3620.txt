went gaint killin today with nekopirosan and godsmack693 (one of neko's friends). godsmack said hes only been playing for a week. he's lvl 45. i've been playing for about a year and a half now (i didn't play for a bit, so about a year) and i'm only lvl 51. i guess its because i've been working on my other skills, but from lvl 3 to lvl 45 in only about a week! i wonder what his other skills are. i'll have to ask him. grrrr. fsckin members.
