it's friday the 13th, and it's been an interesting one. usually, i have awesome friday the 13s, but today was a stero-typical one. i had the crappiest work hours, then my mom's car got a flat, and then i had to take my brother around north texas. ugh. and to top it off, today was the last official day of summer. tomorrow starts the weekend before school. that means i have to worry about getting up early, homework, people, and more responsiblities. i just want summer to last forever. swimming, vacations, few responsibilities, the olympics, and guys. i like guys. it's a good thing i decided to pick a sport dominated buy cute, athletic guys. time to relax for once today. love ya more than today, rach
