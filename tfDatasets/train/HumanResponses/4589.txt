hey * today is the topic on lesbian/bi girls at my school . its not something i am proud of but its not anything that i can control. which kind of sucks but then again i like people having their own thing even though there is like 10 girls in my school lesbian/bi: - hannah biss. - va'lyndi - katherine - alison - summer - ashley s. * ok, i thought for sure there was more but i guess not. oh there will be later on i am sure of it! * it's also strange how all of the lesbian/bi girls all smoke pot or cut themselves [haha]. butits not my problem, i just wish that people would come out like the gay/bi guys. then we would be a diverse school, which in ways would be cool [4 me anyway]. * well thats about it, i'll write later tonight probably because i have a lot to say later on. i just cant think right now! stay tuned kd
