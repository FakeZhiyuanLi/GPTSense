a homeless man supplicates himself to mecca in the shade of the hwy 290 overpass as the sun calls to an end another working day, and all i can do is watch, finger on the shutter button. a brief pause in his prayers as he sees me. i put my camera away. will this be the question of my art? what will i show to the world? and what will i keep, what of these subtle beauties, for my own eyes and memory alone? in an art where you reveal the world as is - what is made less sacred in the showing? and what is made more? how am i supposed to decide that? who am i to make that call?
