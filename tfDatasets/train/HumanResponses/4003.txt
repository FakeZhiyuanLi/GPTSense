tom smith, whom some might know as the 'guru of blogging' has been visiting ultralab south and came to visit us on friday last. he convinced us (ok he convinced me) that we should be creating and writing in these things as much as possible (and trying to create communities etc.). so here am i on monday morning writing away again. but this is one of those times where i have very little of substance to say. what's most important is the habit. if i keep writing in this thing then eventually there will be something worth reading, because i'll start committing more thoughts to (paper?).
