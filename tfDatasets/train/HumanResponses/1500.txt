last night i sorta had a mental break down or a panic attack mixed in w/ a side of bein manic depressant. it was so not fun i was soo angry i just wanted to blow sumthing up! this last year has been really tuff and it all just exploded. having to deal w/ a death of my g/f the moving news and girls and emotions and responsibilty of acting as the father figure cuz my dads not home all week. it was just too much to handle in one year or should i say 5 months. well anyways i took all my emotions out on my friend brandi and i felt really terrible about doing that, im sorry! i just wish sumtimes i didn't exist sumtimes i think things would be better off w/ out me.
