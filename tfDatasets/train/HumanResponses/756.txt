i didn't write that letter to my mom after all. i don't know why, i knew while arielle was here that i had to, it was on my mind the whole time, but i just never said anything, i was to affraid. i really really don't know what to do anymore, sometimes i feel so stupid for even letting anyone know anything about this, i can hide it well enough that no one would ever have to know. i guess i'm just stuck between living with it and fixing it, both are verry long roads, and i know which one is the best, believe me i know, it's just that road is so dark, and the dark scares the shit out of me.
