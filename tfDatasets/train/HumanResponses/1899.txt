today is july 27, 2004. my food strike is now almost three weeks old. the stupid vet scared hope into changing my dog food because one of my kidney tests wasn't normal. normal? i'm 15 friggin years old.nothing's normal about that. so, hope gave my old kibble to her sister's fat assed dashounds and bought me this new lo-protein stuff. i hate it and i won't eat it. i am driving hope nuts. she has bought me special gravy, special treats, all kinds of things to make me eat the scummy new food. me? i just eat the stuff she puts on it that i like and ignore the kibble. ha, ha, ha.hope is going nuts! the strike will continue until the old kibble is back! beagles of the world unite!
