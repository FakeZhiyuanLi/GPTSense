well, i was happy today cuz brad called. i made him laugh.hehe. he's a cutie. i hop we become good friends. i really wish i could see steve more like i see brad. but it's fun hanging out with brad. that would be so weird if he liked me. i dunno how i'd feel if he did. that would be cool and i'd be flattered, but i mean i really like steve. but me and brad are so similar.but me and steve are too a bit. ok so trish on the bachelor is a skanky bitch. i'm sory i swore but it's the truth. she's terrible. she just wants the attention on tv. i hate her. but anyway.i'm excited for brad to come over! woo hoo!
