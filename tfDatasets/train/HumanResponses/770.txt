i sit here with my nails painted.'wet paint' the sign would say if they had a sign on them. i did the little girl thing and painted every other one green and every other one pink. i have accepted the inevitble birthday that approaches. i decided trying to avoid it was useless and vain. what's the big deal anyway? i hve everything to live for and i'm still alot younger than some people. i am completely uninspired.
