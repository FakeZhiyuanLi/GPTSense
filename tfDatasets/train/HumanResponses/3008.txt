hhhhmmm  someone told me yesterday was the longest day seems about right  i was up till 3:00 am reading a short story collection  dun remember the authors name but guess he was a brit referred himself as ruskin sod chop suey is sort of soothing when you read  these guys know their music take you high with fastest music you ever heard and bring you down slowly oh and while am reading i finished breaking into my buddy's comp tomorrow i will make him some recommendations . i slept for 4 hours and up again with the aroma detergent  the maid has come to wash the cloths how can some ppl get up so early it's inhuman. no one should get up so early. yawn  i decided to take a lil nap and got up at 9:00 am  was almost late again . planning to go for some movie and beer tonight. hope it works out
