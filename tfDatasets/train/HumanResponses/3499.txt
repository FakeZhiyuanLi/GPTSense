i've returned at last from yet another camping trip (no more for this summer), my opinions on this one match those of the previous one; the key difference was that it was twice as long this time. upon my return, i found out that during the time i was camping, my grandfather back in russia died. we weren't close by any means, in fact i'm not sure if i've ever really met him anyway, on account of him being in prison. i wasn't told when or how he died; i'll probably never be able to see his grave.
