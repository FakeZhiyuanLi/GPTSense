i have noticed, lately, an interesting shift in the content of my hotmail junk mail. instead of recieveing e-mails advertising porn sites, i am now recieveing e-mails telling me about hot buy stocks. could this mean that lust for money has finally overcome lust for sex in american culture? but being someone who is "more interested in martial arts then sex" (from outlaws, though i'm not quite a song jiang), i'm waiting to get junkmail from 5h1j1n@outlaws.com about ho*t cr3sc3nt h4lb3rd l*u b*u 4ct10n fr33!
