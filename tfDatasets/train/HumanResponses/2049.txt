i believed that the crew in the story " the crew that vanished" did in fact actually vanish. although they had some insurance money saved up, they left some of their most favorite things in that boat. they left the girl's, sophia's, toys all on the bed and hung up all their laundry very tidily.even though they may think they ditched the boat for money because the lifeboat was not anywhere in sight, but like they said, many ships were sailing around that time and not one ship reported a lifeboat sailing around.
