called and talked to her . i really notice how my heart would go thump-thump when i'm with her. also this mona lisa smile that creeps on my face , ha haa. maybe it really is true that love is temporary insanity. it went well. she is happy , i am happy , i guess. that's all that matters now , does it? i hope things would always stay this way. but , knowing me. i'd probably start doing something to ruin something perfect, ha haa. but i do want to stay in this temporary bliss forever.
