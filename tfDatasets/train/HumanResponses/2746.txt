"why are you an artist?". "because i have lots of pain" i never saw any episode of six feet under but that may change eventually. i am not an artist but i have lots of pain, lots of disappointments. though unlike before wherein i am under a severe depression, my pain now comes from disappointments and regrets. as much as most of us i also want to go back in time to correct past events that makes me ache in pain now. i am a lonely shadow, always hiding at the back and in search of light so atleast i may be seen and noticed. great regrets often produced fatal outcomes but then again where is the sense in that? i overcome the kindling of suicide and self pitty, i am often smiling now and i can sleep with out any aid of pills, but those are superficial and faux. i may be what others percieved me to be me, but still i am in pain.
