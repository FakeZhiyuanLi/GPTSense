i feel numb all over. what do you do when a guy you were dating, who you dont see alot and hardly talk to, finds out he has cancer? he didnt tell me, a mutual friend did. but really.someone should make an etiquette book on this stuff. he probably doenst know i know. do i email him? do i call? do i send him a bear and balloons? (hope not)do i get in touch with him to say hi? i feel sicki care about him, but what do you do when you arent a main fixture in each other's life? ignore the fact? -j
