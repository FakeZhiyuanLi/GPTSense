after not blogging for a while i have returned. my cousins just left to go back to oregon and finally my life can be normal again. so, i've been driving and playing videogames, but not much else. the girl i like hasn't responded to me in a long while and i'm wondering what she's doing. i just watched the first spiderman again and an still impressed by the entire thing(and kirsten dunst's good looks). over and out.
