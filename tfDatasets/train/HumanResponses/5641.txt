we got to see a few of the teenagers graduate last night. what an awesome accomplishment for them. i can't believe i've been around these guys as long as i have. what will hurt is when the kids from children's church graduate.yikes. between that, and my daughter growing like a weed, no wonder i have gray hairs popping up.
