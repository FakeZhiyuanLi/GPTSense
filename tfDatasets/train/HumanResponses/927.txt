it's a break that all have been wishing and waiting for. the first weekend of school. the final time to rest before hell gets unleashed. next week, dont bother to look out for any posts. there wont be any, as school starts at 9am and ends at 10pm. so tell me where do i find time? i feel that i've overspent. $140 in 6 days. don't even know where all the money goes to. never-mind, what's gone is gone. just wondering how to survive next week with only ten bucks in my wallet. either it's ciggs or lunch everyday. let's toss a coin and see which one would i get. just finished packing my stuff for school tomorrow. its going to be a looong day. tomorrow is potato cooking day arghh.
