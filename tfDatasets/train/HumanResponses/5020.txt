as i sit here on a humid night i realize that things pass by quicker than expected.when all your fun has gone you sit in a dark place with no one to occupy your brain.it almost feels like death but in reality your just another step away from taking your next breath.as the days go on you will realize where did all that time go.and then it hits you.its been by your side through thick and thin. joe c. 06/10/04
