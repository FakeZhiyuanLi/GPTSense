this game is great. me and matt were palying it today, and we will be again tomorrow. we have a joint account. i've bought us a nice ship, and in about 1 hour we will be able to fly is ^_^. that's because that's when the skills will finish updating. that ship cost 14,000 credits, and took me about and hour or two to get all that money. plus, if you start playing this game, don't let the auto pilot go unnoticed it's very very useful! oh yes, and the reason i didn't post yesterday, is cause it was identical to the day before, nothing happend.
