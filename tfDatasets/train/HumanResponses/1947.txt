anyone who chooses a cat over a dog is emotionally questionable.at this point i probably would have a major precent of the population waiting to pounce on me. i was previously a cat owner and the satisfaction i got from owning one could not compete with having a cute brown and white dog named jlo. corny name huh? choosing a name for whatever species leaves me completely drained, defenseless, and depressed. i'm an oc in decision making, and the fact that names are a lifetime, permanent decision didn't help ease the pressure. i wanted something unique and classy and personalized. i didn't want a name that only sounded good, it had to make sense as well. the name and the subject should complement each other. after seeing the pup's butt shake a lot as she walked, we decided to name her after the butty jennifer lopez. it doesn't mean we are jlo fans. we are, but we fancy the dog more than the singer. cats are prima donnas. dogs are your fan club presidents. enuff said.
