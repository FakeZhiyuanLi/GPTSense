holy crap have i mentioned how happy i am that it is spring, i was bbq'ing tonight and made this huge ass burgers and oh my god they were so good, plus just being out there in the nice air and breeze whoo! good stuff, work still sucks, really dead there, not much to do, a/c season should help it pick up (hopefully) one last thing. i love my wife!
