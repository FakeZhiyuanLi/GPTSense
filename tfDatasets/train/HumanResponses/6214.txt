my name is amadeus, born into a musical family my given name has left me with much to live up to. the complicated composer johannes chrysothomus wolfgangus theophilus mozart who survived his infancy unlike all but one of his siblings, picked up music very quickly and as you may already know was soon touring europe with his father and sister. with all this performance the ego raged, ever more confident of the talent contained within the mind and body. this man wolfgang was by the age of 33, the most famous european composer amongst his living contemporaries. whilst wolfgang should have been rich in wealth he consistantly lived beyond his means. where he should have had many friends and admirers he instead alienated most potential friends within a few days by way of being too confident and coming over as an arrogant cocky little brat. at the age of 26 it is startling how similarly i have might have fared had i not been able to asses my many faults so early on in life.
