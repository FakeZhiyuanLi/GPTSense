i give i give you my heart, i give you my soul, i give you my love, i am here in whole. i give you my time, i give you my thoughts, i give you my friendship, the best of all sorts. i give you my caring, i give you my lust, i give you my strength, in you i trust. i give you my support, i give you my laughter, i give you my enchantment, yours forever after.
