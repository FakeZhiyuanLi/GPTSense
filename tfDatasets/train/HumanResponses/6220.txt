i am learning to listen to god's voice. sometimes he speaks in a voice so small, i have to stop what i am doing just to listen. like this morning, i had this feeling to pray for my husband. i had to stop what i was doing and pray. i prayed until the feeling left. i don't know if he was in danger or not, but god lead me to pray for him right then and there. sometimes i wonder what would happen if i no longer listened to his voice. i don't think i am going to take that chance to find out. i watched jurassic park 3 last night. i know, i am one of those people that actually like the movies. i really enjoyed number 3. it was a little different from the others. more action packed. my husband called me in the middle of it and told me i should be studying my insurance books instead of watching a movie. well, he is right, but i finished the movie anyway. my husband is working out of town this week.
