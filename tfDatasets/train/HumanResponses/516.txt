as the world revolves around me like one of those fall leaves cought in a wind cyclone taking off at a moments notice.i realize i am not alone in this world. there are many things around me that i never notice.maybe its just the slight bit of cough syrup i just took or my mind has opened up to new and wonderful thoughts and feelings. all these things just make you think how small you are. i mean can we belive there is no other life around us? can we! do we have the oudasity to say that we are the only living things in this universe?you know we are like the tip of a needle in this whole entire universe just the tip.were nothing!. were one planet, in one solar system out of 100's, in one gallexy out of millions,all in one universe. we are so small. how can we even start to judge a thing like this, is it even possible? is it? it might just mystify me, but god, doesnt it just seem outrageously real?maybe a little to real.
