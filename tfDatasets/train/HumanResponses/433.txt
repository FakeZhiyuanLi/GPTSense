goodness. it's been a pretty damned long time since i made a post. i guess i was pretty much coped up with stress from school and other stuff. so so tired. damn. i screwed up my tests. gosh. i'm so dead. i failed my math and i haven't told my parents yet. what's worse is that my dad got me a brand new stereo for my room! argh. how am i going to tell him i failed my math? i mean. he took leave for a week or something just to tutor me before the tests. damn. so frustrated. why can't i just get a pass and be over with it? this is so unfair. i mean. i studied didn't i? why me? argh. damn. i'll write another when i have settled all my problems.
