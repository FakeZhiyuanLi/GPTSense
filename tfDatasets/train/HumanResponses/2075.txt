so. anyway my couzin is cleaning his room windows. looks worse then before, if u ask me. so i guess i just volunteered my couzin, who totally sucks at wiping windows, on this post. so what do i say? hmm. well, he sucks at sarcasm. very much so. more on him later, i wanna watch the downfall of the windows. *-*-*garethlova*-*-* and he gives up easily. esp. at cleaning windows.
