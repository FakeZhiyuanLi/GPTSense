does it again. even though the race sucked! jimmie was so strong he overcame a "goof up" by pit road control. the pits were closed, no wait they're open. too late for jimmie. he had to go all the way around again to pit. came out 6th. nevermind he won under caution. 28% of the race was caution laps. the tv audience will either nap or just plain tune out. gotta fix that. poor dj strongest run of the year top 5 maybe 3rd. but the new ford engine failed him. work on it boys, he needs better finishes. ease up michael - rusty's brakes failed. robbie robbie robbie - at least it was newman. kenseth deserves a large fine, points loss, and probation. spinning a guy out under caution is dangerous and uncalled for!
