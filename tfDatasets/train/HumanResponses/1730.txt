i won't get emotional- i promise. today i finished my finals with very little effort, i don't fucking care how i did. its over. no f's, credits in. doesn't matter, as long as i passed. there were a few people i did not get the chance to say goodbye to, but i imagine summer get togethers will occur. for others i know communication will cease for three months. {but its almost better this way} in the mail i recieved my camp counselor papers, mom picked me up an application for northrock 14 and i just finished freshman year. god, i feel old. won't you take a walk outside? oh no. can't you find some other guy? oh no. 1 9 6 3, whats that sound? oh no. keeping down the underground. oh no! current music: the end has no end | the strokes
