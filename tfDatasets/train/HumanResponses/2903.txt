i'm so sleepy. no one decided to wake me up today, so i slept til one. i have to start waking up at a decent time. i hate the feeling that you slept all day and wasted it. and since we all know i have no life when night falls, well.the daylight is sacred. i have to unpack today. i have to say, that is the only part i wasn't looking forward to about home. but i'm glad i'm back! my own room, my own bed, my own stuff. my own kitchen with my own food. bwahahahaand we have food here. *no offense caitlan* but, i suppose i need to go and actually get dressed and pull myself togetheri look pretty scary upon first waking up. and all i've done this morning is talk to people online and thumb through a seventeeni lead such an eventful life, don't i? lol
