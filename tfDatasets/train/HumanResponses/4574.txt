i keep eyeing up the cycle paths by the road as i travel to and from work. my plan, when i can afford it, is to buy a cheap bicycle and use it to get to and from the office. maybe not every day but certainly quite often. it's only seven miles, which is short enough to be practical but long enough to do me some good, as well as helping out both the environment and my wallet. it's been many years since i last owned a bike but, as they say, you never forget how to ride one.
