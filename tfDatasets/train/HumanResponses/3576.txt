7 am today in the morning, the long(?) slow distance run was scheduled. that means, wake up, get into the car and drive as fast as possible to work and get out of the car and let's start. starting in kronberg (where i am working), running to the saalburg , taking a rest of one or two minutes and then getting back. in total i estimated that i have to run about 28k, so early in the morning could be not just fun. additionally, i had to gain (and loose) some meters (see below).
