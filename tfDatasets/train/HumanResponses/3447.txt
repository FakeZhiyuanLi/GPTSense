i have just found out how much the pooch that appears as wellard in eastenders earns per year. and, just to make me feel great about my own career, he earns more than me! a dog, albeit a nano-celeb of a canine, earns more than me! this only goes to prove that dogs are the biggest menace to our society. don't even get me started on the state of tv licensing. this is where our moneys goes?! ridiculous! ps: for the record, he earn Â£26,000 per annum apparently.
