i'm not really in the mood to write anything right now. i tried and tried but nothing came out. maybe it's emptiness that i'm feelin or just the fact that i'm in a phase that i call "the crocodile phase", is blocking my attempts to dig deep and write something insightful, to open a small window into my real world. i'll leave you with this thought: the best things in life are simple. i'm not.
