i hate treadmills. i don't know why i hate them so much but they are just plain awful. it hurts my legs so. i am starting to get a slight shin splint. its not that badjust a different pain for me. a nagging pain. its just something that i really am not used to. more used to acute pain. broken bones etc. this dull pain is like having an acorn in my shin. i think the thing i need to do is well get more comfortable shoes. bigger shoes that are nice and cushy.thats right i said cushy. lets see on the treadmill from hell i ran 30:00 minutes at a 5.5-6.0 mph mace. the pace was fine but the shin slowed me considerably. tomorrow is the big swimming day. its only 30 minutes and then i will ride the bike after. but who knows how it will turn out. actually i will do great. i have to do great. i decided to do this and goddamned i will make it out of it. :) i will make it out of it better than ever.
