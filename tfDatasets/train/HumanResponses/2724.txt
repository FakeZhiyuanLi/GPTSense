well, i finally did it. i managed to sit down and write a 2 page letter to my son. i will mail it tomorrow, along with a picture. i believe that was the hardest letter i have ever had to write. how does one write a letter to their son in jail? "hey there, how's it goinghow's the weather there?" no.it just doesn't work that way. i didn't want to complain, criticize or reprimand him. that's not going to do him any good, not at this point. you can't say i told you so, because i'm sure by now he's figured that out. no, i just made sure that he knows i love him, miss him and will see him as soon as i get there in september. that's all i could do. maybe the next letter will be easier - i hope so. chow
