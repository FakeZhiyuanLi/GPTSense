i have made a major mistake. my constants a totally screwed up! the boyfriend, the hobbies, and my friggen knee. ( i had knee surgery). anyway, things just keep getting farther and farther away. well, not my knee. because if that was happening, i probably wouldn't be sitting here right now. i just keep having these nightmares. but not the kind that are sudden. the kind that are a continuation of what you were thinking about right before you went to bed. anyway, i had a horrible one about my boyfriend. we were all grown up and stuff, and he kept getting farther and farther away, and it really freaked me out. well we had two kids, and i got the flu or something, and i was puking in the toilet. and they were just babies crying, and he wouldn't help me. he just said that it isn't his fault that i am sick. now that was scarry. and a tad bit of reality
