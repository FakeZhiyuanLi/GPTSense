la gioconda, or, the mona lisa. painted by leonardo davinci of the young wife of a merchant. its painted on a thin sliver of wood, and, is admired by most all people to be considered an extraordinary painting. her smile is unconsistent with paintings of the period, which makes it stand out. the way the folded hands make a triangle with the body is stunning. the history of the mona lisa is interesting. davinci was asked to paint the wife of a merchant, and, it took him over four years to complete it, but, never gave it to the merchant. he took it with him to france, where it traveled from king francis i. to the louvre to napoleon, then back to the louvre. it was stolen, brought to italy, sold, and then returned to the louvre again. in 1956, they attempted an acid procedure on it, which damaged much of the lower half of the painting, but, was saved by many years of restoration. it now sits in the louvre, unable to leave again.
