okay, the night before last i had a dream that my inner guide was a chameleon and i was following him everywhere and he was telling me lots of things about my life that were so obvious that i was just in amazement that i didn't notice them before. then last night i had a bizarre dream that i can't remember, which totally pisses me off. every time i sleep at this house i have some freakish dreams, i think because there are lots of spirits here. i've never had as many weird dreams anywhere else than at this house.
