it never rains, it pours! today is totally 2x of yesterday's unhappiness with the addtional stress with my wrong judgement call. still, i've been motivated a little all by picking myself up, self-healing emotionally and mentally. i've been thinking, i have to do this or else, how do i move on? if i can't even get pass myself, how do i get pass anything? i figured, in order to rebuild my status and reputation in my company, i've got to get back to that "original" ian whom everbody asks everytime "how do you always manage to stay so chirpy and motivated ah?" that's what i must achieve back, in order to regain my status. things are not looking bright now but, with my sheer determination, confidence and charisma, i will make it. i'm gonna excel in my work, get a lot of attention, make the dough and achieve my goals! i will be there soon. today's dosage of mind pinchers: if you are already down, do not let it drag you down further.
