its the last week of high school ever. well execpt for exams but that isn't really a week of school. it only seems like yesterday that we started grade 12 and now its almost all over. although i am not fond of it all i will miss it. being with the same people day in and day out for the last 12 years, even though you might not talk to them much, you still build friendships. things will change soon, for good and for bad, but they will change. next year will be different, but it will be good i think, or at least i hope, its a big risk to go that far away, leaving the people you care and love for. but in the end i think it will be rewarding. hockey game tonite, go tampa.
