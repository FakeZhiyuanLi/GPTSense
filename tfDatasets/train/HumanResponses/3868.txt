i doubt you wanna hear about my sad attempt at a life so i'm gonna write a happy blogging blog: i like boulder because it's such a small peaceful place. i'm glad i live on such a wonderful street with such great friends. i am excited to go to a new place next year and make new friends. my favorite things: horror movies making movies with my friends going to pearl street and just walking around frappacinos puppy dogs flying on planes my (uh, my sister's) hammock the chicken dance fudgecicles fake doggy dooky tire swings musicals being in plays sleeping reading a good book in a comfy place last day of summit first day of high school friends cookies and milk watching movies in the theater laughing so hard it hurts strobe lights my fog machine having nothing to do walking through blockbuster for hours on end double sided tape music
