i have, by far, the coolest girlfriend, ever! maggie and i and the way to jimmy buffet her dad got tickets to see jimmy buffet, and she talked him into getting me a ticket. it was so much fun! he's the king of hedonism. the parking lot was the biggest tailgate party buffet i've ever seen. it was ten acers of kiddie-pools filled with hard liquer, wet t-shirt contests, jello shots, pirate flags, shark decorated minivans, and so many crazy things! some people hauled in a full tiki bar and like a 20 foot square patch of sand! i could not believe how many people were fans. as you can see, jimmy has a taquila named after one of his songs. maggie and i danced and sang the bits of songs we knew, got covered in dancing drunk fan's beer, and smelled "the weed" a lot. i could never live like that , but it's kind of fun to visit it once and a while a get perspective, or maybe i just secretly want to be a pirate. arrrrrr! *swash, swash, buckle, buckle* anyway, talk to ya'll later.
