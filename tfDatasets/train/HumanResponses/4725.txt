yeahp, this morning, eh. mom woke me up to tell me i was naked! (imagine that, me naked?) i was like. yeah, ok, i think i know. *rolls over* i got a call this morning at 9 gag. "is this the huntington mall?" "no!" and then i realized it was mom. she told me she had just got out number changed. whoo. *soo happy* perhaps now i can sleep a little bit better. im pathetic. i dont understand my best friend. if bryan loves me so much, then why dont we work? why is he not ready for 'us.' plus, whats the real difference? we pretty much act like a couple anyway. all thats left is the 'yeah, she's my girlfriend.' perhaps he's ashamed of me or something, i dont know. i feel uncomfortable talking to him about it. i love him more than life or anything. but yeah, today, i need to do laundry and clean up my room and bathroom. i cant believe ive let it go this far. :-/ oh well. i guess ill go for now. maria
