great expectations is a dumb and worthless book. the ending bites and so does the rest of the book. maybe i just don't have a fine taste for good literature or maybe i'm right and the book stinks. i finished reading it today in class and i was like we have spent the last two months of school reading great expectations for what! a stupid ending and a bunch of vocab words i'll never use. it's so frustrating.
