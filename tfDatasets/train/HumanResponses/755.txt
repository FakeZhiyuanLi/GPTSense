finally i did something with my homepage. this time around i have updated the blog and calendar section, even though the calendar is still empty. i have decided not to work out the synchronization palm online-calendar by myself, but instead simply use yahoo's calendar. i am probably going to synchronize the thing sometime next week, when (hopefully) my new laptop arrives :) i also got rid of my old homemade blog and instead i went with goggle's "blogger.com", which is actually quite nice. i am thinking about changing the layout of page, but i am probably not going to do it, due to laziness :) anyway, that's it for now. just wanted to get something blogged. but expect frequent blogs from now on.
