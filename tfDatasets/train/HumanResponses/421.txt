current obsession: what to do with my life; part 2 just as a decision is made, the powers that be decide that i can't do that, and everything has to be rethought. right now, i'm leaning toward school counseling/psychology, or possibly marriage and family counseling. grad programs are very competitive, and the fact that my bachelor's is in a completely different area doesn't help. i'm too friggin' indecisive.
