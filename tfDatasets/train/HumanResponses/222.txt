i am standing on the edge. the edge of what i'm not quite sure yet, but i can feel the gaping maw of something waiting to swallow me whole. i feel it there, yet i just stand here on the edge, looking around, checking out the weather, looking at the trees. basically trying to look everywhere but into the abyss.
