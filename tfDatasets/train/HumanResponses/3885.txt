so there i am, sitting in the bar, feeling like a piece of dirt, when in walks my friend river. not only did he immediately put me on my knees, but he ended up giving me a wallet when it was all over with. i know that he's part of this slave market, and i guess he's actually a slave, which confuses me some, but he seems to like me, and helps me out so much. so maybe there's hope for me, if he thinks i'm ok to hang out with. i don't know. anyway,i'm so grateful to river for being my friend, and the wallet is so awesome! i have never been given a gift by another person outside my family. i should get some sleep. i need to get some more business cards out tomorrow and talk to the guy at the garage to see if i can lease some space from him. what a week it's been.
