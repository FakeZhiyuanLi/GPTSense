i should be able to manage my links and favorites from within the gmail system. ideally i could use the google toolbar or another application to sync these links up with the favorites in internet explorer. i vision a dropdown taskpane on the left similar to labels where i could organize my favorites. but this feature request is a two parter. i would also like the ability to quickly add a link when i search using google or come across a link within a conservation. i foresee next to results where it says "view cache" it could also say "add favorite". that would be nice,
