i just back from montana.and u know the way that works. constant flying and switching planes.man i feel as though i have gone through twenty washers and dryers. we were stuck on the tarmac( the runway) in phoenix for like 2 hours because of a d*** thunderstorm.i hate the weather. i was perfect weather for the vacation week but then on the travel day it is the worst weather of all. i start school soon so i am kinda bummed.i am also bummed that no one is on but thats lifetalk later maybe get some sleep. love: you can't live without it yet it is so hard to get when every girl you meet is charming, beautiful, smart, and funny, yet is taken or denies you? what is it they want? they always overlook the good. i may not be handsome, but, i am smart, funny, and caring. i dream of the day when, a smart, beautiful girl comes along, and won't overlook my good qualities. all i want is to be loved just a heads up u get a free poem be me with each post so live with it
