who needs 'em? right? well, that's a big no for me. i desperately need summer vacations to cool or seemingly boring places. these trips rescue me from my very work loaded school year; which lasts from august to june! so far i have been to louisville, kentucky, atlanta, georgia, and pensacola , florida. not many places but i have some great memories from 'em. like in pensacola, my sister's friend emily came. she helped me plan a guy approach, to some guy i had never met even tho he was super hott (with many more t's i just can't fit that many on one page)! so, if you have some funny summer stories, share them wit me, k?! don't leave me hangin'! bye.
