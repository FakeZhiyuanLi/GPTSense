another week over. going to be busy this weekend working on the dinghy. carol is taking kids away to her parents' holiday cottage. very brave of her. i'll get to watch my new dvd, the league of extraordinary gentleman. not carol's scene really. youth theatre in the morning for the kids, we get to do some chores whilst they're out, then off they go and i get stuck in to the dinghy.
