2day a knooty problem surface. i received a letter form njc saying i short-listed to go for e interview. quite shock actually, i though i would flung my 2nd test. now i have to make two choice. one: stay in sji, two: go njc for ip. if i leave i will disappoint quite a no. of ppl. first, my cca teachers would be sad. they r counting on me to win the next campcraft com plus lead the unit. some of my frens will also be sad to c me go, lyk ben huang, whole day calling me to fail my test. (*sigh). looks lyk my fate lies here. if i leave, hope that my teachers can understand. the thing tt i will miss is my cca, taught me many things n also made quite a lot of frens. if i could return for cca i definitely will return.
