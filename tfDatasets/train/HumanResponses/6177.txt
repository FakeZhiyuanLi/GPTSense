i n a recent survey conducted by myself i have noticed more and more of the community of halstead going out of town to meet and some date the opposite gender. two years ago to the start of last school year there were only a few maybe two people per class even actively involved with other towns. then soon after.there was an "anti-halstead boom" that hit the community as more and more people suddenly became seriously involved with a person that was not in the school district. my question is that is this just me over analyzing or do i make a legit. argument?
