a story from olivia, almost verbatim: "manera's sister and grandmother died in the nazi war. but, the happy part is she found a new grandmother and sister. gracie had a brother. gracie didn't want to be the new sister, so her brother is going to be manera's sister now. the grandmother's name is first william born in springtime. and, the funny part is she's not even dead yet. she's 88, but she's not dead."
