your arms wrap tightly around me like a vice protecting me from the world, i turn around and gaze at your face masculine and strong, yet so beautiful. the warmness of your ageless eyes makes me want to part from the shadows, and join you in the light of happiness where nothing could cause us any pain. your lips speak of heartfelt promises my tongue tells stories of past heartache, like a helpless bug trapped in your web i lay my trust in you not to destroy me. what is left of me i give to you. trying to keep a grip on reality as you bite into me with hungry lust, bringing me fully into your world of light.
