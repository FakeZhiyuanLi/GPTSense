i talked to mike last night. mike says the hat should have worked, but since it didn't, we need to get serious. mike told me he found out from erika that chelsea likes skaters with skills . i told mike thats so ghetto, because i can kickflip and ollie almost as good as matt, the last guy she dated. mike told me i need to be better than matt if i want her to notice, so we better get to work on my skills . mike says we can go and practice on the rail and the stairs at the mall. he says i'll be better than matt in no time, and when chelsea walks by us at the mall and sees my skills .bingo success! i'll be dating her in no time mike says. boy was i worried! i was thinking it was my height, hair color, eyes, clothes, or maybe i was just too ugly for her to notice. whew! what a relief. mike thinks it's my skills . i'll work on my skills like mike said. that will do it. mike knows everything. boy am i glad he's my friend gotta get to work peace out.
