i had a dream last night about wilde fires fires destroying the area i live in. more specificly a giant oscar wilde spitting flames stopping through the alaskan wilderness. so life is good now except for the damn smoke from the real wild fires ravaging the interior of alaska. my nephew is almost seven weeks old he is soo chute and chumbley. i decided yesterday that i was going to make a new t-shirt to go along with all of the slogan t-shirts i've made its going to say jiggley nibblit. don't ask me what it means its just jiggley and nibblitty. on a side note my alter ego dr. cleatus mcgillcutty called in yet another phone prank to my friend the honorable "jj" in whorelando flordia. he has yet to return my call i wonder if i'm on his shit list now. -a
