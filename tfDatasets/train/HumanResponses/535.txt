it's raining today. bloody hell, sometimes it's all happening at once. i's like to give a tip to all the guys out there. this is something that many will know all ready and some that might claim that there are many better ways to tidy a shirt but these are my 5 Â¢. 1. take the shirt by the soulders. 2. make a quick stroke in order to put the sleaves behind, this moove should be executed in a position a bit retracted from the shoulders. 3. straighten the sleeves so that they are in line with the shirt. 4. fold the shirt. voila! one shirt ready for the drawer, it's possible to do the same thing having the shirt laid on some surface, this is helpfull if the back-flip does not work.
