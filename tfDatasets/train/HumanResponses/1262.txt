the best thing that had happened to me was when i went to disney land, california, with my family. having a family trip it the best thing. it was the second time that i got out of texas, the only place i go is mexico. it was a good family trip, i had a lot of fun with my family. disney land was a wonderful place, i met minnie mouse, mickey, cinderella, snow white, sleeping beauty, tarzan, and etc. another place that i went was to universal studios, it was cool, there i met king kong, spider man, and the mummy. it was like if you were inside the movie. there we went around to see how they do the movies, and the places where they did the movies that we now have seen.
