don't you hate it when people think they can just talk to you about their problems like u really give a fuck what they have on their minds? and they just keep talking and talking and then you finally snap because your so sick and tired of hearing their sob stories. but when you do they say that you don't understand and get all offended. i hate that. they ask for your opinion or say "i don't know what to do" and then you tell them and they freak. - like get over it. we don't care. go hang urself please. - if u chose not to hang yourself, then please refrain from telling me your problems. there are obviously more people in the world who have worse problems than you. you are not the only fucked up person in the world. if you think you have the worst problems ever then just go away. cry alone because no one cares. thanx. -asher
