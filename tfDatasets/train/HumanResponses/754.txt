and it's thundering outside somehow i feel extremely peaceful maybe sometimes i just prefer to be alone completely cast away from this hypocritical world yeah it's a hypocritical world and in order to survive i just force myself to be pretentious somebody kept pulling my legs so i smiled while imaging strangling him with my own hands cruel? maybe but definitely human why are there so many rules and social values and what's so inappropriate to be a little different from others you accused me of instilling passive living concepts to those so-called "innocent ones" you'd rather say "ignorant ones" i guess sometimes i just can't figure out how things get through some people's brains yeah i just can't understand you said no man is an island but what if someone simply choose to be an island.?
