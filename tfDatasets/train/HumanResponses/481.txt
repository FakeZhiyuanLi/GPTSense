well i have been working on this damn thing for the last four months straight, no days off not even weekends, and the end is rapidly approaching. friday the 2nd i get to defend this damn thing. though my advisor keeps reassuring me i have nothing to worry about, i cant help but shake the feeling that something bad might happen. nothing would suck more than spending 3 years busting your ass in a lab, and then not get your masters (or more years and phd, but thats not the case here). maybe its just stress. it may be the fact that i still haven't found a job yet. whatever it is, i can not wait to get this over with on friday, spend the evening with friends, and then start planning for the rest of my life.
