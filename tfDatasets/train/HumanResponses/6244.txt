i've always dreamed about meeting my brother. but after once failed phone call and letter my dream of meeting him seemed to fade with each day. so today when i needed to look up an address on map quest the idea came into my mind. what if i tryed his address to get directions. and sure enough it gave them to me and i couldn't believe it. i had passed his street a houndred times in the past year or so. i couldn't believe my luck. but then reality set in and i realized that my dad will never take me to go see him. but who knows, maybe i can find someone else to take me. friends maybe considering non of my family members would take me. so maybe i could bribe some people tonight to go for a little road trip. it could happen (only in my dreams)!
