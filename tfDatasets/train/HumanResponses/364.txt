ugh conflict. there are things pulling me in every direction, im jealous in a way but im not stressing, which is strange, instead, i feel this kind of giddy, bubly, strange feeling, and its only just now come to pass. this relationship i have blasted into is wonderful but its hurting people at the same time and that pains me. this reminds me of a book i read, lol actually it was brave heart, when the horses are pulling him apart? that was intense. i dont know how to spell intence. see i just spelled it two different ways and they both look wrong. i like it late at night, i get all numb and jacked up at the same time, i am plauged with contradictions when it gets late and i love thinking about them, but my mind is moving too fast and i feel stupid and slow trying to type. i think i should just scan my journal. blah i feel so random lately. its worth it.
