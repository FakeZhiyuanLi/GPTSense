went out for 2 days, thursday and friday. wind was blowing at like 70mph. got sea sick, threw up a bunch of times. got to shoot a rapid fire grenade launcher, kept an empty shell. got to see my gun shoot with live rounds for the first time, i sat right under it and got soaked from the lousy weather/rough water. i'll eventually have pictures of things when the computer isn't occupied and so slow.
