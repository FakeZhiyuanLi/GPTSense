i just finished eating this really horrid tasting bagel just because it was free. i wasn't really hungry, but i knew i would be later and thought that this would save me from going out and buying lunch. yeah, it's only 10a. it happened yesterday too. i helped a friend move and her dad offered to buy lunch. i really didn't want anything to eat but it was free. so i had a veggie quesadilla. and then later i go to visit my roommate at the restaurant where she was managing. she says to me, "do you want anything to eat? do you want a beverage?" deep down, yet again, i know i don't, but i can't help it. so, again, i said yes because it was free. the same goes with alcohol, but on a much less desperate level. is this a problem? should i get something checked out?
