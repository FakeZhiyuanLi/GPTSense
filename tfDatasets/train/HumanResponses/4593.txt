my breathlessness is back. just a little bit though. but i went back to exercising too. maybe it's either one or the other. the past week i have been sleeping a lot and i felt better. i feel horrible though thinking that maybe i just have a hard time breathing when i move too much. does that mean i can't go dancing anymore
