in response to some direction from me, one of the kids at the preschool looked me squarely in the eye and said, "you are not the boss of me." amused that this declarative has not changed since my tenure as a preschooler, i met his defiant eye and said, "oh, yeah?" he replied, "george bush is boss. and you are not george bush." indeed.
