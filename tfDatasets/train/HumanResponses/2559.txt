tim looked around. he was scared.but he didnt know why. it really was not a surprise to him when his sister came to the door of his room. "heh. you look like you've just seen a ghost," she said plainly while looking around suspicioulsy, "or maybe you have my book i've been looking foryeah?" "what book." "o com'on you know you've got iti've been reading it.and you." "no. i dont have your book.promise.hope to die." "that's what you always say." "the same with you." ".ok.wellwhy are you standing there then.?" "not because i stole your book.or anything," time said this with purposeful guilt in his voice, just to annoy his sister. tim found this fun, annoying his sister, very much so. "tim.fess up.you're wasting my valuable time." "likewise." "yeah." "yep." tim and andromeda, the name to tim's sister, always ended pointless conversations by saying "yeah", or something simliar.
