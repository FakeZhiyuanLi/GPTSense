hey guys. i know i've already talked to some of you about this but if you're still in burque on the 26th you should come to del norte high school at 7 pm to watch us play volleyball. it will be just like old times. unless of course you have never come to an academy volleyball game. then it won't be so much like old times but it would still be really nice to see you guys there. school stinks without you guys around. and not to be repetitive but i miss you guys soooooooo much. glad to hear that college is going well for those of you who are already getting settled in and good luck to those of you who are still getting ready to go. anyways, catch ya'll on the flip side. latas!
