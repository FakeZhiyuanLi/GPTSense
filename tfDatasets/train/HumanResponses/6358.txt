how appropriate the analogy of the firebird, rising from the ashes to its once mighty strength and reclaim the victorious prize. indeed, ever since the regular season ended, the calgary flames have possessed that rare combination of grit, luck and composure that are worthy only of bygone championship teams. now recast as canada's team, the flames have a weighty mission ahead: to wrestle the league title out of american hands. even if none of us are flames fans through and through, we know that the smart money will be on the poor, gritty canadian underdog club (with a little help from the loudest fans in the league) to come out on top. here's to hoping that jerome iginla raises his first cup; that calgary will celebrate its first cup in over a decade; and that lord stanley comes home.
