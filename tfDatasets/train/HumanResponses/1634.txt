i'm a man of strong opinions, originating from unique places, living in the suburbia of our nations capitol. i've never been the type to live big and shout it out in the walking talking everyday world that we all live in, but like to think that i live very large in the online world. anonymously . i plan on blogging it all: w, the democrats, d.c., suburbia, kansas - yes kansas, sports and whatever else i damn well feel like. today is a brand new day and i am back in the game.
