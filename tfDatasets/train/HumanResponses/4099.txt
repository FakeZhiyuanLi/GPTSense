it occurred to me last night that this is like having a dairy, but leaving it open for anyone on the planet to read. however, because the web is so full of all sorts of useful and information that's actually interesting, this will probably be overlooked, lost in the ether and because it's digital, some accident will eventually erase it (i.e. it's not permanent anyway.) on the one hand, that sort of worries me a bit, should i bare my soul on the assumption that a: no-one will ever find this anyway! or b: it's anonymous, so who cares who reads it? ramble on
