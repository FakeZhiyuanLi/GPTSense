there's been travel and there's been rain, so there hasn't been much going on in the garden. however, marny put together some great container plantings for the deck. they really spruce things up and, once it stops raining, i'll take pictures of them and post them. within the next week, i have to set up the second vegetable bed. i already put the wood frame together, just have to clear out the grass from the site and fill it with dirt and stuff (i.e. cow poop).
