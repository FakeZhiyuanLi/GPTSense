i'm glad that we were once togethor. i honestly i thought you were gunna be mine forever. but i was mistaken for what i said was wrong. every time i try to figure out what happend to our love and how it ended so suddenly. and all i have come up with is the one to blame is me. i'll move on sometime not real quick but slowly keeping every little memory in my head till the when i wake till the time i go to bed. help me forgive my self for the mess i put us in. cause hurting you is a real big sin. not finished yet
