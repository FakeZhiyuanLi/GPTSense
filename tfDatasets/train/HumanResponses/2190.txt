this is the thing about being single and being me. you tend to have crushes. and i dont mean "ohhhh he's sooo cute" kind of crushes. i mean "disappointed when he is not what you expect" kind of crushes. or my personal favourite "right guy, wrong time" crushes. or the one that everyone knows about "he doesnt know that i exist" crushes. -j
