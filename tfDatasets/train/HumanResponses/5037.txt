hmmm today was an up and downs day. up side- i got to see my really hot friend, and taught her to to play the guitar. seeing her just makes me fantasicly happy. and just a year ago, we were more than friends (well she denies it ). shame that has all ended now. though, the down side was. i reversed my beautiful 206 into a really really high curb scratching the rear bumper quite a bit. it goes great with the already scratched side pannels, and a dent that car gave me in a car park, probably some mother at shcool picking up their son. and reversed into my car and just left it there. arsehole thats what i say. but hey. my car is already scratched and if anything i can always blaim my brother but. this accident as such doens;t spoil my day. because i got to spend half of it with the most beautiful girl i've ever seem. and hopefully. we could get back together
