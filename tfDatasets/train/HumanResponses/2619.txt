today my mom and dad actually got along when they took my sister and i to encino to get fitted for braces. i'm getting the ceramic kind that shows less than regular braces. it should be cute. i have to make twenty payments of about $200, but it's cool. my teeth aren't that bad it turns out. however, i really want them to be straight, so i might as well get braces before i get too stubborn. my sister majorly (not to be insulting; i love her to death) needed braces so she qualified for their medical program and she's getting braces for free. i felt bad cause she was even missing a few teeth and her incisors had migrated backwards. also, a few of her baby teeth hadn't even fallen out, and she's 14. i'm glad that we can take care of her now. i don't know what in the hell took us so long to get to the orthodontist in the first place. i guess we were just afraid of braces. ;)
