we spent the majority of our morning taking long term repeatability measurements in order to attend the 8:45 a.m. meeting and the labs over at 76.although we were late for both. we then did the lab.which was much more stressful than one would have hoped.as we were unsure of the happenings of the other interns we weren't able to go to lunch with them at the china buffet.in fact we have been unable to eat lunch with them since the 6th.we were able to play ping pong for a little while though
