i typically post to livejournal, but i figured i'd give blogger a chance seeing it is such a popular blog engine. who knows. maybe i'll like this one better and switch over to here. i'll try to keep the posts as interesting as possible. then again, if my life were that interesting, i'd be a writer and not a support technician :)
