i read somewhere that time as we think about it, is more or less a property of light (i.e. as you approach the speed of light, the way time itself progresses, changes), then doesn't measuring certain properties of light in units of time seem recursive? that is to say, if light moves at 186,000 miles/second, and you were something that could move at 186,000 miles/second, how long would a second actually be? there's an idea that the speed of light is the fastest speed there is, but is it? at the speed of light, because time becomes so distorted compared to how we think of it, couldn't there be a speed faster than what you're moving at? because time might be so off kilter, might there not be a way to view things that just isn't possible at velocities much much slower than light? oh well, blog on! i told you i might be back!
