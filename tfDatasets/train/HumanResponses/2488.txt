okay, so i have finished getting ready for my concert and i have approximately 1.5 hours until the limo arrives. how do i kill the time? by telling you all about tomorrow's date. you see, there is this boy (they're all boys to me) that i work with, whom i swore i wouldn't date. there are two reasons why i didn't want to date him 1. because i told everyone that i don't date people i work with (which is a b.s. reason, i know, but it's an easy excuse to get people to back off). 2. because this particular boy has a reputation within our company that i was trying not to associate myself with. so why are we going out? because one drunken afternoon we shared a wonderful, definitely in the top 3 category, kiss. we have good chemistry as he put it. besides i haven't had a date in 2.5 months, and did i mention that kiss?! anyway, i will let you all know how it goes, wish me luck!
