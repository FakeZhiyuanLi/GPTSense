this is just a brief post to comment on the revival of family guy and futurama. both of the short lived cartoon series have done so well on cartoon network's adult swim, that the creators have reunited the voice actors and are in the process of filming new episodes. no news yet on when these will air but, if you were one of the millions who purchased the dvd box sets, then clear some room because more are on the way.
