gosh, it's been so fun the past few days shopping for new school clothes and buying books. i feel like the princess that i am. i went out to dinner last night with my honey. i had a blast. i wore my black lace top with my tighter than boa squeeze jeans and heels. the place we went to was fab, in fact, everything was fabby-fab. today i slept in until noon. of course, it is just the calm before the storm because classes begin on monday. i wish someone else could just sit in for me, take my tests and do all my homework. sigh. such is my stuggle.
