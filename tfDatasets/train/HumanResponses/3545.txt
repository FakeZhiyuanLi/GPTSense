seeing sjp in the new fabulous gap ads makes me long for the days of satc. it was a show that made me seriously contemplate whether i should stay single during my 20's and move to new york to pursue fashion and writing.but alas.the show was ideal, and mostly a fantasy world where the characters had time to get together for cosmos on a daily basis. this ad also makes me want to customize my jeans the way sjp did, by adding ribbons and piping and cutting the jeans to different lengths. i don't usually like gap clothing because it's so plain and boringbut sarah's new ads are creative and fun, and they give me all types of ideas.
