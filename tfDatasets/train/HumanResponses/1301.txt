dont be too harsh on me i may seem strong but i am as frail as a vine in a storm i may say i'm ok but i'm about to break into pieces don't believe me when i say i'm happy and you can see my smile is a lie and my eyes are betraying me don't leave me when i say i can handle it, i can do it by myself that only means i'll try, that i can but i don't really want to don't be fooled by my seemingly quiet confidence when inside i'm a child, confused and terrified
