i really do get annoyed a lot of the time, but i just don't show it. except when i'm at home. gd what the hell is wrong with watching a couple of minutes of tv i don't get it. and my mom always jumps to conclusionsthinking that i was going to be watching it the whole while they were gone. does she think i don't care about studying and grades and all that shit? i do! thats why i fucking go to this school, but i really didn't feel well right after they left, so i decided to lie down and rest for 15 min. she came back right after i had turned the tv on, got really pissed, and said that i was grounded. wtf. and its pointless to try to even explain. argh> fucking a.
