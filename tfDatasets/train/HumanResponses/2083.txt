there is too much to punch down and too many heads into the same screen, aint got the rite privacy for things to be done but neways so far there hasnt been nething much tht has been going on, but yeah for my own information today is my birthday! and so much of a celebration waiting for my uncle and his fly to show up. bah! humbug. its totally frustating with no music and all other means of entertainement shut down. everyone seems to be competing each other in prooving their grief. seems like a big block o fshit to me so far. but wat can i say! its all a matter of a.c.t.
