found it! okay, dan's got two dogs, not one. but i'm going to make it seem as though he's only got one dog. his other dog will seem non-existant in the story. i can't handle two dogs, one is more than enough for a story. i'm going to choose binka over nugget; the website that i got the news from doesn't say if nugget's a male or female, but binka's definately a female. they're both siberian huskies. grâce à [danradcliffe.com] pour la informations. [secret snowfall] will have a lot to do with dogs, of that i'm quite certain!
