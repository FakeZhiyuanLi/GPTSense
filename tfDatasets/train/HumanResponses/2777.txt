yes the light at the end of the tunnel has been turned off due to budget cuts. the only thing that is getting me through to my next day is that a) it'll be friday b) it's my day off c) no tourists d)i'll be going to the movies and e) i'm going to be getting sleep. that and i'll be seeing the dentist soon so i can get rid of this stupid toothache. finished my book today. oryx and crake, and it was really good but the ending didn't make much sense. but to tell you the honest truth margaret atwood never really did make much sense. but thats beside the point. anyways i say read the book it's really good. but don't expect the end to make anything clearer. anyways i am one tired chicky so i'm heading to bed.
