so my school's library is sooooo cold! i had to bring a wool turtleneck sweater and winter socks today.so i can actually stand to stay here for more than half an hour. yikes! i'm all bundled up and still cold. the cutest thing was in my apartment this morning. i go under my desk to unplug my laptop and there's a little baby lizard (well, at least that's what i called it). i quick got my camera and took pictures. but it's tough to get a quality picture of something so small  only about 1.5 inches from head to tip of tail! so, if anyone who knows me is interested in seeing the pictures, let me know and i'll send you an email.
