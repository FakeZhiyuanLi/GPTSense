well here i am starting another week with a full house of kids. one child has already started with the mouth saying " she (meaning me) thinks she knows everything!" and i have finally came to the conclusion that if the kids dont like it here, or like my rules get out! i am not going to live my life for inconsiderate children. i didnt come into this marriage for the reason of being a maid, or slave. i came into this marriage because i love the man i married. i came into this relationship because he is a good dad to my kids and he completes me. i just dont know how much love i can hand out, or how much stress i can take. funny how some people can't take too much of things, while others can. i am definantly not one of the ones who can handle stress.
