a stack of blank cd's to burn your memories on a mirror on the wall to look at yourself and remember a printer on a desk to write the letter a bottle of water in the fridge to qunch your thirst a box of kleenex to dry the tears a tablet of tylenol to cure the pain a sip a gin to give you a little buzz a blanket to warm your cold feet a loved one to sit beside you a picture for them to rember you by a heart for the pain to churn a bed for the rest of your life.
