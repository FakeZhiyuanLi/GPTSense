i'm posting because i'm feeling guilty about not posting for a couple of days. i get started on these huge projects that i just know are going to be a fun, creative outlet that will save me from the ennui that my soul is soaking in.and i never finish. i run into some roadblock, usually illusory, and that is the end of that , whatever that may have been. this, on the other hand, is easy. there is no real effort except to log on and type. so, i logged on and i'm typing! i am also logged on and typing from work. and, i actually have things i need to do. therefore, responsibility to self discharged, i will return to activities i am paid to be doing. odd.i still feel the ennui. so much for blog as panacea!
