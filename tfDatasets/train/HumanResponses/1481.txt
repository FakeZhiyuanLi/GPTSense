whats wrong with me. the gift from hell i guess. i just am no good with girls period. like a mental block or something. the one good thing that happened today is i got tickets to the yellowcard concert with stacey. it's not that i expected her to agree with what i said in my blog but i am just frustrated and i know it isn't her fault and i am not mad at her but i wish she knew how i felt. i think i love her and i am not just saying that.
