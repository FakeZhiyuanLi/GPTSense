hey, everyone! i made this journal so i could put posts up on my sister's blog, which is basically a shrine to her baby, (christian) nick. my day at school was pretty good. everything is so busy-sometimes stressful-at this time of year. signing yearbooks, planning summer excursions, cramming for finals, saying goodbye to friends who are going away for the summer, etcetera. also, this is your last chance at doing something in middle school.once we get to high school, the bits run up. if you have one last thing you have to do, someone you need to make amends with, a teacher you want to thank, a boy you want to confess your love to (not in my particular case, but for a lot of my friends)well then now's the time. high school will be a whole new ball game! i'm excited for ~**summer 2004**~ hope to see all of you, have a lot of time to hang out, and mostly. not be grounded gimme a call everyone! 728-1361 **keely**
