haha i'm soooo out of inspiration right now. all my brain has processed lately is recipes, japanese food names and descriptions, and a little shopping over sunday. but today, it was all made better with the best sandwich i've had in the longest time! an organic sandwich at that heheh. replete with alfalfa sprouts (just a little!) lined with hummus, and bombed with these great lamb kofta balls. huwa. i finished everything on my plate, and i want some more. :d i never want to lose my appetite for food. it is the greatest comfort, no matter how stressed. people who don't stop for food because of deadlines? not me! eat first, be happy, then go back to work! as the motto goes, fat together friends forever!
