i'm sittin here listenin to 80's songs songs of heartache striking home lookin at every man passing by hoping it's him to still my heart. everything around me is part of him every song played, joke told, places i go can be traced back to when we were one my heart sings tears of pain only for him. my soul is crying out in sorrow like a lone wolf howling in the wind i want nothing more than to feel his touch and a simple goodbye, to be released. i am jealous of the love everyone shares feeling cheated, why am i left out? his emotionless "love" has cut me so deep that even my shadow bleeds.
