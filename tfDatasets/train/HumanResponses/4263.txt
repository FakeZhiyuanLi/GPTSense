i have decided to change this blog to the rantings of an irate housewife in response to my mentally deranged husband who has for the umpteenth time accused me of going on websites, specifically online dating services, which accusation is of course ridiculously false. however, in response to his ongoing accusations, i have decided that if i am going to be accused of something , then i might as well be doing it. i have decided to join as many online dating services as possible. note to ivan if you are reading this: if you think i'm kidding, then ask my mom what i did when she was accusing me of smoking pot! oh yeah, that's right,she's dead!
