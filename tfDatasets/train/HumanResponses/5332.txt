after 2 days in a row of getting my son on the school bus late, i realize something. the alarm clock in the bedroom is 30 minutes off from regular time! 30 minutes late.and who would do something so phenonimally stupid? my husband would. see.he works nights. so he gets up in the afternoon. but does he tell me he's done this to my clock? no. when i call him to ask him if he did this(which i already know he did)does he apologize? no. he never apologizes. my angry response negates an apology. see.things are always about him. screw what the rest of us need. he set that clock to his work time. never mind that he never needs it to wake up. i wake him up, or the kids wake him up. ever been so pissed you can't go back to sleep even though you are dead tired?
