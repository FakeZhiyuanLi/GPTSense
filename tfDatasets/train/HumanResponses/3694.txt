my dad is in town visiting. i love it when my dad comes. while i was catching up on sleeptime on saturday morning, my dad was up rummaging around the kitchen. i could hear him cooking. before heading out for a wedding that morning, he reminded me to lock the door and i reluntantly stumbled out of bed. as i walked back through the kitchen, i saw a big pot on the stove and a three-part instruction note on the counter: 1. macaroni in the fridge. 2. chicken soup in the pot. 3. reheat the soup in the small pot and put the macaroni, add little salt. have a good (with happy faces inside the "o"s) day! - dad isn't my dad the cutest? yeah, i'm spoiled. but hey, after not living at home for six years, it's nice to have someone cook. i had absolutely nothing in the fridge, i mean zilch, when my dad arrived. but the house was clean. now, i have a clean house and hmmmm, macaroni chicken soup!
