well.i've been doing some chatting with a few folks and poking around all corners of the 'net. i decided to take "the plunge" and put up an online personal ad. i decided after visiting 7 or 8 different sites that yahoo! personals offered the most listings for my area and i did it. i have no idea what kind of response this'll bring.or even if i'll get much of one at all. but i've decided it's time to start having a personal life again and seeing as how i'm not really into the "bar scene", as it were, this seemed like a very viable option. as a starting block, at least. so.we'll see where this goes. i'll keep y'allz updated on any progress in the romance department :-d oz
