ok, we're all set and good to go with wingedserpent's random stuff blog! however, i still have no idea what to do with this space. when i think of a good topic to write some stuff about, that's, uh. what i'll write some stuff about. right. so, forward we go, or. whatever. i currently don't have any particular choices yet, but i've been thinking about discussing (for the time being) video games, time cube (and i thought i was crazy), and of course, me. yes, me. i know you're not impressed. just shut up, ok? ws
