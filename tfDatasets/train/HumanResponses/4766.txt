so here i am at 3:00 in the morning. after anothe wonderful shift in hell with only $60 to show for it. that really sucks! what the hell am i going to do? i mean really i have three kids and no money to speak of. i'm going broke here. i need help. this is so fucking depressing. i shake my ass for $4.00 a pop. not much cash-o-la. no body is tipping me well because i don't do the "extras" so to speak. :( so sorry asshole. for four fucking dollars, you get bare minimum! okay. i'm done.
