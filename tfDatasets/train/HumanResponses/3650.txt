okay, i knew things were bad when the 2002 justice department memo to the cia leaked and showed how the administration found ways around the geneva conventions to justify the use of torture on detainees and i didn't think things could have gotten worse, but apparently the state knows no limit to the obstruction of justice, as the pentagon confirmed that secretary of defense ronald rumsfeld "ordered the secret detainment of an iraqi prisoner, a condition in violation of the geneva convention." (wikipedia) scary indeed. first the torture, then the secret arrests. the only thing left to do is start making people disappear.
