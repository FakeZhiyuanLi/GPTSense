it's the little things that get me. i burned my hand and you didn't care. i say something witty and you break it down. you say you'll do me a favor and then leave me hanging. hanging on your every word. why? why do i depend so much on you? why does my emotional health need your elusive approval? i didn't use to be like this. i was independent. and now i am slave to your love, against my will. i wonder what it will take to get your attention? to make you care?
