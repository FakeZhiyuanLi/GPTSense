. then i just found out that little tears are forming on the corner of my eye. can't believe it, been crying for a movie. well, hard for me to resist but honestly, i'm just carried away. bet you take it as corney and a cliche-type, but for me, it is worth piercing to the hardest entity of our human emotion. i myself who is proven to be numb(numbing me?!) got carried in every scenes especially the last excerpts of the movie. i find it inspiring to live the life to the fullest as what am i doing now. it gave stresses my point of "life no matter how short or long is still life, love is the element that prolongs and shortens our finite life".
