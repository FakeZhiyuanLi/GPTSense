well where do i start, it has been a very busy week! the week started on saturday with the grand conference in remembrance of my father who died 15 years ago. it was well-attended and very inspirational, thank you to all those who came and made it a very memorable day. i apologise for not posting all week, as i was busy all week in meetings in manchester, salford quays and leeds. not much more to tell at this stage but will speak to you soon.
