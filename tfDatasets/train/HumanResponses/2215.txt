its holiday season, and i'm off to turkey. hoorah. or to put it more precisely im off to an area near olu deniz. i'm not one of those people who likes hoardes of sunburnt tourists on the beach, so i've been looking around the web for a few more remote and secluded places to visit. by far the most appealing to me at the moment has to be patara beach. at only 54km from olu deniz its easy to get to, and has an excellent 18km of soft white sand backed by majestic dunes to spread yourself out on. recently voted the best beach in the world by the sunday times, i think its where im going to be wanting to spend most of my time this summer!
