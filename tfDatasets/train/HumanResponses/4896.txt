my resume is in the mail to ideo :) just barely though.i called the post office and they said that they would be open until 5:30 and i get there at 3:05 and they are closing. but i'm like, "i really want to get this mailed today" and the guy let me get in line :) maybe he thought it was a college application or something, but regardless, he let me mail it! so now i wait.and wait.and hope :) have a happy new year everyone
