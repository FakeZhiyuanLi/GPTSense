sorry for the delay. if you are just joining us, please read the other posts before you read this one. it will make a lot more since. in march of 2003 i sort of ran away for awhile. i spent a lot of time out in denver with my best friend jerry. jerry and i am been buddies for years now. if it was not for my mom and jerry i would have killed myself years ago. jerry use to be 550lbs but, a few years back he had weight lose surgery. he is about 275lbs now. i am so very proud of him, what he did took a lot of guts (pun attended) jerry is more family to me than a buddy, he was one of my friends that was with me when mom died. he took off time from work to come out to des moines. just becuase my mom asked for him. mom cared a great deal for him. i also spent a lot of time in provo, utah during 2003
