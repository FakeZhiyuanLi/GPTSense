today was great! i had a really good day all day. woke up this morning a little sick with a sore throat. it was all better when i got some donuts! after that i went to first period, where i caught up on some much needed beauty rest. the rest of the day went great, mainly thanks to *her* she is so great and if not for her, this day wouldn't have been good at all. she turns my world around :d after school, i turned in my nomination for class president *cross fingers* i hope i win! well, that was my day.until next time.
