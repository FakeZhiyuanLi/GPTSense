sleep soundly gentle soul do sleep soundly gentle soul forget in dreams your cries of woe— wake not until mourning sets the sun. think only what the child knows, in fields of daisies may you run to the blackness – come undone. in the think of innocence slowly grow beyond those cold stone walls you shun. at long, at last i set you free, this burden on my breast you carry. reach the stars i never could. try not to be as i, so wary. thank god, you’re no longer a part of me. escape! i never would.
