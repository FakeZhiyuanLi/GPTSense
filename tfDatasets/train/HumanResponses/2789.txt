and better weather, i don't really like when it rains. the plane i fly was broken again today. towing it to the mechanic is getting a bad habit. instead i got a trip in another plane flying a guy to a little grass strip i've never heard of. it was a short 15 minute flight to a very narrow runway 700 meters long, whereof only about 500 meters were usable due to high trees at the end. on top of that it was really bumpy and the grass hadn't been cut for a while. all in all it was a great ride, when you normally fly to long paved runways at controlled airports, it's nice trying this sort of stuff.
