.a mentally deficient person with intelligence in the lowest measurable range; a stupid personâ€¢ word history: the development of pejorative senses of idiot occurred in ancient greek, although the meaning "a mentally deficient person" is a more modern refinement. greek idiotes, the source of idiot, is derived from idios, "private," and originally meant a private citizen in contrast to a public official. the use of idiotes was extended to other pairs of opposites such as layman/professional, layman/priest, common person/distinguished person, and unskilled worker/craftsman. a person of no special status, knowledge, or skill was idiotes, and the term became one of abuse.
