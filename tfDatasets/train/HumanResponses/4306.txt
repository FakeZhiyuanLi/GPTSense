yeah, it started off all rainy and horrible. looks like it might be brightening up. but the day is getting worse. problems manifesting with the car, as probably predicted. more stress, money, and also makes the looming road tax expiry more, erm, exciting? do i really need to declare it sorn for like 2 days who knows. at work at the moment, and still very bored. no-one's buying anything. so remind me of the point of having 4 consultants in store today (oh, and only 3 chairs - guess who's without.). roll on sunday!
