so i shook bill clinton's hand and had him sign my book at his book signing at elliot bay books in seattle. i tell ya, i almost gave up many times. i was near the end of a 1700 person line, and bad bill arrived late. overall, i arrived at 7, and was looking mr. pres in the eye at about 10:40. he looked exhausted and he had a devious look about him ashley from our cohort filled me in on a tip that pearl jam may be making a surprise performance at the showbox. dammit, she was right. i was so close to lead singer eddie vedder still, the excitement of the event overwhelms me! ahhhhhh. i worked at the northwest summer brewfest at st. edwards state park in kenmore. wow, quite a time that was. everyone there at the event was pretty much hammered. except the staff. i got lotsa free t-shirts and fake tatoo's. which is good enough for me.
