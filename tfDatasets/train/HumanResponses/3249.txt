let me just say this. i'm pretty ticked off. i'll tell you why. people are stupid. why in the hell do people need to open packages of merchandise, that are either (1)clear and you can see through it. (2)it has a picture and description of it on the package. i spend 2 hours a day putting back stuff that has been opened, torn, or broken into and then laid back on a shelf two isles away from where it goes.
