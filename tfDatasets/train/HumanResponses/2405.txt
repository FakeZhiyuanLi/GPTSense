i had some weird dream the other night that me and romi were going to some church so she could tell some sermon. when we got there i had to go get my bike over a hill and clean the oil out of the driveway and when i came back she was making out with some random dude in a car. the pastor came out and kept telling me i had to get her out of the car so she could do her sermon at 6, but it was already 8. the pastor was someone that reminded me of wilford brimley. you know, there are times when you think your dreams could be de ja vu, or mean something, or be telling you about the future, and there are other times when they're just totally bizarre and have no meaning whatsoever.
