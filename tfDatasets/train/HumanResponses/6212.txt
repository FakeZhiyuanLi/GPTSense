kiru! yesterday in iai class we did some test cutting, or tameshigiri. sensei strung a clothes line across the dojo and hung a section of newspaper from it with clothes pins. we then worked on doing straight cuts on it with our iaito. they have no blade, but you can still cut newspaper. well, some people can. my cut was a bit sucky, just a little on the bottom. james was the man, and cut it in twain!
