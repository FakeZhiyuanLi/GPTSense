darn it! i'm still trying to figure this thing out. at any rate. there's an ebay conference in town this weekend and i'm signing up as the press. i am the press, well, not all of the press, but i am a part of that megolithic multinational meandering piece of crap known as the press but it doesn't make me proud, especially in light of how recent events in this country were covered. but that's another blog. so, can you do tables and all sorts of nifty html tricks inside this thing? a table i guess you can. oh yay.
