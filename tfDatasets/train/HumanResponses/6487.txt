as far as i know the rpg exalted is the only rpg in which one can play a gunslinging courtier who, while imprisoned by his mother, an insane mage, and a renegade monk for the fact that he is a reincarnated god, composes an epic poem about tragedy and betrayal and writes it on the walls of his cell, in blood. he composed music too, but he couldn't play it, his hands being bound by white jade shackles. yeah, and he wanders around with a shapeshifting, blood-drinking demon bodyguard, who protects him from the ninjas sent after them by the sinister lord of a massive trading cartel known only as the guild. he has also dabbled in bandit hunting, diplomancy, illeagal arms sales, and impersonating a god (that one worked great!). and basic zombies will kick the (explitive) out of you because they just won't die! and despite all that craziness, the setting holds together and presents an interesting world. three cheers for white wolf.
