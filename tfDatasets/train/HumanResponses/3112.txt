i called a friend in san diego, the time difference was not on my mind, at 3am local time in sd. lucky i didn't wake him. he was awake cause of a new dog that kept him up. i promised to give him a call after the meeting. he was almost coming through the phone when i told him about my meeting. i think he almost got a boner just thinking of all this could lead to â€“ grouse dude, grouse! (hope your dog is ok ;-) i met rocco in oslo around 4pm. a really cool dude. we talked for about an hour. turned out he was not only interested in a cameraman. he was also looking for a more local editor (as he did it in stockholm). in my opinion the meeting went very well. to bad things wasn't all sorted out about how the team rocco was gonna work. so we had a positive dialog, and we would keep in touch. rocco was soon of to a well earned holiday someplace by the mediterranean. so i guess there's not gonna happen much until late july. i know that pornidol is up this fall, so i have my hopes ;-)
