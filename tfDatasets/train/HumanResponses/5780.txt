poor sheep, hiding over there. *pushes forward* i've been playing super monkey ball non-stop since. i dunno, lost track of time. nipponsei have released a new single from asian kung-fu generation, the 4th opening theme to the show fullmetal alchemist. i'm one of their greatest fans out there (they've done great songs). the name of the song is rewrite. well, i really should be going to bed. so, until then, take care and good night (dark continent!).
