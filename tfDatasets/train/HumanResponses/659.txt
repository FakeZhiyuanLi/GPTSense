i'm at work and it's mean! i want to go home and be with timmie or something but never mid. it's extra money and i need at the money i can get! paul who i'm working with is in a bad mood today and keeps shouting all the time. i haven't really got much to say to him, i don't know why i haven't, i think he's generally pissed off at me for being me and vice versa really. but, on the plus side he has just gone off to mcdonalds for some yummy food! i'm going to a bbq tonight which i'm quite looking forward to but the logistics are proving to be a bit of a problem!
