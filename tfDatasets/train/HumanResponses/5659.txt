at my interview for lwsd, i was asked some question about classroom managment and how i handle disruptive kids. i responded with something like " well, i let the behavior go until it interferes with others. then i just nail em." i guess they really didn't like that response, because they called up the principal of the school i was student teaching at and asked her if i was an "authoritative" type. my advice: do not make any references as to the crucifixition of your students during your interview.
