i guess i must overcome this self-inflicted pain on myself. that is, the illusion that she will still like me, which leads to my depression. i have to accept it, she doesn't like me, and i have no way of changing that. sometimes it is really better if you accept things the way they are. well that's life, you've got to move on. oh, by the way, i found my filemaker, i accidentally left it in dlsu.
