wow. i'm such a loser. i know i'm going to end up writing in this again later today. woo. i'm in multimedia . aka, computers. talk about boredom. :/ this site is probably going to end up blocked, just like all the other journal sites. i like this better than that livejournal shit. it's easier to customize this, because i have a better understanding of html. i'm exhausted.
