when you're out there looking for that perfect person keep these things in mind. people change, no matter how hard they try not to. as you grow older you mature, and with each new level of maturity come different ideas, different needs and wants. the person who was perfect for you at twenty could be the person you hate when you're thirty-five. you have to find someone who will grow with you, change with you, laugh with you and cry with you. a person who fills in where you lack, a person whom you can fill in for when they are lacking. but what about the perfect person, you ask? they do not exist. even my bf was not perfect because there are no perfect people, only people who are perfect for each other.
