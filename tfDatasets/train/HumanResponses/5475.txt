i haven't posted for a few days. i've had this really ugly tattoo for about 12 years. i finally went and got it fixed up. it still looks a little funny, but it looks much better. i need to get out. other than work, i'm usually at home. i took a ride down to east atlanta, had a beer and looked around. it's just hard to go out and have any fun. i have to stay sober in order to drive home.
