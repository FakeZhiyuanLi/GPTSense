christopher. he is my 20 month old who has been helping me with the dishes the last 30 minutes. i think there might be a new life principle in his ways. no less than 30 times he took a cup out of the dishwasher  put it in the cabinet across the room. i watched as he peformed the task.over and over and over. ahh the focus factor of a 20 month old. too many things to do.not enough focus to do them all. dishes. life. new life principle. focus - 2 tim 2:2
