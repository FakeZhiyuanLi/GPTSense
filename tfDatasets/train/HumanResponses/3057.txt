i had a pretty solid day today. first i took my spanish exam, bombed it. i mean let's be serious spanish? i don't even speak it how the hell am i supposed to pass a test on it? but then i came home early cause' i had a free period the next exam so i came home and took a power nap on the couch. next thing i know my sister is waking me up telling me i can have her phone because she's going to get a new one. well i don't know if you all know the difference between my sister's phone and mine, but it's a big phone. so now i have a new phone and i also bought a few dvds a couple days ago. i got the simpsons season 4 (best one) and curb your enthusiasm season 2. for those of you who aren't familiar with curb your enthusiasm it's the only show that rivals the comedy of chapelle's show. i also purchased, "the good, the bad, and the ugly" it's a good one. but for now i just finished mowing the lawn and i should do cole diddy's final "preperation" for my final tomorrow. smoke rocks. mike
