music: fiona apple - shadowboxer mood: bored yes, yes, i've been sucked into that large group of people who writes down every freaking thing that happened in their day and then posts it on a website for the world to see. what can i say? it's summer, i was bored today. my sister took the car to ontario to take her bar exam! that leaves ryan and me stuck at home with no car. eh, we're computer geeks anyway. we dont' need to go anywhere. no one's online. i'm so incredibly bored. oh well. x o x o
