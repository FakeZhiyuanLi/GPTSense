i was playing goldeneye 007 the other day and i completed three levels on 00agent, it was hard but no da i mean that's why it's called 00agent, anyway i also played poke'mon with my little sister and she's has a really strong poke'mon but i said she needs to train all her poke'mon and not just one but we are going to have an all out battle some day and then we'll see who's the best.
