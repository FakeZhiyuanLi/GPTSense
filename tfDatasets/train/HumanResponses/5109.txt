my cat, dolemite, who passed away about a month ago was actually just away and came back. i still had gunther and they seemed to get along ok. the odd thing was that i had given dolemite some hot sauce in a playful manner and he had thrown it up on my rug. i don't know what the hot sauce means, but i do know that seeing dolemite means i still miss him.
