do you like talking about food? i'm more indifferent to food than any other people. of course i like eating but i have no desire to eat good-tasting things so much. it is only nutrition that i care. above all, i hate talking about food and hearing others talking about such kind of things. i'm quite fed up with talks and tv programs about delicious dishs or cool restaurants!
