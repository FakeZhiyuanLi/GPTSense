for you who watched the race you know about the red flag well i was there and it was heck. around the 90 or 100 lap area a really bad storm came and there was bad lightning and everyone in the grand stand was ordered off the stand so we went to the ground floor and waited and waited. after about an hour of waiting we thought they would call the race since all the cars were put up and everything and 1 hour and 40 mins. after we left the started the race grrr that made me mad. well im sorry this post is so small its just i have to go i'll try and post something tonight bye
