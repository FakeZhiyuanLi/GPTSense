so yea, i didn't go to work today. it's friday, and who wants to be at work? i watched gandalf fly on his uber horse lastnight until 6:30 in the fucking morning. so getting up at 11:00 wasn't happening for me. i think since it's friday, i get to drink. although i've been drunk every night of the fucking week. i'm such a lush, uber. dance dance you fucking homo's rawr
