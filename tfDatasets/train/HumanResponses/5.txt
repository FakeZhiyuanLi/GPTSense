hey people, for those who have not yet got the chance of watching the movie troy, i suggest that you should check it out ! the casts are really really cool and the scenes looks shockingly authentic. so its like quite awesome,and be prepared for some heart stopping moments too. yea.i thought it would be a boring show but in the end, it was quite good.who said history sucked ?! in the end both of the heroes died.so sad.( at least let brad live lah !) by the way, it was 2 hours 40 mins long, so brace yourself ! it was a good thing that i went to cathay cineleisure to catch it, the toliet's is in the cinema theater itself ! so i didnt really miss out any good parts.last but not least, the pre-sex scences was really hot  what an experience ! seriously,it's either the show was not censored properly, or they honestly (for once) relaxed the censorship rules. but dont expect a hands-in-your-pants sort of show, there's just too much battling goin' on ! movie rating: 75%
