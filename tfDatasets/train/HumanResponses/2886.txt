the weather is a little more accomodating than yesterday. the equator can be pretty unforgiving in terms of ambient temperature. overcast clouds paint a depressing cast to an already drab sky. a brief respite from the heat, but definitely not an environment in which you would want to start every day in. work is overwhelming, so much to do, yet direction is lacking. caught a little of the lee kuan yew interview yesterday night. his opinionated ribbing of malays and the central government in malaysia, and their racist, biased, treatment of chinese and indian citizens, won my sincere applause. can't wait for tomorrow's first edition. eager to see how far the issue can escalate for the press in malaysia (no shred of journalistic integrity when the government is concerned) will probably be having a field day. viva la equal rights.
