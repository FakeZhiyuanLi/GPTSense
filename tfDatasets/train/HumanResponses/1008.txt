saturday. boring one, work is as usual. meeting with group members as usual. movie alone as usual. the story of troy reminds me the famous book i read. the homer of odyssey. i think there are just legends. the movie has no depth and the ending suxs i think. war scenes feels like lotr also. maybe it should give more background information and explanation to the story. it's the work of gods behind these men etc.
