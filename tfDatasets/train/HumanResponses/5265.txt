after spending all night looking for stuff to do besides going to bed, i opened the door that connects the hallway to the bedrooms, and i felt this wall of cool breeze coming out. my first thought was that the guy had forgotten to turn off the emergency generator (and i was not going to remind him to after i entered ;) ). my brother kept telling me there was electricity; this was hard to believe, but when i woke up (still with my a/c on :d ) i asked my mom and surprisingly there was electricity!. thanks mr. president for a good night sleep! :p
