i'm finally over that a couple of months long writer's block. i so loved writing fanfics and then i just couldn't anymore; i have no idea when. then some days ago i had an idea for a story for the fan fiction section on my jenny site. it's still not much but i'm writing again and that's the most important thing. i also have another about someone famous. :d it's a pretty weird thing but i don't care. what will happen with all the old stories? i don't know yet. hopefully i'll be able to continue them. one day.
