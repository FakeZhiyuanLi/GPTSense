i was at my second interview/tour this friday. this time i visited a software company in lund (approx. 57 km/36 miles from where i live). the company is called qliktech and they develop business intelligence software. i was interviewed for a position as a software tester. the guy who interviewed me was afraid i might be over-qualified for that particular position, but he told me to think about it and let him know if they should consider me for the position or not. i've given it some thought over the weekend and i think i'm gonna give it a shot. even though he might be right and that i am a tad over-qualified, it still seemed like a really nice place to work. i also hear that the company is expanding at a rather rapid rate, so i guess i could always move around inside the organisation if i find it unchallenging. now, all i can do is cross my fingers and hope they pick me. lets do it together! :d
