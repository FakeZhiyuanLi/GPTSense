where to start.lets see, i have alot of freedom this is true, im practically allowed to do anything i want, because i hate my mom so much she feels the need to kiss my ass, i always prayed that she would just be gone, leave some how. guess what my prayers were answered.my mom is temporarilly being held up, like a prisoner hahaha. omg.i should not be laughing, but what else is there to do when u have cried so much, that theres nothing else to cry? u laughthats not coming easy either. guess who has fulfilled my mothers roleme! so that "freedom" i had, is gone. i can have people over, but as of now, theres no point to anything.
