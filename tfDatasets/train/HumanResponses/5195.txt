tobey and joe went to the doc today to get a feline lukemia test so they can be vaccinated, but we spoke to the vet and she said we ought to wait until tobey had been inside for 2 months because he may have been exposed and not know it. i guess it can harm them if you give the vac and they already have it. my poor boy! he could never have imagined his little night on the town could be such a hassle. now they aren't allowed out on the porch until they have been vaccinated unless they are supervised. they were very freaked! one of them peed in the carrier. i'm glad i was in my work clothes.
