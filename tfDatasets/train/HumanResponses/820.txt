always have the problem of starting a story and not knowing where to go with it. my ambition is to write a book but about 10 to 15 pages in i have no idea what to do next. i think i will resign myself to short stories for now and just get published. hopefully i will get accepted into the journalism program at asu. i dont want to be stuck working in the pits of lower management for the rest of my life. my sights are set on supervisor in a month and a half. but you probibly dont want to hear it, sorry!
