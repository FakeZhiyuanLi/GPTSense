"the best thing about loving and being hurt is that you get to know what true love really is. for as gold is tested in fire, and so will love be perfected in pain." "the path of a relationship with true love is like a trip together down an old dirt path in the woods - sometimes it'll be beautiful and easy, other times it will be a rough walk with its ups and downs, turns and twists. but when you think you're out of the woods and you look back, you are glad the journey took place, and in all, you are glad you and your special someone took it together. but the journey is not over, you have only just begun. so, don't loose faith; keep on walking. if your love is true, the path you two take will never end."
