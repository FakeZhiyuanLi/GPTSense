woke up rather late today. lunch kinda sucked, mcdonald's isn't the best lunch, especially when everything's a bit stale from being in the car for too long. but that's beside the point. but there is no point, so it can't truly be beside something that isn't there, now can it? kind of like how going to hell is more fun when riding a suv, but in a sedan, it's quite disk-shaped. no?
