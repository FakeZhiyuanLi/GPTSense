slaving over the hot deep fryer, hands coated in sticky batter he comes begging into my kitchen, asking for my fritters with a grin. seeing my partners fried veggies, he gags and leaves in a frenzy "no offense to you " says he turning away, "fuck you" says me. he comes back asking for one, should i lie and say there's none? but i hand him the best fritter, noticing how his blue eyes glitter.
