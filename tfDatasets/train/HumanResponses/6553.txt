nothing exciting on monday. except i had a really bad dream last night :( i usually dont remember dreams, maybe i remembered that one cause it was so bad. today is fairly busy. staff meeting, then after work the staff goes to the vestry meeting first time in the almost 18 years i've been here, that i've been invited to that! not sure i'm looking forward to it, cause the changes we've recently made, i cant say i was or am all for them. then the best part of today, kasha celebrates 1 year clean tonight. :)
