right now i'm atempting to become skilled with photoshop cs. yes, i'm going to the side of the photoshop whores (as i call them). the reason being that i'm tired of making websites with xhtml 1.1 and css standards compliant coding and that have good custom php and mysql backends, but that don't look that great due to lack of graphics. most websites i make don't even use a single image and although they're not that bad, i'm rather tired of making sites that are so lacking in smooth style. i think its time for me to move onto creating well coded sites with great backends but that also look good. i have to say though, that ps is going to be a pain to learn. just because i refuse to look at tutorials. i have never needed a tutorial or how to huide for anything to do with the internet, so why should ps be diffrent? well. i'm off to visit the gym and watch leno while i work out. and once i get back, its off to bed with me.
