well, for those of you unacquainted with my travels over the past year, i'm current in grad school at the university of illinois at urbana-champaign. it's not quite la tech, but i make do. i've been working on some pretty esoteric problems in power systems, so i'm pretty sure any more details about what i'm doing would be cause for some type of beating. lately i haven't been able to engage in anything of any real excitement here(unless eating funnel cake while listening to a demolition derby counts) due to a pretty strict regimen of work and little sleep, but i'm certainly up for reading about someone else having the fun i'm missing. there's also an open invitation to come up and watch me study for my qualifying exam in november. yes, that goes for all of you.
