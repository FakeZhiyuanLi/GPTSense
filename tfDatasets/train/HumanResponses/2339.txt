give me one reason why i'm no longer an object of your interests, why i'm no longer the subject of your conversations. i'm drowning deeper and deeper each day. wondering why i'm no longer the reason for your smiles, why i'm no longer the institution for your confused mind. are we still sharing the same feelings or have yours dried and withered sadly away. - nadrah -
