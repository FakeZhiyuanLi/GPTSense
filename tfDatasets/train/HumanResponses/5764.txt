i am the fifth child in a family of six. my father passed away when i was almost five. at the time my oldest sister was 13. my mom did not speak any english but somehow managed to send all of my sisters and me to college. she did this by "cheating the system"collecting welfare payments while working under-the-table as a seamstress. the gunning of the sewing machine was a familiar sound in the tran household. my family is an island. we keep to ourselves. rarely do we look outside for support. this is a survival trick my mom has passed along to my sisters and me. she did not have a financial/emotional support system when my father died so she learned how to rely on herself. if you are strong internally, it does not matter if the world around you goes crazy/falls apart. to some, this may seem like a defensive and protective outlook. to me, it is code to live by.
