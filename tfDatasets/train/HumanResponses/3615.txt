i'll be back on runescape soon, but i still need to write my pen pal an email. i don't know much japanese, so i'm looking for a good online translator, or even better, a good japanese-english dictionary. i used a google search to try to find a good translator, but i couldn't find a reeally good one. the problem is that i cant read or write much kanji (the complicated symbols) and the online translators had a ton of kanji that i don't know. stupid translators. grrrrrrrrr. fsckin members
