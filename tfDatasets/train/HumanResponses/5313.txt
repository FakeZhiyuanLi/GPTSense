one day, 3 women, a blonde, a brunette, and a red head, traveled to america. because they skipped customs, they were taken to prison and charged as being communists. after a quick trial, all 3 were sentenced to the chair. the red head was up first. "i just graduated from theology school, and i know the grace of god is with me. because of this, i will not die." they threw the switch, but nothing happened. they quickly let her go. the the brunette was up. "i graduated from law school, and i know the judicial system will save me." again, they threw the switch, but nothing happened. they let her go too. then the blonde was up. "i just graduated from an electrical school, and i know for a fact that this chair won't work until you plug it in."
