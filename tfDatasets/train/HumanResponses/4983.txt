it is one of those days again that i'll wake up in the morning and feel like i'm all alone there used to be people here noises,presences but now, its just me and the cold breeze it is one of those nights again that i'll sit by the window and stare at the stary sky and keep wondering is this real? or is this just meant to hurt me? looking at the stars counting it knowing that its there but i cant feel it is it true then? that you are here? it is one of those moments again that i have to say good bye but we'll meet again one day so from now until that day we would still be friends.forever!
