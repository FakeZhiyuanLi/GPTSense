whats the big deal! i am a hugh yankee fan and i don't see why the yankees are always criticized for spending a lot of money on their team. they do have the highest payroll in major league, but there are other teams right behind them like the red soxs and mets. plus its not like every game they score 30 runs and shut down the other team. if i'm not mistaken, i believe if any other team had the money they would do the same thing. one last thing, the yankees spend their money wisely, unlike other teams who spend their money they get from revenue sharing to build a waterfall in their outfield!
