song: lemon demon - consumer whore mood: bothered this is gonna be the second-to-last post i make. i've decided to shut this blog down. but i am pleased to announce the up-and-coming flaming chicken studios, a project that my friend and i have been working on for quite some time. details of this project are sketchy right now, but we expect to have a webcomic, a few flash videos, and a bunch of other goodies. until then, goodbye. random quote: "i pose a conundrum to ya. a riddle, if you will. what's the difference between you and a mallard with a cold? one's a sick duck. i can't remember how it ends, but your mother's a whore." -sean connery (actually, darrell hammond playing sean connery, but the effect is the same.)
