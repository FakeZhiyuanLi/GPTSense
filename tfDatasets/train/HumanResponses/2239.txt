i was reading over my blog (and no, it's not the sprinkled grammar errors that bother me) and i was irked by my so-called "philosophical" posts. do i sound stupid or what? i can't believe i'm annoying myself. blah, guess i just don't think when i'm bored and feel like writing random things. hm.today. i went swimming, broke a bracket, got in an argument with my dad (like every day), and ate chicken. thrilling, i know. then i talked to veronica about where to plant her "flowers" (long story). and now i'm writing in this thing.gah. i suppose i could go look at random topics on wikipedia, but i'm tired. whilst pondering the depths my infinitely deep mind, i just remembered i have soccer! yay, my day is saved from all that is known as boredom.
