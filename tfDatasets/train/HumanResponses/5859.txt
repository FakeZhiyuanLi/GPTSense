i wrote a kool poem at work today. latley i have been working for awhile and then taking a break by writing.kinda hoping back and forth till the poem is done.like a lame ass i then print it up and give it to any available person that i let read my poems to proof read. not sure if it helps any. or if they think i am lame. probably lame.that's life for ya.
