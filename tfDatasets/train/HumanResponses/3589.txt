well yesterday was a slow day, i didn't really do anything excercise wise (unless you want to count walking around malls and trying on clothes). my landlord was supposed to come by and do some stuff with my apartment and i didn't want to start anything and then stop in the middle. he never did come by :p he had to do some other work on the apartment instead i guess. and mom came by too around lunch and she's staying until tomorrow. this morning i went for a 27 min walk with mom this morning. i walked a little bit slower than usual just so mom could keep up :) i got her to work up a sweat :) and showed her a bit around town. anyhow now it is time for breakfast. i will be back later.
