my sister worked as a cashier at a grocery store while in college. one day a local bum came in and bought a six-pack of beer with money he'd collected from begging outside the store. later he came in to buy a 40 and went through my sister's line. he ended up being a dollar short (which means he hadn't collected very much since his last purchase since 40s hardly cost a thing). he was digging through his pockets for money and my sister, being the very empathetic person she is, said "don't worry, i got it," and pitched in a dollar of her own. later customers started complaining about the drunk bum outside. the cops were called and to make a long story short, the bum was arrested for public intoxication and taken away. i always like to give my sister crap about how she got the bum arrested.
