merry christmas everyone i had a great christmas up with my family and got a nice pair of vegan shoes - now everyone keeps asking, "what's so un-vegan about shoes?" well, vegan shoes have no leather or animal-made glues. they're really nice :) and i got to see a bunch of relatives too, so that's always fun! pictures of the un-turkey are coming soon, but they're on my cousin's camera because mine is currently broken :( i hope everyone had a great christmas
