music on the ipod: guster: "amsterdam" franz ferdinand: "cheating on you" longwave: "everywhere you turn" cowboy junkies: "my wild child" -no reasons today for why these particular songs nor what they've meant in the past i spent the morning and early afternoon sitting on a pier by the water, reading "prayer for owen meany". i am nearly through with it, and i must say, not a bad book. it was good to smell the salt water (even though it is the li sound). chatted with a very kind old man who was out for a walk. he sat near me to rest and struck up a conversation. he was such a gentleman, and so sweet. i bet his grandchildren love him. now i am posting this blog in the library on a public computer, and trying to figure out how to get home. this will be so much easier when i can finally drive in october. though connecticut has some total crap law about not being allowed to drive past 9pm until 17 or so. i think i'll go see "mean girls" this afternoon.
