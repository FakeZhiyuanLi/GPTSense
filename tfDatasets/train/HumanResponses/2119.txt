great news today i have a new cause (not that i've abandoned yesterdays) my new cause is animal testing.i've always been against it but today on one of my many visits to the peta website i found any interesting article on animal testing which caused me to go through me house throwing away any product that didn't have a not tested on animals sign or stamp.that consequently has gotten me into trouble.:) oh well.it's all for the animals those lovely cuddily animals.especially the grizzly bears and rabid bunnies
