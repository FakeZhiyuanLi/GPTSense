tomorrow i'm going to christian camp for a week, i hope to meet girls and maybe make friends. but thats what i want them to think. or christian camp is what they want me to think im gonna go to. i wouldn't be surprized if it was a slave labor camp that makes people carve toothpicks out of stumps for a week without sleep or food. maybe i'll have to carry logs and rocks up moutnains just to make wooden elevator buttons. maybe it will just be an excuse for michael jackson to get it on with children. ok, i lost intrest in this topic. im just gonna try to meat hot chicks there and maybe get a new girlfriend or something but if any of that happens i guess it wont be as fun as i thought. i should remember the theme song to fresh prince of bel-air so then i will really have a chance with da ladiez. ne ways get back to ya later.
