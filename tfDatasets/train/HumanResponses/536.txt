if you love her/him and she/he loves you let me give you an advice although i don't seem to be getting it right. give as much of youself as you can, and then some more. if you are being fulfilled, there are good chances that she/he is not. so talk with your partner and do your best. always have a dialouge and don't be afraid to talk about "touchy" arguments. it's something that you both will appreciate and your relationship will be stronger. sigmalab's prototype is coming along. yoghi made a working build where the condivision is being saved to a xml file. i made a prototype of a id3 tag reader in c# that uses the id3lib com wrapper, it probably won't be included in the release because com is a propriatory technology. is there anyone that has a working id3v1 and id3v2 tag reader library written in .net? if so write on schrepfler at inwind [dot] it .
