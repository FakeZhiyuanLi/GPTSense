not so sure i want to see michael moore's latest. it would be good to see something that will get my mind off of ellie, but moore just pisses me off. see, i agree with much of what he says, but to me, he's just as arrogant and self righteous as bush is. the only difference is that he doesn't have troops at his disposal to do whatever he feels like doing. jeez, i wonder what moore would set legions of mad liberals to do! might actually not be so bad. i've never really understood the connection of bin laden to hussein, and i guess that's because there isn't any. then there was the whole wmd thing. i mean, they were definitely fucking with the inspectors, but how did this become a specifically american problem, requiring a specifically american use of force? and where the fuck is bin laden? do you think he's dead? still running things? respond away. i'd love to know what you think!
