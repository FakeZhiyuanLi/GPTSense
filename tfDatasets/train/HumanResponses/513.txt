his poetic soul withers away like he he is gone he is lost lost forever in this endless world the world that rejects him the world that hates him the supposidly understanding world we turned on him he is so small he carrys this tremendous hate on this shoulders always and forever until he cuts it loose cuts his life away from the pain and ends his damned life. he has a new life now a better one he isnt tormented he is loved yet,he was always loved he just couldnt tell.
