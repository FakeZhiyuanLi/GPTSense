i was chatting with a friend of mine and the topic of spm came out. i was telling her about the pressure i feel to face the exam on 4th december when she suddenly slap my hand! "4th december? are u crazy or what?" that's what she said. and guess what. then i realized that the exam is not on 4th december . but it's on 4th november how could i forgot the real datei must be crazy it's an important exam. she laughed histerically ( so histerically that i hope she's not my friend at that time. ppl starred at us that's why) she said that she just couldn't accept me being that ignorant on the date. hmmm this thursday i'll be sitting for history. god, give me strength i hate history okay i need to continue my study (history. arggghh)
