i've added a download section to the sidebar at the right. the first download i've made available is "sevenup". this is a four-player (3 computer players, and one human player) card game that i wrote in delphi. this game was written with very little reuse in mind. as i have mentioned before, i am in the process of writing a card game library. first, this project is intended to give me some practical expirience in writing programs in c#. second, it is designed to be reusable, so that writing new card games will be much easier with this library. the first game i plan on writing with this new library is a replacement for the sevenup game. when that is done, i will place that game in the download area.
