i've found that having a job makes you much more likely to get given nicknames. i haven't ever really had any titles other than my real name in the past, owing to it being reasonably unusual. however, these are the new ones i've picked up over the past few months: -manbrose (we used to have a workmate called manvir. it was something of a variation on a theme) -brose (the truncated form) -bro (the band call me this) -broid (this one, which came from giles [see link to his blog] is just wierd. i do find myself saying "these aren't the broids you're looking for" as a result) i think i like being called am best, but noone seems to do it!
