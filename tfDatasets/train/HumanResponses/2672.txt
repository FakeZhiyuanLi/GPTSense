i'm a dork. it has been two years. i can do math and read, exxtremely well. i should sleep now, since i think i'm supposed to teach a piano lesson in the morning. it is difficult to teach when you're half asleep. it can also be quite difficult to pay attention to what little kids are saying when you're not focused, at all.
