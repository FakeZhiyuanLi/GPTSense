well i still don't know when i'm going to be leaving work. my leaving date started as the end of july, migrated to "maybe the middle of august" and now is dependant upon when i finish an assigned task. no mean feat seeing as i'm being thwarted at every turn as i try to complete it and to top it all off, i'm decorating my flat - i absolutely hate painting and all other forms of diy. why can't i just ride my bike instead?!
