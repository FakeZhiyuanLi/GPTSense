went up to le passet (above barberine) with rebecca to climb tout ca pour ca. we were both pretty hung over from a bit of a drinking session caused by the england game being a good score, and starting early when it was happy hour at bar d'up. we didnt take enough clothes and had to turn around two pitches from the top because we were both too cold. the last two pitches that we did do though were stunning. really nice moves.
