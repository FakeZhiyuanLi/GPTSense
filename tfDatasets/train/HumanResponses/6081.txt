model transformation is just a glorified clp problem. the main difference is that, instead of integers or reals, we have to solve for objects. also, the type rules we talk about with objects make it a little bit more complicated, but these can probably be expressed as a series of default rules that must always apply. for example, if an object has a certain type, it must have values for all attributes of the type (and, with current typing rules, must not have any other values, although i find this a little weird myself). there is also the problem of object existence - integers and reals just exist, but objects have to be created, and generally deal with identity a bit differently.
