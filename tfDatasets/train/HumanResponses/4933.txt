my friend t gave me a great birthday present: one of those new google email accounts, called gmail. gmail is going to be a major competitor to hotmail, and it will feature free 1gb storage. you might never have to throw away emails again, and i know that is something t really likes. gmail is only out in a beta version, and thus not available unless you get an invitation from someone somehow connected to the right channels. the new address is per.fischer (at) gmail.com.
