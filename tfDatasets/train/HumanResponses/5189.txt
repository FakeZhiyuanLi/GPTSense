i'm just posting to post. i don't really have anything to report or any thoughts on anything. these last few days have been ' lazy days ' spent reading and mostly, sleeping. sleeping could be considered one of my favorite hobbies. other than that, i've also been playing some more halo. but the annoying banshee morons and team killing jerks get to a person after a while. still, my halo skill has become alot better. hardly ever do i get under 20 kills in a game and more often that number is closer to 30 or above. heck, earlier today i had a 39 kill game. and the day before i had a 42 kill game. anyhow, i'm off to bed now. but on a last note, the new mariner bucky jacobson has gotten his 3rd major league homer. and it won the m's the game in the 10th inning. less than a week in the majors and 3 homeruns, keep an eye on this one boys and girls.
