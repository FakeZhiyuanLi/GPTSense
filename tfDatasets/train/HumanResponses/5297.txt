today is wellness we had to do this retarded cpr thing. yes! i love basically making out with dusty dolls that sit in conley's office and pretty much every kid in school had their mouth on it. yum yum. ours was broken and the air wouldn't pump in the stomach so yeah, it was pointless. i would never save someones life. i would probably waste time trying to save them and they would just die anyways. then it would be my fault. i also went with cece to don pablos and to get my cool sun glasses. and yes, i do look like a 70s rock star in them.
