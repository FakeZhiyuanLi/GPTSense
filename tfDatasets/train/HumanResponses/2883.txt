my friend jess' car is being stupid. its broken down on her twice in four days! yuck! i wish cars didn't have problems. but then all the mechanics would be out of jobs. dang. oh, well. random thoughts from wani. on a lighter note. my husband and i are going to the lake this weekend. i'm looking forward to it. in a few weeks we are taking our care group there, and in september the youth group is going. we like to share my inlaws' lakehouse as much as they will let us! its so nice there. one of these days we'll get some pix up here. i went to a baby shower the other day. it was so cute! and there were like four babies there. it just feeds my need to have a baby of my own. i can't wait! ah! but god will let me know when its my turn, i'm sure. i just wish i knew when that was gonna be!
