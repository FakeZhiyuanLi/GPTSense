i know this has all been gone over before. but what the fuck is redhats's problem? how can they charge $ for linux? it doesn't make any sense! i'm trying to get my rhce but i have to use fedora (since it's the closest thing to redhat) for all my learnin'. it's really quite irratating. oh well. i do have a copy of redhat enterprise linux es (paid for by my j.o.b.) but i really want a copy of redhat enterprise desktop. but unfortunately the cheapest version is still over $2000! i really hate software companies sometimes. bah! i'm gonna go now.
