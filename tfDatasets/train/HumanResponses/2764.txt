okay. maybe i over-reacted yesterday. the cubbies dominated the bucs 12-1 today. but they are still in 3rd place. not exactly the cat's ass, but it's better than 5th place. i'm still looking forward to that sox game though. i haven't been to a mlb game in like 5 years, so it should be fun. and i have tickets for those seats right behind home plate, so look for me on tv :p weather sucked today. rain. rain. and more rain. global warming, perhaps?
