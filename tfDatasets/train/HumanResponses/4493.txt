michigan was cool, the only thing i didnt like about it was my cousin, marie, she is so spoiled.they had a carnival up there by her church, and i had asked her if she wanted to go, cause i could take her, then she said she wanted to wait for her mom, but then her mom didnt feel like goin that day so marie didnt wanna go either, that really pissed me offi dont mind goin up there, but if she just wasnt so spoiled.sunday they had a parade and marie was on one of the floats, i had a chance to go, but i didnt want to. so one of the floats stops because a little kid fell off and got his foot ran overmy aunt ruth told me to go check it out to make sure it wasnt marie, i saw no point b/c marie's float was 5 floats behind this oneso i check and its a little boy, but he was fine he started walkin around that same nightso about my trip, i liked it, i saw a lot of hot girls up there and one of them gave me her number!
