the hotel in which i work is by no means a road-side holiday inn. it is very bougie. so that means our cliente are mostly 'well to do' types. basically to make a long story as short as possible. i get sooooo pissed off that these guests repeatedly bring me $20 bills (or higher) to constantly make change! and while i'm sure that a good part of my pissed-offness is becuz i'm pretty broke, but still it pisses me off to no end to have to constantly make change for these yuppy -upitty fucks!
