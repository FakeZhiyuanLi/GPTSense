.to see. ah ha ha. just kidding - hopefully it'll last a bit longer than these two posts. frankly, if i have trouble keeping myself interested in this god knows how anyone else will be. i doubt there'll be an overall theme to the blog but perhaps that'll develop as time goes by. i expect it'll be one of those streams-of-conciousness things with maybe some profound insight stuck in there by accident. i don't know how private/personal the blog will be either; i'm always acutely embarassed about showing my true feelings to people - hence the 'ironclad' moniker - but we'll see how it goes.
