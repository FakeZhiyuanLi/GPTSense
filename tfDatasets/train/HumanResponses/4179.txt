the weekend was ok, it could have been better. i slept for most of saturday and finally got out 5pm. went to my grandparents place for a bit, came back to the apartment watched some tv and got some dinner. after that went for drinks with the guys and came back around 2am. on sunday i went to vote early with the grandparents and my uncle,then came back and went back to bed, i got up around 4pm for a game of ultimate frisbee, it was fun, we played 5 on 5 for about three hours even though it rained, the rain actually made the game better. we won 4-2 and after that got together at eduardo's place. on monday the results of the election came in, as everyone expected them to be, and uncle jose passed away which ruined the day. latter on i went out to dinner with stimps, ray and willy we grabbed a beer and went home.
