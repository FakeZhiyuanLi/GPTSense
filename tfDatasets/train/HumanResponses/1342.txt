well this sux. the other night one of my friends showed up over at my house drunk out of her mind. since she is prego i thought i should help her out. so i jumped out my window and did the best i could. when i got home my mom had noticed i was gone and locked my window so i had to come in through the front door where she was waiting for me. at first she didnt believe me about it then i finnally managed to to believe it. well i almost got grounded more but she was being kinda kewl about all of it so hopefully i can manage to get myself ungrounded some how and then i can go see a certain someone (hehe). well ill see u guys later.
