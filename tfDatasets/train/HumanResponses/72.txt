again sorry for the typos. more on the uses on pink in egypt. i saw a store display with manneguins all in pink and pink scarves over there heads last night when we ate at this really cafe in in old cairo. it was so nice becuase al;l these famous writers have been there. i love reading something and then experienceing it. or at least what the author experienced. so i have also seen lots of little boys in pink and a lot of the male artist in the alexandria used pink in their work. way to go egyptian men! i talked to my new friends about it and pink i sjust any color to them. this is my gola for the us. i don't want pink to be used as a harmful gender color. i have noticed that in general egyptians are not afriad of color. maybe only america is chromophobic (afraid of color). i will discuss this more when i get back.
