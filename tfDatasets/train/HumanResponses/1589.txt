ok, just to let you know, i'm a boy. today i purchased tom clancy's rainbow six:3 for my xbox. i must say it is a very good game. i'm to head over to zach's house today at 2:00 for band rehearsal. i'd ditch it again to go to katy's house, but i already told him i could make it. damn! anywho, i'll have most of the summer to spend as much time as i want with katlyn. i say most because she's going out of town for a long while and i really can't spend time with her if she isn't here. i'll find some way to keep myslef occupied until her return. i guess. well i guess i'll catch you guys later on. i love you katlyn!
