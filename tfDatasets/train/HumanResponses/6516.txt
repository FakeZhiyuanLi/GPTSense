new delivery rounds start next week - i'm not quite sure how i first got involved in this, but it now appears to be my baby. if it goes well, thats just how it should be, if it goes wrong, i carry the can. hopefully it will go well, we've done a lot of planning to get to this point - just need cooperation from the drivers.
