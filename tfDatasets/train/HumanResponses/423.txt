current obsession: none (shocking!) so, i've done a little research into the local community college. good news! they have a partnership with several 4-year schools; you can earn your bachelor's or master's w/o leaving the area. how great is that? i don't know if that's common; i hadn't ever planned on going to a community college. still have more research to do. but, i was happy to hear that; already have a bachelor's, kinda wanted to go beyond that. weird factoid: the sports teams at said community college are called the cougars. my alma mater? also the cougars.
