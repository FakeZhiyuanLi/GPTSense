ok, all of you that know me, understand that i am very "pro-homosexuality" right? but, lately this whole fight for gay marriage has been draining me. this might be my fault, but i'm getting bombarded with support gay marriage emails and stuff. so, i pose to you this question is there such a thing as too much? am i the only lesbian that is annoyed? i mean, i realize that saying this might get me kicked out of the lesbian hall of fame, but my thinking is that the gay community is more than likely going to support our gay marriage efforts. so, the people that we really need to be "harassing" (and i say that loosely), are those that don't understand the importance of equality and civil rights. i may just be totally off base. what do you think?
