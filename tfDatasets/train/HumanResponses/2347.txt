i went to the fracture clinic this morning for my 10-day update on my wrist/arm, and it turns out that, as expected, i have broken my arm (radius bone). the consultant spotted it straight away, but explained that it might not have been picked up previously because it wasn't a great x-ray. i am now sporting a new caste, and the old moth-eaten version has been binned. when it came to me getting a new one, the sarcastic south african bloke responsible for putting the caste on, who had just spent the last ten minutes winding-up the patient next to me asked me what colour i would like. me - what do you have south african - pink, yellow, blue, red. me - red please south african - why red? me - (deadpan) because i mostly wear black clothes.
