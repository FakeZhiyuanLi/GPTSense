ok today has been going good.i have a tennis tournament in pasadena this weekend.hopefully i'll do better than last time because the last match i played in, the word terrible doesn't even come close to describe how i did.oh and an add on to my previous entry.if i'm sooo stupid how hell did i get an a in math (because the calling me stupid was referencing back to math class) and on the last test how come i got the highest grade.i mean i'm supposed to be so dumb! ok no more talking about that crap.so far spring break has been good, nothing but relaxing.tis grand! well got to go and make plans to practice before the tournament. ciao
