after about one year of experience in just maintaining the existing piece of software by providing some fixes and new features, i was given an task to write a new code right from scratch. first where to start is the biggest problem we faced. actually you learn a lot in maintenance, but it was all in the negative. every problem you faced was caused by a failure of the old code to prevent problems during maintenance. but this doesn't always teach you how to write good, new code that avoids such issues. your entire thought process only reacts to the events it becomes difficult to visualize the big picture in just one short and come up with some design architecture. but for new development, we need to sit down and consider -how- we intends to build the application, rather than focusing in on how to structure specific features.
