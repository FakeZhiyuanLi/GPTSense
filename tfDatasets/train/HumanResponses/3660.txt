ok lets shift gears life is about to change yet again for me. its interesting to ride the wave of flux within flux i kind of feel like and errant atom. speaking of which i had an idea for a band called "unstable adam" once but i guess that's not really on topic. i have decided to synergise my mental and physical fitness. in the united states physical fitness in relation to outward appearance is more prized then inner health coupled with mental and spiritual clarity. i read an article this morning with incite into asian cultures specifically china and japan that states true beauty can only be obtained through synergy inside and out. so my point of the day is we spend too much time working on the outside of our homes so that everybody else knows how beautiful and elegant we are when in realty the inside has a bunch of junk drawers that need to be cleaned out. -a
