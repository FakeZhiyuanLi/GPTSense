so i wasted most of my day after class today at vla. i just dont want to do work. i have to though and i know that. the boyfriend comes back tomorrow morning and i will get to see him for around 20 minutes before i have to leave to go to class. class today was awful; 3+ hours of an essay writing workshop. the tips were highly useful but it just dragged on much longer than necessary. i just wish these lecturers would cut to the chase and stop with all the bull shit. ah well. ok, i am going up to the boyfriends house now. will do my work there . hopefully.
