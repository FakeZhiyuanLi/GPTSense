this is my first time with a blog. i have read some other blogs in my time. ed b.from canada had a very good blog but i won't even try to have one as good as his. gran dorse said i should try this so here i am. the reason for having this blog is to try to engage some banter on current events namely the conflict in iraq and our countries war on terror. i know i am not alone with my views on our current administration. i feel like we are being lied to and their intentions in iraq are not sincere. i hope that there can be some lively chit chat on the war on terror and other issues as we head toward the most important election i have ever taken part of.
