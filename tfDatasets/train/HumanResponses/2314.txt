as i was on my way to work, this old lady noticed that i was drenched in sweat. she offered me tissue. i didn't know her, she was just a face in the throng of strangers . imagine if everyone would just be like that. we start off being inherently kind, but somewhere along the way , we get jaded. that is so so sad, we should never compromise principles. they're the only thing we can hold on too in this life. try to search for that which makes you happy. and content.
