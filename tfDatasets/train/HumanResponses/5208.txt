okay, so maybe i should be a bit more clear. i am at the canadian university press conference in st. john's, new foundland. you see, i am the managing editor of a college newspaper and i am out here representing. okay, let me now be even a bit more honest. i haven't been representing so much as drooling over two really hot boys. both, of course, whom have no idea who i am or why i am. but still, good times. there is a blizzard here. for real. no planes in or out for the next two days. i have to get out of here back to my real life. i have to go to l.a. next week and my plane leaves from vancouver, not new foundland. i love you all, which really means just me as i have a zero readership at this point.
