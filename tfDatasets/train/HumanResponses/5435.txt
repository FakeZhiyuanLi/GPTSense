we're starting to move today, and we're probably going to be finished by friday or something. maybe thursday but you never know. on saturday i have to go to the district meet for track. fun i did horrible at our last meet. it was just really bad. i didn't to do anything and it pissed me off because my dad said that he was going to be there, but he couldn't show up in time because he had a lot of "errands" to do. yeah right, even if he did he could have done them today or after my fucking meet or something. but anyways, we have a choir tour tomorrow as in elementary schools and stuff. should be fun, anyways i got to go to confirmation, i love you troy, night night.
