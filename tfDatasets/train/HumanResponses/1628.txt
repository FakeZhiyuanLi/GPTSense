its my bday in two months! haha. anyway, i dont really know if that makes a sound, bri. but i have a serious question, if you liked someone, would you go ahead and tell them even though you know you absolutely have no chance of going out anyway? i mean, like, you dont talk or whatever. no communication whatsoever, would you still want to let them know or would you rather not. personally, i would rather not and spare myself the miseryyeah i've been through a lot of that so i know. if you know you have no chance with this person anyway, why would you tell them? its a complete waste of time and tears as well. okay well im out you guys. later! lots of love, joana
