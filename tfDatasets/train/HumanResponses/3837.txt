well exams are going good so far, only did two, but my hardest one (physics) is tomorrow, i think im going to do horrible. to much stuff to know and i dont know it. once friday is over it will be fine, even though i will have two exams left they are both pretty simple. a week from today we will be graduating, its kinda hard to believe, i have so much stuff to do in so little time, but it will all get done. got bev's bday gift with the aid of lisa. we ended up getting a betta (pet fish) and bev loved it. i hope she enjoy tomorrow.
