well i guess i havent been posting anything for quite sometime now. dont know if that has been because i was busy or because i didnt want to write anything. life has been a little complicated for quite sometime now. something is definitely bothering me but cant actually pinpoint what. i am not enjoyong my work. i think i need to think it over and identify what is it thats causing all the trouble. had gone for team lunch. wonder why people celebrate it when they get married. i mean what is it that they are gaining after all. arent they losing their freedom and getting bound to one person. beats me! maybe i will know if and when i get married. ;-)) guess i should get back to work now.
