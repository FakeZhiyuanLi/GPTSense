so this whole american idol thing came from the british show pop idol, right? anyway, we've all heard of kelly, justin, ruben, clay, and so on. from time to time, i even see kim caldwell (season 2) on the tv guide channel. well, today as i was working on my computers, this song called 8th world wonder came on. i was digging it, and then i looked at the title and it was kimberly locke! the 2nd runner-up from season 2. she's a heckuva singer!
