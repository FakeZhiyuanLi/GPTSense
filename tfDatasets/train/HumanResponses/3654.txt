yes, still sick. but watched interesting programes on scctv (that's seattle community colleges television, for those of you with superior cable who skip past channels 14-30) and discovery. discovery's in-house programes on natural disasters are a combination of access hollywood and fox cable news journalism; inflamatory and slightly hysterical. i learned that any minute now there's going to be a landslide on one of the canary islands that'll cause a megatsunami, which in turn will wipe out the eastern seaboard. i'll take earthquakes on my coast anyday.
