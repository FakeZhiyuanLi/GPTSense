so, i decided once again to have a blog. i've had two, but i never kept up with them, and i felt the urge to have one again. so, there has been alot going on in my life right now, and dont really know what to do ya know. im moving away to college in about a month. there is this guy that i met, who is so awesome, and i cant help but feel good when i'm around him. just my luck, a month before i leave, i meet someone awesome. well yeah, today was a work day. then i got to go see bye bye birdie that lia, brittany, ryder, and brie were in. it was a really good show. always fun at the theatre! later. qotd: "my one regret in life is that i'm not somebody else." - woody allen
