i had work last night and today. my legs r killing me. i am so tired but i wudnt trade it for the world. i luv it, it is so much fun. this whole thing with tiffany is way out of hand. i hate what it is doing to all of the girls. i am kinda sry the sisterhood broke up, but i think it is about time. we r all getting too old and our scheduales r all really different. but, i life will go on and we will all get thru it. i will c everyone one tuesday. have a happy memorial day!
