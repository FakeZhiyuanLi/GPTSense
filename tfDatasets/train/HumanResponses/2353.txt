i knew i would do this, start up something and pay attention to it for a couple days and then forget about it. maybe it's a sign of how dull my life is, i have nothing to blog about. what a boost to my self-esteem. i suppose i could write about how i didn't get the facility trainer position i wanted. but i've bitched about that enough in real life, don't really feel like doing it to a computer too. since no one will probably ever read this. could bitch about doing 3 jobs yesterday for the price of one, but i have to do that today too, so i suppose i'll hold off. could bitch about my soon-to-be-ex-wife or whatever the fuck she is (she filed for divorce, but due to her inaction, inadvertently dropped it) but that would take way too long. i need a life.
