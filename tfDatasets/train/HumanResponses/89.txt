one of my friends told me that their is a big change to her attitude. i think she changed after what happened tonight. and not only her but all of them. and i'll be honest, i've changeda lot! honestly, i'm afraid to tell them what i really feel about our friendship. i'm always hidding what i feel, one of my friend told me that i might comit suicide if i don't tell anyone the problems i'm keeping to myself. i'll not comit suicide, and i don't want to hurt myself. anyways, i'll change for the better.
