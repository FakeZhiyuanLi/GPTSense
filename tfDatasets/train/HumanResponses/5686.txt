listening to: hoobastank - crawling in the dark feeling: sleepy oh yeah! i did it! woo hoo! i signed on! hello readers! i am the sister of the blogger. right now she is at show choir camp singing to her heart's content, well, hopefully, i haven't really talked to her, but i assume she is. it is nice to have her sing somewhere else besides here and having the room to myself. it has been lovely, have a good night!
