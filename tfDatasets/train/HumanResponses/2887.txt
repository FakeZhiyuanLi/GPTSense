my very first blog posting. feels weird somehow but could be due to the lack of sleep that i've been experiencing lately. i'm a business development manager for a manufacturer of car bodykits called ars. we've been exhibiting at the singapore expo dreamcars asia show since last tuseday and haven't had a day off yet. the cars in the show were ok, the show was pretty biased towards performance tuning. racing queens were great tho, chirpy, friendly and hot as red pokers, so if u gals are reading this, u kick mucho ass (will post some pix when i get to it) writing this blog at work seems wrong somehow but i'm beyond caring. slave driver of a boss had me working 14-15 hours since the bloody exhibition started :
