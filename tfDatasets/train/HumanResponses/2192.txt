well, gmail fever has struck. people want to get their hands on 1gb of email storage space so bad that at least one person who has an inivitation from google to sign up has decided to auction it off. going price as of this writing is $16. gotta love capitalism. according to the auctioner, it will make you popular with the women. a bit of a stretch, don't you think?
