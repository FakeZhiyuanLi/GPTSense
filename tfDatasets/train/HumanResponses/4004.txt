now that i am up and running i thought i might explain a little bit about my intentions for this blog. . to the right i am busy placing links via blogrolling.com. i've found that since i am not paying for the service i can't limit the number of links, so i shall be on the lookout for a free service with more features (yeah right!). the links are mainly to education (including online education) sites but include stephen downes edu-rss feed which is pretty much a gold mine of information and news about education matters. stephen's site is there too as it is one of my favourites for a thoughtful read. as i myself grow more thoughtful i'll be placing some actual content in the blog itself. perhaps next week after semester one draws to a close!
