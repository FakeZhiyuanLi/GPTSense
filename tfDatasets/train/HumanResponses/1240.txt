don't you hate it when the first thing you hear at work in the morning is, "you look tired!" i do gee, i was feeling pretty good this morning until you said that. what compliment can i give you in return for that bright ray of sunshine? however, if i choose to let this bother me, then i probaby am tired. but, i am only hostile now because instead of staying up late and finishing a book i am reading, i put it down and went to bedregrets - the spice of life.
