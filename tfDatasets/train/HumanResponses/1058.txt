when those bastards let me go, they actually insulted me by trying to escort me out. i say 'trying' because the moron who let me go stopped in the reception area to talk to someone and i guess he actually thought i'd wait for him. yeah, right. i went downstairs, left the property and then came right back up as a visitor to talk to some of my friends. they were as, or even more, freaked out as i was. for quite some time after, months even, i thought i might actually get a call back from them. denial - it's what's for dinner. i was gone, toast, history, but still hanging on to the hope. pathetic. they paid me double the legal amount it costs to let someone go without notice, and were done with me. i had some cash, and ei coming, but i had to get a job eventually. so i thought, hey dude, you got's some serious experience there, go see the competition. next: the competition
