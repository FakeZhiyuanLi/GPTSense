a teardrop it can stand for joy pain anger sadness but for me tears no longer have any comfort they no longer console my feelings no matter what these feelings are my knife is my only comfort talking "walks" is my only consolent my poems are my only confident because no one cares and those who do will not remember with time a teardrop those who love me will lose two one for sadness, and one for joy. a teardrop.
