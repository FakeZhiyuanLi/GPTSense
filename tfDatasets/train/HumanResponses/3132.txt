this morning, as i cut through the house, maria was on the phone and noah(4) was bebopping around. i waved at her and said good morning to him. he was surprised to see me  and then excited and expectant.  "can you play with me?" "not today. but we can play on sunday." "but why?" "i have to go to work now, but i'll see you sunday, okay?" sigh. "okay." ugh. if this is even a fraction of how it feels to be a mom with an outside job  man, what a hard life.
