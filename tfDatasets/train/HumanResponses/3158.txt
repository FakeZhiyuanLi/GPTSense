ya, schema much better - think it will take us longer to write a really good schema, but i'll take a look and see if i can do it quickly - if i get bogged down, i'll bail (jon reynolds, our best xml schema guy is on vaca). we can give web services a whack. in theory, its pretty easy for us to write and deploy - we've done one as an experiment before. i assume you guys will do the ms flavor - if i recall the ms flavor is doc literal? vijay will know for sure - i'll check with him too. md5 is no prob. i'll get you a schema doc as soon as i can. hopefully monday.
