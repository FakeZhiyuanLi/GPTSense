hmm, maybe this is a waste of a post. not sure if i can think of much to say. i guess i'll just go with the flow and see what happens. i'm really enjoying xm radio. i made my first commute to work today with it in and enjoyed every minute of it. sound quality is fantastic. it only cut out once when i got downtown and went between the tallest of the buildings. it was only a second or 2 anyway. i even took a ride tonight for now reason other than to listen to music a bit more. i can't wait for my home kit to arrive so i can listen to xm in the house. yikes, not doing so good. already at a stopping point. let's see. i don't know, there's only so much you can say about yourself. nothing's really new at work. i'm pretty busy dealing with all this shit for a compensation analysis of our pay structure by a consulting firmriveting blog story, i know. maybe i'll start a story or something in a separate blog. i think this one may have died already.
