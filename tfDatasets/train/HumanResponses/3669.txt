and to think that this morning the worst of my worries was not being able to see all my friends at drama again. i guess that you really should never say things can't get any worse. they always do. it seems that what happened on the bus is going to happen again on a much larger scale. the school. i can't believe it. 'they' said they'd drop it. it was a stupid mistake. bastard!
