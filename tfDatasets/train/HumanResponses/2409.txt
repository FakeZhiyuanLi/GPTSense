wow, i haven't written in here in a while. not because i haven't had any dreams lately, but because i forgot about this log. last night, i had a dream that i woke up, and i was calling for my cat, and it was nowhere to be found, and i went outside to look for it, and there was a note on my door saying that the apartment manager would charge me 35 dollars a day out of my bank account until i paid my $250 pet deposit, or i would never see my cat again. so now i'm really scared that my cat will get taken away. either that, or i'll have to pay a lot of money to get it back.
