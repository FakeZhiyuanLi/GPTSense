wow! it's friday already! it's amazing how fast life moves on. yesterday i was chatting with my younger brother and he was reminding me of how short our lives are and we need to do whatever good we can before we disappear from earth. we are 17 months apart and he is my best friend undoubtedly. we both are very similar in thinking. in fact, that's one of the topics when our wives meet coming back to present, can you believe that i reached office at 8.30 this morning! i have decided to start early since anyway my younger daughter wakes me up at 7 in the morning ready for her morning milk! so, i have decided to come here immediately after dropping my daughter and go back for dinner time. let us see how many days this will last. now i have finished catching up with folks back in boston before they went to bed and ready to get on with another nice day. will come back later.
