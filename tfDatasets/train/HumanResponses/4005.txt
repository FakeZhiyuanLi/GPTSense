ako is the maori word for 'teaching and learning' (maori are the indigenous people of new zealand). the reason for ako's existence is the discussion and dissemination of ideas related to learning and teaching - mainly from a tertiary or higher ed perspective but not exclusively. i'm hoping to create a collection of ideas and links that someone somewhere (besides me) will find useful. ako is created from deep within middle earth (that's the south island of new zealand for those with a more literal streak) where the author is engaged in consultative work in tertiary education.
