i'm so sad right now. it's sad that i feel the way i do. i shouldn't be this upset over a person. letting this feeling ruin my mood and my evening. but it's happening. i don't know if this is real or my mind and my heart are distorting my actual feelings to make it seem like i should be feeling this bad or that i actual love him this much. i just wish he would just take me back so we can be happy. i know i can make him happy. if only he knew. i feel like such a loser, it doesn't even make sense. someone should get a gun and put me out of my misery because i am making a fucking mockery out of my self not to mention embarrassing my self. god. love sucks! it just grabs a hold of you and jerks you all around and then throws you on the ground and leaves you there all bruised and bloody. not to mention hurting and confused. but its so wonderful while it lasts right!? sure whatever. yakima
