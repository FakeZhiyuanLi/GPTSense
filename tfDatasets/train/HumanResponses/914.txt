hi there. this is my first ever blog. just to get one thing straight. i swear. a lot. if you don't like that, get the fuck out. now, onto the meat. my name's samir. i'm an ugly sod living just outside london (that's england, not canada). this is where i'm gonna post everything that pisses me off. and maybe a few things that were actually good about my day. this is at ooble.blogspot.com because i use the name ooble wherever i go on the net. if you don't know me personally, you'll know me as ooble. so there's my rant for today. wow, i feel better already! oobs.
