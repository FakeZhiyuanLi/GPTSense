my boyfriend is acting werid, my parents won't let me call him they think that i am crazy for dating someone shorter and younger than i am. but, he is only a few months behind me. i don't understand why they do this. i don't understand why they hate him, they haven't met him at all. no one in my family has. they tell me not to judge a book by it's cover, but isn't what they are doing here? i know that i am not the only one to feel this way. many girls my age do. but, my boyfriend and i are really in love you see and, no one can stop that. no one. not you not my parents. no one but me can break our relationship no one at all ~p6evilsquirell~
