a new house means (possibly) a new career, haha. anyway, after some weeks of non-competitive running (=jogging) i participated in the gießener frühjahrsläufe and clocked with a 1:22:50 for the half marathon, i.e. 4th rank in total, not to bad for such an old guy ;-) with execellent weather i really enjoyed it (possibly except the last 2k).
