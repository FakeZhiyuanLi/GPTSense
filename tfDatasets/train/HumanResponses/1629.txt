i completed the ogden marathon in a pr 3:28:25 (3:27:46 by my watchthe timekeeper apparently gave everyone the same start time). keys to achieving this pr were: 1) speedwork at the local track. 8 miles of 2 mile repeats at 30 seconds slower than 5k pace, with 1 lap rest in between. 2) plyometrics. i used the 4 exercises described in runner's world: bounding, skipping, etc. 3) 23-mile long run. the longest long training run i've ever done. 4) marathon race pace band. this allowed me to focus less on mile-by-mile pace and more on keeping on track for the overall target i set of 3:30:00. next up: telford financial half marathon on may 31 in farmington.
