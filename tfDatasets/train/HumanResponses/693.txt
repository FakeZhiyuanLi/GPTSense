hey its me again your favorite blogger. well it's still thurday 3 june and 21.04 gmt. i am watching t.v with the one person i want to spend the rest of my life. i was watching a webcast on bbc online while my lady was watching emmerdale, corrie and eastenders. well this is what she watches everyday after work. she is so beautiful but truly, i don't trust her. not like i'm feeling unsecure in somewhat, but when in my past i was labelled as a playboy, i believe in what goes around comes around. sky is getting darker now over brixton south london. i am planning on leaving this place as soon as possible because i don't feel like my lady and son are in a safe neighbourghood. anyway, right now we are watching beetlegues or whatever you spell it. this is another day in as i lost my credit card and bank card and no cash on me (but rich in the bank). i am still doing my website i will post the link once eady so keep on reading for now peace. god bless you all
