what should you do when the baby is sleeping? finish the laundry or start a blog? i guess you've figured out which way i went. for those who don't know me i'm the mom of six kids age 8 months up to 12 years. there are three girls and three boys but so far no sign of alice the maid or any other maid for that matter. this weekend is the festival in our small town so i need to get cakes baked for a cake walk, wash ball shirts for those in the parade, find change for the kiddie carnival tomorrow and find mosquito spray since the oldest three kids will want to hang around downtown afater the parade tonight. stay tuned, tomorrow may be more interesting!
