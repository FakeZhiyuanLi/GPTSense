mood: tired music: billy talent well i'm back in already. went to mcdonalds for 2 mcbacon rolls and a chocolate milkshake. milkshake wouldn't come out the straw, but using 2 straws as chopsticks seemed to work well. the park was pretty wwet, but the 6ft was skateable. almost fell on my face doing a feeble stall in the mini bowl. andy found that quite amusing. so i'm back home already. ross might be coming over later to practice some songs for our gig at the barfly on the 12th august. possibility of going camping tomorrow to loch lomond but i dunno if i can be bothered.
