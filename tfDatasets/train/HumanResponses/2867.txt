as you know, today is good friday, and do you know what it meansit means that today is a holiday, silly(to people who do not know what it means). i'm dying of boredness i have nothing to do except to sit down on the couch and stare in to the television i can't be doing that all day right? so, i have asked my friends out butthey"re all going somewhere with their familiesit's totally unfair. and its all becuz of my grandmothershe is the most weirdest granny in the whole entire universe. i dunno how to say it but she is just the .weird. not only weird but irritating. my brother was sleeping so comfortably with his saliva coming out of his mouth in his bed at 6.58 p.m. suddenly, my granny shouted at him to wake up as seh said this, " its not good to sleep in the afternoon". i mean whats wrong in sleeping. everything my family and i do is wrong to her. she always wants us to follow her god damm way of doing things. as i've told you, irritating i hate my life
