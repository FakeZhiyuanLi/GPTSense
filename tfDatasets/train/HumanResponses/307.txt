starting on a different web page design today. hopefully the site will be up by the end of this month. today i've been wondering about what to do this summer. i have a few options in mind but need to get going if i want to do any of it. summer is coming soon. work life thoughts: i wonder how come people seem to have an builtin ability to find something to nag about went it comes to their employer. as soon as you get higher up in the system you nag about the ones one step above you. at the same time the ones below you in the hierarchy keep on nagging about you and you all of a sudden think this should no longer take place since you are not one of "them" anymore. funny how no one seems to see the fact that this is an evil circle and that nothing good will come out of it. i am not claiming to be without blame for the continuum of this circle, but i definitely think it all should stop. this circle is probably the number one cause of bad teamwork.wonder who invented the whole thought :)
