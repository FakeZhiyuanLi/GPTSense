i have a voice. i just don't use it. i have opinions. they scare the hell out of me. i got caught saying it aloud last week. "i don't care if i win, i just want to be right." there was only one right answer and i had it. i knew i it. so i went after it. i insisted. i demanded. i screamed out. i made a nuisance of myself. and as a bonus, i won. usually there is no right answer. i am afraid. i stay silent. i shut down. i disappear. and i lose.
