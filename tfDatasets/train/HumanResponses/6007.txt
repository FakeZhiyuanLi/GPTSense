well, may 28th, 2004. g-day. techtv and g4 merge. to form one network. g4techtv. very original name ain't it? so far i've seen only one techtv show on, which was x-play. at 7 the screen savers will be back, thank god they didn't get canned. anime unleashed will be on tonight at midnight and will be running for a few hours. before that unscrewed with martin sargent and laura swisher. basically, the best and some of the worst (like robot wars etc.) was carried over from techtv and g4 took all their (in my opinion, shitty) shows and slapped a new logo on the tv station. great.
