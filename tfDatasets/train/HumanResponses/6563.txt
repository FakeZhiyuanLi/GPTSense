been listening to evanescence's "my immortal". i've listened to it before, but its meaning hasn't resonated with me more than now. i've been feeling rather lonely. it's simple, mostly just amy lee singing and the piano. this is probably my favorite type of music. savage garden's "two bed's and a coffee machine" is another good example of how well voice and piano do together, but alone.
