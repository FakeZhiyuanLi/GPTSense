i love being lazy! spent most of today watching the magic roundabout . trippy or what, eh? anyway. got " hat full of sky " today (latest kids book by the master pterry {terry pratchett}). read it in about 3 hours. darn good book. bloody library though. i mean, i get my notification that the book's in by text message, and i got it at ten o'clock. so i cycled down. and was the library open? was it hell! doesn't open 'till two on a wednesday. so, back home, and then back out again at two. oh well. tomorrow i'm going up to whitam to stuff envelopes and stuff for my mum. speaking of mum's, why does the quicktype on nokia phones put 'nun' up before 'mum'? stupid. anyway, she works as the secretary for fundraising or something like that for farleigh hospice. i really can't think of much else to write. if i have a brainwave, i'll let you know. chow
