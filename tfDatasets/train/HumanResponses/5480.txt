i don't really know what i'm doing here, but i'm always looking for new stuff to do, so why not start a blog. everybody else is right. i just moved onto a houseboat. my boat's named "cool breeze", hence the name of my blog. i'm living out in a beautiful area and really want to rediscover some things that i haven't been into for a long time like hiking and photography, perhaps this will be a good place to post some pictures. i'm not really into country music, but i've heard a song on the radio recently where this guy's singing about the next thirty years of his life. to paraphrase, "it's time to start drinking a little less beer and a lot more lemonade." that's kind of where my life's at right now. life is good, but i'm 36 and single and that needs to change. i'm tired of being alone. i've learned that sowing your wild oats doesn't reap a whole lot.
