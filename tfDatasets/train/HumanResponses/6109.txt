well another race ending under caution. that was no one's fault but it ruined the ending. kasey looked like he was gonna catch ryan and make it a photo finish. finally the 88 has a good finish and so did the 38! next week road racing. in indy, ralph suffers a bad hit but is all right. montoya disqualified! oh and schumie won.
