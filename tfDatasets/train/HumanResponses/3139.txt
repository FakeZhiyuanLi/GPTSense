i just woke up at 11:30. was up till 1:30 am last night. i finally saw spider man 2, good stuff. i would say it and the last one were the same because they were both good in a diffrent way. i will probably be seeing it again. 4th of july will be fun. i am going to angel stadium to see an angel vs. dodgers game. emily will be there too, i think shes stalking me. (hahaha *pokes emily*) i am still working on that poem. going to write a love one, a sorry one, and probably some more love ones.
