in my dream the artist is an older man. he is brown from the sun and solid. he has the typical etched lines in his face and a shock of fuzzy white hair symbolic of relaxed wisdom and gentle age. this person holds weight; this person has left marks. he sees something in me that i don't see. a seed. a spark. talent. potential. call it what you will. i am a pale little girl thing. i am not wise. i drift and bounce; i leave no impression. he wants to cultivate my potential as one cultivates a plant. he rains down supplies and instruction upon me. a shower of ink and paper and brushes and pens and paint and "look inside yourself" and "stay open". he is excited. he thinks something beautiful is going to blossom. i feel bad because he is wrong, but i don't know how to tell this wise man that he has made a mistake. i am not the person he thinks i am. there is no spark here. i am pale. i am nothing. i am empty. in my dream. he insists. who am i to argue?
