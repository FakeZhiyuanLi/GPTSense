i can't believe myself! i nearly forgot to blog at all today! curse myself *shoots*. actually, that's conter-productive because then i wouldn't be able to blog at all. some strange person has contacted me through my site, i'm becoming more and more scared of numerous people finding it. why would they? :s. it's scary. there's nothing on there at all. but for some reason, i was persuaded by him. well. reminded to update it in someway, so i've finally got a nice background image for it. i could have used one of the world wide wong ones, but i made a new one that also says "nathan's site" on it. i've cut writing this far too short. i might have to add something later or something similar, write it on the other computer. actually, i'll come on later. chow for now!
