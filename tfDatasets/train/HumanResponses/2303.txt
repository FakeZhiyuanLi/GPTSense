i'm sitting here, half awake. thinking that in just a few short hours i will have my senior orientation. i have no idea what i should be feeling. the best way to describe my emotion right now would be fear, mixed with curiosity and excitement. i also have a feeling of hope that things will work out. i really don't know the problems but i think a lot of them will be solved this year. it is kind of sad that most of these people i won't talk to again. i'm also shocked that i'm already done with three years of high school. i hope that everyone has matured. hopefully the days of stupid comments are over. plus if the maturity level will be high then people will stop being so shallow and self centered. it will be fun to see everyone again. i hope my classes are fill with friends. or life could be very dull. and what is the point of leading a dull life. life is to beautiful to waste. oh well. time to go. bye ~~~ phydeaux
