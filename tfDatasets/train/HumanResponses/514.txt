as i listen to the torments of his life as i hear his goodbyes as the sun fades into the clouds as i see him running from the pain he hides it under his pillow his pillow is a place for his secrets he lays apon them everynight and keeps the pain close to his heart his love is male and so is he he feels the rejection of family and piers and crys he crys rivers onto the tears that any of us cry he is sadden by the thought of he he is him and thats all he needs to see i dont think i like that poem does oit even make since?
