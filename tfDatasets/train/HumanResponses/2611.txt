so i just signed up for this so i could respond to dan's posts, but then i thought instead of boring my friends by making them listen to the minutia of my life, i would make them read it here instead.so let's see.since that usually involves dogs, it's only appropriate to start with a dog story. last night i got home to discover that my foster had shit in his crate. i was up until 2 am taking him outside while he vomited/crapped and cleaning up his crate/doing laundry. now i have to leave work at 2:30 to take him to the vet. enjoy!
