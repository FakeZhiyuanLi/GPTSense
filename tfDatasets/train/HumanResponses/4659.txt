i made it to 5:15am on sunday morning after a "summer" party - alcohol cannot kill me, or at least short term it couldn't . great fun thanks to the guys and hege ;) not much happening today, sitting in the country again working a smidgen more than one usually does, but working none the less. watched denmark make total arses of themselves in football last night. jeez how can a team play that lazily and only lose 3-0. thanks czech republic for not making it a total laugh.
