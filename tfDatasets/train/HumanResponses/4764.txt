what an exhausting day! had rotc for the second time at this new training centre (situated in the middle of nowhere at don muang). had to do 30 pushups when we arrived off our buses, and was forced marched into the centre for about three yards before we were stopped and ordered to do 30 additional pushups-in the middle of the road. as we wearily trudged our way in, the drill instructors ordered us to do pushups again, goddammit. started the day off with a uniform-and-equipment check; 95% of the two companies were forced to do "excercises" for any breach of uniform regulations (untight boots, unbuttoned pockets, un-shiny belt buckles, long finger nails, long haircuts, noticeable moustaches, and anything else that one can think of).
