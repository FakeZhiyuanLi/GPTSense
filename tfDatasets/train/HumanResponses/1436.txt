i knew when i first fell in love, you were so different and sure, muscles showing through your shirt, and a smile just for me. you laughed at my corny jokes, shared your music in the halls, took me out and claimed me yours, and gave me the world. i knew when i gave up on love, when the tears began to flow, spending more time with your friends, i was just your whore. i had changed too much for you, needs you couldn't full-fill (sp) dreams you wouldn't be part of, we grew apart by miles. i know that i can love another, when my soul is fully healed, when my heart stitches together - all the pieces that it lost. slowly you fade from my veins, whispers of forever - gone, promises of love - forgotten, i will be happy and survive, learning to breathe on my own.
