there is no need for a moral dilemna. just think this. if a and b are opposites, a and b cannot both be true without being contradictory. only a or b can be true. in conclusion, there must be absolute truth. therefore, anyone who preaches that one can reach salvation through more than one path (religion) is a liar. god is the only way; there can be no other. christianity claims to be the only way; it only remains for one either to accept it or reject it. i have more to say, but it would just be too much. anyone who wants to know more can mail me through the link below. click on my name.
