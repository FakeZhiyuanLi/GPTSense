i want to use this blog to help organize a few ideas which have developed over the last few years. essentially, just as physicists seek a grand unified theory to combine the strong, weak, electro-magnetic, and gravitational forces, i'm looking for something of a grand unified theory of the humanities . this is no small task, to be sure. i have no or little formal training for such a task. i have done a fair amount of reading and a hell of a lot of thinking about this issue (or about these issues, if you will). but if i don't organize and communicate them, my efforts won't do anyone any good. the first few blogs will, most likely, attempt to discern a natural hierarchy, a method bywhich blogs are best organized.
