it was such a nice day outside (for once!) that i just had to spend it all in the sun.so i took the dog for a nice long walk and went swimming and lazed about in the sun, it was wonderful! i feel so relaxed and nice now. oh, and i got my mug that i had painted at color me mine today, it looks so much better than i thought it would the lady there said it looked awesome, it made me feel so good, i'm so happy right now.
