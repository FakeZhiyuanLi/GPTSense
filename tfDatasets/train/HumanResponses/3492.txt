yesterday 2 friends slept over and we had a "pijamada", was cool. stayed up untill 4am talking. this weekend is gonna be very quiet just gonna spend it with friends. maybe tomorrow sunday we'll go to a mountain called "chipinque" to hike. too bad i don't have a camera. i'm kinda sleepy now i didn't get to sleep much. so i think i'll take a nap.
