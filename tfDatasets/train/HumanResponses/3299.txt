hey, peeps, just heard today that that accursed "president" of ours' tax cut bill is giving tax credits to all sorts of parents *except* the poor who actually *need* it. how stupid can you get? and this from a "president" who claims he won't leave a single child behind well, at least the democrats are many of them in an uproar about it, which counts for something. but how can we get rid of w. and his filthy crew? and *why* on earth is w. seemingly so popular? it makes *no* sense at all. *none* it makes me feel sick.
