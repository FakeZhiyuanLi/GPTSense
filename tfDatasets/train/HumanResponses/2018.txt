beauty in life. but in death? are they the same? yes, i think they are because one may walk in death yet be alive. the spark that dwells within is not gone, but shines with a new luminosity. what then is learned? what is known? perhaps a chance to embrace the darkness. to balance it with the light. to truly know thyself, one must be willing to embrace all. form changeth not, yet change is a constant. i grow and prosper: only when i am willing to be all, but who am i? ~ anakya
