went to the movies with my daughter, lisa. she’s a huge fan of m. night shyamalan, so we’ve been looking forward to seeing the village. stopped at starbucks for coffee on this rare saturday with her at home. she’s working toward her master’s while working 2 full time jobs, so usually she has classes on the weekends. she has a few weeks now between the end of summer session and the beginning of the fall, so we’ve been able to spend some time together.
