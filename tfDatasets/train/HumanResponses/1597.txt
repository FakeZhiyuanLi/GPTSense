my mommy made me stay home today because she says im spending too mucch time at katlyn's. i feel like i've missed so much, but maybe it's good im not spending so much time over there. she's probably getting pretty sick of having me around all the time, i know i would be. anyhow, i'm leaving for alabama thursday and i won't be back 'til sunday so i wont be postin tween now and then. unless something big pops up. i'll check ya later on. i love you katy bear!
