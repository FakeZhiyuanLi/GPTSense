i can't sleep i dreamt that i'm lost in this buildings with my friends the other night there's chaos everywhere but we don't know what was happening. we just follow the crowd. when we reached this highway bridge, i saw han's in front. i wanted to go after him, but suddenly a war just broke out, i was hit by a laser gun. then i just slowly collasped. my soul was still around, but i can't find han, my friends or any of my families hmm. wonder what dreams will i get tonight? i have a very bad feeling about it. gd night everyone sweet dreams.
