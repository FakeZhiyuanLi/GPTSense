last night the funniest thing happened. i came home from work and heard a faint meowing from the backyard. i rushed to the edge of the woods, worried that it might be the cat. sure enough. he was stuck in a tree. he gave me this look that said it all: "what the hell am i doing stuck in a tree? i am a cat! this is what we do!" he appeared to be embarrassed. the best part of this story: perhaps it was sheer coincidence, but there was a family of mice below. was my cat really frightened so badly by mice to spend the entire evening in a tree? maybe.of course, i helped him down. (note: this has happened to me, minus the mice)
