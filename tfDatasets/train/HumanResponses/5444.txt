this paper has given me so many problems.first, i could not find the guide lines on the computer. then after i found them the printer would not print. so i went to the home and just started to write the paper. i got all the way though the paper then the printer started to work. that is when i realize that the paper was on the wrong subject. how in the world did i write a paper on the wrong subject? i still don't know. at this point you think it could not get any worst right, wrong.
