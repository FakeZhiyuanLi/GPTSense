everybody is starting their holiday now, but me! but i can't complain because i don't work and don't go to school. if i just had money life would be great. €€€€ always the problem :) one of my friends just bought a turntable, it's catching on. by the way if you want the best lps insound.com they are just so great, and they don't even pay me to say this.
