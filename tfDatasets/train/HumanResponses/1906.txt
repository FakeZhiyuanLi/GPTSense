not sure if i'm gonna be discipline updating myself online. life's hard not being at home most of the time. talking about freedom, i'm not sure this is what i wanted all my life. maybe it's just someone else's dream i'm following thru. life's a bitch esp when u've got a piece of skin tore off ur thumb. esp ur master hand. did u know that u use 70% of ur thumb for most of the work u do try living a life without a thumb. life's hard especially when i can't type fast. freak
