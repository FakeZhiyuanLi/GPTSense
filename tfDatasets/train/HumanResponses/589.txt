as of july 14th a new year started for me. i decided to make a personal new year resolution which would be to do different things. not necessarily any awkward crazy things, just things i had never done before. so far i've accomplished (in no particular order): * went to the spa (splurged) * ate shark * went on "maid of the mist", niagara falls * got rear ended in a car accident (nothing serious) it's a good start. hope to still have much more stuff to add to the list.
