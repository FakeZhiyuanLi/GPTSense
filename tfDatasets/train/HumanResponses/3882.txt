freedom is just around the corner. freedom from devin and gabriella's athletic and academic schedules that is. now if they just weren't so social like their dad. let me tell you this, if any of your children ask you if they could join track say anything to dissuade them devin and gabriella have participated in soccer, basketball, gymnastics, swimming and volleyball to name the majors but never track, until this year! yeesh! i have never spent so much time at an event as i have with track. a minimum of 3 hours to watch devin run the 55m hurdle (best time : 10.7s) and 400m relay (55:78s) with the varsity team which is all 8th graders (i am mom! hear me brag!). anyhoo, my evenings are now somewhat free pending on the degree of whining, bartering and sucking up from our rugrats richard and i can withstand.
