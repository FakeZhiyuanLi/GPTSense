so the day starts out normal. i wake up at 6:30. standard. i make pancakes for cuz. not standard. the i get free time from cuzes. so i call my friend. and she says" hey chaz" my response is standard and i get the standard answer: not much. so i ask her if she can do something; her anser: no i am busy all day. wat pisses me off is when i know for a fact that she isn't busy so i am spending another boring day alone. then i have to go get clothes: again boring. then i get free time from rents. finally. i am thinking i will go skateboard to starbucks and get something to drink. starbucks is good for me. well thats me signing off. the time is right you both lean close you touch and kiss it is heavenly you can't describe it but you and your lover both feel the same delirious with passion burning with fiery emotion emotion full of love this passion is fueled by the first kiss rebel for life
