i woke up today and i realized. my uh. money is really tied up in other investments ( hee hee), so how am i gonna manage quitting my job? well, i'm working on some things and i'm waiting to hear back on some of the results this evening. i am scared y'all. for real. i'm tryng not to get caught up in the negative "what ifs", but it's really hard! if i didn't live here, this would be so much easier for me. this hellhole is hella hard to get your side hustle on in. i'm not giving up yet though. *sigh*
