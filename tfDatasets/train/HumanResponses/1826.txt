a quote made by ronald reagan from his "a time for choosing" speech made in 1964: he said liberals refuse to acknowledge that the choice is not between "peace and war, only between fight and surrender." he added that liberals tell us "if we only avoid any direct confrontation with the enemy, he will forget his evil ways and learn to love us," (a la jimmy carter). all who disagree with the peace crowd are "indicted as warmongers. let's set the record straight. there is no argument over the choice between peace and war, but there is only one guaranteed way you can have peace - and you can have it in the next second - surrender ." this was made in reference to soviet russia, but i think it applies to our current state of affairs very well.
