today i went to cr's place, and he made a lovely dinner for me and pat, get a chance to meet his lovely wife and adorable baby. i've been contemplating that if i should drop all i have in the state and go back home to j to see if we can work something out. many of my friend said that i should move on, but i just can't get her out of my mine, i know that i love her very much. there a line from a movie i saw it was 'true love lasts a life time' maybe j's my true love after allis it worth the risk?
