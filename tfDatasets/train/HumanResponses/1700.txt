cake is recent years has lost popularity, why is this? i believe that the modern height of cake was the early 20'th century when all the western world was united in praise of cake. then they lost popularity. some say it was eh war, some say the war was caused by the loss of cake poularity, but i say that the two are one and the same. when cake sales dropped the french pastry market suffered and the germans no longer had the cake there society required to remain powerful. inflation rised and the country was in shambles, leading to ww1. if cake had remained as popular france would have had slightly more power and germany would have been more stable and the world would have been ushed into a golden age of world peace and enlightenment, but wiht the loss of cake sales this can never be. don't agree with me? i'd like to see you come up wiht a better explanation!
