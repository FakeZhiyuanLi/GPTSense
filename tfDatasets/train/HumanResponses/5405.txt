my cousin got caught sneaking out last night. i was suppose to go with but i needed my sleep. i also had a feeling that something was gonna happen. he took out his brother's new camry and drove it at like 1 or 2 in the morning. he picked up two of our other friends and drove to saratoga to see his potential gf. haha. before he snuck out of his house, he was in the backyard and the birds in the backyard started squealing which woke up his brother to find his car missing. he went to check up on his brother and thought he was sleeping but it was just pillows. they called the cops to report a missing car. i can't anything else or they will use this as evidence.hahahaha
