pain why do i exist, on my own it hurts like a fragmented bone the worst black nightmare i scream blue without your touch i feel untrue i need your touch, for this i dream i need your soul, to hold you near. with you near, my soul will beam without you here, my soul does tear i know you are the one for me to be with you, will set me free life is not life, without you here and to lose you, my greatest fear.
