this has been bothering me for some time now. sat in damons lounge passing the famous jay a long and tiring chat over what to dunk in our tea started. two choics came up. jaffa cakes and kit kats. and the question is, at what point can a snack that can be dunked in milk or good old tea be called a biscuit. we all know that jaffa cakes are not a biscuit even though they claim on the packaging that it is. its far to spongey, not enough crispiness or crunchiness to be a real biccie. the point of this is where would you place a kit kat? would it be a chocolate or a biscuit. i for one firmly believe the snack in question is by all means a biscuit. there is no way in hell it belongs in the fridge next to the snickers or yorkies. i feel that if you are the type of person that decides to eat the kit kat as a chocolate and not the biscuit it so rightly deserves to be then you are infact a dick. roarahahhahaha! word trilby
