i used to come to work and commute near this highschool. usually got there around one of the class breaks. lots of girls would be chattering outside near the fence loud, about what highschool girls chat: clothes, guys, sex. when the bell rang, the asteroids came: about 10-15 cigarette butts, thrown nonchalantly on the other side of the fence simultaneously, among the feet of sidewalkers, like small red-lit meteors ignited by highschool atmosphere and the presence of chicks. they described gracious arcs from the girls' fingers, all together over the fence like air dolphins, and lay smoking on the other side until the next break came. i used to teach to girls that age. :(
