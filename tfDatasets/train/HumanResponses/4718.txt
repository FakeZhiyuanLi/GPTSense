have you ever noticed how fate seemes to get in the way most of the time? i mean really it is always changing things from how they should look, to a completly different situation! i would have to say that the person in charge, of fate that is, should be shot serveral times. i though fate was supose to help me, not fuck up my life. it is getting really anoying. now i have to spend the weekend arguing with my cousins, hot fun! o well i guess i just have to deal with it.
