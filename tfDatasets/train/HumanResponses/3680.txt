in the beginning, there was a blank page, and then enrickay said, let there be blog! and there was blog! but blog was empty and boring. then enrickay said, im going to bed its 2 in the flippin morning! and so he went to bed. only to return the next day to fill blog with wonderful things. (or not so wonderful things, whichever mood he happens to be in.) quote de randomo: "don’t take life too seriously; you’ll never get out alive."
