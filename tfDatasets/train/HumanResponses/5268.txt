wow you're a retard. hopefully, someday, someone will knock some sense into you and you'll finally realize that we aren't meant to be together. did it really take, oh god, how many times did we go out? i dunno but did it really take 3 years for you to realize that? and still. so in*n*out is the best. try the french fries well-done. seriously. it's like, cooked crispy potatoes. with some salt. and stuff. but seriously, try it. yea. guys are confusing. could someone maybe write a book on the male species? or at least leave me a comment or something to help me out? much appreciated. thanks ^_^
