as i lay in my bed this morning i couldn't help but think, "damn you money." this because of me not being in maryland with joe. but alas, even if i had made it to otakon, i wouldn't have any money to buy anime there. maybe i could take on a second job. but then again i wouldn't have any free time if i did that. o! the struggles of the american teenager, so much freedom, so little ambition. maybe things would be different if i were starving somewhere in a rice paddy. but probably not.
