yeah so i'm really bored right now so i decided to post again. have you ever heard of the pop rocks and coke rumor thing? ya know, if you swallow pop rocks with coke or any other soda, that it will make your stomach explode? well, one of my friends was talking about it and i felt brave so i did it. i bought a pack of pop rocks (mmm. strawberry) and a 1 litre of dr. pepper (dr. pepper is my form of crack tasty, and legal) i put the whole pack in my mouth and took a big swig of the dr. pepper. the pop rocks popped all the way down my throat! it feels funny, but i'm not dead :) in all this i got 2 things a new favorite snack and 5 dollars! ;)
