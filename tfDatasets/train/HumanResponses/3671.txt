so chemistry was lame today. i came into it during the lesson. maya and patrick were in here, which was cool. i actually did work, which is always a first, and i did a page for my chemistry analysis. lame. my musical is next week today! i'm gonna die so badly. i don't know all my lines yet, but i know most, i haven't even done one of my songs. i'm the lead and i hate surreya because she just hijjacked my computer and posted and i had to edit it. lame. i spelled her name wrong on purpose by the way. i say lame too much. lame. i wonder how kathryn did on her french exam. she must have finished by now. speaking of french exams i swear i have my listening (which i will fail) next. la. not good. i love this new blog. it's so cool. i can say whatever i want on it, it looks respectable (not as good as scribblejournal but much better then my old blogontheweb, unlike yas's which looks amasing. windows xp), and it has a decent comment system, so make the most of it! woo!
