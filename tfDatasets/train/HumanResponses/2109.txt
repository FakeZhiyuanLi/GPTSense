so i came in to lab meeting late because apparently my time is not as important as the county health department's physician. james looked up at me with half a smile and raised his eyebrows, i just had to say it then "bon jour james!".no response. some brain giant called 7 times trying to send a fax to the lab, (s)he finally realized it was not a fax number. the fax tone is something probably used in guantanamo to make detainees talk. sequencher is freaking $3400+. i guess we are stuck with a single user copy. my jeans are all of a sudden baggy, and no i have not lost weight (no way i am wasting my calories!). coca-cola came up with "low-carb" coke.i guess this is just another sign of the apocalypse. and yet another mental midget working at mcdonald's in the mall but that's an insignificant story. today's games were good.the hell with work, god bless online streaming tv (again). and yeah, eap, is now master eap.
