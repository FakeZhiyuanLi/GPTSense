well, the prologue for the tdf is this weekend, and i was talking to my buddy mathy and decided that the whole world should benefit from my observations and insights as lance rides for his 6th tour. so, here it is. i hope to make a daily commentary and celebrate at the end with a victory for lance in le tour.
