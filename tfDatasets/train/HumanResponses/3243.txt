catching rainbows if i could catch a rainbow i would do it just for you and share with you its beauty on the days you're feeling blue if i could build a mountain you could call your very own a place to find serenity a place to be alone if i could take your troubles i would toss them in the sea but all these things i'm finding are impossible for me i cannot build a mountain or catch a rainbow fair but let me be what i know best a friend that's always there this is a hug certificate
