was one of the worst days of my life. i'm not going to go into too much detail, but lets just say my brother attacked my mother, my father, and his wife with guns. not just attacked em, but loaded em and pointed it at them and threatened to kill us all if we called the police. but that's just what i did. everyone has huge bruises, there's damage to the home, the property, the truck, and to the sense of safety i once had here. the police came in droves when they did, 10+ cop cars in full swat gear. it was the safest i've felt in years. but now i can't sit here comfortably without being ready for a quick exit if for some reason he comes back. if he's let out early again, i will be leaving. i can't stay in the same area with him and feel safe with my life. i'll talk more about the details in real life.
