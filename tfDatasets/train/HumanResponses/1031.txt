alright now boys and girls, this one will be short. do not go see "the day after tomorrow." it sucked my ass with 8 straws. it had a good idea, but bad presentation. there was really nothing to fear except for the evil frost, which in all reality is not that scary. and there were these fake-ass wolves that really sucked ass. i don't know, maybe you'll like it, maybe i just suck. if you liked this movie, watch out for the sequel."the day after the day after tomorrow: looks like rain" quote of the day: "fuck is a 4 letter word. rape is a 4 letter word. love is a 4 letter word. fuck is a curse. so is love." augustus hill p.s. i don;t believe that.love kicks ass, i just like the quote because it sounds cool and says fuck a lot.
