well h-dawg said i should sign up so i did. and here i am. just testing it out. i dunno how faithfull i will be to this, or how serious. but i shall try my best. school is soon to finish which is good and bad. nice to finish up, but sad at the same time becasue friendships will be lost.(and maybe relationships) but we will see how it goes. play it a day at a time. im gonna steal holletts idea about his mood with the song lyrics, but instead i will put down the name of a song and the band/singer. "alice in chains - goodbye dont follow"
