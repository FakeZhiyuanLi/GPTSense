what if i said that.i wanted to leave this earth for just one day, to experience what its like to not have to worry about anything? would you let me go? would you let me reach for the stars.let me achieve everything i ever wanted? do you care enough about me to see what im worth? or do you just sit in your self centred world and sulk? i have no idea what im trying to say here. except for maybe were not right for each other? maybe we shouldnt talk to eachother. maybe we need to distince ourselves until the world falls down on us.what if.
