okay, so yeah i'm new to "blogging" but i get the general concept of it all. a lot of bitchin' and complain' then some funny jokes and moment to remember for life. so, this entry is about my new job at the home depot. it is a major pain in the ass. the paint department was alright, just learning where things were and what kind of finish the customer wanted was the hardest part. but, the powers that be decided there wasn't enough labor $ in paint so they sent me to the hardware department. the only thing i know about hardware is a gay boy shouldn't be working in it. i spend roughly 3 hours a day just trying to find someone else to answer a customer question about something. i do enjoy when i actually know about what they want, and then where i can find what they are looking for. however, it never fails an older man will walk up to me asking what kind of lag screw will fit in his storm window, and then do we have stainless steal or galvanised ugh!
