i just got offered a contract extension until 22 october. which is great because it'll mean that i don't have to spend my travelling money living at my mum's house until i leave. it also means that i'll get to stay in edinburgh for another few weeks (there may be reasons for this you know.). the only problem is that i might actually have to do some work now! i'm sick fed up of decorating. i've spent the last few weeks painting, filling and sanding in preparation for selling the flat. i can't put into words how much i detest diy. i don't know how people can do this for fun. how many people do you see who spend their weekends in b&q? i've got far better things to do with my time - and far more fun things too.
