which way do we spin? good question. and does it make a difference? possibly. why else would we be so crazed and idiotic? i know that in my life many people i've met were affected by the tides. but hey, that's getting off on a tangent. then that begs the question: is there a counter-clockwise? if you look at it from the other side, like through glass, is it clockwise? or is it still counter-clockwise? you may be able to tell that i think out of the box. welcome to my world and the world of most other people. rock on.
