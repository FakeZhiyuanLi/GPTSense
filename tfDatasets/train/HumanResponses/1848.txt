hello again everyone! welcome to the "viral cartoon show", and this is where all the traffic from kakutama +3 is going to focus for a while. some of us are still fighting with each other, while the rest of us have moved on. i am talking about how my sister is still bothering mute about how he never takes any risks. that is for another time though, back to describing this cool new website. it is a project at the moment, and mute shall be joining me soon. he was the first one to jump aboard on my brand new idea for a website. then when michelle heard about how mute was joining me, she decided to tag along. the mysterious adam (michelle lives with him) also has started to show some interest in the world of the internet. maybe he is going to jump on the band wagon also!
