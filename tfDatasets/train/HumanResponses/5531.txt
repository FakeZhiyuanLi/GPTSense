watched [stuart little] on tv! stuart's an adorable orphaned mouse, who was adopted by the little family. (who keep a pet cat). a mouse with a pet cat! he's even got a really nice red carbriolet! (that's a roofless car.) how come stuart gets to drive, even though he's not yet 16? i want my driving license! after that, watched [selena]. brilliant movie, about the life story of selena, played by jlo. pity selena died in the end, she was shot. great person, great voice. if she'd lived, she'd be gloria estefan the second.
