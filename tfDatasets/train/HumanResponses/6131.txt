i have to drive about 80 miles three days a week to get to class but because i live in southern california traffic is a pain in the ass. so what do i do, i leave at 4am for a 745am class. i get to santa monica about 515am and just sorta hang out until class starts. under normal circumstances i wouldn't go to school so far but i was already going there when my roomate and i had a falling out-i could win a worst roommate contest hands down-and thus i moved into my mothers house in riverside and i haven't found a place to stay yet. soon, maybe over the summer break i will get a place and in the fall i wont have to dive so freaking much. gas is $2.60/gallon for premium. its adds up.
