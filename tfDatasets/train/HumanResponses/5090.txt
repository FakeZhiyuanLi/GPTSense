as a new attempt to blog, this one appears to be heading for disaster like the first one. oh well, easy come, easy go, i guess. i have tried using some of the other sites, but i can't seem to get past one or two posts before i lose interest, or the desire to maintain anything of substance. in real-life, i can ramble on and never say anything of great importance, but for some reason, when it comes to online, i get stage fright or something.not really sure why that is. it irritates me to no end sometimes. well, i will try to write more later. (we'll see how that goes.)
