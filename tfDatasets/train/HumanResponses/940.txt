i'm wondering when peoplethe ones that write fluff pieces or profiles or think up the slant for a personality pieceare going to get tired of using the "he's so uncool that he's cool" angle. am i too cynical? i don't htink so. i'm just tired of "you know, this fellow is doing all the things we know are uncool, yet the net result is.well.folks, it's cool!" can we just, as a society, acknowledge that we all know that geeks are cool; underplaying anything is cool; independent loners, especially (not "even") when they don't wear the latest fashions, are cool. i'm tired of being told that contrary to what i might think, these things are actually cool. thank you, i'm done.
