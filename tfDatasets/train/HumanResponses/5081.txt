can you believe it? chelsea walked right past me like i didn't even exist today that's soooo ghetto! i thought for sure my new hat would make her notice. i wore it backwards like mike said and everything. i don't get it. if it's not my hat, then what the heck?! maybe i'm too tall for her to see the logo way up there. it can't be my brown hair, she hasn't seen it. i always wear a hat. but erika told mike she likes brown hair anyway, and brown eyes. i got both. so what then? i better call mike later for more advice. i better make her notice soon, or i'll have another ghetto summer sitting at home with no one to go to the mall or fun central with. i better call mike. he'll know what to do. peace out.
