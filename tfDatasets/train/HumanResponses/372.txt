hi rob/dean, here is the starting of what i'm sure will be a lemgthy collection of blogs about youth small groups at bramalea baptists church (otherwise known as "d-teams") we need to set cirriculim based on 2 major opinions: 1) knowledge that we want to pass on to the students to help them in their faith and help starting really good discussions with other students and friends (christian or not) 2) listen to the students, their questions, struggles and successes. two of our favorite books are c.s. lewis, "mere christianity", and brian d mclaren's "new kind of christian" both of these focus on who god is, and what/how we can relationship to god. we have traditionally started with the "why believe in a god?" followed up with if you believe in god, what kind of god do you believe in? (attributes of the biblical god) is this the direction that you are looking to pursue this year? - kevin
