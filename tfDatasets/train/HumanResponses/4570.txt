the weather that's typical of the season has reasserted itself. in other words, the skies are grey and the rain's pouring down. i spotted a number of fairly miserable-looking cyclists this morning, one of whom, clad only in a t-shirt and shorts, looked particularly unhappy. it made me very glad that i was kitted up in a full set of waterproofs. i managed to feel somewhat superior when i arrived at work to see people making a dash from their cars to the building and getting throughly soaked while i strolled casually along, remaining completely dry. well there have to be some advantages to riding a motorbike on a day like today.
