ol' rusty it's a running joke, this truck of mine. it's grey and green and black with time. it sputters with the intent of going, but it wheezes and it soon is slowing. but it's my comrade, it's ol' rusty. never mind the window's dusty. keep it floored, forget the brakes, hold fast the door, ignore the quakes, adjust the clutch every five feet; detour stoplights, and where roads meet. it's me and ol' rusty down highway 64. one hand driving, one holding the door. so, that's today's poem! see whats up later!
