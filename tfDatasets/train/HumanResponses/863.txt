i really haven't been writing anything in here because i've been having a hard time with some stuff. i've been in this mood where i feel nothing can go right and nothing will get better. i've been treating people like crap too and thats so not cool. i want answers to my questions, but i know i can't ask them cuz they could mess upi something that i hold so dear to me. i've had this question in my head for some time. i've been telling myself in my head, should i ask it or leave it alone. it's been like that in my head for the last week. i don't know what it is. all i know is that i need to stop acting the way i am and move on. that's really the best thing right now. but it's not going to be easy for me to do. oh well. i got to go now. i feel like making food for my family.
