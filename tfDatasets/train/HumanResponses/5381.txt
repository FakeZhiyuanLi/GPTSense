she’s young, pretty, and show’s no cleavage. (which means she is not slutty like other pop stars.) jojo is the newest pop star on the scene and she is awesome. with her fist single- leave (get out) she is makin' thousand’s of people across the united states dance in their seats (if not get up and dance!) thank go she is not another britney or christina. god knows we don’t need another one of them. jojo is one of the best singers of our time right now and she’s only a teen. note: she didn’t sleep her way into the business *cough* britney * cough* christina * cough*. she made it on pure talent. keep it going jojo
