i'm due to start the first chapter of [secret snowfall] very soon. yes, i know what you're thinking. i've been going on about it for so long and i still haven't even written a single chapter? i totally agree that i'm way behind time. but my weekday afternoon schedule's packed to the brim, and there's school in the morning. the only time i'm free, nowadays, is the weekends, but lately those have been full up, too. so it's been quite a bit of a squeeze these few days, and now that i finally get time. see if i can complete three chapters by the end of this week!
