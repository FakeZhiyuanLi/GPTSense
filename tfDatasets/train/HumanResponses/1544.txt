so i guess i'm going to try to make a effort to post in this thing so here goes. mike and joe slept over last night, which was cool, but we really didn't do much of anything. mike stayed up till 5 playing playstaition, i fell asleep at 2ish and as usual joe was out by some stupidly early time. we then went to net 24 (aka geeky lan party place) (lan-local area network) (aka lot's of computers hooked up together) which was fun because i haven't played counter strike in a couple months and haven't gotten a chance to show off my mad 1334 skillz! (yeah.) so i showered woohoo, then went out to dinner for julae's b-day. that was mucho fun cuz we went to sarahs house afterwards and "did stuff" weeeee -cept not and now i'm home, i really need to call rachel, cuz she doesn't have a sn but i've been so busy i haven't been able to call her. i just don't want her to think i'm blowing her off. well this has been your friendly neiborhood spid. i mean, thespian. jeff
