getting ready to have a blow out.well hopefully anyway.it seems like we've invited the whole town! hubby and i still aren't getting along. whatever either one of us says the other says the opposite. he thinks its because i'm off work. we mostly just cleaned all day and tried to avoid each other. what a way to live. can't wait till everyone gets here to start some real conversation ( while everyone can still be sober enough to talk ) ciao
