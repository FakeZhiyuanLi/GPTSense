have been in istanbul for the past ten days inconsistent humid weather is not my favorite thing to wear on top of my suit! after a frustrating monday, i'm looking forward to whatever chance has in mind for me today. i'm all prepared for it. note to self: don't drink and drive. hell, maybe you should quit driving altogether.
