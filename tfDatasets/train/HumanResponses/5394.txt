is there any better breakfast than a pint and a rueben at 11:00 am? i don't bloody think so. on the agenda for the day: work dinner with the moms maybe drop in at a going away party for a teacher i used to have a crush on, maybe not. they'll be lots of strange and scary grad students,some of them may have been ta's of mine going to see pansy division maybe bring home some achingly beautifull queer punk rocker? if not, plenty of fun in beam and water's if only the rest of my weekend was shaping up to be so much fun.
