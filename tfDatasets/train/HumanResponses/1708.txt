every time i go to school, i end up seeing someone on a computer doing omg ilegle actevetys. or maybe just in the library. these people are doing stuff like looking up lyrics to rap and looking at shoes. . . . what the fuck? shoes and rap? i was in a chat the other day, as well, and a guy kept linking me to his computer. -_- anyway, i'm out. this'll probably be rewritten next time i'm all overfocused.
