it has come to my all-too-fleeting attention that a 9 to 5 job just can't suit me for the rest of my working days. i've only been in the occupational alt world since late august, and already i'm about to tear my hair out. well, at least if i was hairless, i could plead illness and somehow wiggle my way out of working like a proletariat slave. i welcome and encourage any ideas to get me out of this slump! the only jobs that don't necessarily follow a 9-5 schedule (that i can think of) are stripping, waiting tables and construction. i'm too fat, too elitist and too lazy to do any of those. so help! sos.
