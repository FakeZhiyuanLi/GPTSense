wow. she replied. i didn't think she would. i'm stumped. what do i say? jesus, i sounded like a dork in the message i sent her. stupid! should i tell her the truth? "i saw you in eastwood and was wondering if you go out with me?" too fresh. "no we haven't met, i just saw you here in friendster" liar. "it took me almost 4 weeks to finally find you" too scary. oh well, fine, i will tell the truth. "i saw you in eastwood, found out that you work in the same company as my friends."
