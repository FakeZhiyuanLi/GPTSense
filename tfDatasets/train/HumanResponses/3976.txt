for all those who wonder where the name herm came from, this blog is for you. as most of you know, my last name is hyte. growing up, my family and i would always try to think of creative first names for mike (my brother) and my future children. such as term, krypton, neeph, and transvest. (there are plenty more) well, during a volleyball trip in canada, i was telling some of my teammates about these names. one of them suggested i name one of them herman alfred. for hermaphrodyte. they said we could call him herm for short. everybody started calling me that, and so it kind of stuck.
