i’m about a third of the way done with this trip. i’m only getting a little annoyed with natalie. she can be so frustrating. i guess all little sisters can get that way. there are so many things i miss about oregon; my friends, trees, real mountains, rain, people who know how to drive, no sales tax, someone to pump my gas, wog & fi. i’m not even to my final destination and i already can’t wait to see the girls in october. i’m so lucky to have such wonderful supportive friends and family. i know that i couldn’t do this without them all.
