this is my 2nd or 3rd week working the night shift. i don't know which, the days and nights are all running together and somehow i feel i've missed out on july. i know i'm turning into a bona fide night person because last night my head didn't do 'the bob' one time, and i have the television line up memorized from jay leno the whole way through to 6am. one thing that's cool is going home in the morning and knowing that although i'm headed for a nice round of the today show and a nap, everyone else is on their way to work. suckers. night shift puts a serious dent in my social life, though. forget happy hour. forget meeting for lunch or stopping for a beer on the way home, etc. it is nice to have the bed all to myself though. no cover sharing or fighting over how high the air conditioner should be set. night shift sucks, but all in all it's an excuse to skip exercise.
