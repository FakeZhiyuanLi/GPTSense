each day that i spend in this urban metropolis makes my patience edgy and impulsive. each day my anticipation becomes more and more impetuous because of a hope. a hope that fades each single day. the hope of going back to the philippines this july 9, 2004. in just a brief momment my anticipation ended and my hope shattered and replaced with feelings of devastation and abhorrence. i am faced with the fact that i will not be going home this week! this occurence didn't abate my determination, instead it grew more indomitable than ever. i will go home!
