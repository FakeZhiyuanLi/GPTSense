ronald reagan is dead, jesus, leave the man alone. he wasn't that great a president anyway. my god, when i die, bury my ass in a hole and leave me the hell alone. my funeral will be this huge "get laid, get shitfaced, get stoned" party, not some "poor poor pitiful me, i died" fiasco. isn't that how we all want to be remembered? :p not this "boo-hoo" crap. screw that.
