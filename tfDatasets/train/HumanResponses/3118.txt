we get the new flooring this weekend. 1100sqft to cover with tile and laminate flooring. now, i just have to learn how to tile. i haven't figured out how to get the 40 boxes of laminate home yet. i had a really good night at the buddhist center on wed. it was my first foundation class and was a but difficult because of the language used. i did manage to keep an open mind and was able to speak with the head nun afterward who was very generous with her time and helped give me come clarification on the intent of specific words. my wife helped me make a cheesecake-like desert last night for a potluck at work today. we have has some enjoyable time together lately and i'm looking forward to doing the flooring together. lets see how i feel after the first room is done. worked out again yesterday. its very handy having the new gym at work. meditated and stretched this morning after i wore up at 5:30am. it seems like i do really need less sleep when i mediatate.
