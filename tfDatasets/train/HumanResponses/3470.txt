hey this is my first day here, and man does it feel kind a funny. everything is all the sudden so new again. i'm a 27 year college grade, who just moved back to my home town. yah not too much fun if you ask me, but i had to. my mother just became real sick, and well dad could care less, so i moved home to take care of her. i picked up my whole life, and moved just to help out. so now i have given up all my friends, business, and life. i am happy that i could, and that i was able to, but it is not all fun. good thing i just found a good job, that could be a career which is nice! me i am a music nut i collect guitars, and love to play all styles of music. i read a lot, and love sneaking out for a beer or two at the local tavern. i moved from a small town, to the big city, and can not stop thinking of the mr haggard's song "big city." i love that song. well enough for now
