had an awsome time parting last night. my friend was in town from wash st., had to have a party out. went to hmc karaoke, and it was a blast. the boys came through and showed there support as usual, as well as the ladies, but the guest was a little late. my girl was singing up a storm and enjoying herself. however, gave me a little glare at the end when i was talking to a female friend she never met. this friend is pretty.haha! got the hint, but enjoyed the talk. will talk to her again. i can't believe we drank that much on a work night, but we did it before so why not do it again. haha. paying for it right now at work. need to have more nights like that, feeling of being free and not worrying of what anyone thinks. except for the residents that complainted later on that night because we were too loud in the parking lot. the mananager had to come and tell us we had to leave.
