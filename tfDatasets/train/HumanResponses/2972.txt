a post! a post! he's going to post! i'm going to say what's on everybody's mind. or some of you at least. exams are near. stress, anxiety, and displeasure are running high. people are complaining, griping, worrying, stressing, and even ranting about their exams. other people however don't seem affected. either they are confident with their knowledge or they know how to cope. i like to think of myself as one of the latter. i am confident with what i know but i study none-the-less. anyways, i know not of anybodies problems, concerns, or whatever. i however am feeling happy at the moment and have been actually been feeling happy for most of the week. if you got's no idea what i'm talking about then that's your petty issue so don't trouble me with it and just ask someone else. until the next time
