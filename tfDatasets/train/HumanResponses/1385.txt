ok, i know my life is starting to sound like it revolves around the weather, but-shocking-today it was sunny! woo! we didn't go to the stream though, cos no-one could really be bothered. so we rented out some films from good old dillons or one stop or whatever they call it these days. we watched underworld and session 9. session 9 is rubbish, hard to understand and people hack eachothers eyes out (or so i heard-i was hiding behind a cushion) it was meant to be a psychological thriller.it didn't float my boat if i'm honest. second film, underworld, was good. vampires and werewolves and stuff.anyway, my day was better than yesterday even though i'm bored now. and i'm 'talking' to andrew on msn who seems about as cheerful as dung beetle. ah well. better go and get some chocolate.
