today is my first day of work at my new job. i just graduated college and i am ready to take on the world. i am doing an internship this summer with a bulge bracket(large) investment banking firm in dallas, texas. i am excited about the opportunity and hope to learn as much as i can. this blog is set up to chronicle my experiences for the summer. all of the successes and failures, the good times and the bad. i hope that this blog will also be informative to anyone who is considering investment banking as a career. check back as i will be updating it periodically. if you have any specific questions please email from my profile and i will try to answer them as best i can. enjoy.
