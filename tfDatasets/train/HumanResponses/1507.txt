today was one of the most happy days of my life. i asked my friend brandi to be my girl friend and she said yes! i was so happy. i hope that are relationship turns out to be a great one becuase she is a really amazing person, and i would do anything for her. i know that im moving soon but im sure everything will work out fine. plus 180 miles and 2 hours of driving could neevr keep me from seeing her. anyways i love ya brandi peace out
