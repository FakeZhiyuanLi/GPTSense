night and day i was a lost soul who found you in love, not by chance we met but by he that's up above. i had asked him for guidence and he led you straight to me, he said, "my lonely child i have brought unto you thee. take and love her cherish her in every way, for she shall be your night and you shall be her day. be in love forever and be of one heart, and what god has joined together let no one take apart."
