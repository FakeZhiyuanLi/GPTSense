a question this is which will find many takers. a gay and happy man will say, "its a heaven my friend"; but his sad, depressed friend will say, "no dear, it is hell" none really knows this world, its is just a place where we have come to spend a few days , as a guest. lets us just live in peace and love lets just move on. towards fate and luck lets just move on.
