cleaned. rearranged. made a mess. cleaned. the vicious cycle of trying to make my place presentable.or at the very least less cluttered. now most of my plastic army is on both my computer screens. their little eyes staring blankly out at the opposite wall behind me. the monsters are arranged in a cube/crate thing looking fierce and dangerous. and whole bunch of comics and other misc. crap is on the dining room table. my mannequin now has a somewhat decent wardrobe after i went through my closet. you can see her all decked out in my profile picture. found more shirts that i forgot i had, lying on a shelf. hung them up so i remember that i have them and can incorporate them into my daily wear. room's nowhere near looking orderly though. tthhhrrppp
