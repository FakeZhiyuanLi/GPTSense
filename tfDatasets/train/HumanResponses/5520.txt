she weighs 180lbs and reminds me of the leprechaun. it's really weird to know someone who might have been in a movie and don't even know it. she just has an annoying voice that makes you think of him, like she wants to kill you for just being near her. she tells people she's lost weight but i don't know where from. probably from her sixth chin and one of her rolls. kayla thinks she's so much better than everyone only because she has teachers up her ass 24/7. we have a friend named josh and she thinks he loves her madly. only because he said she would be easy. she would be too she's desperate, never had a boyfriend. probably squish whoever it was. have you seen her brother damn i didn't know an 8 yr old was suppose to weigh 120.5lbs sixty more pounds he'd be up there with her. when they run i swear they wobble and get hit in the face with their rolls. you know how fat people have "huge boobs" no she's flat as a fucking board.
