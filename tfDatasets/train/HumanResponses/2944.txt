read trlblzr's blog. [no doubt that's how you got here.] i know how ya feel. and that wretched wumpus! hehe, text adventures. my brothers played one many years ago, and it took them forever to figure out that they first had to tell their character to wake up [or get out of bed, or whatever] it was something about a window washer or something, i don't really remember. good times. finally read a review for doom3. woah. truthfully, i can barely play doom without getting scared out of my pants. google zdaemon game launcher. it comes standard with doom1. 00 ~ i don't why, but there's doom, doom1, and doom2, everybody but me has doom2. poop. and it's pretty much the only way you'll ever be able to play against other people. -i need a girlfriend.
