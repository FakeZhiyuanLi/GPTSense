so today is the kind of day where i'm really tempted to have a meltdown. people yelling at me for things they don't even understand, people being mean, and on top of it all a gloomy day. but it's not worth it to have a meltdown. perhaps the best thing is to sit down with a fine whine and some aged sheeze.
