i hate this. i might not be able to go to california. i know, it sucks. my dad is gonna decide if me and diana are gonna be able to go. when i heard that, the first thing that came to mind was "that's messed up!" because you know it is. i hope i get to go back. a couple of days would be enough. well i have to go. later
