ahhh i am going to go crazy! i miss cody so much. i know i have only been outta school for 2 days, but i have barely even spoken to him. i feel like he is out of town or something. he wont ever be home because he is playing so much baseball this summer, and so what time will we have to spend together? not much. i feel like crying right now. all i want is to spend a little time with him. is that too muh to ask
