i have been reading a few postings on a friend from works blog and it seems like a good way to share some thoughts and experiences, so i figured that i would give it a shot. my main goal for this blog is to share what is going on in my life with friends and family. i'm planning for my first post with real content to be about hiking my first 14er this past weekend which should be posted soon.
