writing these cursive letters in red ink. turns wooded desks into a workspace. notebooks skattered. reveals hopeless stories. curtains are closed. lights are off. but one remains. so i watch my stagering hand. writing my thoughts. i then sign my name at bottom of the page. hoping my words will be in someones mouth. carry on, so much time wasted. at wooded desks. ink is wasted. on these cursive lies. pushing back curtins. turning on lights. one lights off. notebooks are skattered in bins by wooden desks.
