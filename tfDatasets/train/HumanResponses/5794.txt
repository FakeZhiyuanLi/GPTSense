okay so i am not a reject persay, i am not popular but i do not get picked on or laughed at (although i feel like i am most of the time i am sooooo paranoid), but going to school in one of the richest neighboorhoods around and listening to the pretty people complaing about what car to buy gets on my nerves,i am not going to lie and say that i am friends with the popular kids in my class, because i am not( me going to the movies with gary. what a laugh)but most of them know my name but only because i am known as the smart girl or the good girl, i am not really all that smart( i am preety sure that i failed my geometry exam to day) i am preety good. i am not complaining because i do not have a big fancy house or a red convertable, because i am just glad for what i do have( as corny as it sounds). i have to go catch up later
