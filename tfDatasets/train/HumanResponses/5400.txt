so t. and i decided to go for our nightly walk a little earlier than normal tonight, since it's supposed to storm. so we get about 1/4 way through our normal route and it starts sprinkling. so i start walking as fast as i can, trying to beat the thing. we had to abort our plan- it was really thundering and lightening. i think i got a better than normal workout from all the hard walking. and we only got a little wet. barbara cancelled on me for dinner tonight. her strep has turned into bronchitis. we rescheduled for next week. i think i am going to change the sheets/duvet cover on the spare bedroom bed, then get cozy in my bed and read my new instyle and marie claire that arrived today.
