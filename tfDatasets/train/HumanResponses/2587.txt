ok guys, this story's worth hearing. so monday morning i'm woken up at 6:15am by this really loud beeping noise, so i tried to turn off my alarm clock, but thats not what was beeping. so i laid in bed for a few moments, blinking stupidly, then heard my mom yelling somehting from what seemed like really far off, and i realized all of a sudden that it was the smoke detector going off so i jumped out of bed and opened my door, and this wall of smoke came pouring in! i quickly woke up my brothers and got them outside, then went back in to investigate. i hurried over to our kitchen, and arrived just in time to see out microwave melt and fall into pieces our kitchen was in flames, the walls, the counters, the floor, the stove, microwave, refridgerator.oh man. my dad somehow put it out, and i am now practically living in my basement, while about 500 people come over every day to repair or clean our house. wow. so that was my adventure for this week. peace out, a-town ~chel~
