here, right in the middle of the summer we find oursleves under attack from grey, dark, thundering clouds. a fierce flow of angry tears soaks my hair as i toil in the field. the great above breathes a heavy breath that chill's my bones and reddens my cheeks. dry soil turns liquid and seems to grab my boots as if it wanted me to stay. but i move on. smile on my face. work, food, shelter and family.what more could i ever ask of my creator? what more? no, nothing more! instead i should thank him. and so i do! praise god! for in him i am free. i was a slave, bound by my sin. but he took what was mine and gave me what was his.
