for those who know me they know i like john. but for those you don't know, i like john shultz (or however you spell his last name). i don't know why i like him but i just do. and john if you happen to read this, you already know that i like you, but do you know how much (hint: a lot!)? so i just have one question, why does he like lisa so much? hasn't she told him that she just isn't interested in him? but that's ok because i realized something yesterday. if he is so in love with lisa, let him because if he can't see someone who likes him who's right in front of him than i have no need for him. why should i chase after someone who doesn't even feel the same?
