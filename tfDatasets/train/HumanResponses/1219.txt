well in my various adventures today, i fell inlove with a great gal. i plan on "going steady" as the hip young term is used and perhaps someday even having a cohort in my nefarious plans for the domination of france! you people out there probably think it rediculous that the great genius that i am even has emotions, especially since i am part llama, but in-fact snoofs are quite intelligent and very developed mentally. so, if you are reading this, know my love is for 783742643, written in phone dialect, so if you waste your time figuring it out, good for you. anyway. i will continue with my usuall banter tomorrow, though at the moment i must act smitten.
