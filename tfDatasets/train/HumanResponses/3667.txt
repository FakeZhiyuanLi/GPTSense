so i'm sitting here in it, on my own, surrounded by people. smike went well. random people come up to me when i'm at school and compliment me on my performance, but it's not the same withought hector and kathryn and all the others. i'm so lame. i seem to have no life of my own. the moment i'm on my own i go to my form room and sit there with the tangled mess that is my thoughts. i guess that i need other people a lot more than they need me. so what else is new. on a random note, i am now constantly looking for spam on my blog, and in my inbox because chris waring asked for my email adress, which by the way is tru_neutral@hotmail.com, and for the adress of this site. i'm all out. see ya. xxx
