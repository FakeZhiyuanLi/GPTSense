darkness is all around me. i always feel alone…….even in a crowded place. something i fear always seems true there’s no where to run. i can’t hide from my fears i hate being alone darkness is always around me. my heart is no more i have no hope left. there is no known path my future cannot be seen there’s no hope of return the window is not open pain is all i can feel i will feel no more i am no more my death will come as no surprise it’s the only hope i can feel my life is a bitter story it’s ended in a sour way…….good bye. i am dead.
