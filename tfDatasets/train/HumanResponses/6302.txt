sounds like a fun thing huh. apparantly it defines the connections between various texts be it film, television, or standard print. many levels to it, which i'm only soaking up a little at a time. i have however finally (i think) found a suitable hypothesis and topic for my fairly large research project that i now have a little over a month to complete. time to hit the media service archives, library, and hosts of other online knowledge sites. good luck me.
