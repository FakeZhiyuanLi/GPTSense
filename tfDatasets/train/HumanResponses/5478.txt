i'm living out by a town called emerson. there's a restaurant called doug's place. i'd heard that it was a really good place to eat. i went there for the first time today. it's your typical meat and three veggies kinda southern restaurant and it was packed. it was good. but in reality it's a bible-belt alcohol-free hooters. man all, the waitresses were to die for. i'm not talking cute; i'm talking hot. these girls look like they got tired of gripping dance poles and decided to start serving pork chops, collards and cornbread. i know where i'll be eating out from now on :).
