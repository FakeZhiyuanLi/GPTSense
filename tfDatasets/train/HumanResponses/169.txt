chorus: trapped inside this dark place i can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel. what lies in front is all that i fear, it creeps over me like its my own shadow no one is here with me only the haunting memory of my past it hangs over my head like a poisoned moon. only it shatters over me leaving me as a rotting corpse. a sheet of darkness has come over me i broke what only faith i had i flushed it out of me it covers only my weakened soul. here tonight i will conquer all the odds i will rise back from the grave making my name known. if i could just get one foot out of the door but my feet are so heavy and my past is weighing down on me i think only of myself and my heart starts to collapse when nothing good comes from my mind. what’s my mind been up to? it is no longer apart of me soiled enough from the shades of the world. i can’t turn myself around, fallen too far down the rabbit hole what’s left is only an image of what people see me as.
