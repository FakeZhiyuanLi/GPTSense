took the boat out for the second time yesterday. it went fairly smooth. it would have gone smoother if i hadn't smoked a little wacky weed. my engine died on me while i was docking and i haven't tried cranking her back up. this lifestyle is fraught with alot lof little headaches but it's all part of the experience. but i had a couple of old friends over and we did some fishing. i didn't catch anything. ( i fish, but not very seriously. i don't have the patience.) but one of my buddies caught a 9 pound carp. last night i rode out on somebody elses boat. that was a nice experience-going out at night.
