i had a dream last night. it’s been a reoccurring dream of mine for quite some time. i dream of rooms. many rooms and i roam from room to room looking at everything in it with wonder. these rooms are new to me and i am delighted when i discover a new one. enter ty pennington from extreme makeover home edition. okay not bad, now this dream is getting good. he seems to be barking orders here and there and starts telling me i need to go look for more rooms. all of a sudden my family at the curb-side and i hear him say “bus driver … hit it”. then i woke up. blah! they’re coming to my house, i know they are!
