sitting here in this room. waiting for her to make a move. i'd like to hear the phone ring, i'd like to have the inbox filled. an instant message. a call from someone else letting me know she asked about me. maybe an old fashioned letter. the problem is, she doesn't exist. somewhere out there she does, but she hasn't met me. she doesn't know my name. she can't even tell what color my eyes are. never heard my voice, never asked to hear mine. somewhere she's happy with the guy she has now, or is she alone asking the same question i've wondered for sometime. where is the one for me? i may find her tomorrow, i may find her next year. perhaps she does know me, but it's my fear of failure that keeps me from getting to know her. not in idle conversation, or the casual question, but asking her to let me know her, and peering into her soul through her eyes and getting the answers i seek. i will meet my fate one day, and i hope my fate is her.
