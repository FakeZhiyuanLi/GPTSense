ooooooofff, i thought our boy was going to pull off that win. how great was it for that guy, cancellara to put up such a huge time and hold off all those guys. first tdf, first stage win. i was just glad to see the rain held off. my biggest fear was bad luck and an injury. how quick can fortunes change? ask peter farazijn, who was at home, watching on tv when cofidis called him to get to the race, matt white had a crash in training and broke his collar bone. this guy went from spectator to competitor in 2 hours. i hope he has a great race. ulrich looks like he's lost weight. i think he's definitly going to be a huge challenge this year. mayo, heras, hamilton, jan. it's going to be fun 3 weeks.
