i was recently watching t.v. and i heard somebody say "money is a sport." this kind of made me think. if money is a sport then your biggest athlete is bill gates. to be honest if somebody like bill gates is the biggest athlete in a sport, it's a pretty pathetic sport. the closest thing to training for money would be working, but if that's the practice what's the game? and how do you explain finding 20 dollars in your wallet after last winter? see so until you can give me answers i fail to see money as a sport (just a hobby). though i did here this from a person on a reality show, so i think i took it too far.
