i am in a considerable amount of pain and need to see a dentist. i have an appointment for this afternoon, and no dental insurance coverage or income. i just hope bush doesn't get elected (or appointed) this time around, this country needs single-payer health care! update (20:38): the dentist prescribed tylnol 3. i feel better now. :-) (kids, stay off drugs!)
