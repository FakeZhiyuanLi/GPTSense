here it is tuesday and this week sucks already! found out hubby has new assignment that he'll be gone weekly from sunday to friday - giving his family a whopping whole day to spend with him while he sleeps to catch up from the week i was hoping this would all be coming to and end soon but he tells me this may go on for another couple months. good news though - i am driving for two field trips this week again! going to a local zoo tomorrow and then an amusement park on friday. what a job - drive them there, get in free and get paid by the hour to enjoy whatever the trip may be that day! this whole 'blog' thing is still very new to me - not sure what all i should be saying in here. not sure if anyone really gives a crap either but at least i can vent. more will come as i get more comfy with this whole thing laterz!
