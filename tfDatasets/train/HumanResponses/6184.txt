finaly, something new to the greatest media player; or at least my personal favorite; microsoft has released a beta version of the windows media player 10 i know it may not seem like alot, but it is truly awsome. i love it. its sleek new design and all the new fetures, including ability to buy songs from other stores, is really cool. not only do you now have a great looking media player, now you can even change the color to cool looking colors. though you still dont have much of a choice with the mini version the full version is really great!
