this morning i got to work at about 8am, like i do most mornings. i missed work yesterday and sunday due to a strained neck and massive 3 day headache. never fear, a heathly breakfast of percocet and pancakes has me driven to strive through what could have been another rough day. getting into work after being away for two days can be a harrowing experience. thank the gods for outlook rules. 100 emails later, i waded through my unread mail only to find i had a slew of new bugs [the errors in games are called bugs, and it is up to the person assigned to fix them] to detail. do you think anyone missed me? ;)
