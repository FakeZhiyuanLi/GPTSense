alright, so the weekend happened. saturday, my family had to go to this picnic at a local state park. it was good to see a bunch of people i haven't seen in a long time. i got a chance to kind of show off my portfolio. good for me. maggie and i talked a bit, not a whole lot, she had a party saturday afternoon. got lots of graduation money, that's always good. she then took off to her internship, so we talked a bit on sunday in between flights father's day was just bad. we all woke up feeling like it was going to be a bad day. maybe a self-fulfilling prophesy. dad was just grouchy all day, and when my sister tried to talk to him about his gift he just kind of blew her off. really made us want to get him something, oh well, seems to happened on "special days". there's something about the pressure to happy that makes everyone edgy. it's too bad. it'll get better. well, i'd better get back to work. hope all ya'll who read this have a great day!
