today i was still sick so i stayed home from school once again. it was really boring. but oh well i was sick so it doesn't matter. i just watched t.v. and that's all it was so lame but what else are you suppose to do when your grounded? well this whole blogger thing is pretty cool. i mean i have a dairy that i write in sometimes but this is better b/c now i feel like if people read this then they will feel my pain in some sort of strange way. oh well. oh yeah yesterday jessica called me and she was like yeah lance is always talking about you at school (meaning the school i went to last year) and hes always like "yeah i'm gonna take porsche' to prom next year i'm gonna send a lemo to her house to pick her up with two dozen roses inside, the limo will take her to pick me up and we will go to prom" isn't that sweet? oh well um i guess that's all for today i'll t2yl. love ya, porsche'
