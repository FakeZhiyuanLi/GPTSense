i got 2 new cds today i'm excited. ben kweller (sha sha) and the new switchfoot one. yes, so that was the high point in my day. yesterday at the mall i got a bunch of crap so that also makes me happy, but now i'm almost broke and so i don't have enough for the camara that i wanted. :( poo. and i'm staring down the barrel of a 45 swimming through the ashes of another life no real reason to accept the way things have changed staring down the barrel of a 45.
