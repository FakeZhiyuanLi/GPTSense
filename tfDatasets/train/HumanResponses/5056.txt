my life sucks soooo much right now. my friends aren't talking to me. it's saturday, i'm all dressed up with no where to go, and i had to work yesterday. k just isn't interested in me anymore for some reason. i didn't get a text last night from aaron. kill me. i need to stop wallowing around in my own self pity and stop listening to norah jones and coldplay over and over again. god i suck.
