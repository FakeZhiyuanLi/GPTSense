i just watched beauty and the beast. i had to watch this scene 3 times, it is my favorite. it always makes me feel good. sigh. tale as old as time true as it can be barely even friends then somebody bends unexpectedly just a little change small to say the least both a little scared neither one prepared beauty and the beast ever just the same ever a surprise ever as before ever just as sure as the sun will rise tale as old as time tune as old as song bittersweet and strange finding you can change learning you were wrong certain as the sun rising in the east tale as old as time song as old as rhyme beauty and the beast tale as old as time song as old as rhyme beauty and the beast (p.s i'm not gay)
