well, i like having my own place. especially such a quiet place. not much to say today. pretty sick of the tears thing. but, oh well. saw about a boy last night. that was a fun movie. i've got one for tonight but i think i'll go to bed. gotta work in the morning. babysitter is flaking out on me. wants fridays off. at the outset said fridays were a work day. i wish i had a good alternative. but. . .that really cheeses me off. anyway gonna pee, gonna read, gonna sleep. and hop back on that hamster wheel tomorrow. yee-haw.
