i have some problems in life with paying the second part of the tuition. the "nice" guys at the university administration that deals with reducing the tuition on grounds of financial status got something wrong so now i have to fight them. as usual in italian bureaucracy they don't give you enough time to complain and the story is just too cliche. plus the rents in bologna sky-rocketed since the introduction of the euro. in the recent news, it was pointed out that there is a number of apartments that may be rented but are left unused. why do i get suspicious and think that it's a artificial way to keep raising the rents? at this point in time my only hope is that the next major (the candidate for the left is the former cigl leader conferati, aka chinamen) will try to unblock this fast paced race that is leaving the middle class (if there is any left) in great troubles.
