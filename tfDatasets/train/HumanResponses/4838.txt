did anybody else pre-order the pedro album from jade tree? i got my copy in the mail yesterday, two weeks prior to its release. granted, i've been listening to an illegal copy for the past two months, but anyway, now i got the real thing with all of jesse ledoux's artwork and everything. it's nice. anyway, if anyone else has it, i want to know what you think of the album. i think it's bazan's best offering since "it's hard to find a friend".
