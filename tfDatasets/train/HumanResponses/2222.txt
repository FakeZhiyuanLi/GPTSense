just seeing them on tv makes me think of them even more than ever.lol. keita's the best. who are w-inds? they're a group of three extremly cute japanese guys, keita tachibana's the lead singer and he's only 18. the other two are ryuichi ogata and ryohei chiba. they're cute, too. but not as cute as keita. my cousin was the first one who found out about them. when i first saw them, i thought they look like girls. but then, they were only 15 at taht time. now thay've grown so much and become so much cooler.*drools*
