finally done with most of the work for today. i finished with the dock from last weekend, and i got paid so now i finally have some money. i still don't know what i'm going to do on monday since i have off. chau wants to goto busch gardens and i'd kinda like to go.but i want to do something just my girlfriend and i since its my only day with her all weekend. i guess i'll just leave it up to her (i hope she's reading this ;-) ) anyways, i just want some time with just her. but all i have left to do is to goto the dump, and i'm all ready to go; just waiting on my brother to finish up his part of the grass.
