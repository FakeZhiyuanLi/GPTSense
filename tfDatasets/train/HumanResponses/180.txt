okay i am only taking one of the two drugs given to me by the va. the mood enhancer made it harder for me to sleep not better and i didn't like how it made me feel. the pain inhibitor though is working well. i still have a dull throb but no serious shoooting pain. also fixed the bed sag which was of tremendous help to my situation. back is still sore and stiff every morning but not intolerable. proper sleep is vital to one's health. the bed can make or break that. no nightmares anymore either. they have subsided foir now. shaun
