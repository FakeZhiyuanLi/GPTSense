they lurk everywhere.hotel lobbies, coffee shops and non-descript office parks. dressed in suit and tie, they offer you dreams beyond your imagination.world travel, mansions and luxury cars. they only ask for three things in exchange: some startup funds, a bit of your time and potentially most damaging â€“ a change in motives. so if you are part of world financial group, britt worldwide, cutco, xango, amway or quixtar, don't get defensive. if its working for you, more power to you. some of you are my friends. some of you are my family. i can deal with that. i know you've been calling me. i've even met some of you for lunch. but i won't do it. i can't afford to change my motives. it would cost too much.
