went to watch [harry potter and the prizoner of azkaban] today, i think chris columbus did a better job with the movies than alfonso cuaron. cuaron may be a more experienced director, but i don't think he knows how to deal with harry potter movies. there are so many areas of the book which he cut off. and then the story moves way too fast for people to actually follow on. and then, in the movie hagrid only brought one hippogriff to class, and there are supposed to be more hippogriffs than just buckbeak! alfonso cuaron is just not cut out for harry potter movies! get that.
