ok, there are literally 5 important things that i should be doing right now, but i absolutely cannot focus. i ate too much panda express for lunch and have been battling my food coma bravely ever since. must keep eyes openat least to maintain the appearance of consciousness. randy had a job interview today. keep your fingers crossed. say little prayers and burn a candle at both ends, just to be safe.
