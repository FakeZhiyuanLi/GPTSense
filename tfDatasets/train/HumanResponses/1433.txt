i havent seen you for over a year, we've both matured and moved on, your girlfriend goes to my school, and my ex follows me in the halls. i hardly recognized you standing there, beside my locker, looking so fine, remembering the times that we shared, feeling sorry for letting you go. a glance is all it takes to notice, one glance is all it took and i felt, everything that i've ever felt for you, return in a heartbeat and a blink. you phoned me when i least expected, your voice brings back the memories, equally haunting and pleasing to recall, wondering what it would be like - . if maybe next time we werent caught.
