escape. into the concocted fiction of tv dramas into the arms of your imaginary perfect partner into the twilight realm of isle beach into the breezy car ride along ecp into the warmth of your comforter into the unbridled surf in your dreams into the make-believe fantasy of tall stories where who you are does not matter where what you can do is unrestrained where how achieved you are is of no concern where life's many questions need no answers where the colours you see are richer and warmer where weight defies gravity where you are the lead you want to be.
