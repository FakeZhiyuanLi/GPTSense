so much to do today. have to finish kasigui by tomorrow. i've been going home at 12 am for the past three days. okay, monday doesn't count because i was at the shop. i really have to find myself another job. this job is taking my time away from things that matters most to me, my friends, my mom, my clubsmyself! probably it will be a better thing just to retire from the shop and dosomething else.i have a script in hand, don't i?
