this last weekend was my first pride ever. it was a blast. i went to the vip party on saturday night, met and chatted with many folks. went out to a club on saturday night, danced a bit skankily (oops), and then got up for brunch on sunday at chuck and wayne's house in midtown. afterwards, they took me to the parade lineup, and i marched with gerogia equality (georgiaequality.org) and then i watched the remainder of the parade. while watching the parade, a ridiculous downpour occured, bringing the already 2+ hour parade to an end. there had to have been at least a 100 thousand people at the event and i loved every second of it. next year, i intend to volunteer. over the next few weeks, i am going to begin getting involved in the community. i will hopefully meet with various charity people and see where i might best fit. okay, time to workout and head to work (may i please make some money, please, please, please!).
