december the 23rd. one day before christmas eve, the day we celebrate christmas. i thought i would be much more excited, but my brother says it is due to getting older. for god's sake, im only 16! anyway. i just thought i would update this. some people start to complain if there isn't a post every freaking day. i've started writing in my paper journal again. i haven't written in that since the 29th i think. i've been listening to some new bands recently. they go as follows: hot rod circuit - sorry about tomorrow, .hopesfall. - the satellite years, mae - destination:beautiful, midtown - living well is the best revenge. my favorite is hot rod circuit. you should go pick up that cd, its tight hahaha.
