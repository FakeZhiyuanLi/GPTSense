i was watching tv the other day and i saw a commercial for cap'n crunch cereal. it was at this point when i came to the conclusion that the cap'n and santa clause are very alike, and possibly the same person. i mean they both love kids and give kids things. granted one is awesome presents and the other is nasty sugary cereal. then there is the fact they kind of look alike. they're both older with grey hair and always wear a uniform. so i think it is very likely that they are the same person. so who is this person you ask? it is obvious it is the quaker oatmeal guy. so either i have uncovered a huge conspiracy or i'm just hungry.
