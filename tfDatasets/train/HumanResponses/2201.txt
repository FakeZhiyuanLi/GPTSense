so, i'm working at vbs with the three year olds. i took this little boy to the bathroom 3 times and i had to hold him up while he peed. it was so exciting! *not at all*. so i'm trying to not like steve very much anymore. i don't think he likes me very much that way. just as a friend i think, which is dissappointing, but o well. there's another guy i kinda like now :) so, kraig, josh, and hopefully jeremy and zander are coming friday to play n64 and maybe ps2. i'm excited! woo hoo. i really need to pray about this steve thing so i get over him painlessly. sigh
