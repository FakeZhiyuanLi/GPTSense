well. for me. tomorrow sees the embarkment of holt (su) holiday mission 2004. i can't believe it is here already. i hope to bring you updates throughout the week of all the exciting things that god is doing. but if i don't - please forgive me because i will probably be too busy or asleep! god has really blessed me this year by giving me an overwhelming sense of peace about it all. i know that everything is in his hands and all we can do is do our best and he will use that to bring him glory. so if you can - pray for the team and i as we declare jesus in this town.
