so i am going to try to actually consistently use this blog. i hope that i can stick with it. today kinda sucked. between my virtual environment demo sucking a big one and the trouble with my thesis, i can honestly say that today sucked. alas, i am almost done with my masters thesis stuff, just need one more signature. i am completely done with the academic world once i get just one, little, tiny signature on my etd form. cannot come soon enough. i need more sleep. i need more fun. i need a life.
