hey everyone, i am just writing a few extra notes about our trip. we have purchased a laptop computer and will be taking it with us so that we can keep in contact with our great canadian companions. we have also bought a digital camera so that we can show you the pictures and videos of our korean life. i will try and answer emails the best i can, but the best idea is to become a member of bloggers and comment on my entries. thanks! have fun! matthew
