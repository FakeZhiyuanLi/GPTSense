let's see. what to write, what to write. ok, last night i was at the house in florida with my friend kendra. she was in the kitchen filling waterbottles with iced tea for the next day, and i was in the bedroom with my earphones on. suddenly she appears in the doorway to our room with this frantic and terrified look on her face, so i dropped my music and ran after her as she sprinted back to the kitchen. we tried to whisper since everyone else was asleep. "what?" i whispered. "it's a f***ing roach!" she scream-whispered. "i just stared at her, uncertain at which i was more surprised at- the roach or her language. then i just started laughing. man, the look on her face. ha. peace out, a- town. ~~chel
