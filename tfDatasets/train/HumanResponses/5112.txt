well, the title pretty much sums this all up. full off gossip, rumors, and he said this , and she did that 's when does it all end?!?! i really only think it starts now, because when you grow up, you'll still have to deal with the same things, maybe to a lesser extent, but. it's there. then when your old, and can see death's shadow, you still have to face that because you complain your bananas aren't runny enough, or your viagra isn't working. oh, and the fights . it always sucks to get into, or even see fights, physically or verbally, mentally, any kind of dispute between you and your friends, or family for that matter. a few " unmentioned " friends, just got into a "dispute" over a rumor which who knows how, or who started it. i mean, if they all talked , they could see it's just a misunderstanding on everyone's part but hey we're teenagers!
