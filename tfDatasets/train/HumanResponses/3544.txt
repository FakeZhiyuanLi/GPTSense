hey all, this is jared, this is my first post and i'm in melaka so you can't really expect it to be very good can you? any way the only reason i started doing this is besause i wasn't going to be shown up by ethan and elliot tan (no offense guys) and because it is kinda nice to have somewhere you can rant and rave about things. as you can probably see i wrote this post 5 years ago when i was about 8 years old, which is kinda funny don't you think since i didn't even know what a pc was back then. well i gtg (that's chat lingo for got.to.go by the way) so catcha ya'll later, jared should i sign my posts? hmmmm. maybe we could have a debate on that. "should jared sign his blogger posts?" oh, right, yeah i just remembered gtg. haha. jared
