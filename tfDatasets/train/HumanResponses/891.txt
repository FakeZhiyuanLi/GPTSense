hey jacob, this is a great idea for a blog, i always appreciate a heads up on good music. five eight and the tom collins band were both at music midtown this year, ignorant non-athens folk missed them in their haste to catch great acts like the offspring and puddle of mud. the new release "five eight" is really good. some people just can't get used to the vocals, but at least his singing isn't generic. i've always liked this band, and some of it's best songs ever are on this release. proof yet again that athen's is a veritable breeding ground of great music.
