today lesley, haley and i went to estes park. it was a lot of fun browsing the shops and having lunch up there. the girls had their picture taken in an old time photo shop. the picture was a gift from lesley to haley for her high school graduation. we then stopped at my dad's house for short, but nice, visit. then we came home and grilled out some hot dogs and ate some good raw veggies and macaroni salad. haley and lesley then showed scott a new version of solitaire before they left. it was a fun day. and now i'm really tired so i'm gonna go read my book, angels and demons, and fall asleep.
