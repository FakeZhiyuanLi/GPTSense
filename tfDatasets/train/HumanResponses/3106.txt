summer is almost here. and i can't wait no school. sleeping in. much more money spending. and just the presence of summer feels great. but then when you get home from that last day of school and you walk in the door you're either like-"now what?" or "hell yes" haha. but either one you still know what you are going to do with your time. this is my schedual: 10am-wake up 10:30am-eat breakfast/watch tv 11am-take shower 11:30am-computer 12pm-hang out w/ friends/movies,mall,chillin 2pm-lunch 3pm-chill some more 5pm-dinner 6pm-hang out 8pm-watch tv/movies 12:30am-bed/sleep [sleep overs may vary] i cannot wait for summer! *quote of the day* "i'm feeling a little bumbarded by your intence energy".
