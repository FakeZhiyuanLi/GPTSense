considering what i posted last, whoever reads this is probably wondering or thinking i am this fucked up person that got beat as a child, or they pity me. i need no pity because those experiences taught me lessons in life, and they made me a stronger person. i am one of those people who think a lot because of it though. i'm always thinking why? but this is only going to be a short note. hope all have a good day! ~mel
