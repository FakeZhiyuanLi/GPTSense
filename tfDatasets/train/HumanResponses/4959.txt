ok. another day, another dollar. i didn't get to do much last night, because i was just so exhausted but, today is friday, so there will be some time free this weekend. in all likelyhood, there will be a party tonight, but that's allright. (partying with friends is a portion of life. there will not be a post on my blog until monday at the earliest. if someone who reads this blog would like schematics or code i have written, feel free to contact me at: diskfly@online.no
