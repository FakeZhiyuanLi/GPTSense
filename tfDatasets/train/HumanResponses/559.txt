so my friend jose has inspired me to start blogging i really just wanted to get some feelings out today. at 3 this afternoon, as i was standing in front of the ccp building i observed a man riding by with a bike that looked like mine. my stomach sank as i looked over to the west side of harvill to see low and behold, my bike missing. the u lock i had securing the bike was cut through. i just want to say that i hope he crashed on it and died yes is that too serious? well i don't give a shit this is the second time in a year i had a bike stolen. the first time was last may in front of jose's house you see, his arab trash neighbors' kids stole my bike. ok. i'm done. it's in the past. nothing i can do. lesson you should all take from this: write down the serial number, and the uapd are fucking useless
