tuesday newsday is a bit lackluster, but here it is. do you keep up with the news while on vacation or otherwise away from home for an extended period? if so, how (newspaper/tv, etc.)? and has any major news item ever happened while you were out of touch with the news, shocking you when you found out after the fact? a little. i trust on hearing it from people. when i backpack or canoe i don't at all, otherwise looking at paper headlines. the closest to a big news item was being on an "academic vacation" when ronald reagan died. i guess.
