as you may or may not have seen in the description of the site, this is mainly a site speaking of a 16 year-old(me) who's recently switched to mac from 13 years of using a pc. my name is david and i'm into anime, computers, and ddr(dance dance revolution). i will speak of these things often. my life is typically very dull, so if it sounds like i'm making something up, i probably am, you can ask me, i don't mind. as i currently have no readers, i don't have to bother with updating or anything but i'm going to try and have a tad bit of a schedule so i say now anyways, i hope everyone enjoys my life because i'm willing to sell it for a lot of moneyheheheh. ahh. if only i was kidding. david ps. i'm writing this on my g4 ibook 1ghz/12.1"
