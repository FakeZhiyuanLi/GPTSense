on our field trip to the aquarium it was very nice. it could have been better it there were more things to do. the wide variety is wonderful. all the colors of the fish mixed into one tank was reallly preety. i wouldnt mind goin again as long as there are more things to do.the train ride was nice also. some of the sharks were huge, then there were others that were kinda of small.it was kinda of scary that the train was urrounded by water. i would hate to imagine the water tank breaking with a train inside of the tunnel.next year i wouls like to go to moody gardens.no matter how many times you go it is still educational and fun.
