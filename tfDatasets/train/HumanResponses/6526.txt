today, at work, i handled a document for someone who claimed that the wounds john kerry received in vietnam were "minor wounds", and that he didn't deserve the awards he was given for them. to anyone who actually thinks this, i offer a deal: i will shoot you in the arm, and then you tell me that what you are feeling is a "minor wound". i've seen gunshot wounds, helped sew them up. no gunshot is a minor wound. they hurt , and they are life-threatening, whether from blood loss, massive trauma, or infection. to refer to such a thing as minor is to expose one's own ignorance of such things. on a related note: i have also noticed that the shrub campaign is doing a good job of keeping the press focused on kerry's war record, rather than their own boy's. they'd better keep that up too, because we already know what his record is: he is a deserter. they used to execute people for that.
