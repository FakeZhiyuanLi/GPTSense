so i've lived here in the us for about 8 years now. i just visited our local food lion. they have a wide selection of wines, but here comes my rant. why do we need 400 different chardonnays? ok i'm cool with a few from each state, some french, australian etc. in contrast i found about 5 chiantis and only a couple of other italian wines, even fewer german ones. being from britain i was bewildered by the choice at us supermarkets when i moved here. millions of choices of milk and orange juice. just seems wierd that there would be so many chardonnays. maybe it's a subtle way of putting france out of business? who can tell. i guess if i want a good selection of wine i need a wine retailer rather than a supermarket. and don't get me started on not being able to buy chimay in north carolina :-) rant ends.
