i seriously think there's something wrong with the weather nowadays. its boiling! i feel like a cooked chicken. you could fry an egg on my head, and my hair's so dry i think i could light a fire with it. not that i want to. i hate this weather. i wanna go to the arctic at least its cold there all year round. i can't stand heat. the weather arghx! if this goes on much longer, i'm not gonna just feel like a cooked chicken. i'm gonna be a cooked chicken!
