well, i just got home from school at about 4:43pm. i was trying to get on here but the server must be bugging or something because it took it forever to load the page. well, i got a ton of homework and little time to do it. but i don't care :) theres always time (usually) for homework. man, i feel pathetic :-s coming here, righting this, no one cares, its not like i have a stalker or anything. right? but still, its kinda fun and it gives me something to do in my free time besides watch t.v. and besides, there isn't anything good on right now. i think. well, thats about it for this post, my dad is starting to yell at me to do my homework.
