why do people lie just to gain someones trust? isn`t that an oxymoron? moron being the keyword ohby the way.those of you that think a description of yourself will sufficeinstead of a real pic.it doesn`t b/c what you perceive as sexy, attractive or fine.another may not.at least with a photo it allows the viewer to decide. just my thought.
