this morning was boring, then i went to amanda young's house and watched chasing liberty and ate ice cream, which was very fun and shes a really awesome person! then at 7 i went to a church activity which was decently fun, even tho we were just making stuff for girls camp next week, but ya. and then afterwards me and aj and tahnee and scott and katie went bowling. it was decently fun i guess. but it was kinda pathetic how my moods changed within a few hours. at 8:45 when the guys picked up me and tahnee, i was so hyper and excited. then by like 10 something i was just depressed. it seems like guys only flirt with certain girls. i was kinda the 5th wheel and it sucked. i got home at 11, and its 11:10pm right now, and im just like. whatever. i dont even care anymore. but i dont really like being the 5th wheel. next time ill make sure what the situation is and maybe just say no
