it's been so long sice i used the computer. stupid eve! she really likes to irk me. asking me to help her with her chinese homework again! why can't she do it herself? oh, right, she will flunk it without my help. i'm glad she finished her history, now i can play my games in peace, without her nagging at my ear every five seconds. the holidays are ending. why does everything has an end? stories have ends, life ends too. why must every single thing have an end? puzzling, isn't it? my brother is going away to thailand for 9 days! yay! freedom! though there will be school. with school, there will be homework and tests, when will there be time for me to do my own stuff? time really flies when you have fun. it's already jun 25 now. mom just called me, apparently my brother got his graduation hat. it looks. dumb, square and hard. i dunno. his graduation is in july. mom is probably going to attend it without me or eve.
