i got an email from bj today and it made me so happy.it just made my day. i decided i'm not giving him the note. i will take it and put it in my emo binder and hide it in a cardboard box in the back of my closet where only i can find it. i love the smell of my perfume and the way it hangs in the air. thinking of the way people smell.i hope the smell of my perfume forever haunts him . he was behind me in the hall today and i ran into him (literally) and i hope he could smell the scent and remember what it was like to smell it in my hair and on my neck. i remember how he used to smell and i wonder if he still smells the same. i wonder if i'm being too obsessive about this whole thing. i need to let it all go and move on like he obviously has. i think i've said all i can say right now. nothing else i have to say has any meaning at all right now. it's a wonder i can stand up to all the pressure. .hasta luego.
