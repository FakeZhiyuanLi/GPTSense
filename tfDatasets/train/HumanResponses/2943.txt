democrats have even made wal-mart an issue in the presidential race. sen john kerry has called the company that provides paychecks to 1.4 million americans, "disgraceful" and "unconscionable." wal-mart stores "destroy communities" and "drive me crazy", said kerry's wife, teresa heinz kerry. this was told to a group in minnestora, the home of target corp. she failed to mention to her audience that she had bought more than $1 million in wal-mart stock.
