insecurities fade, inhibitions gone another lonely day is done. eyelids droop, stars begin to shine moonlit, all is divine. shadows dance and time stands still with dreams my head fills but sooner than i want, light dances 'cross my face, i'm covered with light's warm embrace. a bird sings as the world begins to bloom. my day will be happy- i get to see you.
