10 days to the olympics! today, the newspaper ran an article - [survive the olympics]. this year's olympic mascots are phevos and athena. according to mythology, athena's the goddess of the arts, wisdom and war. she's also the name behind athens . i've never heard of phevos before, though. at athens, beanies of phevos and athena are on sale. wish i could get both beanies! they're adorable. fencing and soccer are in the olympics after all! i don't know for sure, yet, if england's in the soccer olympics, but i hope they are! england: don't crash during the preliminaries!
