well haven't done anything for a while but play my guitar and eat and sleep, its been pleasant but it is getting lonely. so you ever just wish you had that special someone right by your side but it feels like their a million miles away? it sucks even more when you know they could be right in front of your face i wish i could see heather more. is describe the events of this weekend but i don't have the drive or motivation not to mention it was extremely uneventful. well that's all for now.
