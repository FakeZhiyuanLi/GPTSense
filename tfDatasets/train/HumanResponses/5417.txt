well, i guess this would be a good outlet for me. but how many people will see it? how often? how will they access it? this is fun. to blog or not to blog, that is the question. i dont think that i am ready to discuss my personal things with you, i want to but am scared a little. i feel like a little kid that has to dip their tiny toes in the wanter first to test it before jumping in. so thats what i am doing. we have to build a trust up with each other blog. can i call you that? blog-mr blog. why do i feel as though "blog" is a man? masculine? sounds funnyblog. where did that name come from? blog-blog-blog. i could say it all day. can you tell that something is wrong blog? can you tell that i have something to say? do you know what it is? well im still testing the waters, so you will just have to wait to find out.
