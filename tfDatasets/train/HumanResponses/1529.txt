i am home now from my road trip. and i hate florida. i can already feel the weight of loneliness hovering by me. lest you think i am overly dramatic, consider once again my situation, and then also remember that i live with my parents. there isn't going to be somebody asking me to come over at 9:45ish anymore. i will come home, watch tv for a few hours, play around on the computer, maybe talk to her on the phone, and that will be my life. it makes me feel very very sick.
