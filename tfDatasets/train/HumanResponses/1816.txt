only i could manage to get a bee sting on my thigh. i was picking up pool toys outside this afternoon. it looked like it was going to rain and i didn't want them to blow away. i picked up the beach ball and somehow managed to mash a bee or wasp on my thigh. ouch it still hurts. it was a pretty stinky day all around. the morning was consumed with errands. pick up materials for 4-h projects, return a swimsuit i was sure would fit dd but didn't, get some groceries and drop off some important papers. i had my six and the girl i babysit for. they were picking at each other the whole time. that is not a big deal but it does get on your nerves. this afternoon dd worked on 4-h projects. she did make progress but oh the whining and complaining getting there. i wanted to go to the drive in tonight but it looks like the weather is not on my side. maybe tomorrow?!
