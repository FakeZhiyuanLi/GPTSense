the time that my friends and i got together at my apt. for some pre-drinking, then headed out to catch the metro into the city so we could go dancing. on the way, i had to pee so we stopped in the cvs. after begging the manager to let me use their bathroom (and using it), i remembered that i had forgotten to put on deodorant. i prompty used some, then put it back on the shelf, then sprayed myself down with some imitation ck1. good times!
