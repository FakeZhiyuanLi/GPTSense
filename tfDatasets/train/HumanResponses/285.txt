crazy, i've stopped reading the news since june 19th. oh well, i suppose the world stops for summer vacation. how much fun. for some reason, i don't think i would mind working or something like that, yet i feel so incredibly lazy. i suppose i need to find something to do before i sink into a coma. on that note. ta.
