am i wearing pants? whose to say what pants are? whose to say what wearing pants can be defined as? is it simply have the material next to one's skin? or is wearing pants have a deeper, more complex, meaning? are any of you wearing pants? do i want the hot women to wear pants? are all the hot women wanting to slap me and all the ugly ones very offended? whose to say what ugly and hot is? maybe a hot girl is ugly to me, but who would be able to tell? but is she wearing pants? i don't know. that was todays lecture on pants. i hope you learned a lot because there is a test on nuclear relitivity in 10 minutes.
