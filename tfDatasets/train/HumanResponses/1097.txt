i got the new job that i applied for  so i will no longer be an insurance underwriter, asked to review 28 files a day, constantly under the gun. what a relief. the hours will be worse, in a way. i previously worked noon to eight pm and that gave me time for a bike ride almost every morning and time do those little things. starting august 9th, i will work 8:30 -4:30 pm. it will require tremendous determination to get home, throw on the bike clothes and go. it's simply out of the question to do it in the morning. out of the question.
