going back to school is a big decision to make. after highschool i joined the army. after five years of service to this wonderful country, i found myself out of work and with no formal higher education. i looked at my job otpions and decided that i didn't want to be a laborer for the rest of my life. going back to school was not a problem for me, my problem lied with trying to go to school around my work scheduel. i started out by going to night school, after obtaining my a. a. degree in just eighteen months i applied to csusb. i was orginally turned down by csusb due to a math requirement. after taking the math class at a local community college i was accepted to csusb. with just a year and a half at csusb i'm going to graduate this comming spring. at the time of graduation i'll have spent just three and a half years to obtain a four year degree. it has been difficult, however i set a goal and worked hard to get there. if i can do it anyone one can.
