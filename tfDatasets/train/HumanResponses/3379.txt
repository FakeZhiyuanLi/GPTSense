we saw mean girls yesterday. that was a pretty good funny movie. although there were some traumatic parts in the movie, overall still thought it was fun! so the movie made me think about some stuff from high school and the different cliques my high school was a little different going to an all girls private school. our cliques were weird.hard to define cliques by type like jocks or nerds or whatever it was more like clique 1 and 2 and 3 . no one was more popular than another everyone could basically intermingle with any group and it'd be fine. i think first 3 years of high school i sat with different girls every day or week. but senior year i stuck mainly with the ap "nerds" who really weren't nerds. (wonder if that makes sense).some of the "nerds" were also "jocks" and also "the cool asian crowd". neways. yeah.i guess i'm glad i didn't go to a public school
