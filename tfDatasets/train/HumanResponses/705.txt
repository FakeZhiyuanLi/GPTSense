this pain is staying with me i can't get rid of it i can't get it to leave i can't put up with all of this all this pain is blinding me, i cannot see i've lost my way on the path of life i'm not sure if this is right i have to think about what you put me through i really want to spend time with you all these thoughts are making me lose sight on all the things we used to do we used to laugh and hang out all the time but you are no longer mine i want to tell you how i feel but i don't know how you would deal with all the things i'd be telling you but now we're here this is the end i'm so glad that we're still friends
