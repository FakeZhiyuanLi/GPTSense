i have been reading memoirs of a geisha almost all day today. it is such a fascinating novel. i never realized how difficult being a geisha is. it also talks about japan's past. if i could live in any time it would definitely be either before the meiji era or the early 1900s in japan that is. i have also been fond of the wild west era of america. ha i guess i am just a hero kind of guy. cowboys and samurais always seemed so cool and brave always saving the damsel in distress and other heroic deeds. anyway, i am losing track of what i wanted to say. i have gained an even greater respect of the japanese from this book. they have such a dignified and polite manner. well, that is about it for today. i suppose it is just too late or something. see you later.
