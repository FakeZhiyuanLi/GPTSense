last night i was invited to join some friends for a halo party. they had three televisions with three xboxes networked together for a massive multiplayer experience. i'm not all that good, but neither were most of the other players. i had a great time sniping scorpion drivers and running over people with a ghost. we must have played for six hours. it was great! that's about the most exciting thing that's happened so far this week.
