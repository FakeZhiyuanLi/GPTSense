mood: cheerful music: roger whitaker - ding dong merrily on high yo, this is just the beginning of the blog; so. i'll talk about day 1. i woke up, dog was barking i had to deal with that. when i was done with that, i watched some show. starting over. it's part of my "lesson", somehow. but after that, of course i went onto the computer. hell, i live on my computer. but anyways, i went around bhz's, and nintendo.com forums, the new n-advanced, and a lil' bit of krr and mw's. but anyway, we had somewhat of a party last night, no big deal, same ol', same ol'. nothing really went on, they left around 10. which is weird because they were gonna' stay here instaed. oh well, 24 year olds will be 24 year olds. so. bye. forgot, here's a link to my forum. =p http://acn.3.forumer.com
