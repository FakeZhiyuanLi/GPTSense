well i finally did it, after 10 years i finally finished the first chapter of a story. nothin big, something i have been meaning to do for along time. more for my friends then to be published, i read it over 15 times, spell checked it 6 times then mailed it out. funny thing is i was not as nervous as i thought i would have been. i had a really nice day yesterday, it stated with a call at 8am, my sister in law was in the hospital in labor. by 2:45 pm a wonderful 8lb baby girl was born. so of course i rushed to the hospital to see them. a great day indeed. ana
