loneliness is. cold like wet sand moulding under your feet as blue as the serene ocean calm currents stirring silently in the vacant night it moves like a snail sliding across the misty boardwalk where life once used to play it feels like the firm grasp of air it's always there but never close enough it smells like dry salt as the echoing winds sound all over it looks like an empty bottle buried at the end of the ocean it taste like poison you swallow it and slowly start to crawl to your corner and want to die then you realize your werenâ€™t alone you just went unnoticed loneliness is.
