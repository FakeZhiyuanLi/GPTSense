you do know me silly pants! and as of getting married, #1 although we have met, i am sorry to say that i don't know you that well. # 2 perhaps in the future, if you are not threatened by comments such as "mr wheat, marry my girlfriend and i will eat you." then we might be able to consider it. as of now, i think the answer is no. sorry. good news all, tomorrow is friday, and then that means 3 days of no schools! :od peace!
