i use this phrase for greeting you all to this post, because i got my social security number and my tax id in thailand yesterday. its been 8 months and counting since i have landed here, and it has been fun. to say the least. after all which other project does one get to have time for his hobbies, build one the best collections of music, have time to watch on an average a movie a day, read up on all the novels one missed out on, and even have time to think about restarting guitar and piano lessons!? before i get into the kind of work i have been doing here, let me get back to the issue at hand. my english has been shot to sh*t, my pronunciation is gone to the dogs, i forget sometimes how and "r" is pronounced, on the whole, like my wife told me this morning, i am legally dumb. adios, pritham
