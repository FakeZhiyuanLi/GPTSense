it has been a while since i have posted anything. this weekend i went camping with my brother, will, liz, jackie, and sal. it was fun but i got in trouble because my mom found out that will went and my punishment has not yet been decided. i am scared to know what it is, but it was worth it i had a great time. our camp site was great it had a space under the tree's to set up the tents. there was this dog there that was lost i think and followed us were ever we went. to much drama going on. tyler (cousin) went to a party this weekend and got fucked up, and his brother jordan made out with tyler's ex, not something you do tyler was pissed. why dose everything have to go down this way. on the way back from camping me and will both got car sick because we were in the back with a whole bunch of blankets. well that's it for now i hate being in trouble.
