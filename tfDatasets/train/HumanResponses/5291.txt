"one who can recite the kama sutra forwards and backwards while sitting in the lotus position under a scared fig tree". the answer of a chicago economics phd student to the question "what makes a successful economist ?". now the only comment i have (besides the realization i am citing too much out of colander), doesn't the guy have his priorities wrong ? i mean, "reciting" the kama sutra, come on, find a wife and then. you know what ;-)
