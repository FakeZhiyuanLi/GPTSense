it's saturday morning and mrs rasmussen is off from work until thursday next week on her mid term holiday. after a rather glorious week, it's been raining all morning and everything outside is soaking wet, including the batch of washing i hung out late last night when the weather was really nice and warm. matthias is cleaning his room, and he plans to watch the fellowship of the ring later, which he thinks is very suitable for the weather. sofie is still asleep in her room as we speak. i am going into the city centre today to meet a bunch of roleplayers i found via a website. they meet every saturday in a book shop in george street, and then venture on to play at a coffee shop in rose street. i am hoping to find a couple of roleplayers willing to play during the week, as i have not played for more than two years.
