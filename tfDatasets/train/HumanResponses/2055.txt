i am happy that it is friday ~ but i still have to work tomorrow so that kinda stinks but hopefully i get caught up on my work but i really doubt it, i am thinking that since i am not really going to get caught up i should just stay home and not come into work but then i think about the over time so that makes me want to come in tomorrow, also my sister is going to be here tonight so i kinda want to stay home tomorrow incase she wants to do something. i guess i will decide before i leave tonight.
