republicans are getting stranger by the day. a group calling itself "people of color united" has started running anti-john kerry spots on radio stations with largely black audiences. the ads slam kerry as "rich, white, and wishy-washy," presumably to draw a contrast between george w. bush's famous appreciation for ethnic diversity. anyway, here's the kicker. the group is funded by an insurance salesman from indianapolis named j. patrick rooney  a white guy. rooney, who slams kerry for being rich, has a pretty nice savings account himself. using money from his personal savings and his insurance firm, rooney has donated more than half a million dollars to republicans over the past four years. keep trying, guys.
