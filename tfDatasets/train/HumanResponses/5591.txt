sigh. friday is just not my day. reason is because friday is the day when i have my piano! ah! i hate it! well, sometimes it can be nice. but that happens only like once in a blue moon. sigh. and always, i will be stuck in the library, doing nothing but surfing the net. you may think that it is very fun. but no! it can be fun when you have got something to surf.but, usually, i do not have a single thing to surf and then, i tend to go to the same old website over and over again. it gets boring. sigh. what to do? sigh. if not for the piano, my day would be so perfect sigh sigh sigh.10 more minutes then i would meet my doom. i did not practice piano at all. and then, the teacher would start to grumble here and there. why wun she get tired of grumbling at me sigh. not only me, even my sister thinks that she is always grumbling. this is so weird. haiz.
