i am the closest stranger to you. i am who i am because this is who you want me to be. i do have problem revealing the real me. not that i am a secretive person. i just do not fancy the thought of someone understanding me as much as i understand myself. i hate to ask for help. would only do it under desperate measures. i've always been independent, especially emtionally. and i totally hate it when someone ask me to take care of myself, do you think i need your reminder? i love myself more than anyone else. so leave it to me, i can handle this. i know how to take care of myself and i do not need people to ask me to do so. i am in the journey of finding myself.
