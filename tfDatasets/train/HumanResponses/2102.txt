after my health final this kid said,"dude, i heard you were bi is that true.that's what everyone is saying." i can't stand people. sometimes people don't know why i get mad about being called a fag but it's because i can count on hearing it every day. sometimes i purposely take different routes to class or sit in different spot when i can. tomorrow is the last day of school and i might actually not have to worry about other people.
