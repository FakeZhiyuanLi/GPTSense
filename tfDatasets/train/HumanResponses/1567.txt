trying to get ready for my big 4-0 b-day, missed the opening at bedlam, waiting to hear how it was. got an e-mail from a friend on vacation in asia, she's in tiland, floating in the salty sea, wish i was there. no art making today, interesting evening, one of those i'd rather keep to myself till i know you better. did you know that ichiban means no. one in japanese? at least , that's what she told me. ha ha it's funny how sweat can smell like sex, or is it that sex can smell like sweat? i always get things back ass words, the story of my life. i just want to take my motorcycle for a ride and disappear into the horison.
