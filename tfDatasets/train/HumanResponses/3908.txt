today was wonderful. i do not think the kitchen has been that clean since before my back was hurt. he kept checking on me making sure i was not needing anything as he worked. he fixed a meal i could eat. and enjoy. served it to me and kept the girls entertained while i ate. i am thinking it maybe time for a small playsession for reward for his attentive hard work. maybe something can be worked for next week. would like to have one room avaiable. so no sooner than the end of next week. already thinking about what we can do for the play.
