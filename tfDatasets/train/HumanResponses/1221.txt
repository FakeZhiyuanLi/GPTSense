another idea given to me by my "friend" "wayne" is a new weapon of mass destruction. it is kind of primative yet seemingly would be very effective. he thought of it when we where discussing the war in iraq and there weapons of mass destruction. he felt all the hubub over nuclear weapons was irrational along with genetic weapons. he posed the question you all have thought yet simply not expanded on; why not just use a giant mustard gass filled log? you would simply fly it in and drop it on a hill above what you want to destroy. if anything cuts it in half, you have two slightly less giant logs to deal with and a field of mustard gas. i am open for suggestions as to how you can make this great destructive item even more powerful. please post comments with your ideas.
