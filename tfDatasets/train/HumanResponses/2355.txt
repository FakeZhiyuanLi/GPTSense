well i don't really know what to write. i really want to film something. if you are reading this and you would like to be involved with a movie, let me know! oh yeah, it would help if you have a camera. it looks as though i will be making quite a few dollars on this 6th grade video i am doing. i'm already guaranteed $300, and it hasn't even gone on sale yet. hell, it's not even finished yet. wow, all that money for sitting on my ass. i can't wait to see what happens when i get a real job. grades are up, i'm getting a new cell phone this week, and things are all around good. i updated my profile so check it out or i'll castrate you with a rusty spoon.
