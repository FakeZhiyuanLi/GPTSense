and i've been sitting inside for almost 2 hours. don't ask me. tonight marks the last night of free time for me. :'( band camp is fun, but not fun enough make me want to spend more time there than my dad does at his job in a factory. working overtime. >_ i 'fixed' someone's computer today, meaning i tried futily to rescue a 3.5 year old piece of junk that hasn't had virus protection since 2001. i don't know what people are thinking. oh well, i'm going back saturday or sunday to try and finish up, hopefully i'll get it. i'm going to go wallow in depression, i.e. read a funny book. trlblzr
