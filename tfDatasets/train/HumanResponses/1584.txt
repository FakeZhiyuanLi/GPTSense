it's summer and i'm lovin it. this summer is going to include 2 major things. katlyn and golf. i'll be spending the whole with katlyn or golfing, and maybe i can get her to come golfing with me so i can have the best of both worlds. that would be neat. hopefully i'll lose some weight over the summer too so i can be skinny. woohoo! grandparents are leaving today so i can have my room back! yay! i enjoyed having them here so it's all good. i'll be glad to have my bed back so i can get off the floor. that's all for now, posts may be few and far between during the summer, but i'll try to keep you updated. i love you katlyn!
