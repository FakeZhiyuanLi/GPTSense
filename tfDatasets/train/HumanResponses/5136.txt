i thought that you'll maybe comment my note but you didn't and i'm very dissapointed:)but seriously i've just watched  moulin rouge" with my friends caroline and aga, that was a great film. i don't really like nicole kidman but she played very well in that film. now we're watching  gilmore girls" my favourite soup opera. but here in poland we had got just 2 series of it but that's o.k. i don't mind. but i'm jelaous of it that you have all the films earlier taht here in poland and that makes me furiousbut i'm not complaining. so i would like you to comment my note, please:)and thx
