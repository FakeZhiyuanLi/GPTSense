some things just don't stick in your mind. no matter how many times you try to remember. i just saw collateral tonight. i tend to forget the name of this movie every time i tell someone about it. "i just saw. that movie with tom cruise." is all that comes out! even in this post, i had to go back and fill in the name. the movie was pretty good, though i missed the ending. i figured that i had time to run to the bathroom and get back before the climactic moment, but as i returned, the action had ceased and the movie ended. it did have some great moments and lots of action. i enjoyed it and as soon as a bootleg becomes available, i'm catching the ending!
