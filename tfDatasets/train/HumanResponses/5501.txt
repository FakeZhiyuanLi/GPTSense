cold rain drops, falling on my face, wondering who i am, as i stare off into space. warm tear drops, running down my cheek, help me up please, i'm feeling so weak. cool rain drops, splashing on my face, wondering what's happening, as my heart begins to race. hot tear drops, searing down my cheek, i cry, and cry, i think i've sprung a leak. hot, cold, warm, cool, it's all running into one. all these sensations, have just begun.
