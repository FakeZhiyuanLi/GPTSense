working late. nothing unusal there - must stop doing it though. annoyingly i am off tomorrow so by working this late, its nearly midnight i shall be knackered tomorrow. still taking this opportunity to order some stuff off of play.com - the best internet site in the whole world at least when it comes to me parting with my money. so what am i getting? as you have asked so nicely i will tell you. dysrhythmia - pretest - the reviews seemed interesting so i thought why the hell not. i am sure i will regret it. charlie watts - watt's at scott's - this isn't actually for me but for a friend (honest guv) fred frith / john zorn duo - 50th birthday celebration vol.5 - i love john zorn the noise is wonderful. i probably have more john zorn than any other musician (frank zappa and merzbow are probably the next two). now i just have to get the other 4 cd sets in the 50th birthday release. right enough of this wibbling about on here - time to finish off and go home. oh ok one more coffee as well
