so today i'm alive and kickingmyself in the arse for staying out so late partying last nite. man, let me tell you, a couple of drinks and some crazy dance moves are a great sleeping pill. and it works just like one too, b/c this morning couldn't get up for the life of me. man, eeqaz you looked hot yesterday (or so that was the general consensus). cerellean, so did you hun, you're always hot. work, dreaded, but unavoidable, let's go.
