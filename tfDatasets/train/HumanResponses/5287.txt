now, have they not only "in a sense" snatched the car out of my hands. no, no my friends. they have managed to literaly take the car away. i no longer have a car. fuck, fuck fuck. now i have to go to fucking youth camp. four days in a room, sharing a bed with people i hate while my friends get a room to themselves, don't have to go through any of the bullshit of camp that i do, don't have to respond to alter calls or anything, because they're above that because they're in the band. meanwhile, none of my girl friends are coming, so all the way up there i'm going to be in a bus full of people i don't know, nor care to know because they know nothing. someone how i have to manage to be polite to everyone. even though im going to be sick and miserable and frustrated and think about how i don't have a car now.
