yes! summer officially began at 11:02am this morning. ahahahahahahaha to all you who are still in school. finals were a bitch, but at least they're over. i went over to my friend karl's house after school today along with another friend (joe). joe was like totally rocking out all day. 'twas pretty entertaining. ;) and then, of course, there was some time spent making fun of me, but that is to be expected. :p most people think that summer break means staying up late and sleeping until noon the next day. aaahahahahahahaha! i wish. here's my daily summer schedule: 5:30am - wake up, get ready for swim practice 6-8:30am - swim practice 9-10:00am - lifeguard inservice 12-6:30pm - work as lifeguard only positive thing is that i get $7 an hour. not too bad. :) k catch ya on the flip-side. more ramblings later maybe.
