today went by really fast i cant belive its already thursday! i thought eileen was mad at me earlier but she says she is just trying to keep her mind on her books!but at lunch i wouldnt eat her popcorn so i think she got mad but i had already eaten something. well so after that. stallins and me had a great convo about bowling for like 5 minutes i thought it would never end but finaly it did! as the bell rung i gatherd my things and walked w/ fro to science! then we wnet to lemays for some dumb ass demo's they were crap! so i sat next to hannah on the air conditioner.its was some fun stuff. in choir i didnt get a solo uh well but i wrote him saying i really really wanted one but i didnt beg. i was formal about it! or at least tryed to be so yeah that was my day pretty boring except for those morning annocements they were crunk!
