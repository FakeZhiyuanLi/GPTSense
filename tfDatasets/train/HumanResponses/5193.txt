work today was pretty cool. i got to drive the z machine mowers, and it was cake. i drove them yesterday as well, but today it was really fun because i got to do it all day. it reminded me of driving the quad at warren and grams in mississippi. now on to the bad news: my old boss has cancer and i just found out today. she is my mentor and one of my favorite people in the world so i'm saying my prayers that she will be okay. she's a tough cookie-but it's a major blow. i'm gonna light a candle for her.
