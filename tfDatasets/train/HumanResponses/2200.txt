so i was just at the disney website and they have a whole thing on each disney princess. my favorite one has always been aurora (sleeping beauty), and i took a quiz, and it says that i am most like her. wo0t! hehe. i also wrote a diary page. they have the cutest little diary page, so i wrote in it and it's so pretty! yay! i have also been looking for designs for my homecoming dress. i've been looking at the barbiecollector.com website. there are so many gorgeous dresses! i also looked at the cinderella dress that she first has but the step-sisters tear it up. that one's pretty too!
