i think the reason i hate physics is the teacher, ms. miller(the skinnier of the two). i think she thinks that we are all stupid. so, she decides to teach us like that. i just feel like yelling at her, "do we look fucking stupid?". other than that class and everything else is going pretty well. jen and i are doing well, which is always good. graduation is may 19, i'm counting down the days. only.oh screw it there's still a lot of days left. if you want to know exactly get a calendar and do the counting yourself. sorry if it seems i have an attitude, i really don't. control the pet population and have your pets spayed or neutered. till next time everyone.
