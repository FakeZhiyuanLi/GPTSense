i don't know exactly what wombok is. this the limit of my understanding so far: 1) it's some sort of green vegetable, possibly similar to cabbage. 2) there's a big box of it sitting outside my door. i know it's wombok because it says so on the box. 3) after a few days, it smells quite unpleasant. the chinese students that live in the apartment next door must have some kind of use for it. i'm assuming that if it was rubbish they would take it downstairs to the bin. in the six days it's been sitting in the hallway, though, it has not been tended to in any way, as far as i can tell - it just sits there, rotting, ignored by all (except, of course, me). i could throw it away myself, but that would be an admission of defeat. the wombok must not win.
