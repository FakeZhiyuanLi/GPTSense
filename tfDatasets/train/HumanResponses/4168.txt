whoa, i just got to spend an hour ouside in the grass, on a beautiful, sunny day. i alternated between just lying and relaxing and reading "the catcher in the rye". no, i've never read it before. i'm trying to avoid carbs. i wanna go play outside! since i can't do that, i guess, i'll just enjoy what i can. :)
