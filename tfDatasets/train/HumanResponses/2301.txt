deep inside me lives a voice that will not calm itself. it is a voice of chaos and confusion, it is the driving force behind many a foolish thing. when my life becomes dull, grey or restless; it is then that i feel this voice stir, like wayward leaves caught in an autumn wind. it dances on the edge with me, daring me, tempting me to go over. it is coy and beautifully mallicious. these days of my life go by like the pages of a book in the wind, with all of the important things caught in my mind like little catch phrases. i seek true love, to carry it around with me in my pocket; a small comfort in a world of discomfort. i do not understand my place in life, my purpose shall we say. i seek knowledge, challenge, and a space to grow. i seek an alcove of comfort and warmth, a warm port where i can feel safe and calm.
