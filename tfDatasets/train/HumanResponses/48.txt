ok well i couldn't think of a title. i apologize but its almost impossible to get a good title for every post about my extremely lame and sad life. sigh. anyway i'd like to thank evryone who posted in their blogs recently. before i had resorted to reading almost everyone's blogs the entire way through due to lack of entertainment. please people im me or email me at my new email adress sjd919@hotmail.com please people i need entertainment! today i got my haircut. i wasn't sure i needed cut but what the heck, right? wrong!. seriously i hate it. it's not a new style or anything it's just so darn short. the few curls i had had are now gone and it's just blahh. i'm gonna try some gel or something. if im not at wednesday night u people will know why. seriously pray for me and my hair. sjd
