yay, in.um.10 days i get to go to denver for nlc(national leadership conference), but that isn't what i am excited about, i get 200 dollars for going and i am going to save as much as possible so that when i get back i can go on a shopping spree! plus while i am there i will get to go to six flags over denver and host a few meetings and boss people around! can't wait! p.s.- i am not much of a patriot, but happy independance day to you all!
