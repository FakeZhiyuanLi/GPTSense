this morning i woke up at 4:00 in the morning becuase i could not breathe, literally. something in the night caused my asthma to flare up and i woke up struggling for air. after several attemps to slow my breathing down and several attempts at sleep my mom came in because she heard me. we went in to the doctor got my breathing under control and got an x-ray of my chest. the doctor said that my lungs were "cloudy" and that id have to take steroids for a couple weeks just to get healthy again and that was my wonderful start to the day
