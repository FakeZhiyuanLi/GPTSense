aaargh! issue: a last-second click got me to this public smoking poll. of course i voted agains public smoking (go away!), but among the poll results i found this comment: no don't ban it somepeople who have no choice to smoke cos they addicted, so it isn't rite bcos they have a rite to smoke in the street and it can show ppl how disgustin it is. i hate ppl who think bcos others smoke it must be cool like i smoke cant stop now most ppl in my class smoke and it shows me how disgustin it is and i wish i cud stop but i cant and i like to smoke in public to show that it is disgusting. for 10 minutes i will be glad that i'm not a citizen of a country which allows that degree of illiteracy. for 10 minutes i'll be happy i went to school in romania.
