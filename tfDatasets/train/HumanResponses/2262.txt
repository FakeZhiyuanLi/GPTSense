i think i may be in love. i've known her since i was a small child and am i finally realizing it? no i've had inklings before but this.let me explain. i was up at mick connelly's lake house after his son's bar mitzvah. we were all swimming and being happy and i was sad when she left and explaining is moot beyond this point. best of friends but one's a little bester.
