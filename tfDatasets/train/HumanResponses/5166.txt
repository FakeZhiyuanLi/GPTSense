the first private channel will broadcast from kuwait its alrai tv and its belong to jassim bodai (alrai alam) newspaper owner but its like a surprise cause its come without any one talk about it . and i think the channel will show news talk show and some kuwaiti drama and comedy series and they will broadcast from the ministry of information building in salmiya near souk alsalmiya and salmiya fire station maybe the minisrty will rent the building for the alrai tv its good to see private tv station broadcast from kuwait. you can watch alrai tv on nilesat. thats the start for private channel to broadcast from kuwait after the govement said ok for media city .
