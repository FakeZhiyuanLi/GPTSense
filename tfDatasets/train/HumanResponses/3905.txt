my attempts trying to be an intellectual: i think the best way of doing good to the poor, is not making them easy in poverty, but leading or driving them out of it. in my youth i traveled much, and i observed in different countries, that the more public provisions were made for the poor the less they provided for themselves, and of course became poorer. and, on the contrary, the less was done for them, the more they did for themselves, and became richer. -benjamin franklin, the encouragement of idleness, 1766 the inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal sharing of blessings; the inherent virtue of socialism is the equal sharing of miseries. - sir winston churchill how do you tell a communist? well, it's someone who reads marx and lenin. and how do you tell an anti-communist? it's someone who understands marx and lenin. -ronald reagan communism doesn't work because people like to own stuff. -frank zappa alas, it is all for naught.
