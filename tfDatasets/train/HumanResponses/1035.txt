just saw lost in translation with bill murray and scarlett johansson. i didn't think i'd like it, but it ended up being really good. it made me want to go to japan just to see some of the places they show in the movie, although meeting someone like johansson would be a definite plus as well :x. bill murray was hilarious as usual, and johansson was pretty good too. the whole movie has a dreamlike atmosphere that is just amazing. it just goes to show how two confused people, stuck in a strange place, can form a bond that transcends barriers that most people seem boxed in by. they seemed so comfortable in each others' company. then again, if i was sharing a bed with someone as beautiful as scarlett johansson i would be pretty comfortable too. the ending is really good and kept the film from being predictable. go see it.
