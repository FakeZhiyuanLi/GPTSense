this is my favorite lyrics of all timebye poison the well. please read them very slowly and carefully and take them em.let me know how you feel about em it describes so much " kisses are never safe when residue of old love is left how could i feel lesser when someone better walks around waiting for you to call out as your cold hand grasps mine i feel unright and privileged to be able to look in your eyes same chemical as stars deformed fingers leave trails of hearts in writing could three words be the end to births only meaning crying to sleep is my remedy urgently trying to stand on broken confused legs am i looking for reasons not to be happy emotions catch up with me i'm too fast for them"
