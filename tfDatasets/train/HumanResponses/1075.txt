i'm in a pretty good mood today. i'm looking forward to the puppets trip this weekend, and just enjoying ignoring my homework. lol. i watched the teaser for a movie, garden state, that comes out july 30th. it looks so good, the cinematography, the sharpness and clearness of the picture, it's beautiful. can't wait till it comes out, and it has a good plot too.^_^
