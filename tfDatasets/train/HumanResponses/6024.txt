it was a startling love affair that started out with a charming smile a mind-blowing flirtation between your seductive lips and my right ear those lips revealed the nature of endless possibilities. those eyes could easily start a fire i could feel beads of sweat down my bosoms and seeping though my clothes such torture deliciously tormented the tension a glimpse of transcendence- i saw. it was whimsical and dreadful. i idolized the untouchable fantasy. as i trembled with happiness, i excused myself out. on the corner of my eye, i knew i left an opportunity of what could have been… but the heart doesn’t lie. it was a startling love affair, that ended with desiring romancing smiling and waiting. *jenn_ramos
