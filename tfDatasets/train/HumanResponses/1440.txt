you are the only one that knows, the pain that haunts me, that shackles my feet to the dirt. you are the only one that knows, the fantasies i burn for, that bind my hands to the wall. you are the only one that knows, the things i want to hide from, that prod inside my head. you are the only one that knows, what my soul needs, and you're nowhere to be found.
