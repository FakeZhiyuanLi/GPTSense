the last time i attempted to publish to this here blog nuthin' happened! i spent an entire 15 minutes of my life typing words of brilliance that i wanted to share with the world. now, today because i have nothing sagacious and earth shattering to share, publishing will be just fine and this will be the most visible post here on my brand new blog. so now i shall click "publish" and see if this works. if it does work out, i feel compelled to say something deep.sooooo"where you are is exactly where you are supposed to be." how's that? :-)
