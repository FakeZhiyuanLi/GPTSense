my son is splashing around in the tub, saying "mama mama mama mama mama." over and over. he's been doing it for the past five minutes. i can hear in his voice that he's not in any pain or distress. i'm wondering how long he can sustain it. children are amazing to me. they have such stamina and will. "mama mama mama mama mama."
