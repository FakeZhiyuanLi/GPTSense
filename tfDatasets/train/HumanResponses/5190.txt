this morning i found an old yoyo and since then i have oddly enough been messing with it. like most kids, when i was younger (4 or 5 years old) i had a yoyo. it was a dark blue in color and had silver streaks on it, making it look really nifty (heh) when it was spinning. my ' new ' yoyo is a solid pink one, but its still cool. i had forgotten the pleasure one can receieve from the smooth motion of flipping the wrist up and down. it seems that the true classics never die and are always a pleasure. anyhow. i think i am going to go mess around with it some more. hehehe
