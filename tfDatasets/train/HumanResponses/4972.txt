here it goes. hey~ okay, i finally have the balls to do this, thanks to derek and steph! here is how i feel.i like steph so much, but i feel like she lies to me to make me happy. i ask her out on a date.while at the same time, she is asking someone else out on a date. it just sucks feeling like you're being lead on. for the record.love is a strong word and i don't necessarily love anyone, so my love for steph is not getting stronger. my like is getting stronger. mabey i'm not getting led on.ya never know. but the reason i decided to post this is i want honesty.so why not give honesty? their ya go. ~andy
