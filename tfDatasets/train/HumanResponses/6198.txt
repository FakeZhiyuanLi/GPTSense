the cardinals are the team to beat right now! the have been getting some big breaks and good pitching from a staff that wasn't supposed to be worth a damn! i am worried that their luck will run out once the post season arrives but until then i am rooting hard for the redbirds! here at home, logan is growing like a weed on miracle grow she is walking pretty much when and where ever she feels like going. has been getting a new tooth every 10 days or so. i really am amazed at everything that is happening. i am soooo thankful that i have a beautiful healthy little girl that her mother and i can spoil and love! that's all for today d
