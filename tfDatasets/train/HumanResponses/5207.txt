good times last night. our group attended karaoke. i planned on signing 'bad timing' by blue rodeo but they never called my name. but gosh darn was it ever a good time. beers (and when i say beers i of course mean good ole 1892 beers) were 2 for $5, quite the steal. photos taken will no doubt be incriminating. after the pub we had a snowball fight. i was snowbanked more times than i care to remember. my whole right side is aching. tomorrow we go home. hard to believe we have been here a week already. we are just starting to get into the swing of things. just starting to build friendships and now they are going to end. as usual, such is life.
