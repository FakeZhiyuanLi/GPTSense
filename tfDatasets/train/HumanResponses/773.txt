my first step into the world of blogger. my livejournal is just to read and comment on others. this.this is me. my hopes. my fears. my dreams. once before i tried to trust, and found my dreams shattered. even as the glass rose exploded outwards, glass shards flying everywhere, glittering in the light till it seems a thousand stars fell from the sky. i found it beautiful. and now, once more, i set forth my hopes and dreams. intact they are wonderous, in progress they gleam, and broken they are beautiful. help them break or help them grow, that is your choice. if i could have only one thing, it would be the power to change. people will not agree with me; in fact, most people do not. but if one thing could happen, it would be everyone who reads this learns something. they may not agree with my views. but i hope they take away an increased understanding of another person's perspective.
