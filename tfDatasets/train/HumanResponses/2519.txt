yesterday, i didn't get the chance to go online. i'm so annoyed about it. i just can't last a day without surfing the net. this morning, i opened my friendster account, and i was surprised to found out that i already have 28 friend requests, 4 testimonials, and 6 messages. not long after that, i again received messages. haha! hmmmthat's it whatever!
