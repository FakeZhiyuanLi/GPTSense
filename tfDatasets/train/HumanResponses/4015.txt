where on earth did spring go?!? we had, what, maybe 2 days of spring between freezing cold and this sweaty stuff it was like 88 around here today - sweat rolling between the mountains i call my chest. ponding up in my bra ready to burst! ass stickin to the nice computer chair we bought in the winter - leather, yeah great idea - then sitting in the bus today - must be 15-20 degrees hotter in the driver seat than outside - thought i was just going to melt and pour right down those bus steps into oblivion! how i wanted to smack the van driver this morning who whined over the 2 way radio as to the fact that her air conditioning wasn't working as good as it should - could have reached through that mic and strangle her least she has it! ok done with my complaining - for now.
