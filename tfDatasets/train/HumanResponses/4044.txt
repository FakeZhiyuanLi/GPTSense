i am so confused. i think i fell to hard and to fast and wishing that you felt the same way, i took things way to far for the short time i had known you. i would never act like that in my normal setting of life in hillsboro, and i think this started because it was something i could control, or atleast i thought i could. when things started out they were great, i didn't worry about what was next or how you felt, but now.its like tension all the time, or like your always in another state of mind when we're together. i would like to have a serious talk with you but you would just laugh it off or change the subject, but whatever.
