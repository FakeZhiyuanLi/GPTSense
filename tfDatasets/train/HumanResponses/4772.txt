oaky, this is a little new to me. i don't usually share my thoughts with anyone and am hoping it stays that way. i have discovered that it is helpful to put my thoughts into words. that makes what i am thinking a lot more concrete and realistic to me. what i mean to say is, just like when a thought is spoken, once it is written and someone reads the thought it is real and can't be taken back. so, as i begin a new chapter in my life with a new job and a move for my family, i thought i would try something new with jounaling my thoughts. maybe something profound will come of this.
