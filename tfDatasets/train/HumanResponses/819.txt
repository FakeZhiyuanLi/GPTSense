whatever you do, dont live there. it would be a waste of life. this town has nothing to offer me and i hate it. i want to go back to cincinnati where i had everything, here im confined to a 10mi radius of everything that sucks. unfortunatly im stuck here and asap im outa here. like my wife's family, town sux. if this were houston or dallas, life could be good. this place is a waste of dirt.
