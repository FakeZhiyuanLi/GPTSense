my god is everybody going cuckoo? why do people think its easy to design sites. why does everybody want that you give them world class designs in one day ! for me designing a site is first getting to understand what the client wants, and how to basically give him a good layout which actually helps him. i mean how do i understand, research and create a layout in one freaking day. i have always been a person who works really good under pressure. give me work with 15 days to it, chances are ill only work for 7 days on it, but ill finsih it on time :). in my last 6 years of experience i have been able to give almost 90% of my work on time. but now deadlines are getting to my head. maybe i need to relax, have a chilled drink and go out for 2-3 hours . have fun, take care pixel pusher
