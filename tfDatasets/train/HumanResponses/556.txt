everyone must have what he/she doesn’t want to remember any more. the more you try to erase such memories, the more vividly they get aroused. it is often said that you can naturally, little by little, forget what you don’t want to remember because your instinct works. but i think it’s not absolutely true. why do her faces, voices and touches still keep me so annoyed…?
