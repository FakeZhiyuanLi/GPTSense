first off, i won a t-shirt at work today. it's a nice "i am msn" t-shirt and i am excited to take it home and use it to clean the dirt off the wheel wells on my car. =p and then. a gatekeeper at my work, kelly (who i duped to win the t-shirt today *ha ha) went over to this construction site across from my work to find out what the hell they are doing. it looks like they are taking twenty 150 foot steel beams and shoving them deep into the earth right next to each other? anyone know what the point of that is? i guess we'll find out soon from "mentor call kelly" as i'll call him hmm. claping and cheering for kelly just erupted?! enquiring minds want to know. more soon.
