time for bed, yes all my energy is used up for another day. it seems i owe hubby some good lovin' since he was able to let my mil down easy about next weekend. whew! as well she has agreed to go to a chinese all you can eat on sunday for the kids. lets just home they have a great salad bar. i am not paying jenny craig money so i can just screw around on food i don't even like. i am so sad, ziggy's family is having a huge garage sale saturday morning, the only neighbor i liked on this street is moving. i hope we are next.
