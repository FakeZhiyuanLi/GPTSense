the day of which we do not speak is over my age is higher, but i'm really not older i guess 'cause you can't age a whole year in just one day. well i guess if you like got hit by a train it might make you feel really bad and oldwhat? let's see, it didn't really suck too bad at all. the boy and my love and i went to the state fair. it was pretty cool. i took a lot of pictures, some of them not so cool, some of them pretty ok. i am tired from it, from the walking. when i laid down in bed it felt so good. it was a tired i had earned instead of tired simply from sitting around and doing nothing. well hey wow look it's time for me to get ready for work. yippie working the weekend is just so so so dandy fun.
