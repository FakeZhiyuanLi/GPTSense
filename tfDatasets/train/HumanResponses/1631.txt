are they real or just some story made up to scare little kids? we may never know if these stories are real or not, but as far as i'm concerne, it doesn't matter. to me it doesn't matter if they're fact or fiction. if they're real then thats fine and if they're not then who cares? we should just let people belive what they want to belive. i'm not saying that i don't believe any of these stories i always give it a chance, but i could care less if they're real or not.
