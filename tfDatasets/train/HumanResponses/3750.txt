rainy days always make me feel lazy. *yawn* buti na lang i'm not in my hyper mood or i would've gotten pissed na naman sa techpoint (where the office bought my pc). eng eng kasi mga tao, i told them i wanted a p4 last year and the darn pc that arrived was a stoooppppid celeron 2.0ghz. ayan tuloy! wa pang one year, malapit na bumigay! (di pa ko hyper inis nito ha?) stupid processor can't handle the stress i put it through hahaha 0rpm na ang cpu fan speed when i checked hardware monitor a while ago. buti napansin ko ang init. i thought napapraning lang ako when i felt the cpu tower was hotdi pala! maybe if the weather gets better tomorrow, i might make talak our purchasing why they bought a stoooopid celeron. *yawn*
