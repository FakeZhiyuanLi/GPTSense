hard to believe i live in waukesha, sophisticated urbanite that i am. but let's face it. when the worst crime overnight is "a suspicious resident was carrying a stick and yelling at residents in the 800 block of eales avenue" and he does it at the reasonable hour of 6:34 pm, that's where i want to live. and as for the guy who was reported to police for carrying garbage bags and mumbling to himself at the county courthouse, i hear you brother, i hear you. i hate the garbage rules too. but the aldermen are at another location. of course, in many cases they're the same people so spilling your trash at the courthouse might not be a bad idea.
