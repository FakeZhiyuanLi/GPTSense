i have finished my shapely tank. i think the fit is wonderful. i really love this tank. woo hoo. its funny, just yesterday i joined the tank along and now my tank is done. that was fast. i think this pattern would have been better if written in the round. i may rework it for the round and try knitting another tank. this will be the first time i have tried re-working a pattern. i used berroco cotton twist yarn, but i do not really like it. the yarn split very easily which made working with it difficult. so, this will probably be the last project that i make with cotton twist.
