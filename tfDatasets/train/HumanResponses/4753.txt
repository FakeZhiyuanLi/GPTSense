geez this is really bugging me, my partner that is. so we have a kid in and he's here sitting in the room with me bugging me. can't he take the hint that i'm not listening to him. i'm on the computer trying to stay entertained and not pay attention to him? he was asking stupid questions again to coworkers agh man does he ever make me look stupid in front of people. don't get me wrong he's a nice guy but man oh man does he ever bug me. i'd better end before i get too worked up about this lol.
