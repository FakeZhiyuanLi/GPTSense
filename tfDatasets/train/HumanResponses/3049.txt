brought back by poular request.i am now writing in my blog. man i am wiped out. by now i'm probably infested with various childrens' deadly diseases, along with a few smashed foods in my face and hair, oh yes, and a few bruises on top of it all. oh, how i love camp :) hey well i am at loss for words, most likely becuase of my lack of alertness at the moment (which means that i should not be drving, since that, of course, would be dangerous.drivers ed is quite the learning spot). so anyways.going to go soak up the sun that has been gone for a while :) till we meet again
