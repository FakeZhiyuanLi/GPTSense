its completed! as i'm writing this entry, i'm celebrating my completion of [the last chance]. yes, i specially stayed up tonight to write it! to annabelle, who really seems to like my story, i think you'll be particularly happy now! now that i'm done with that , i'm going to seriously start writing that new story, probably a sequel to [the last chance]. the original seemed quite popular, so i'm doing a sequel! at this rate, i'll have enough experience in writing to become a writer by the time i reach my 14th birthday!
