well, tomorrow is the beginning of my journey back into the heart of graduate education in fort worth. i'm feeling a little nervous about it all, but on the whole, i think that it will be a good place for me to be for the next 3 years or so. i'm pretty tired right now, but i figured i would post a little ditty before i went to bed to "mark" the occasion of my foray back into the proverbial fire. i'll let you know how things go tomorrow night. hopefully my ibook will be here by then. cheers.
