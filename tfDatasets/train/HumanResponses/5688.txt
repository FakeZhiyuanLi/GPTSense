today me and my sister had to clean our room. it was a complete mess and she thought it wouldnt take long but i knew it would take all day and i was right we started around 1:30 and we didnt finish until 7:45 pm. but its all worth it because now you can see evey piece of the floor that was supposed to be shown because i would always cover it up so noone would see the mess but now its actually clean! :d but then that means when i get back from showchoir camp my room will be clean! (hopefully)
