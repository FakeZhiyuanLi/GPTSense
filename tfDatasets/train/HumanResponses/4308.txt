what do i do now? :-/ it looks like my diet and excersise buddy soesn't want to be apart of it. :-( oh well, she's going through a lot now. stupid mikey of course you had to ask me to homecoming. of course i would say no. i thought we had this talk before! i think of you as like my brother! nothing more! now janise doesn't even want to go to homecoming anymore. because you said maybe and not yes. and you asked me! why is it so hard for you to get over me? :-( i don't want to be mean but thats just gross! :-p mikey i love you with all my heart. but its a different kind of love. we have fights, i can tell you anything and everything, i understand your problems, but it all sums up to being long lost twins. :-/ i could never love you like that. atleast i could never dream of it at this point. any advise from any readers? :-p still looking for someone to go with. *hint*hint* :-* lol xoxo
