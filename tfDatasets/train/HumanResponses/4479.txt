this song by sheila chandra exemplifies how i am feeling right now for that special someone who is on my mind. ever so lonely, sheila chandra ever so lonely ever so lonely without you ever so lonely sink into your eyes and all i see love is an ocean and you for me sink into your eyes your eyes are all i see your love is an ocean an ocean refuses no river ever so lonely an ocean refuses no river waiting for the time when we can be alone together alone together eternally the ocean, the ocean refuses no river the ocean, your ocean refuses no river ever so lonely ever so lonely without you your ocean your ocean refuses no river
