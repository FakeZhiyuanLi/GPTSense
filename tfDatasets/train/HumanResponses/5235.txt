once on chance impulse i stopped a happy crazy thought it was to visit with the tarot reader on summer soltices day a big and busy fair it had been with silly friends i had been seen bubbling with all the skepticism i shook hands with a mysterious man he spoke in hindi to my surprise had lived in pune at osho's premise inquired with polite grace what i pressing issues i meant to trace alas if only i had no worries i spoke of the one thing on my mind he spread the cards across the table i picked one as i was able with fan and flare he proceeded its the "ahha" card he conceeded an impending revelation - a sudden flash of comprehension was to delight me! i must certainly have looked confounded for quite unnecesarily he expounded words i wished he wouldn't have spoken wounds i wished he wouldn't have opened all the turmoil - i know i bolted into the temporary respite of sounds and sights a crowd had gather around to cheer an honest street artist conquer his fears.
