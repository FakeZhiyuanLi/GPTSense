so.today was our first real day of work, alhtough i wouldn't really call it workit was more or less glorified "orientation." we had the opportunity to explore all the spectrophotometers that we had learned about yesterday.that was fun.almost took up an hour of our day. anyways our day progressed and we finally realized that we were going to be doing a ton of measurements after our meeting with dave wyble. for the rest of the day we took a series of 50 measurements on the first few of all 12 spectrophotmeters. fun stuff
