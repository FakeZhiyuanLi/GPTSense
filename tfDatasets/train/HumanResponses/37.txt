so once we got everyone out the office last night i went and bought a few beers and me and dave toasted the office. those few beers soon lead us to the waterside for a few more. the end result was me dave and bob drinking a bottle of tequelia. good times :o) if only my head didn't feel like someone was kicking it all nite (looks suspiciously at clare)
