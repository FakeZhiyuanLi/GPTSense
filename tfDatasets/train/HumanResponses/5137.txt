hi everyone this is my first note and i don't know what exactly i could write about but i'll say a few words about myself. my name is sonia and i'm 15. i'm from poland and i live in the capital of poland-warsaw. my favourite music is punk, rock and nu-metal . my favourite bands are good charlotte, blink 182, limp bizkit, linkin park, slipknot and korn but the most i like is good charlotte. now i'm sittink in my pink room with my best friend aga who came to me for a week because she leave far away from my town. it's boring now because the weather is awful and we're sitting at home and doing nothing. i don't know what else can i say. i'm wondering if you like my blog but we'll see.
