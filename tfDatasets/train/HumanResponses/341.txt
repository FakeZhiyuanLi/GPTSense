uurrrggg! i'm sooo sad. my mom said that we could possibly get a dog we saw on an adoption website. then today when we were going to go see the puppy, she said that we didn't have enough money because im getting braces soon. i wonder if im being too selfish. hmmmm. my friend slept over last night and one thing that i realized about him is that he smells like a wet dirty dog eeewww. so many people want me to go to their houses for a fourth of july party. i cant decide which persons house to go to cause i don't want to hurt anyone's feelings. decisions decisons.
