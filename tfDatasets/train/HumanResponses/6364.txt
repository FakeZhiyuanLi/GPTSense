today i'll tell you guys about something called school. mine is a big hulking structure of plaster and metal, tehiyah day school. it's a jewish school, and with this comes good things and bad things. i've listed these for you in a handy pack: good point:you can get away with crazy shit and no one does anything. bad point:you can't do anything normal or you will be punished. good point:the kids are nice and sheltered. bad point:the kids are all white and sheltered. good point:all meals are healthy and vegetarian. bad point:no meat in school meals. good point:no extra classes. bad point:no extra classes. as you can see, my school is a piece of crud, thanks for reading folks! current muzic: gary newman-cars
