went to watch [shrek 2] today it was hilarious, i was laughing almost the whole duration of the movie. donkey is the funniest! and puss in boots. keeps giving those glassy, innocent looking eyes, so adorable! and there were the three blind mice (of whom one fell into a hole), pinnochio (who denied wearing ladies' underwear and made his nose grow longer), and all sorts of other fairy tale characters! its like a mix of all the nursery rhymes, fairytales, and all that stuff. i regret not watching the original shrek; i love it!
