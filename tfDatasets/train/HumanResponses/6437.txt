wow, two great games in two nights, yay! the european soccer championship is becoming increasingly exciting and i never thought i was going to say this after my team had to get its lazy ass back home ^_^ oh, and yesterday it was the city's patron saint holiday hence.i couldn't call the dentist ^_^ but the good news is i just decided it's time to stop once and for all feeding my soul with inconsistent and useless fears. at the end of the day i'm happy no matter what, and intend to go on this way.
