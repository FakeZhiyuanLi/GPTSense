i just learned today that many students fall into the "trap" of college life. that is, they still think its highschool for them. the parties, the gimmicks, the late-night tv shows, and of course.procrastination. well, i guess i really shouldn't feel bad about it-missing all those parties and suchafter all, my parents are having a hard time sending me to college.let's just say that i belong to those who "can't afford to fuck up" kind of people. well, i guess that is just for now.
