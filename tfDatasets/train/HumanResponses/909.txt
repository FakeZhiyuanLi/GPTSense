well, i'm free for 10 whole weeks. no more school; no more worries - and lots and lots of sleep. finally, after 15 exams and more stress than a pmsing single mum, i can finally collapse and not care any more. life is becoming good. man, i'm tired. i really should stop talking to people until 3am. and stop with the chocolate - i think it may be keeping me awake. now i need to get myself out of these shitty school clothes. later. oobs.
