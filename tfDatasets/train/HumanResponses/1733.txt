last night i cried for many feelings could only be expressed in such a way. i don't even know where to begin, hopefully the developed pictures(hopeully by next week) will tell the story better than me. it didn't even matter what medals i recieved or certificates i was awarded. the greatest honor was getting jt's old congress notebook. . .god, i'm going to miss that kid. this years end was emotion incurring enough- i can't even imagine how bad it will be next year.
