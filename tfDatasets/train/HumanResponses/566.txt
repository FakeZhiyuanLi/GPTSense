well, today was another eventful day of school.if that's what you want to call it. today was a "b" day, so i had adv. english; band; alg. ii; and adv. biology. i really don't like these days. i mean, the only class i really like is english because ms. curtis is pretty cool. i don't even like band at the moment. i'll tell you more about it later. but yeah, i really hate days like this.
