well today was a normal monday, just kinda hung around during the morning sleep, eat, eat some more and that was about it. this afternoon i went rollerblading which was fun i guess, i chased my sister with the hose which was fun. after dinner i went on a bike ride, had to stop at ace hardware and get some wasp killer, then went to my grandparents sprayed a nest and got attacked by wasps. didnt get stung luckily tho. then i went on the trail with silvia, and oh boy was that funhaha. first i found a rubber duck, which almost saved our lives (maybe), then it took about 5 mins to cross laport, and then we were attacted my mutant bugs which followed us around and there were thousands! and they would just spawn in front of us. anyway i got home around 8 and now i sit here typing this thinking about my last free week before school. today was a much better day then the weekend, and i hope it continues that way,.
