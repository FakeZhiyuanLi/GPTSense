paris hilton and nicole richey was on fox last night in "simple life 2" season premere. this show was quite disturbing in the fact that two of the richest broads in america are begging for money. not only are they begging, but it shows average people like you and i handing over 5 dollar bill after 5 dollar bill. nicdole even offered a gas station clerk to work for 30 seconds for free stuff. this week's dumb people irl goes to average americans who come in contact with nicole and paris.
