lori had her note published today. it is quite exciting. i have a personally autographed copy. even though she defines attorney in her condensed note, she does no such thing in her student note. it is very impressive. she even wished me best wishes today. and that coming from lori, it means something. yael got all the best from lori. i think best wishes are better because i wish for things that are better then the best. they are the bestest. that is what i am so special. special like a fox. ok, must go do the advanced evidence and crim questions. those are going to be tough. tough with a capital t. like for trouble but tough instead. ok, off to the questions.
