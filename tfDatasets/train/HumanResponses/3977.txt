have you ever been in a group of people where there are people you have never met? and then one of these new people comes up and ask you what your name is and where you are from? creating the perfect opportunity for you to ask the same questions back, but realize you really don't want to? you tell yourself, that you do not care what there name is or where they are from? most of the time it's shrugged off and the "don't care" reason is blamed. well, i don't think that's fair. i mean if you really did not care you could at least ask them and then tune out. but you don't even do that. why? because you are to lazy. to lazy to open your mouth and mumble a sentance. that is a true sign of a lazy person.
