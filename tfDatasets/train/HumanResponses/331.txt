always have this fear that the white bunny, subaru, will go psycho and start to attack whenever we get near. she's done it before. subaru seems fine now. we've separated the two. hokuto in one cage, subaru in another. subaru apparently couldn't stand the continuous humping attempts from hokuto. subaru is calmer now. will come up to your finger to be rubbed on the nose. really cute. of course it's only because subaru wants out of the cage to hop around the living room. once out, subaru will growl at any attempt at physical contact. *sigh* psycho bunny.
