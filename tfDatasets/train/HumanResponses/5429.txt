we, my family and i, spent the weekend with one of our friends in their villa located in damaavand road . it was fun and at nights got very cold. they had a dog named spike , a good boy. soon enough we made friends and he started chasing after me here and there, asking me to go and play with him. he was such a large dog, so large that after a bit of playing, during which he used to stand up on his legs and push me backwards, both my arms became painful! but all in all, it was fun and above that i needed it badly.
