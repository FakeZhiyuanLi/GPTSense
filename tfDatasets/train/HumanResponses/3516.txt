my neighbour died sunday that's like a big shock for me cause i've not even get over the death of jink yet i was really confused and didn't know what to do my parents said i needed to talk more but i just can't, it's too hard for me my dad asked me if i wanted to come with them to see her one more time but i can't and won't i just can't believe that someone with that age has to pass away. i'ts not fair, it really isn't. damn it. jelte cheared me up that night, he was all conserend about me really sweet :). the funeral is friday, in the same room where the funeral for jink was, i think that's going to bring up all of the memory's hmf. i really can't let this go :( but i have to, even if it's too hard. i'll have to miss jelte today, cause i have to stay at home that's what my parents said and oh yeah, i got fired last thursday buh. stupid people and stuff. byee
