well it's either clean my bathroom or play on the internet. i think you can guess which activity won. my life is consumed by work lately. i live for fridays and am not enjoying my job anywhere near as much as i used to. it's alright, but i guess the saving grace of my sanity is the people i have the pleasure of working with. i've made some good friends at work and we all get to bitch about how much our jobs suck. i never used to do that a year or so ago i need that footy tipping prize, get away from it all at the company's expense. ;) 9 weeks and 2 days to go (but who's counting?)
