ahhh. just booked for my first weekend away with the girlfriend. can't wait! we're going away somewhere so we can be together with no distractions, just me and her, spending lots of time in each other's company. i'm going to try my best to make it a wonderfully romantic weekend. i hope i can, because i love her so much. steve ;)
