i just wanted to take a moment to clarify something, based upon the feedback that i have thus far received. i really hope that i am not expected to have all of my posts be as enjoyable as the first. my mind is generally following about ten random and unrelated tangents at any given time. sitting down and writing is my atempt to bring at least a few of them together for myself. so don't be alarmed if some of my posts seem to have no relation at all. . .if i don't know where i'm coming from, how can i expect anyone else to? :p
