ahhh, so after a talk with a friend and a weekend in the country i'm much calmer. saturday was absolutely wonderful. jb and i went to a farmer's market, went swimming then fell asleep on the grass in the shade. the relaxation was much needed and i feel soo great. oh, we went shopping on friday and i spent way too much money. i got some supper cute heels though. i've always been into girlie things. i love pink but this season is making it sooo much easier to be into pink. i love it. i bought little pink heels with wonderful tiny black bows on the side. i also bought a bunch of "work" clothes. i'm soo happy!
