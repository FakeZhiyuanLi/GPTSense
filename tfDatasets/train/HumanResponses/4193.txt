i had a dream last night that i had another baby. weird thing is that i am fixed to not have babies anymore and have been for almost 5 years. the baby was born in the bathtub and i dropped her in the bathtub because i had no help having her. she was still okay and beautiful. i wonder why i am having birthing dreams? i think i will go look it up!
