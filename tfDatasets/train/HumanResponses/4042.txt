this post was submitted by brent fehnel (that's butchie's real name for those of you who don't know) and captures the status that we are striving to attain in the summer of 2004: "in 1972 a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn't commit. these men promptly escaped from a maximum-security stockade to the los angeles underground. today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune. if you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the a-team."
