you know who's an awesome frontman? yes. that guy. but you know who else? james hetfield of metallica. the guy has it all. he's a hardass, with a killer voice for metal vocals, and he plays some badass rhythm guitar. he's written some of the best songs the music industry has ever heard, and some they haven't. he's written some masterpieces, and the guy battled alcoholism. i mean, yeah i loved his writing more when he was a drunk, starting fights with his own drummer. but you gotta love the fact that the man took his life in his own hands and fought back at his challenges, and overcame them. so, thanks mr. hetfield, for kicking so much god damn ass. just come back to montreal dammit.
