memorial day, another holiday to add to the rest. another day we have off of work or school. this holiday like so many other's have lost all meaning. what is memorial day? why does our country celebrate those who fought in war when the war itself could have been avoided all together? could it be that man kind has a thing for killing? is that why god put us on this planet, to hate one another? to fight over stupid things such a land? we worry about being rich and making up in the world, but does it really matter? will it matter when we die? all the riches of this world could not save our soul from damnation. so what is memorial day anyway?
