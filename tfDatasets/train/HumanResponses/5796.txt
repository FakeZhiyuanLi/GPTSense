the other night, drinking of course, kim suddenly decides she has chicken teret's. she starts clucking and bocking and crowing cock a doodle doo at the top of her lungs in the middle of sentences. i haven't laughed that hard since steve, in pitch darkness, ran straight off the side of the cliff into the river below, we didn't know there was a cliff or a river, until we heard the splash. anyway, the next morning, i asked ron if he heard me come in last night. he says no, but i heard a chicken. her rooster is much better than her elephant.
