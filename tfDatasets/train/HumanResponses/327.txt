it is friday. week went by quickly. need to bring in my car for a check up and then have an eye doctor's appointment. that is my weekend so far. also need to finish the case modification i'm trying out on my old g3 minitower. started to put starry night on it but stopped half way through. always a problem of mine. starting something and just lose interest half way through. oh well. i am bound and determined to finish this. hopefully.
