you ask me to love you, ask me to forgive you, ask me to forget, forget the lies of our existance. you ask me to live with out you in my world, and i cant do it. you stand there like a huge void in the doorway. or maybe thats what i want you to be. just a huge void in my life. please, pleaes leave this world to me and close your eyes and leave me to write.
