i was reflecting on the fact that i do have a fair amount of hobbies and pastimes. i collect holly hobbie stuff, i like to write, i sew, i knit, i crochet (but nothing that requires me to crochet circles - i can't do circles),i have developed a liking for patchwork, i like to garden, i collect jackie annuals and magazines from the 60s, 70s and early 80s, i like to cross stitch.in fact a whole load of hobbies that make me sound like a mad old pensioner. yet conversely i have a very technical job, involving telecomms and networking and internet related things and all kinds of weird and wonderful goings on. therefore i am a paradox.or is it quixotic? or a paradigm? i think i will be all three and what do you do in your spare time?
