a day goes by with nothing to mark it but an "x" on the calendar. my feet have moved one in front of another mechanically as if pulled by some outside source. tuesday was the same as monday and monday was the same as sunday. two days back from vacation and already the rat race has reclaimed me as its prime participant. please, no more subways, no more solitaire. i miss the salty air of the beach and the wind in my hair under sundrenched skies. here there is nowhere to turn but to the gray concrete beneath my feet or the metallic surfaces of the valleys i cross on my way from and then back home. if i didn't know better i'd think i was sleepwalking, but i know this isn't a dream.
