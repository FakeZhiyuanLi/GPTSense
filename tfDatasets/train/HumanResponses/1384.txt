today we all went to the stream again.it seems like we practically live there. anyway, it was fun, especially when my flip-flop floated downstream to the deep part and j had to swim to get it for me! we had to walk through a field of stinging nettles on the way home.that was two hours ago and my legs are still in agony.it can't be a good thing. we made a friend! dave! some 'skater' we met as he cycled past the stream. he can't really skate, and he has the scrawniest legs.you could snap them.it's weird! anyway we had a five minute conversation with him and then he cycled off into the village. tomorrow grandma arrives.great. tomorrow me, j, sara and meg might be going to the cinema, but i have no idea what we're going to see. i'm starving to death! i'm so hungry.
