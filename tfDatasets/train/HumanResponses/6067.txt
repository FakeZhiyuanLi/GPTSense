kama'ane'iku'ulokomaika'iika'kahakai sonnet oh here is my grace for the beaches the large rainbow fly up high above sky how captivating is the state of hawaii a real paradise - the mixture of peaches pineapple, coconut, lau lau, kalua pig mahalo to my ancestors for the charmed mentality and i'd be magically swarmed with aloha spirit and the love of big and small people who celebrates the wind god to blow us away and feel so cool so refreshing and crispy unlike the pool i must taste the salty and sweet kind of waikiki beach - for i to admire and grace the god of ocean and dignify his place ~kekua april 2004
