my last year at junior high was the worst. i didn't enjoy it at all. people spreaded rumors about me and my friend terra. also people who i thought were my friends turned on me. i really hated it. also i lost my boyfriend i had for 8 months. i didn't get a part in drama, this fat girl that can't sing got the part i wanted! it was just a really bad year.
