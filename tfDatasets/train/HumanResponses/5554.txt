went to a chinese orchestra concert by raffles girls' school today! it was great, especially since i'm in one myself. by that, i mean i'm in a chinese orchestra. guest performance by the indian orchestra; truth be told, i wasn't too fond of the indian performance. it was a bit. soft for my liking. i prefer pieces with drums in them, loud ones, rather like the chinese orchestra. the indian orchestra's drums were minute! never mind about that, anyway. 2Â½ hours! izza and cheryl were there too. to pass the time during the 15-minute interval, i tried to write. but i didn't get too far; writer's block.
