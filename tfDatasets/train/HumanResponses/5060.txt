i never used facial cleansers or moisturizers. i never washed my face before bedtime or even splashed it with water to make it sure it was hydrated. my thought was always hey, if it ain't broke (read: no pimples/acne), don't fix it. but man, times are changing. because of my part-time job as a server, my hands are always getting dirty from handling plates and glasses. and, because i have short hair, my hands are always touching my face to push back the hair that is always falling into my eyes. so *poof*, i have pimples. so today, i decided to invest in skin care products. the only problem is, in order for my skin to get better, it has to get worse. that's right. for a few weeks, i have to tough it out with super red, shiny pimples (even bigger than the ones that i have right now!) growing in every which crevice of my face while my skin goes through a "detox" phase. i am no longer vim. for the next few weeks, you can call me pizza face.
