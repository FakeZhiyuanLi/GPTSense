when i am looking forward to something i usually blow it up in my mind to something so fabulous that i am bound to be disappointed. this is especially true of the haircut i had yesterday. i just wanted the same cut i had but a little shorter, not too difficult. or so i thought. all of the sudden the top layer of my hair is 3 inches shorter that it had started and the back didn't change, leaving a long layer that flips up. it is like a mullet gone terribly wrong. and she thinned it which i specifically asked her not to do. fortunately my sisters will help trim the unsightly back so i wont have to wrap my head in a scarf to go outside.
