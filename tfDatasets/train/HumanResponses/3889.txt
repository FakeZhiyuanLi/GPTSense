i will start to go away i want to say i am a free man now. i don't want to hurt anyone. specially not her coz i have hurt her a million times. as it is, i don't know if i am, i guess i am. but she's getting by. her pride and probably her resolve to make things work for her is getting her by. though i know deep inside she's hurting. because of me. i know how i can make her really happy. but i just cannot do it now. most especially now that i have to clear out certain issues about myself. i am contented to see her happy, no matter how contrived it is. i know she's not, deep inside she's not. but something tells me she's on her way there. she can make things work for herself. so i believe i am ready to leave her now for good. maybe slowly, i will drift away. and never bother her. we'll finally have our separate lives. maybe once in a while i will check on her. i hope i can let her be. let her find her own peace. i will leave her for good.
