mmmm, not that impressed. only ones in library, so have to go up stairs, along, then down some others. they stink of air freshener (so much, hard to breathe, and the ioe library is stuffy at best of times). anyway, went through small cubicle into main bit and was (for once) almost thankfull of the air freshener. the first cubicle was already inhabited. and eminating from it was strong smell. not of useual toilet smells, more a sweaty, not very hygenic kind of smell. anyway, the middle one was blocked so had to go for number three, which has a cracked loo seat. when you sit on it, the seat expands, thus making gap in said crack wide enough for some flesh to squeeze into it. when you stand up though, the seat contracts, catching a bit of your skin in it. this seat has been like that for 9 months at least now. but the smell left with the first cubicle's inhabitant. and sinks were ok. not greasy like they sometimes are. and surface area by sinks was clean.
