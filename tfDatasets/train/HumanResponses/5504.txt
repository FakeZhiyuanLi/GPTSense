love, i think it is. some time or another, it comes after us all. you never know who or when, why or how, it just happens. everyone findes their own way to express it. some through affection, some through poetry, music, song, dance some through death or other ways. when love picks you, you can run, can hide, but you can't get away. once you know it, you can't deny it. it is horriably lovely and sweetly painful.
