my wonderful employer has the incredibly sensible and civilized policy of giving us fridays off in the summer. nine weeks of 4 day weeks (actually a couple of 3 day weeks thanks to the statutory holidays), what could be better? well ok, permanent 4 day weeks would be better but hey i'm happy with what i'm given.
