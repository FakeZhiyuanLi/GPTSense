hey nothing much going on here lately. went downtown last night but jeff decided to pull another cinderella and leave at 10pm, so then it was shitty. thanks jeff. and nowhm it is shitty out today, i hope it rains and thunders and lightnings. then i can just sleep all day because the boys are going out with their aunt and uncle. there's not much else to say. certain someone has been trying to cause some more bullshit drama, but i'm just letting it go because it's so fuckin retarded. oh, britt moved to michigan to live with her dad. she said he is excited to have her there and she seems excited too so that's awesome. shes goin to community college like me haha go britt. thats all for now. lata :)
