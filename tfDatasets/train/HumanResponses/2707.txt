so here at ygy? heard that we had competition from the likes of the stupidity police and we would like to post our formal statement about the matter: "we couldn't care less" quoted from the editor himself. anyway in other news google fans out there can get their very own g-mail accounts that have a gb of storage. does that seal the deal. i don't think so. apparently you can't delete any of your mail, ever. crazy- yes! also google will constantly search your 'private' mail and send you appropriate spam! madness but some may say it is worth it for all that storage.
