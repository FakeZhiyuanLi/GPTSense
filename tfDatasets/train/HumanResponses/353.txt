holy shit. could work be any more intense this week? /chandler i've got data from two new radars, an emi sensor, a seismic sensor, new data from an old radar, a paper to write and about 30 other different bug fixes and tweaks to do. it's insane. in any case i've been a total pony all week, staying up late working, waking up late, working, etc. it's like grad school all over again. although i di kind of feel like maybe i'm back in the tons and tons of work groove - which is a good groove to be in when you've got tons and tons of fucking work. weekend, where for art thou?
