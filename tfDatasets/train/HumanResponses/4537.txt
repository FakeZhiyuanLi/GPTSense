today was the beginning of our third week.we have been doing pretty much the same thing in repetition.so not too much was learned on my part.but we have perfected our time for our long term repeatability measurements.about 40 minutes for 48 measurements.not too shabby.if both of us got here at the same time we could posssibly finish before our 8:45 morning meeting.
