in the future i plan to go to college and get a well paying job. i also plan to buy a big house and treat my wife like a queen. my wife will never have to work or do anything besides make me happy and spend my money. i would like to take my wife on romantic trips to other countries. i plan to be very successful and live a very good life. when i do get my well paying job i will try to get a car collection. one of my hobbies will be racing so that my wife can tell me no don't do that and she can worrie about me and then i'll still do it.
