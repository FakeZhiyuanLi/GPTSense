well i can't say that i'm upset right now with the way things are going. m and i are talking all the time, and i can't get her out of my head. she loves me :d i love her too. now my only issue is the time. i'm still afraid that two years would be way too long of a time right now, and then, even if we made it, it'd be another 2 and a half again before anything could really happen. n is still an issue, because she e-mails me constantly, and i stil care for her, but in the end, m will be mine. i don't know what to do about n though. i keep thinking about my life, and the person that i am. i want to change stuff. it's time that i clean up, and i plan to actually do it and stick to it this time. for the first time in a long time, i'm happy with my life.
