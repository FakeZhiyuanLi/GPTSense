now i have something to do on weekends (that is besides getting bored!). just re-re-re-addicted myself to the wonders of rpgs on pcs (role playing games). i was consumed by it during high school, college, even after graduation. but there is always something that pulls me back to the reality where i belong. relationships (with breathing people), time and of course money; these things wake you up. i wonder what's gonna pull me back now. alone and lonely in a far far away galaxy. this is my saving grace.
