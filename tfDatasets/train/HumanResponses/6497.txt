the house purchasing stress levels increased yesterday, as the seller refused to reduce the price to allow for us to carry out remedial work. we wanted 7k off; in the spirit of comprimise i said we would accept 5k off. they said no, only 3.5k. i told them to get stuffed. anyway, the valuer who originally dealt with the seller has phoned her and told her not to be so stupid, and they are now going ahead with the 5k reduction. carol took some pursuading to go ahead though, she had taken a major dislike to them for messing us about.
