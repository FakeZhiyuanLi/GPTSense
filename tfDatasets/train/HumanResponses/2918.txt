well i'm back in town. didja miss me? i have a few pictures, but not a whole lot. it was really gloomy and dark on saturday but sunday was bright and filled with sunshine. i got to see my brother play ultimate frisbee and it was pretty cool. it's a blend of football and frisbee, as far as i could tell. well i have to go but i have lots more to say.
