you can lash me with your words of anger or shoot me with your two by four. kill me if you have to but just don't keep me in this cave of darkness and weary loneliness. can't you see that i'm in pain.? feeling sorry for my broken heart yet tryin to be an iron inside. even in this cold i can feel myself burning helplessly by your deliberate ignorance. what am i to you now? am i just there to fill the vacant slot on your leisure timetable? tell me now for i can't stand this loneliness a second longer. - nadz -
