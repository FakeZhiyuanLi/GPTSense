i feel, neutered. i used to be so mean, callous and just down right happy to inflict pain upon others. what happened? i can't anymore, even when people insult me all i can do is smile like it was funny or the like. why? i don't know, maybe i'm becoming more and more pious like i had always hoped i could be, but now finally being able to do it thanks to my unborn son and the anticipation i await him with. i feel like i've lost who i am, but i'm comforted by the fact that i feel as if i have gained something much more special and much more meaningful. either way, i know if the situation calls for it i won't be nice. just hope that situation never comes.
