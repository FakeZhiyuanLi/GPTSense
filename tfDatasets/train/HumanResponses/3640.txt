hello everybody. i hope everyone's weekend was pleasant. before i forget, we need to get jon shaw on here. somebody get me his non-work email address. jeremy.i'm looking in your direction. welcome back to the right coast, ryan. my whirlwind beach trip was good this weekend. my brother and sister-in-law came to my place on friday night, so i actually got to hang out among good company for the first time in a month. a trip to and from the beach in 36 hours was a little more stressful than i'd like, but it was good to be on the sand in nice weather. i got a brutal sunburn, so i feel pretty crappy. the sunburn and the active weekend are also contributing to me being extremely tired. my body and i just aren't getting along much lately. hopefully we'll work it out. hope this finds everyone well. people need to start posting more. love, mjl.
