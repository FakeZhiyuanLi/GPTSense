how could i forget to mention it? last friday was my last day at uni as a student. i had my media law exam last thursday and then wrapped up another module on friday, and then, out in the sunshine. i've been in this situation before, but i guess you can never get used to it. it's a mixture of wild joy and crazy angst. what to do now? my gut reaction was to apply for any job anywhere in the uk i thought i could do. but then, i calmed down and thought about my own business. about the dream of being self-employed. you own boss. i still have it. so, there we go, at this point of writing i am officially self-employed. i have a client who needs his website and other things done by the end of june, but after that? no idea whatsoever.
