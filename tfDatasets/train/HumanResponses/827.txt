the truck stopped in front of the green rear security door. the .40 cal machine gun opened a volley upon the door. the hail of led penetraited through the aluminium and smashed the lock beyond recognition. the two men in the front jumped out of the beaten truck cab. both carried ak-47s with 30 round banana clips with gas masks. one had very old and shifty eyes, the kind of a war veteren that had been in the feild too long. the other man was very young and green. the older man pulled open the remains of the dorr while the other covered the hallway inside. white light, white walls, and a white tile floor almost blinded the men. both of them rushed down the hallway."we need lab 12," belted the older man. "were at lab 15 now," screamed the other. as they ran two security gaurds rounded the corner.
