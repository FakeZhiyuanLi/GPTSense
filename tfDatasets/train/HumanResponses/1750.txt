not a good day for me. :( somehow, i lost my balance, and fell. i have been going into spasms, again. we think it's my medication that i am on. i made me an appointment to see my doctor on friday. been getting these horrid headaches again. and everything else hurts. i tell ya, i am just falling apart here. :( and to top it all off, my computer had 18 viruses! yikes! now, i am backing everything up. and then my dad is going reinstall windows, and going to start from scratch. again. i am mostly backing up what is most important to me. like my poetry, sims, and ect. speaking of sims, sims 2 is coming out next month. :) i am getting it. :) i also have a website, http://shans-sims.cjb.net i have started creating objects for the game. :) it's so much fun. :) ok, going to go. i just wish this stupid headache will go away! :( sigh . later
