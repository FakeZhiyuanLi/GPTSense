i'm going to san diego on sunday and will be there for a week. there are a number of things i'm looking forward to doing, but i wanted to know if anybody else (that has been there) knows of any places or activities or whatever that i should *make sure* we don't miss while we're out there. i just don't want to forget anything. i already plan on going to the san diego zoo and in-and-out burger. other suggestions?
