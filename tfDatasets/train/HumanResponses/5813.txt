i've gone and done it again. this time, i'm on blogger. why the move? well. typepad was costing me about Â£6 a month and blogger is free. blogger's templates are nicer and (after a quick look under the hood) i think i may be able to hack a template of my own. not earth shattering reasons, but there we are.
