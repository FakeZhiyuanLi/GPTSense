so i am working out in the gym on campus today. two totally old, totally not rich-to-make-up for-their-oldness, men want to get their game on with me. liver spots are okay if you accesorize them with a fat, fat wallet. like i am going to hook up with some prof on a 45,000 to 70,000 dollar a year job, in kentucky no less. in my opinion, the best these old boys can hope for is a blow for a good grade. eeeyuck!
