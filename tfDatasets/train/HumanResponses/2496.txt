i havent updated this in awhile, so here we go: soccer has started and so i'm more busy than usual, and i'm more tired and sore than usual, so i'm going to be earlier. but don't get me wrong, i love soccer and i'm glad that practice has started. i'm sooo pumped for this years season, i really think that we will do well, cuz we are actually working together as a team and alot of people have improved and the new kids that we have are actually decent players, plus we are in a disctrict or whatever this year and so if we win a certain amount of certain games, we can go to playoffs, which might actually happen, so i'm happy about that. well, that's all for now, and so once school starts i will update this daily. but until then, don't excpect this to be updated often.
