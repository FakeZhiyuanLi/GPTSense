so last night i'm watching an older michael moore movie, the big one. my favorite scene is where he brings the welfare mothers to the capitol somewhere (i forget) and one of them says "i'm a full time student and i have four kids." uhno. you do not get to be a full time student if you have four kids. you do not get to be on welfare and do nothing but go to school. first of all, a full time student attends class 12, maybe 15 hours a week. second, kids didn't just happen to you, lady. nobody catches a bad case of offspring. you lost your option to be a full time student. get to work.
