not much in the way of posts this week, i'm afraid, as i'm on holiday and too busy enjoying myself to want to spend time writing about it all. i will say that i went to see spiderman 2 the other day and i agree with the critics that it's much better than the first one. anyway, things'll probably be back to normal next week.
