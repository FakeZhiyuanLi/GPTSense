today has actually been a rather pleasant day. the only think missing was talking to davina. i was really hoping to spend some time talking but it is kewl i know she needs to rest right now. i don't know what i would do if i ever had to go through that again. i guess it makes it a bit easier on her with me knowing exactly what she has just been through and everything she is facing now as well. just maybe make us a bit stronger and more in tune with each other cause i do know where she is coming from and she now knows where i have came from
