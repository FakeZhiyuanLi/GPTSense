i wasn't able to write in my journal the last few days. mainly because i've been out college hunting. where i live there are over 700 colleges in this state alone. and almost each one turns out to be better than the last but at the same time also has several flaws. like for instance. there's this college here called the leads college of excellency. beautiful campus, nice classrooms, great garden but the auditorium, computer lab, library and cafeteria are all in the basement! a guys gonna spend half his college life in the library and lab the place at least should have some direct sunlight! it was very hard to decide which one to pick as they all were good but at the same time they all had many flaws. anyways, recently i started work on my site's version 2. the work is progressing at a steady pace and i expect it be complete in a week or so. other than that nothing much happened, every since i got my results things have been very eerily quiet.
