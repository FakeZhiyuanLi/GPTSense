i'm tired of being what you want you want me to be feeling so faithless lost under the surface i don't know what you're expecting of me caught under the surface of walking in your shoes every step that i take is another mistake to you i've become so numb i can't feel you there become so tired so much more aware i'm becoming this all i want to do is be more like me and be less like you can't you see that you're smothering me holding too tightly afraid to lose control cause everything that you thought i would be has fallen apart right in front of you every step that i take is another mistake to you and every second i waste is more than i can take and i know i may end up failing too but i know you were just like me with someone diasappointed in you
