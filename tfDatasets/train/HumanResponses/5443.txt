i think i excepted this summer to be much more than what it was. when actually this summer is just like any other day in tallahassee. all i do is get up, go to class, eat, come home, eat, and go to sleep. this truly not what i excepted. i though that because i had a good week last week that i would have a good summer. but what i have to realize is that a week is just a week. it doesn't determine anything. live day to day is the main thing to do.
