i went to a christian book store in clairmont to buy a bible. i picked one up and brought it to the register to pay for it and the lady behind the counter started to hit on me. she goes "we are having a blood drive and if you could donate some blood for us that would be great, we need some young and healthy men." i was like "young and healthy huh?" she was like "yes (with a smile) some strong and healthy men." i don't know if you would consider that getting hit on but i just find it funny because i was just trying to buy a bible and she's all checking me out. what the hell.
