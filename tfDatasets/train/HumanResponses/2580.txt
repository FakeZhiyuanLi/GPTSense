i noticed new cameras in the parking lot of my designated living space. cameras are everywhere. i've read somewhere that the average british citizen is photographed some 10,000 times a day by various things - security cameras, traffic monitors, atms, the like. i think it's spreading to america. you see cameras on buses. some people are even sick enough to have cameras hooked to their computer. me, i hate cameras. not as much as i hate clowns (i really hate clowns - i'll save that for later) but cameras really make me feel like i'm in prison. watch out for the long-hair, he might whip out a comb and make sure he's presentable. not. it's big brotherish. "mr. beamish, we know that you ordered 5 white castle cheeseburgers and they gave you 20" i guess i long for a time when the only people taking pictures of me were relatives, wedding parties, the driver's license bureau, cops, and japanese tourists.
