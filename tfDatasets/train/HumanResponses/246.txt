scott and i put our visa applications in today. we ran around getting money orders and last minute (ahem) passport photos at lunch time. but we got it all sorted, and the travel agent has a monitoring service so that we can check up on the state of the visa application. fingers crossed hey? also paid some more money off the contiki tour. still a fair way to go yet, but we've got 6 weeks or so to pay that off. (it sounds way to close when i say it like that)
