daniel, i cannot tell you with words all that i am feeling in my heart; words do not do my love justice. i cannot tell you how i want you deep down in my soul; words can only touch the surface. and i cannot tell you with my mouth how i yearn for you in my whole body, for words fail to come close to portraying my need. but for now, while that is all we have, please take these three words and know that they mean so much more.i love you!
