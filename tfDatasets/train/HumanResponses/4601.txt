today was boring. i don't know why, but i didn't really didn't do anything. i was going to ask a friend if they wanted to play tennis, get some lunch and go down the street, but that didn't end up happening. i couldn't be bothered, maybe tomorrow. well today, i got up at about 8.30am hehe, the earliest i've gotten up all holidays. the dog woke me up, he was going crazy at my window to come in. so i let him in, he was on my bed for a few minutes, but ran out. so i had to get up, and make sure he didn't piss anywhere. he's a jack russell, 2 years and 9 months old, and quite recently has developed the habit of marking his territory inside. lol. then i took the dog for a walk, and my borther and sister were building a treehouse, so i annoyed them for a while. then i went on the computer. my brothers friends is sleeping over, and he's starting to piss me off. he is hanging around me more then my brother. he'll be gone tomorrow anyway. so that was my very boring day, i'll blog soon.
