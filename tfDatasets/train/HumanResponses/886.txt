looks like it's gonna be flat for the next few weeks. mother atlantic has gone to sleep, right on queue at the start of july. i dunno what i'm gonna be doing during the flat spells, it's surprising we don't turn to drugs and inner-city crime. i start to itch after a few weeks without surf. luckily for me i've got a holiday to look forward too, we're off to the canaries for at least a week, maybe two, in september. there is one little piece of good news though, i read in this months carve that they're expecting a busier than usual hurricane season this year. nice one! is this the last post until september?!?
