this has been a good last couple of days. we won our victory in requesting the picture to be removed from the camp st. vincent website. it took a 2 1/2 hour meeting to get our point across, but it was done. we are grateful. all is well. today is father's day and i was able to visit my father today. that was a good visit. i don't have much to report today; and no links to share. perhaps tomorrow will be more informative. over and out!
