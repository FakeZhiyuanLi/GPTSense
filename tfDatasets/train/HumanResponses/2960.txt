hrm. im so tired i want to drop. im still up from my last post. i sort of have a head ache but kinda not like a dull sort of pain that just sits there waiting to take advantage of any sort of weakness. if i concentrate on it. i can make it go away easily enough, but i kind of like it. it is there to remind me that some choices i make  are poor ones. honestly. i did it for a girl that dosn't seem very interested in me. i know inside it would never work. but she is kinda fun to be around on occation. i had a huge crush on her a few years ago. and now it's just like that head ache. oh well.
