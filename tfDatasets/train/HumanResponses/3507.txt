what is a love letter? is it a good idea to write one or just keep your feelings to yourself? what do you write on the paper? you have more than enough to say to fill the paper with lines and lines of thoughtful words. but what exactly are those thoughtful words? are they " i love you." ? or maybe " you are my everything. " who knows? but i think it's beautiful. i live for ink and mushy feelings.
