well, i'm getting read to jet to my japanese final it's not going to be easy. the good news is that i'll probably be done in about an hour, so i won't be stuck in the classroom until half past noon. i've organized a sushi and sake party for my class tonight at kokoro, and i think all four teachers are coming as well. it will be interesting hanging out with the four little japanese women outside of class. well, i'll check in later and try to post an update on how the day is turning out.
