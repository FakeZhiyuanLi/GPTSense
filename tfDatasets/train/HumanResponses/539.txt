it's 3:07 am, i am studying for an exam tomorrow/today and my mind suddenly drifted away to ask myself a question. can an os be developed, based totally on a runtime such as .net/mono? written completely in c# or whatever language supported by the runtime's compilers. how long would it take? how long just to make a functioning gnu-like environment (bash clone, etc). should we strive for gnu-like environment, posix standards, opengl etc.? and how about the graphic environment, hardware acceleration, 3d and the works. how can drivers be programmed in a high-level language like c#? can a well written kernel core help in this task? i don't have answers to any of these question, if anyone reads my blog, please mail me just to have some feedback. write to schrepfler at inwind [dot] it.
