bought a really nice seed shirt today at tangs today. if there's a good time to shop, its now. the great singapore sale is on until the end of july! *yay* i was supposed to watch [confessions of a teenage drama queen] with ashley today, but at the last minute her parents wouldn't let her go. unfair! so i didn't get to go, either. never mind. there's still [harry potter and the prizoner of azkaban] to look forward to! and i can always catch [confessions] another time. if it's still running!
