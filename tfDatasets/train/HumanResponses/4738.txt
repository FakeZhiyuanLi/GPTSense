it another normal day. for particular this day, i just wanted to keep myself in a quiet world. silence is a devil. it makes become dumb with my own expressions of feelings. a person has to be active and lively. i've fallen in love with silence. i want nothing but just a silent atmosphere in this world. just for this particular day. i don't wanna talk to anyone. neither do i wanna listen to anyone. all along, i'm still a loner after all. just feel particular sad and depress for today.
