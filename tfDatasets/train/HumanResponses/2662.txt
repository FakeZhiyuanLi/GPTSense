i swear, that surely but slowly, i'm going dislexic. today, while in harvey's i was going to go get some straws and stuff and i looked at the little packages of pepper. i read, "poultry" but in fact, they said, "poivre". the other day when i was on the plane, my mom was reading a newspaper, to me it said, "poltergeist marries again." when it actually said, "polygamist marries again." these are just a few of my dislexic moments. i still seem to be able to write things which is good. i made a braclet last night at like 3 am. it turned out to be pretty cool, it's just a bunch of different coloured beads in no order with a random heart bead, but it's cool. i bet you wish you had one. maybe i'll start a business. i'll call it "crazy beads" and our slogan could be like, "we'll have you eating, breathing, thinking beads!" then i'll take over the word. i'll plant subliminal messages.
