i don't have anything to do, but i'm not crying. i just dont get it. i have never seen anyone cry out of sheer boredom! i am pretty tire thought. i am extatic finals are over! no more getting up before the sun crap! i was very relieved. i have nothing whatsoever going on in my life. of coure, there is nothing remotely abnormal about that. i do believe i will cut this off now. oh one more thing, make comments on my story, its jut the beginning of course, but it sure was fun fun fun to write. good bye, will write more on how boring and never exciting my life is.
