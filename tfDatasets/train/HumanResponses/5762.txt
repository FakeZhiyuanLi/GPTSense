if you live in canada you've probably heard that a wal-mart in quebec has unionized, i won't get into the details or anything, i'll just say that while i have no real desire to have my store unionized i am hoping that this will scare the hirer ups and maybe start paying their employees a decent salary, i mean it's pretty sad when your full timers don't make enough to live on their own.
