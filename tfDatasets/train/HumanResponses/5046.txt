i went out to the hazel wood, because a fire was in my head, and cut and peeled a hazel wand, and hooked a berry to a thread; and when white moths were on the wing, and moth-like stars were flickering out, i dropped the berry in a stream and caught a little silver trout.   when i had laid it on the floor i turned to blow the fire aflame, but something rustled on the floor, and some one called me by my name: it had become a glimmering girl with apple blossom in her hair who called me by my name and ran and faded through the brightening air. though i am old with wandering through hollow lands and hilly lands, i will find out where she has gone, and kiss her lips and take her hands; and walk among long dappled grass, and pluck till time and times are done  the silver apples of the moon, the golden apples of the sun. wb yeats
