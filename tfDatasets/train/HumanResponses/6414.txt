it's been done before, but thats not a reason for not doing it again. i want to find out how to email your site and post via email, just like you are able to in blogger.? you could take a picture using your cell phone and email it to your site and it would enter the log entry for you. the body of the mail being the info and the attachment being the media. from what i understand you need some extentions installed for your server, and i doubt my isp is going to help me out anytime soon. they don't even have gd lib 2.0 what am i to do?
