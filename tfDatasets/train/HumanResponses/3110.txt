i worked most of the night, helping a customer getting his mac up and running. doing video on a fragmented disc is no success. hi had tried to defrag. the disc himself, but it crashed. turned out that the disc had journaling enabled. so it worked out just fine, but the waiting took forever and a lot off coffee. i got up early anyway and when to apple norway. the had a post-nab seminar for resellers. we went through all the new cool apps like final cut pro hd, shake, motion and dvd studio pro. this apps rules! i'm really looking forward to them getting in the market.
