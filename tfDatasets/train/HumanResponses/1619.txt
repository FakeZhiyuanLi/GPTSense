i realize that i have become narrow focused. which in some cases is good. but i realize that it is mostly because of theworm. today dragon was trying to tell me about ethiopian churches and i blew it off as unimportant. but actually it would have been interesting. but since it didn't have anything to do with art or computers i deemed it as not something i wanted to waste time with. i hate that wasting time has become so important to me.
