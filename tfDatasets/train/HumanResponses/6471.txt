hey, weeza here. i have no idea what a blog is, except for the fact that i just made one, proving how easy and care free the internet has gotten. so far i have figured out that, on a blog, you apparentaly you have a template and then you post things. i think it asked me what i wanted my url to be, so now i gues i have somesort of a site name to type in if i want to go to be blog. i've heard the term blogring before, is that what this is? do i go to the same site to view and to post? how do i change my template?
