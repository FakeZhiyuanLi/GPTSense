miskas magic song miskas magic is a super camp miskas magic everything’s alright miskas magic all our friends are here we sing so loud that even china could hear. refrain: to be here with you to be here with you play some games and smile to look in the sky to swim and to hike with you… we are camping, european scouts we are camping, and have a lot of fun we are dancing and playing chika boom we are making food on the fire of wood. refrain it doesn’t matter, that miskas magic ends it doesn’t matter, we’ll still be friends we may meet in the other camps but miskas magic is the best of them. refrain x2
