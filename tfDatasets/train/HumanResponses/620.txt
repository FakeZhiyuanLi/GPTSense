i collect hats. i have over 20 of them. some of you might thinks that is really weird. do any of you collect stamps. i tried. i had gotten oven thirty weeks of stamps when i realized "hey i'm going to have to put these somwhere" by that time i had over a hundered little peices of paper. to me sitting down and going throuh each one is really stupid. and weird. i'd rather collect things that i can actually use (like hats)
