i've been trying to sleep for awhile now, but i can't. i just can't help it. all i can think about is shawn, and how sweet he is, and how much i miss him. i long for him, desperately. i want to tell him how much it meant to me for him to come and see me today and how surprised i am he tricked me into being okay kissing him infront of his mom, and how incredibly happy i am that we're together, that we're friends. i just love being around him. i love fighting with him over dumb things like how pick n save is better than sentry, and i love discussing beliefs with him. he's such a beautiful person, and its nice to find someone like that, a task that has been rather difficult during the course of my lifetime. i just never want to lose him, ever. god i have his damn stuffed puppy with me right now. it smells like him. gosh! i wish i could fall asleep, i really wish i could.
