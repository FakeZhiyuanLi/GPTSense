martin and i had our date last night and i'm still smiles. unfortunately, he's leaving for daytona tomorrow for testing because get thishe's a race car driver for the nascar busch series. i must confess i haven't been much of a follower of the sport despite my north carolinian roots. so needless to say i'll be missing him but luckily we have free long distance on our cells :).
