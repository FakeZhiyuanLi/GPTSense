all alone, or in two's, the ones who really love you walk up and down outside the wall. some hand in hand and some gathered together in bands. the bleeding hearts and artists make their stand. and when they've given you their all some stagger and fall, after all it's not easy banging your heart against some mad bugger's wall. -pink floyd
