this is exactly what he is. i creamed and oiled his back when he got sunburnt, i made him breakfast, lunch, dinner, cleaned his clothes, ironed, cleaned the house, peel his back when the skin was falling, took him around, got the email address of the girl he likes, did everything i could for make him feel less trapped, lost or dependent. fucking bastard! this is how he repays me: by insulting me and offending my intelligence, by saqying i am lazy and do nothing all day! fuck off! you! you dirty pig!you stupid man!you deserve nothing ever he can forget anything else from me, including being taken around. i hope he cries all the tears he has as i did when we were still a couple, i cried so much i cannot anymore, and i really want to.
