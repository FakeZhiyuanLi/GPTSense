washed the good ole bike. got cakes of dirt off it. the dirt around here has an attitude - 'twas smirking while i was cleaning it off the bike with a smug 'not bad for a days work, wot?' attitude. rode quite a smudgy bike to work. got accosted by traffic like crazy. grrr. got late to work as a result.
