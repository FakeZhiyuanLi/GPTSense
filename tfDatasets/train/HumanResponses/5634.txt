well i told ya i'd get up my poems here are two for now. very old (1 year and 6 months) saddness drips over me i see that your laughing at me you think i care about what you think of what i wear? and you dare to laugh even when you stare at me like im from some other planet saddness drips over me all my teachers,friends,and parents think im bendable,but im not. i have feelings bottled up inside i have no where to hide like a tide trying to break free of this terrible situation im in you think my heart is cold but if you lean in its not all you care about is what group to hang out with i can easily say my friends are the best they stay with me help me care for me even with saddness drips over me im free. well i hope you like it well later
