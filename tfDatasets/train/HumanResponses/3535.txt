well, i finally have my own blog! i wonder if anyone will ever stumble upon it.? this will be my little online home for posting my thoughts and wanderings on the web. i've taken my blog name is from _haibane renmei_ (translation 'charcoal feathers federation'), one of my favorite anime featuring a haunting story with endearing characters and beautiful settings. by 'haunting' i mean that the events in the story kinda stick with you and make you think. i think i need a new word, since 'haunting' has such a negative connotation. bear with me, i will add links and postings as time goes by. let me know if you have any helpful advice.
