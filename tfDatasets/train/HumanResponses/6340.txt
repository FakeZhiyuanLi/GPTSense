moving on from a stagnant place in life is a exceptional mark of maturity. and moving on with grace and confidence is sexy as all hell, for life is nothing but a series of brilliant and disorderly dealings that confuse and disturb even those with the best sense of self. to transcend from monotony is to realize self-worth. sticking it out does not correlate to one's resolve to succeed. ok, maybe in a high school wrestling match, but not in life - especially not in love - when there's a world of incredible choice that exists. and it does exist. getting outside the boundaries of the world you've defined, by choice or by force, is an amazing kick in the ass. it's transformative, it builds confidence, and it provides a call to action. and at some point in time, laughter will emerge through the tears, and you'll know that your personal revolution has begun.
