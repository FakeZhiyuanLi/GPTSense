morning world 8.53am saturday morning, should still be asleep. what to do today, have a cigarette, think about quitting. maybe go to the dump - major excitement!?* see if i am allowed to have my car keys back today ooooh. husband and daughter are making pikelets. as long as it is sweet for breakfast seems to be their motto. yes i am a pissed off wife, one who would very much prefer to become a single mum than go through the shit of having as ***hole for a husband. i shall get off this bandwagon soon, just still in post fight angry mode. well, i shall just go for a wander around the garden and have a think about what's doin' today. bye all (that is if anyone actually reads my boring posts. x
