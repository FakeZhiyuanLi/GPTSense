but then i got to work and everyone said i did a great job with the breakfast spread! that felt really good. after all that schvetzing i got some appreciation. sometimes i feel like i'm starving for validation and just wanting to feel like i matter. kinda sad when people praising your bagel-buying is just about the nicest thing you hear all week. ah, modern life.
