sweaty guys in sleeveless t-shirts. girls are parading around in tank tops, belly's exposed (the good and the bad). the bartenders are ripping you off for a ten dollar red bull and vodka. however, the look from the cute blonde wearing the casual black pants, gucci sandals, and plain white blouse changed the entire scenery. it's amazing sometimes how a single glance can arouse you from the slumber encompassed in the bar ritual. no one spoke to each other. just a simple smile. besides, i'm involved right? either way, the simple smile is what carries over to today and reminds me that yes i am the cute machine.
