i've been missing nealy a lot lately. i dont want her back. i just crave her friendship, laugh, and maybe the way she holds me. i know i can find that with someone else. i found this this morning: my heart belongs to my soulmate, and she knows who she is, and for today we are apart, but time will tell, so i wait peace and prayers always. serenity is not freedom from the storm, but peace within the storm. sometimes we must let go of the ones we love, so we can love ourself, them, and others more
