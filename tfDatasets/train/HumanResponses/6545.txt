on the fourth of july i went to the beach with my cousins. all cay long i was wishing i knew how to surf. but i didn't so i went boogie boarding, it was boring. for dinner we had hot dogs. it took my dad 4 hours to put the mini bbq together. at 9:00 a barge full of fireworks cruised into position. then the show began. after the fireworks we packed up and went home. that's what happened on the fourth of july.
