girls were not given the fully reliable qualities in life. it is very sad when all a girl can do is think. maybe too much, maybe way too much. or maybe the girl is a total flop and can't decide what to think about. it is a rather saddening experience, let me assure you. so you might have guessed what is wrong with me. i'm thinking too much. in fact, way tooo much. i mean, there are only a few things in life that are my constant, and i'm just not sure about them anymore. i suppose that maybe i can do something about it. something to make me not to be such a shallow person. but then again, does a shallow person care so much? i don't know.
