i've been told countless times that journaling is good for the soul (or something to that effect), that it'll just "make ya feel better". well, here goes; guess i'll give it a shot. how is it possible to hate your life, yet love it at the same time? i've got a husband that couldn't love me more if he tried (and he does try), 3 beautiful little girls (who just happen to drive me insane at nearly every turn), a few good friends, a decent job.so why does it bother me so damned much? there's got to be something missing. i guess i just need to figure out what it is. yeah right; figure it out! always easier said than done. my life is crazy-there's always something to be done, and never enough motivation to do it. no matter the task, i'm constantly running into what i like to call 'roadblocks'. as if i'm destined to be unaccomplished. speaking of which, i should probably go get the kids to bed.
