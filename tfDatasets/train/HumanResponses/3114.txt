today i went over to a friend. we've marketing ourselves as weddingvideographers, and today we were gonna plan out how to make a reasonable webpage. nothing expensive and fancy, but clean and well thought Â– "less is more". i gave rocco a new call. after a short talk we decided to meet at bar 1, at aker brygge in oslo the upcoming saturday.
