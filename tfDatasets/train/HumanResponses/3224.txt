goddamn, the past 3 days i've been quite literally scouring the net trying to find an unused gmail invite, because of my timezone the majority get released around 2am my time and so by the time i get on the net they is all taken. finally got one about an hour ago and *drumroll* gmail is down! talk about frustrating. anyway, gunna post a screenshot of the google 502 error because. well i don't think they're something that's going to happen a whole lot once gmail goes gold/1.0/final/whatever the hell u wanna call it. note: the code for these templates must be pretty damn cruddy.
