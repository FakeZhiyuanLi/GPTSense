well its summer again and well. there is nothing i have plan to do this summer which makes it seem like summer will last for ever. only 2 more years left and our group will disappear. we all have plans for the future and some can't wait to get there others are wishing it won't come. to think this is one of the 2 last summers left before we'll be on our own. me i don't know what i want to do exactly i just know i want to do some thing useful. any ways so far this summer i've watched the dead zone (a very strange twisted show) went fishing caught nothing and watched the monk marathon season premiere starts in a hour and a half yeah.:/
