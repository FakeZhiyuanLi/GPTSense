wow.the demo at work is all done! and we actually got it to work! and work well :) so that was a happy end to the week! :) and even the cto thought it was "wonderful." too bad i've been so busy working on this demo that i'm totally not ready to go to california on sunday guess that means i'm working again tomorrow. but man, it was awesome to get that demo working today. made all that work pay off. and ca will be awesome as always. hopefully i'll have some free time to head up to muir woods and see some redwoods and just go hiking a little bit. it'll be great for it to be warmer than -20 ;) not much else is going on here. hopefully after i get back from ca things will slow down a little and i'll have some more free time. if anyone has ideas of really nice boston restaurants or knows of anything interesting going on there the week after valentines day, let me know have a great weekend everyone!
