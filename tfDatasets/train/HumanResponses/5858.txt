remember sitting by the lake relaxing like tomorrow would never open its eyes, never take the day away. memories swimming through my dreams, leaving shadows of love lost. wishing the day would shine brighter for you. but i remember leaving things the way they were with the sun hitting the window reflecting in the mirror shinging in my eye it looked like heaven remember many nights alone. calling for happiness sunsets, holding hands in the park. my first kiss so much bliss remember leaving things the way they were back there that night, sitting with you. the sun setting behind you shades of darker blue moving its way into my heart so much change moving with this wind, something to light the dark.
