not as bad as someone telling me, "you look tired." but, what about those people who walk by and say, "good morning, how are you?" but never stop walking to hear the answer. either there are strange habits being formed in the human race or there is a growing race of human psychics. i would really love for the psychic type to stop and tell me how i feel because i am not sure if "good" is actually my answer or my habit. maybe a psychic will tell me that i feel tired.
