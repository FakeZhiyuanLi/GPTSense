lessons ive learnt, places ive been, people ive loved. its all bollocks. why is everyone growing up so fast. now i know this may seem like a very silly question to ask. most likely to be explained by my age and the frustrations that come with it. but like most people i prefer to think that i am more mature than other people. but thats the problem. see what im trying to say here is i dont like how everyone wants to look 25 and go rave the night away. now theres nothing wrong with a bike ride and a visit to the sandpit everynow and then is there? off you go now, listen to some five iron frenzy.
