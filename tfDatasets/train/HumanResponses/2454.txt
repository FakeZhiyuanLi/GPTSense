ponyyyyyyyy! wow, that dvd was so fabulous. i definitely cried myself to sleep last night after watching it, but you know what? it actually made me so happy remembering all the little nuances of life at gsfta that only photographs can truly capture and i forgot the way your second toes do that funky curve thing. hehe! oh the memories. (sniffle, sob, sniffle) but yes, i do love the chickens. i'm still curious to see what my chicken looks like though and if it has any resemblance to me anyhoo, thanks a bunch and you're the bestest (i just love violating grammar rules)
