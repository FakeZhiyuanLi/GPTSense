welcome to your friendly neighborhood bloggerman! to keep it simple, this is what's gonna be on here: political stuff - feel free to argue the crap out of me in the comments section. religious stuff - from the basics to the controversal. boring stuff - stuff in my everyday life, things i like/don't like, yada yada yada. misc - the rest of the crap. well, that's about it. have fun and post as many comments as humanly possible!
