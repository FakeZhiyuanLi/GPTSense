exfguga is currently down do to bandwidth levels*, so there's not much to talk about. now, since i have nothing else to say, visit my website . i just made it today. ain't it a coofoo website? *bandwidth levels  a bandwidth is the width of a band when each member stands side by side. there are unlimitted levels of bandwidth. level one is 1 ft., level two is 2 ft., level three is 3 ft., etcetera, etcetera, etcetera (i have no idea why i even bothered to look up the spelling of "etc."). hence the reason timmy wants to know why the [bad word] he even mentioned bandwidth, when he should be telling us why the wesites down.
