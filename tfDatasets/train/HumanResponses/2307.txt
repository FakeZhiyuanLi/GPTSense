i've been patient about the whole idea of waiting for paperwork, waiting for the schools to mail a piece of paper, but now i am ready to get this over and done with. i have packed up most of my things and i have tried to make arrangements to get things settled and i'm being held up by this piece of paper that says "you'll be here" i knew for sure that i'd have the arrete by now, but it seems that i've been merely living in a dream. oh well for now i guess i'll just continue going day by day, waiting patiently
