finally decided to get a haircut yesterday. omfg, what a big f*cking mistake. i went from florence henderson flippy in the back to something that resembles a lesbian haircut (and not a mullet). it is really short bit not short enough to spike 'cause my bangs are shorter than the rest of my hair. i hate the haircut lady. she was deaf and could barely speak english. aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh. in part it was my f*cking mistake to actually go ahead when i knew those factors. aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh
