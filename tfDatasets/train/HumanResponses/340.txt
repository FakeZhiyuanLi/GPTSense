wow. today was a very hard day for me because i had to stop being friends with one of my best friends because it was an unhealthy friendship. but i'm glad that i did it. it took me a long time to realize that it was an unhealthy friendship because i was in denial. but even my friends and family kept telling me that i need to break it off because it was affecting me in such a radical way. i will always remember him.
