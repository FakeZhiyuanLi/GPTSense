wishing like hell i could find the fabled middle ground dreams of compromise and fantasies of grey peruse the cobwebbed corners of a mind i lost over a year ago. this paper reality and some remembered mistakes continue to intrude on my ideas killing them before they can escape things to do, people to see, money to make- these things can't be done or seen or made if i'm off creating my own happiness. coffee and cigarettes and pictures for my words or no words at all. i don't mind if i don't sleep but being aware doesn't make wishes come true.
