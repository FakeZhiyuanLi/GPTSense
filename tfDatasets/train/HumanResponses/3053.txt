why is that? it seems to me that most men possess the capability of being a complete sweetheart but they fight it tooth and nail. they feel like they have to be asshole suprimo to be liked. let me just tell you guys, it doesn't work! for me, my heart melts when a man treats me well. that means he calls me when he says he's going to. that means he doesn't make me chase him. that means he admires me and thinks about me all the time. now i'm not they type of girl that needs material things (i prefer to buy for myself). all i ask for is a man who's heart is in it just as much as mine. what i keep getting are men who have serious, i mean, serious issues. commitment-phobic, emotionally-unavailable, and just plain weird guys! why do i even bother anymore? what makes us waste even a moment of time on these losers? is it because there are just so many of them, that if we didn't keep them, we'd be single forever?
