you know that the red-faced fucker with the pitchfork is having a good time when i start sweating in my suit before i even get a chance to leave my flat in the morning! speaking of lucifer: after a few weeks of watching gordon ramsay's "hell's kitchen" (popular uk reality show with celebrities attempting to work as gordon ramsay's kitchen minions, being voted out by the public via phone each week) i've determined that jordan's tits are indeed filled with helium, i still love cooking and, gordon is evil incarnate. you gotta love the bloke. ("first you shagged the prime minister, now you're trying to shag me from behind!") on the downside, the show's like a mikado set on a wooden plank, with ramsay as the plank. without him, it's a pile of crap
