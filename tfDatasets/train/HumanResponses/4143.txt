awful, awful rehearsal for otc concert. i hate musicians wrestle everywhere and i'm starting to despise all modern music. what's the deal with counting? it's simply perverse, switching metres from 6/8 to 4/4 to 4+3/8 to 3/4 to 3/8 to 2/4 to 2+3/8 in the space of 20 bars. counting rests is what gets me. and then people will walk up to you in the middle of the piece when you're busy counting in semiquavers and quaver triplets and ask "is it fun?" perhaps it wouldn't be so difficult if i was on the bass, but on the piano you have to read 2 lines, and watch the conductor, and make sure your fingers land on the right keys. i will never ever agree to be a chamber pianist. what do people find in modern music? gosh, the agony. completely atonal. no melody. no sense of key. it's all about pulsating rhythm. and that's disgusting. you might as well bang trash cans like oscar in sesame street.
