theoretically i will go to college, and my aspiration will be wanting to have a good life. in the future it may be confusing at first, for the many things there will be or have to do. first of all there will be college, you don't know what to do, but you get hang of it you will know. them it will be finding a job, knowing were to work, if you like the job, or if they pay good. another one is finding a house or apartment, and etc. at that time i will have more experience that i do now, because of the things that i have learn and gone through. when i have done with college, i may form a family of my own. thinking first about forming a family is not a good idea, what you need to be thinking first is about college; about what you want to study or work for.
