so i've decided to jump into this blog thing, although i'm not 100% why just yet. i have several reasons for trying this out. i want an online presence where people i know and others i meet can get to know more about me and the thoughts i think. i'm also a pretty colorful guy with many interests and this is a good place for people to browse thru my personality. the title, this is real, is a simple statement about what i'm passionate about. i want to see past the smoke and costumes and gray and straight into what is real. i'm not into fluff, give me function over form. if it isn't sincere, i don't need it. i don't mind traditions but i will not be controlled by them. this passion comes from the fact that i once was into the show, but wasn't too much on the go. god broke me a while back and now that i have let go of myself, he has been molding me into a useful tool. anyway, if you're interested, check in on me from time to time to see what i'm thinking about.
