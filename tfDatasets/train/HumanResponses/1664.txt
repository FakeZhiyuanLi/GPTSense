dinner was ok tonight. we had hotdogs, yogurt, mac and cheese(banquet version) thos were the good things. the bad things were zucini and weird tasting mashed potatoes. i drank chocoalte milk. gabe finished in about 10 seconds(for real) and while we ate we were amused while gabe played special features on harry potter 2 dvd
