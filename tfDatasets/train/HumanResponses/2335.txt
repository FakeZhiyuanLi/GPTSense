how ironically funny this world is the least expected knocked on the door of my life unexpectedly. i opened the door only to find a beautiful greek boh. standing tall the epitome of a man. enigmatic, oomni, sharp, privlyekatyelni. seized me from the real world and placed me on cloud nine. if there's any higher, i'm already there the wind beneath my wings. i will love him until my dying days - nadrah -
