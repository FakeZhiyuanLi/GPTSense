well todays about over and it went over much better then yesterday. everything is working outfine for me and cassnadra as well as for my friend ryan too. i've jsut spent the majority of today modeling, no not male camra modeling lol but 3d modeling in 3d studio max. i re-created a star wars blaster in 3d and then for my first atempt ever textured it. i think for my first atempt at texturing i did pretty well. the blaster is shown below! i hope i can keep up the good work and make more improvments since i'm taking up in teh field of 3d modeling for game design as well as a minor in c++ computer programing. well its about 2:00am and i think i may need to hit the sack so i'll post more tomarrow!
