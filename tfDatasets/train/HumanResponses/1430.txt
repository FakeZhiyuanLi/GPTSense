you seek death, i seek life through the darkest shroud, through the edge of a knife existence- defined only by action i awake from the slumber of a thousand ages we crawl- on our bellies for we have no legs we pull- our minds out from the gutter. into the sun -now we burn this age. raised to be strong, but weakened by convenience this is the time when our souls will die this life. driven to a point. where is the angel that will still my hand? we crawl- on our bellies for we have no legs we pull- our minds out from the gutter. into the sun -now we burn forgiveness- it is what we all seek, searching for truth but discovering lies this is the center where we will attain all things that in the end we'll be bound by .and never able to be free.
