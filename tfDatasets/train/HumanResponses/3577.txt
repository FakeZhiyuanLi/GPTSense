crap crap and more crap. now that i have that off my chest i guess i can get on with todays blog. i finally learned how to change the windows explorer text size (after being a coputer tech for ten years), so now i can actually read the pages i go to on the web. too bad there isn't anything worth reading out there. friends of ours from alberta are comming to stay with us for a while. their actual vacation plans got screwed up beyond repair so their final desperation choice was our place. my dick hurts. took my son and his friend to the community pool today. this was the first time i had been there. nice place. the tits on one of the lifeguards were pretty nice also. i wasn't allowed to smoke near the outside pool so i had to travel through the main building and out the front doors to get my nic fix. i just ate two pizza pockets but i'm still hungry. that's it go away now.
