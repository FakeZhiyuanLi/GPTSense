digging and clawing from the darkness in sight searching for some hope or a sliver of light forcing the loneliness to some dank blank space there is such coldness in this bitter empty place screaming and shouting for someone to hear do they not see that i have become controlled by fear it scratches my skin and makes me bleed mocking my pain as it plants its seed terror and fright close in from all sides i slip and i stumble seeking to hide it finds me again and begins to burn in my eyes i hear its laugh as it claims its prize crackling and snickering bring me to my feet if i can just overcome the gloom i can have it beat i will not be ruled by such a sinister thing i will fight the pain to fly out on fateâ€™s wing
