yup, i am all out of ideas. i feel a sponge who has lost its ability to soak up things. right now my mind is blank, i cant work , i cant think and i cant stand this feeling. all my life i have wanetd to be the best in what i should do. i have tried like a man possessed, but then , times like these hamper my thinking and my work its been almost a week now, i have not been productive. either i have to much on my mind or i have nuthin left to think about. i dont know. all i want right now is to bloody leave everything and go off somewhere to relax. these last six months have been hard on me. lot of people have lost faith in me, some have stopped respecting me and my words others have stopeed listning to me. i am sick of doing what people want me to do. who are they to tell me on how to lead my life. i just want to leave everything an go off somewhere where i can just focus on inproving myself and my work. i need time, i need space and i need to be alone  pixel pusher
