ya, well, a commercial for disneyland came on while i was watching north shore so i walked out of the room and decided to get on the computer. life sucks right now. girls are trying to get me to leave one girl hanging and run off with another one. which is a real pain, because they are cool, but they refuse to believe that i should try and go back to being friends with my ex (she just dumped me) before i possibly hook up with this other girl. life will be cool tomorrow. i might go see spider man 2 at midnight, and that will hopefully help me get away from everything. life has been a mess lately, i screwed up alot (sort of) and now everything has gone wrong.i have resorted to listening to music since its easy to pick a good style that fits my mood. *snore* good night
