as you may have noticed i've been putting down: current muzic: ________ this only means what music i'm listening to at the moment. i usually play music to clear my thoughts and it helps me get in the mood for anything really. i could listen to utada hikaru before a date, or nofx or the pillows before going to hang with friends, or even some classical to liven thigns up before going to a b'nai mitzvah! hell, music is great for anything and everything, people please, listen to more music and give a thought to something besides linkin park, ok? thanks, i kneeeeww you'd understand. current muzic: ?-
