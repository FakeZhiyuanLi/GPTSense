well, at the moment i'm trying to create an alanis morissette fan website, and i must say i'm not having much luck. i have everything planned out - i even have a logo! but i need to find a server to post it on. i was thinking about using blogger as the base for the website, but that's just an idea. i don't know how it would work to do that, because i don't think you can post any pics on here or anything, and that kind of sucks. if anyone can help me find a good server (besides freewebs - i've got like 4 websites on that server), i'd be eternally grateful. thank you so much to everyone for your love and support mouse
