ok, i'm getting bored writing in this little blog thing every day. and if anyones reading it, you're probably bored too! today was the normal sunday routine, which is good i guess. woke up, read the paper, drank coffee, went to work at the weight watchers meeting, went to drink more coffee at life is good, came home and took a nap, went to primary purpose, came home
