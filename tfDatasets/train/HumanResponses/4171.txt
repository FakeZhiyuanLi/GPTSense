i just met chris, nick and nicole for lunch at pizza hut. rather i should say, the lunch buffet . i remember it being a whole lot better. i didnt eat any salad because the vegetables were terribly under-ripe. they were so young that michael jackson what hovering over the cherry tomatoes. so i stuck with the pizza/breadsticks angle, and i gotta tell you, it just isnt what it used to be. shame on thee, pizza hut. shame! well, i'm glad i got that out of my system. i'm going to stick with my non-buffet-eating lifestyle.
