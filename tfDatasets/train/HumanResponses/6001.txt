so this post is about my one and only. he is the sweetest guy i have ever known. i love him with all my heart, and i always will. we are going to move away in about a year, get married at some point, have kids, and get house so it can be our home. i'm so excited, i can't wait. i love you and he loves me. well i guess thats enough for now. just had to try this thing out. later.
