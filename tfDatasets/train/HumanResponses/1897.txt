my favorite human is mom. she keeps me company every day, and she tries to make my nasty new food taste better. i have become very fussy about what i eat. she takes me for nice slow walks, makes sure i get all my medicine, and she gives me lots of love, even when i'm driving her crazy. in return, i make sure she is never alone, and i'm always glad to see her.
