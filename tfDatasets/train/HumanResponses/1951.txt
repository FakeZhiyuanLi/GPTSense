cats have been around for centuries and were once known as royalty. thousands of years ago cats were worshiped by the egyptians. they were a race of people that were very smart and built huge monuments like the sphinks and pyramids. still today we have no idea how they managed to build these great structures and a race like that must have enough brains to suppust their claims that they were worshipable.
