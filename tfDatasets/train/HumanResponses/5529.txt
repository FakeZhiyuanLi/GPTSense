cheryl, annabelle, ashley, and almost everyone else - all experienced blackouts last night, from 10pm to 12mn! they had to go without air-con! me, on the other hand. i am so lucky, i had full electricity. if any one of the blackout victims are reading this, you'd probably want to murder me. the last time i had a blackout was about 4 years ago! i'm lucky when it comes to sleep. in sparkc, everyone else had to use thin sleeping bags, whilst mine was so cushion-like that it was almost my bed back home! but i've gotta admit, i didn't like not having a blackout, they're normally really fun.
