comin' outta someone else's head my thoughts are fake and my brain is dead pourin' outta yours to mine like a teapot full of dirt and grime my fake thoughts are sluggish like a fog in my mind dull and distant, but there all ambition is rounded out like the corner of a spoon your thoughts for me, are bare comin' outta someone else's chest my heart is frozen and no feeling's left just a bunch of replicated ice black from dirt, but here have a slice my fake emotions leave much to want some explosives wouldn't hurt (they are) dull and distant, but there inside my chest is a 2-d square all angles and no depth but i got lucky 'cause even this much is rare
