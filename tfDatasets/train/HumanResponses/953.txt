don't know why i decided to create a blog today. i've thought about it for a while. why not - everyone else is doing it. god is faithful today. even though i got caught in the rain three times. and the pain level is at about a four. with throbs to six. faithful, faithful, faithful. liz leaves in the morning. molly's going back to south africa. school starts in three weeks. not ready!
