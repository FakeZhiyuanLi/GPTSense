so now we know, in new media there is no such thing as a vacation period. suddenly the telephone is red hot, all new projects have to be finished before the end of next month. so again i have to work instead of taking a vacation. 4 years in a row without vacation. let's hope we can find some free days next month to make a short visit to the french alpes.
