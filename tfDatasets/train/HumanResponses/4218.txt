buenos dias, well life goes on as usual. working on something which is becoming more and more confusing. didnt play holi for the first time in my life :(( wanted to but then we were just 5 of us and didnt see a point in playing in such a small group. holi is one festival where its more enjoyable to play with as many people as possible. a couple of my friends did come and put some colors on me. that was holi for me ;-) india is all set to crack world cup semi finals. it would be nice to see them win the cup this time around though australia is a better team.
