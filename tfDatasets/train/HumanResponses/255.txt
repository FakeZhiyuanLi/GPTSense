well i am all finished moving and everything is almost normal in my office i have to wait until next week for the phone company to do their thing, and later this week for internet but i have my cell phone and that will do for now. i am sooooooo excited because i booked a summer vacation for my hubby and i today. we are going on a 4 night cruise in august and i cant wait. we will need it by then because our summer schedule is packed and at least 4 weeks of it are going to be spent apart from each other. so that will be good to do at the end of it all and then i will be ready to kick off the new school year all rested and refreshed. royal caribbean international monarch of the seas 4 night mexico cruise departing on august 30, 2004
