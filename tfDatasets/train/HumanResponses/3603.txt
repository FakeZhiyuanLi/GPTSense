well, i'm very probably going to be unable to (wow, so many prepositions) post here for quite a while, about a week maybe. school starts tomorrow, and i'm planning to get the syllabus for all of my 8 courses and study all of the material this week, finish all of the homework they give in the first week, as well as all the long-term projects. for the homework and projects they don't give officially in the first week, i'm planning to sweet-talk them into giving me the details in advance (who can resist a young, starry-eyed, ambitious student? hehe, the gullible bastards). i know, i'm a dork. but i'm a manipulative dork.
