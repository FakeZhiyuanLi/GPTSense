so, here it is. i have a blog. impressed yet? i knew you would be. hi, um, i'm spazure. i have a palmone treo 600 gsm phone and figured i'd create a blog to share my experiences with it, mostly because i'm sure others with the same phone might benefit from my trial (and sometimes error) of various features and programs. just to get an idea of the point of view, a little about me: i'm 23 years old, and married. don't confuse me with your typical housewife, though. i'm a poor college student. my husband is a soldier in the u.s. army :-) i have friends all over the country, and i travel a lot. hm. that's about it for now, i guess. my first post is going to be a list of stuff currently on my treo, as well as short little reviews on each piece of sw. be looking out for it. :-) -spazi
