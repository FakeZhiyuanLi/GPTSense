it is hard to imagine how some of my young students survive their busy summer schedule. being driven from camp to after-school activities to play dates, these children do not seem to ever get a break. i did not realize the severity of the situation until yesterday afternoon when i conducted the usual session for four girls between five to seven years old. it was one of those days when i had to toss out whatever my lesson plan was and just went with the flow. the kids were irritable, hungry (even after a prolonged snack break), and as usual, painfully honest. sometimes i forget to take negative comments in stride.
