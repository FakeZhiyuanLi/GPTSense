what is death to people? is it an ending? is it a beginning? is it just a way point? it’s hard to figure out how we make it what we believe. it could just as well be a path to nothingness. we’ll just never know its not what we are destined for. if we knew what would happen when we die it wouldn’t be any fun. death is just what you make of it and if that in the end is a bad choice that’s just what you have to live with. it could be considered an easy way out for someone who is in pain. but that’s just chickening out. life is what you make of it and so is death.
