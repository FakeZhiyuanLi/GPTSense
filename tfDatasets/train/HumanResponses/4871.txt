well yesterday i went swimmin at the oxbow it was so friggin hot out that i thought i was gunna melt! it sucked cuz i walked to the river but then i got cooled off but then i had to walk home so once agin i roasted lol but all waz good lol. on the way home we found a baby bird who was just learnin to fly it was on the road so we thought it woood be a good idea to take him home we put him in a big,card-board box and then went inside while inside we relized that sassy, a once thought as a female cat. was really a male cat. lol i went ouside later to find an empty box and sassy all riled up.she killed our baby bird furthermore, an hour later i went outside to see the dog, morgan, eating the lil bird. and what have we learned from this? one must not tamper with mother nature lol! poor bird!
