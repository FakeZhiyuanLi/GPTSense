ever since wednesday when i discovered i could no longer fit into a skirt i could fit easily a year ago, i have put myself on restrictions in terms of when and what i can eat. as loony as this may sound, it's really not. i'm not starving myself. i could never do that. i am, however, limiting what goes into my stomach after 8pm each day (i.e., nothing except for liquids or a piece of fruit). i'm also trying to eat regularly at normal times, instead of eating breakfast at 3pm and lunch at 8pm and dinner at 12am. something like that. i'm also going to attempt to work on at least 3x a week. i hope this works, because there is no way anyone can get me to go all atkins or slim fast. blech! wish me luck.
