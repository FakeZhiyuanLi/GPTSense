30/06/04 - felt woozy today so took an mc and skipped school. got lots of homework though maths, physics, chem and english. 4 subjects. wow i'm gonna have a great time doing them :s heard from my classmates today was hell. ha glad i didn't go to school today =d said maths lesson was rough. the whole class got a major lecturing for being in the 'holiday mood'. totally no mood to study after holidays man but can tell everbody is trying very hard. o levels is not something that can be played around with. i'm downright scared of it. 3 more months to the preliminary exams. gotta really catch up if i want to pass it. alright, i'm gonna rest up awhile good day to those reading this. peace ;) "unleash the power within."
