just finished return of the king. great movie, cant wait for the extended edition. as for me i have work tomarrow from 4-10:30 pm. oh well. anyone who reads this that has a warhammer fantasy army for sale let me know now that i have money. i think my army priority is wood elves, dark elves, undead (any type), orcs, humans.
