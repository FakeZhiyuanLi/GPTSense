i finally got around to tinkering with the computer mcgill gave me. i got everything laid out on a table in the basement, then suddenly realised. i have a workshop! this is very exciting, a place i can leave junk laying around all over the place without worrying about it, and without jen getting upset that the place is a mess. anyway, i got linux installed, and fired up one of my spare hard disks, but it didn't have anything fun on it, so i'll be getting the other 3 installed next (one at a time because ide sucks).
