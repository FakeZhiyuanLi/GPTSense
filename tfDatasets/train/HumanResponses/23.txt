greetings in the name of jesus! i will fast from tv. well except for basketball. because it helps me chat with nonchristians at impe. anyways, here's why.for lent i fasted from all types of law and order. believe you me, that was tough. it's my favorite show. there's lots of drama and a feeling of compensation and closure at the end. none of the relational drama i know about. anyways, being summer and kinda bored down here in the apt alone, i've taken up a lot of television watching. so now i will fast for.forty days. i hope i have the right heart in doing this. in place of tv i will read, read and read. cuz i dont read much. i will still watch movies if it means i'll be spending time with people and building relationships for god's glory. basically, i'm fasting from wasting time, letting tv fill me unhealthily. i will break fast after june 30th, so we'll see where i'm at july 1st. god help me! by his grace and mercy, gill
