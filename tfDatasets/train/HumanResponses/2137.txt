hey all well im shure if you read this you will know of adam by now. well people have said he is not a good guy to date beacuse of his past faults, well i know that is all true, and i know what he is like with his girlfriends, and i know he has a temper, etc but i dont know what it is that makes me still like him? i still get all bubbly in the stomach and giggly, but my head is saying you know what kind of guy he realy is. its like a kid who had heard his parents say dont touch that it is hot you will hurt your self, but the kid still does it any way, thats the way i am feeling right now, i have my friends telling me no, but i am still reaching for it knowing they no best. i do like him soooo much though and if we do start something i want to have a talk with him before and lay down some rules, and if he doent like them then i know that it wont work beacause i wont be like his old girlfriends i wont let him do that to me. thanks for reading if you did. later days! cayla
