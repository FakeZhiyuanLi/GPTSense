i'm sorry for the things i said, i'm sorry for all that i've done, i'm sorry to make u feel this way, i'm sorry for all that you've been thru. thanks for being here for me, thanks for all the times u tried, thanks for the sacrifies u made, thanks for telling me everything. but some things can neva be changed, but time cannot turn back, but then again u tried so hard, but its of no use at all i took things too hard, i was so negative, i dint give u a chance to try, i couldnt take the pressure. it all just went too fast, it has just onli begun, it will not change a thing, it will not change.a.thing
