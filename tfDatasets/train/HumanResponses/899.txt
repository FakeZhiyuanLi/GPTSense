colin quinn is funny perhaps 1 joke out of 4. the past two nights of tough crowd have included his terribly painful "celebrity hat party" clips. hoo boy. i do like, however, the fact that race is a big issue on the show. anything related to race appears to be okay to talk about, and that's refreshing. no holds barred, no matter how intelligent (or not) the conversation is, is always my preferred venue for a current events-type program. okay, tired now.
