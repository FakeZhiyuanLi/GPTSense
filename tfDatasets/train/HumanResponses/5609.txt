stars sparkle in the black of night; glittering beauty crowning the goddess in all her glorious splendour. the moon glows beckoning her children. they celebrate their mother, on this, the fullest of the moon. from the waxing to the waning, the new to the full, the moon is our guidance, the goddess at her best. lighting the way for us to follow her back to the earth, where we can all once again become her seedlings.
