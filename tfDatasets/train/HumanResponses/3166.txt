arrived in kingsville tonight to see grandparents. saw 3 nice bucks on the way up here.all 8 points between hwy. 35 and refugio. nice to be away from town for a while. will probably get to drive on the king ranch in the next 48 hours, one of my favorite past times. also should get to fish.what more could i ask for? had a great bible study today with the high school kids after school. focused on anger and how jesus was able to remain unangry during very frustrating times (betrayal by judas, disciples who wouldn't stay awake for prayer). hope it was helpful to the kids. till later.
