school starts in two days. i just can't believe that. it's like i've not even had a summer. i'm excited because (1) i'm a junior and (2) i *liver sign* learning! and mrs. bovender is simply awesome. and as excited as i am i'm also not really looking forward to working myself to death. but it's encouraging to think by the end of this year i'll know calculus, and high-level chemistry, and be fluent in latin, and know more about the history of the united states than i ever wanted to know, and be able to write an incredible essay in a short period of timenot to mention play a piano concerto. :) gah the psat is soon too. i had this grand idea of me making like 2000 flashcards and learning all the words but i'm so tired right now. i have to read my other book this weekend as well.which i haven't even started on. life is just too complicated sometimes.having to juggle schoolwork and music and social things.
