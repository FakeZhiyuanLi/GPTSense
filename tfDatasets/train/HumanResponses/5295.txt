tomorrow i get to take french ii, ap english, and a wellness final. isnt life swell? it just kina sucks they have to cram it all into one day, and the last one at that. but i'm not studying so lets hope things work out for the best. smooth move, i know. i can't see shattered existence @ alrosa villa on the 4th because of gay las vegas. grr sorry matt :( i hope i dont miss a lot of things over that week period. i bet i do just because thats how things usually work out. and i think i am going to see the day after tomorrow tomorrow. tricky huh?
