i am a dopamine addict. the neurological bum-rush creeping under layers of flesh, blood, cartilidge, marrow. can't pretend to want a cure from this manic seething, the constant needing of a fixation. i want to leap tall buildings, face the sea great in his domain and see how he likes my taste. pull my hair and slam my body against the wall of the elevator, with the emergency alarm sounding and tell me to be just still. bind me in a wonderlust, caged somewhere in open plains. this could be it, i think, but i chew through the wires. can't you see the duplicity? take my hand and bite my throat. i don't need a savior of glory. i don't want the proper thing.
