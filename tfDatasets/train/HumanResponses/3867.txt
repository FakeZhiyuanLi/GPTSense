hair is a funny thing. or should i say, my hair is funny. see, i shaved my head a few weeks ago (long story) and now i'm growing it back. at least, i'm trying to grow it back. see, i have chinese genes, and standard chinese hair. that means my hair is thin, straight and the roots are spread out. that means when my hair is short, i can't do anything with it. in fact, i'm at the complete submission of whatever my hair wants to do. unfortunately, it only ever wants to do one thing when it's short: stick straight up. so i'm dealing with what my hair is: a chinese afro. a chafro? a chifro? it sticks straight out on the sides and back, and straight up on top. hair glue products are futile since my hair is so thin - i can get a few to stick together, but that just makes my hair look like a spikey chafro. spikey is too generous; it looks more like a black chiapet. so until i hit that magical 1.5 inches up top, i will suffer in silence with my chafro.
