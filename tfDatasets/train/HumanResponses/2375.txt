stuck why won't it stop? the pain continues. we aren't each other anymore, yet we find our way back, as if being forced unwillingly together. i wouldn't hurt you like that again, i never meant to in the first place. but it happened. what do you want from me now? why are we doing this? neither of us want to, it's just that unstoppable energy, pulling us back to each others lives. i won't leave until you leave but you won't leave until i do. stuck. stuck in this immortal reality.
