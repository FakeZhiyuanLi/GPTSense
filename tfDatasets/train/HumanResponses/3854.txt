aiya. just came back from my (old) school. i got dis feeling again. left out. lonely. well, not their fault. and not my fault as well. it's just a natural thing that will happen no matter how hard u try to stay close with 'em, and i shud understand. but i can't! i'm not even close to my bestest friend anymore. gee. great. i have no real friends. ~*~
