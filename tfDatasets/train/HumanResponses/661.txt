heard about blog for some while. then june told me that she had just created one then i check out whether anyone taken up kit.blogspot.com. the result is page not found. then i become so excited, thinking to have a kit.blogspot.com who knows when i signing up for an account. "kit" is an invalid id really kind of shit feeling. finally, created this just-kit.blogspot.com -.-
