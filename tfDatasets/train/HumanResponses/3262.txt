entry start: 12:10 am i don't know, since this site might be run in the u.s.(hence different timelines), but that's the time that i began writings this blog. somehow, i wish college was easier . having only a half-day schedule(morning to noon), i somehow found it hard not to do anything. well i guess that's just the academic itch in me. and now that i am doing something, i also find it hard to do. ironic right? well, i guess i better stop bloggingfor nowand get back to what i'm working at. entry end: 12:15 am
