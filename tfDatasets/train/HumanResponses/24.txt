well, i have a large music collection now (compared to what i had before, anyway). i got all of the cd's down, so now i'm just enjoying them and doing my thing. i've really not got anything to do, and i'm supposed to be in bed, but whatever. i'm not going anywhere anytime soon i should plan an outfit for tomorrow or something. i don't think i've ever done that before. except for weddings and stuff. anyway, it's time for me to lie about going to bed. i'm going to bed now. (you're being lied to) current music: queens of the stoneage - no one knows
