wow.okay since i am the only one who will probably read this for now. this is the first post of my new blog. i have wanted to do this for a while. the title is duplex living made easy.because i live in a duplex. i like it except for right now because the other side is having the woodfloors finished right now. so here i am watching newlyweds: nick & jessica and kind of getting high on the fumes. i will go to sleep at the 'rents house so that i am able to function for work tomorrow. but i cherish the day that i am able to return to my lovely little duplex and sleep in my own bed. afterall, i am paying rent for this place.
