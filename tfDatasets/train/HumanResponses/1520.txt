i was slightly late and when i reached the orchid enclosure, almost everyone was there. the planting and mixing of burnt soil and top soil. we constantly changed methods of mixing the composition of soil. first it we just mixed it normally, before we decided to follow another's team method of pouring in soil into the trough and thoroughly mixing it. due to the lack of time, we decided to do the old way. after seriously wetting the soil, wefound out that the method we had adopted was seriously flawed. the soil that were mixed in that manner were clogged with water. finally, we planted the soil. another record set today by me is having recived scolding from mrs. teo twice. a little thing maybe you do not know, mrs. teo paints her toenails and pink lipstick. shocking uh! au revoir and god bless everyone in this world
