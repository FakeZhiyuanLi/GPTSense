i have thought about what i want this blog to be about, some topic, besides just me , to give it coherence and trajectory. but, i have so many interests and curiosities that deciding on a single topic is impossible. here is a taste of what will make its way into this blog: book reviews, knitting projects, library stuff, pets, traveling, my sneaky strategies for losing weight, movies, oh, and who knows what may become a hot topic in my mind. its a big library in there, my mind that is. so many subjects, so many resources, so little time to dig your hands into everything! so, this blog will be about exploring it all! this blog itself is a venture into another interest. i've designed web sites, but never tried blogging. i've written diaries and kept journals, but not online. its all the rage, so i'm going to throw some thoughts out there and see what happens. happy blogging!
