today was pretty cool. my classes were all easy, it went by fairly quick, and because of the constant raining, i didn't have to go to the exit to do more community service. a guy up there gave me the hours anyways, too. i wonder how long it's going to keep raining, there is a flash flood warning, so it could get ugly. maybe it will be all dark tomorrow morning like it was today, that was pretty sweet. glad tomorrow is friday, too; it's about time for this week to end. and of course there's the huge game of halo going on at my house at 6:30.should be 16 people if everyone shows up. and damnit, don't you just hate it when you've got feelings for someone that doesn't have feelings for you? it's just pointless and degrading. matches with the gloomy mood the weather gives off. anyways, i smell tacos, so that's my cue to leave. peace eses.
