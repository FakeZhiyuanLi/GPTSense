yeah so today so far has been pretty funky. i saw melissa she was looking nice :d. yeah shes under alot of stress and said right now isn't a good time but said she would tell me when. to some that might sound demanding but to me it wasn't. it's kool to know where things stand and from this you can just relax a bit more. i had an interesting time playing pool in the lees' house (in their new "games" room) was funky i beat james at pool by 1 rack to nil. if only i had been betting! so yeah thats kool. today i plan on getting my homework done as usual and getting my portfolio back up. so yeah for now, bye bye.
