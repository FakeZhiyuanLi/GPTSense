today was a good day. i went to a baseball game (just friends playing at a local field) and a house party. i had fun! i didn't fight with my husband, and i had a long island iced tea. also, since i'm moving out the new house rule is that smoking is allowed throughout the whole place and not just confined to the basement and the front porch. yippee! i'm really a non smoker, but lately i've been up to about a pack a day. and all at the kitchen table! i feel just like a new person. the nicer my husband is to me, the more like sh#* i feel. reverse psychology? how dare he! i never thought i'd be divorced. pretty smug of me, huh? whatever
