sheesh, you ever get those days where nothing tastes right? i decided to make a soup tonight for dinner instead of the normal stuff. what started out to be french onion soup, ended up being something all together weird. i guess that is what i get for letting my 6 year old foster daughter help me make decisions. it didn't taste bad at least. my hubby went for seconds. i wasn't all that impressed with it myself. i can't cook with all the extra spices i used to since we got into foster care. kids are picky eaters!
