so i had a chorus concert today, and my parents came up to see it. so we got back to my room after the concert, and my parents told me that the application said that i should bring a nice little gift for the host family. so i suggested something like a t-shirt or a cd of american music, and my mom says, under her breath "or a thong." lolz for all. suffice it to say, this should be a fun trip to germany.
