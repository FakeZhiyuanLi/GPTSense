i think royal is a good man. although he may have some sharp eages. he is still afectionit, sometimes too much. like when he went to kiss mattie two time and first wanted to go and touch her breast and then go down her pants. but thank god mattie stoped him . i really like it though because they seem like they are meant to be. because it was so cute when royal told mattie that he had been looking at a ring for her and he found one,and how if he were to buy it would she mary him. and she said " yes ! !" sometimes he may act really werid and too touchy but, thats how boys are sometimes you can't live with them you can't live without them.
