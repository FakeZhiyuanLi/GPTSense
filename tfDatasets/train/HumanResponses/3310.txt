today was one of the best swimming days. i finally felt that i was able to pick up a stride - so to speak - in my swimming. it is finally starting to hit me how hard my goal is.but really how well worth it it truely is as well. what draws me to it is how hard it is. how incredibly difficult what i want to do is. can i do it.i know i can. i have to know that i can. i think i am going to try and take wednesday off and then swim again on thursday. stay posted. :)
