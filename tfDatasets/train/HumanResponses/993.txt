first off, i got my first reply back from gmail, yeah! it was about keyword searching. it was mostly a "standard" reply but it did have a little personalization to it, basically they were going to forward the idea to the proper department. since i haven't yet posted the keyword feature request here, i guess i will do so today. i would like to be able to add "keywords" to a conservation. so that i can search by keywords only, or add additional keywords that might not be in the conservation. for example i had a recent email back and forth about an additional invitation to gmail, but not once did i mention "gmail" so if i searched for gmail on my system nothing comes back. it would be nice to be able to additional keywords for filing reasons and examples such as the previous one.
