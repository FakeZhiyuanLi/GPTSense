congratulations to everyone who guessed phil. it was indeed phil that said those things. he said he wanted to do those things to brad. of course, i'm not surprised by anything phil says. once we were in a crowded mall and he asked, "if we were gay, would you date me?" i said, "no." so he started saying, loudly, "you wouldn't date me? why not? i'm a nice guy! come on! say you'll date me!" all the teenage girls looked at us funny as i ran out of that store. it's no wonder i'm not in therapy. i'm starting to think that, despite his black fingernails, almost peeing on brad's bookcase, and never unpacking his apartment the whole time he lived here, pete is my only normal friend. oh yes, tj? i looked it up and those things don't have official names. the staples.com site only calls them "brass fasteners." sorry i couldn't help more. i asked the girl who sits beside me, but when i said, "spreading the legs apart" and i giggled, she walked away.
