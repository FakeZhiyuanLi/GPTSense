whoa, talk about dumb luck. ann (the big boss) shoots me this email saying if my name is in the "to:" bar that i won a prize. and low and behold, what do my eyes see? "jeremy *last name here*" in the "to:" bar! (note: i ended up buying lord of the rings 3, a stack of 100 cd's, and a cd case holder thingy with the gift certificate. well, it paid for part of it, i paid out of pocket for the other stuff.)
