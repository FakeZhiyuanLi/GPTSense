i think green is my favorite color, i think it makes me look a little bit slimier and if you have ever seen me you know what i am taking about. grass is beautiful girls with green eyes make me think smart, pretty and lovable, green shirts dive me nuts, green shorts makes me think so hard i can hardly talk to the girl. green cars make you feel proud. green magic decks are strong and powerful. green soda makes belly's happy. you know what made lord of the rings such a great trilogy. all the lovely green shots of plains and green mountains and green elves.
