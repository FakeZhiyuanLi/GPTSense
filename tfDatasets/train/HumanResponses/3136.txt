well one of my best friends thats a girl is mad at me. which really sucks because she has me and herself confused. i finally get to go see spider man 2, today at 3:30. life sucks being single, though getting dumped is worse, so i can't really tell you if going out is a good idea or not. just be careful that you stay friends (if you want to) with someone you break up with. also, your friends are not worth losing over a gf / bf. and besides, you have a much better chance of staying friends with your friends than staying together with your bf / gf.
