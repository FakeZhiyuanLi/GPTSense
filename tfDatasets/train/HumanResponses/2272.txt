i finished the granny square scarf on saturday night, or actually sunday morning at 5:30 am while i was watching the olympics this zig-zag scarf is for my mom. this pattern was very very quick to make. okay, this has nothing to do with crochet, but there is something very hot about men's synchronized diving.
