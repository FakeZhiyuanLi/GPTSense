my friends and i are planning a tag sale in september. we will be offering vintage cottage style goods in a beautiful setting in the evening under the stars. we have been buying and stashing some great shabby finds for the sale. our plan is to do these sales 4-5 x per year. creating displays or settings with our "finds" is very important to our sale mission. stay tuned for more "tag sale" details :)
