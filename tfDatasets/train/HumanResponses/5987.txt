number 2 daughter went to a friends house, so son and i toddled off to do what he likes to do - go to pc world, gamezone, dixons, anywhere he can get a multimedia hit. today was pc world, about 10 miles away. we get in the car, and alanis is in the cd. 'do we have to listen to this? we've had it for days' he whined. 'ok. put courtney on instead.' so grudgingly he slips america's sweetheart into the player, and mum starts to sing. ok, so not always the right words, but singing none-the-less. and son sits there, dreaming of shooting people with an mp40, or something of that ilk. and finally i get to my point. is all this angry woman music bad for the boy? what am i turning him into? passive-aggressive woman hater? queer? post-feminist new man? or just a well-rounded music fan? i don't know. i'll leave that one to his therapist to figure out. p.s. we bought the c.s.i pc game. ok, so it has dead bodies, but at least he didn't shoot them.
