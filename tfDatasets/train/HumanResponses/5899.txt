crappy day i have today. while playing ro, im so bored that i could die. and during the couple of hours before i going to go to sleep, my grandmother is nagging like hell and my maid refused to clean the room. ( maids these days are getting more and more "naugthy" ) i feel like just jumping off the building. man.how i wished that i could just be outside, doing my stuff, without anyone coming here, nagging, dont wanting to do this and that.like i said, life is fucking tough.
