i sadly enough got in a car wreck this morning. i was on my went to practice when i ran off the road. i was driving down the mountain and my car slid and ran off the road and hit a tree. luckily i was fine, but the car wasn't. they people at the car shop place said that it might be totalled. so i might a new car *ekk* that was a good ekk but i'll miss the one i had, "the neon." when it first happened i was bawling and then i car my dad thinking that he was going to yell at me. i never felt this bad in my life. my life just flashed before my eyes and i thought in that mid second, i hope i live.
