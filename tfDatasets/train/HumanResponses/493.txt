mom originally posted this as a comment, but i'm the midst of switching over to haloscan for commenting services, which will wipe out all previous comments. :( this is mom to say that i don't know much that is new about ev at tbs. she can't receive phone calls yet or check email on base yet. she is keeping very busy, though. anyone know of a good church near quantico? i'll add more when i hear from ev. :) thanks, krist for setting up this blog!
