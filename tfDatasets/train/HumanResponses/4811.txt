wov! another day has passed, and it has been sometime since i updated my blog! ok here goes, today i spent my whole day chatting with my darling and sweet lao po. yesterday i spent my whole day with her ( had some tiff but worth it ). the day before, i spent my whole day with her and half of it was acting like a clown -_-" :p as for the day before the day or day before the day's day, absolutely, apparently, unfortunately, what a mishap, my memory fails me. guess what?! believe it or not, my lao po's mother's friend ( rather long huh?, cutting it short - "mum's friend" hehe ) saw me accompanying her home! luckily only that, and nothing else ( praying, burning incense ) *hope* that her mum doesn't invite me to her house that soon. ok that was boring though? now for the real "monotonous part". i manage to control myself lol!
