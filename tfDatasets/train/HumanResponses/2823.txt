today is just really blah. not much happening; glad my week is over halfway done. i had this headache for most of the day. wonder if its my job? yeah probably is speaking of which, im really debating on what my next move will be. i don't know if i really want to committ to here or if im going to move on to something else. im still trying to figure out some other stuff too. i really don't mind this job; i could hang around cause my next step up i think i could be really good at, that's a bonus. it really just comes down to the other stuff that will make or break me. most likely break, but hey, you live and learn.
