i'm so frustrated! i agreed to go out with a guy i sort of liked. now he is possessive and stuff. ugg. i don't know why i did it i knew his sweetheart 24/7 thing was a lie. so why the hell did i do it grrr. he is fighting for my honner and stuff like that. i don't want him to! half the fights he gets in the middle are little ones like -whats up with your name- kind of fights. that i probably started! belive it or not, i like to fight little fun fights. but i wish he'd just leave it alone! :*-( cry
