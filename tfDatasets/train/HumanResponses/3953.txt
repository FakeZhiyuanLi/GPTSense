so i just posted my first blog a little under an hour ago, and had the sudden urge to write again. i have been scanning over all the different posts and what not. some interesting people out there. ;) i am mearly waiting to gain the will to get up from this chair and start getting ready for the rest of the day. it is about a quarter to 3 and i told my girlfriend i would be over to her house by 4:30, and that just is not going to happen. the fact is, i don't feel like getting up at all. i feel like just sitting in this nice comfy seat, only getting up to use the bathroom, and doing absolutely nothing for the remainder of the day. i could say, in my defense, "why try to make something of the day now, when the day is closer to being over than i am of being ready to start it." it doesn't make a lot of sense, but my girlfriend usually falls for that sort of thing. but either way.i think it is time to go, for real this time. :) have a good weekend, folks.stay out of trouble.
