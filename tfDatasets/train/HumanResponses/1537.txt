is liberation and self awareness, realising that i have the capacity to hurt someone advertently and not feel guilt about it? is our conscience our limiters as in xenogears, the genetic code implanted in us, not to go against our creators, not to have the strength to match them, to have an uncontrollable fear of them, that we whimper at their feet? guilt. it used to last longer. this time, it lasted for just half a day. the first ten minutes were the most intense but it slowly faded, while my gears were tearing the angels apart. amazingly, no insomnia, i slept with minimal interuptions. the next day, i didn't feel a thing. actually, i did feel something. a strange cheeriness, my savings had increased by a thousand and i have more time to do my research. what happened to my conscience? it used to be strong, it used to dictate my moods and my inactivity. where has it gone to? am i free? or have i just been playing too much xenogears and reading fight club?
