haven't been online blogging for a while  it has been over two weeks that i have written any thing  i have come to realise that it is only on weekends that i am able to dedicate some amount of time to the "deep" thinking needed to get on with such serious activity  since we had friends come over last weekend, there was a small sabbatical  but now i am back  especially since we do not have any friends / relatives scheduled to visit us for at least another month  anyway  whoever reads this  let me know what you think of it  shall be more regular with posts from now on  cheers, c
