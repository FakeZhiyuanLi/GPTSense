every body ends up some where. a few end up somewhere on purpose, they're the ones with vision. a clear vision with the faith and the courage to follow it through, which for some can dramaticly increase the chances of coming to the end of their life, but at least then they can look back and be satified thinking i suceeded and finished well. the thing that scares some people with visions is the fact that maybe they will die to serve the vision but scared should only be those who don't know whether they will ever reach heaven.
