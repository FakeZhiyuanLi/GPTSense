i cannot believe that i am having so many dreams! last night i had one about my former best buddy, drew. he and i had a breif relationship, but realized that we were better friends than anything and continued on as such. it's been almost 10 years now, that we've been friends and now it's been probably 1 1/2 years that i've spoke with him due to a woman with a tight leash. i really wonder how people are controlled so easily. i couldn't handle that mysself. well, this dream was me confronting him on how he said that we would always be friends and that if a woman couldn't handle cindy, than she didn't need to handle drew. i was sad in my dream, i miss him while awake as well, we spent a lot of time listening to each other's problems and triumphs, to have it all end because of a relationship is not only sad, but typical. :( i miss my friend.
