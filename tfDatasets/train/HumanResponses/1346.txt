well, after i saw the movie fahrenheit 9/11 with my sister and her boyfriend and his friends, it was about 3:00 am. heh the funny part is my sister's boyfriend's friends parked in a garage that closed around 2:00 am. so, they had no way to get home, so we all got squeezed into one car with about 10 people in a 5 person car, and we took them to the marriott lobby which they would stay until the metro/bart would open at 4:00 am, and then just take the metro/bart home. yea.and oh! this homeless dude was hella stalking us, and asking for money and calling us retards.
