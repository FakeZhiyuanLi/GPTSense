it's amazing. and exciting. and probably not for me. i thought that i could use my technical acumen to help people.but it's still far more technical than relational. the attitude i sense is "i'm helping you, don't talk to me." bleah. so, the tours were great, the people were kind, but the problems are just too complicated; rather they're quite complicated and too sterile. and can i just tell you? the best time i've had this week was last night, when i got to hang out with the guys (david(7) and noah(4)). there's nothing better than a four-year old who wants to play and a seven-year-old who wants to make plans. man.
