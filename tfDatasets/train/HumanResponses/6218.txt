i am currently reading a book called "prayer walking" the concept is to strengthen you body as well as your soul. hmmm.i think i am going to give this book a try. i do need to prayer more and get a stronger prayer life, and i do need to lose some weight. but in order to do this, i will have to get up early and actually get out there and walk. i think, once i am done with the book, i will actually get started. i will have to let you know how it goes. church yesterday was awesome! we had a powerful move of god and a total refreshing swept through the church. it was amazing! during last nights service, i got all the girls in the youth group up at the front dancing and jumping. it was such a great time in the lord. those girls are so special and god is doing great things in their lives.
