hello again! typing again b'cos i'm very bored. spent virtually the whole night last night trying to figure out how to put pictures into my reports and i had no clue. this morning, i just dragged the hearts from my pictures file in my computer. it works well enough for me! there's nothing better to do right now and i've finished helping my mum clean up the guest roo for some friends coming over. they're from the uk and they're called sabrina and daniel. they'll b around for a week then they're going back to the uk. it's always great to c them cos they're good fun. will be taking on some fish from my friend cat because she's leaving. so i've got the tank ready already with the plants and the v. good filter. if you hate fish, look away or you might be scarred for life, or if u actually like discus fish or want to see what they look like, then here are some pics of different ones: ok then, thats all for now! ttfn, evernix
