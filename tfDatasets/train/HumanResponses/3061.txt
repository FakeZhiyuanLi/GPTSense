i gave in yesterday; i called m. i was sitting there wanting to talk to him so badly, and i thought he might be feeling the same way. i could picture us both eternally staring at the phone, too scared to make the move. i decided i would be the one to break the silence. i cried and sobbed and wailed and played the perfect fool. it always seems that way during a breakup; there's one that just won't accept things. while during the breakup i was the strong comforting one, this time it was m. he's going through some genuine problems right now. he has no sense of who he is at all, maybe he even knows himself less that i know him. he really does need the space, he really doesn't want to be the cause of all this pain. i understand that, i hope he works things out. right now i'm still sad, but i'm also optimistic. it's gotten me this far, right? i'm still certain we're meant to be together.
