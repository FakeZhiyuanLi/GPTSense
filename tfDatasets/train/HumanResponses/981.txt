another day has pass, aiya looks lyk final year exam coming soon lao, 4 more weeks to go. hear the word fye has oredi made me very sian lao. dun feel lyk studying leh, but nvm la once in a while work hard for exam will do some good. wat more can i comment on, this year streaming lao, try to make it into a good class n also hope my ip interview is a success. anyway the main reason i choose ip cause its challending, better than currently sji one. sji next year take 9 subject, nj take double the amount. actually double the amount also ok one la, except that i will be more busy n the workload jus piles on.
