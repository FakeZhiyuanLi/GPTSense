i was busy the past few days and haven't been able to write. my friend helped me out the other night with my swimming technique - or complete lackthereof. i have never used that many muscles in my entire life - the little muscles that you don't even think of using, well i had to use them there. i started out on yes - i kick board. quite possibly the most embarrassing thing of my entire life - sitting there on a kick board. having him look at my legs kick. i can tell you that i never want to deal with that again. next it was the arms. it is amazing how inefficient my strokes were. sheesh. but its going good. i just need to focus my efforts on the run - because that is what is going to kill me. i am going to be running more tonightkeep tuned. its funny i know no one else is reading this - oh well. :)
