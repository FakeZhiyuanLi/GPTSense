i was recently scammed by a girl during an online gaming experience; she had touted to upgrade my garbs for, get this, free! in retrospect i should've known something was awry, but i guess deep down i wanted to believe there was truth or at least some sort of intrinsic verity in her words, logic need not applyi was duped. nary a lossi suppose. suffice to say, that i'm quite resilient and hence able to bounce back, no pun intended, from my lack thereof. if you really think about it, the charlatan did me a favor; mmorpgs are an infintesimal, even trivial, part of life anyways. deviating from the matter at hand (on a lighter note), i finished no second chance by harlan coben, a book i was currently reading. well, let me just say what a convuluted consummation for a book with more plot twists than a coaster! and the implications of a father-daughter bond theme pervaded in a subtle yet villifying manner a real page turner at that ~one tough cookie~
