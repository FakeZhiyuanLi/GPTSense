i just watched the clip, of point of interest, and omg i loved ittt i had heard of this nicole character from my fellow ci fans. but i never thought it would this good. i had been meaning to know this nicole character, how she screws around with bobby's head i hadn't seen this episode or any other episodes with nicole. but anti-thesis. ohhh my, it even shook my chians up a little. how they kept on going back and forth and as if vdo couldn't get better at the whole character actor. and it was amazing. i need to see the whole episode. and then i have a clip of cherry red. and jones. some of my favourite episodes. hehehe you just got to love him and the show of course. and the show. when is the second season coming out so sad, i need a fix grrrrrr
