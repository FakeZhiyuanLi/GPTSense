my life is a big c.f. i went out on sunday and was minding my own business having a drink with my girlfriend when some girl (don't know her name) said that i said, "f%$# you!" to her. i so did not do that. anyway, her and her friends dragged me outside and beat me up. then i went to a bar down the street and got dragged outside and beat up again. (stupid) then i gave a friend a ride home and ended up kissing him and my husband saw it. i am a mess. what the heck is going to happen to me? i'm very sore and looking for an apartment/divorce attorney. i know i deserve the whole adultery scandal, but i didn't do anything to get beat up over. twice. they beat my girlfriend up too. i know things will get better.
