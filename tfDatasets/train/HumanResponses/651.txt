despite random lectures and other disjointed bits and pieces, tomorrow is to all intents and purposes our last day. at the moment i just feel very stressed as my folder is a big fat mess and i am looking at a long night of crazy before the morning of hoorah! the other big ol' pisser is that i have to go to a flinging reps meeting tomorrow. reps!? who cares? i wouldn't bother if barbara wasn't the chairman. but never mind that just now: today was my last ever ever ever lesson as a student teacher. there are many, myself included who thought this day would never come. i am summoning the strength of ten tigers for one last time . grrr! right then.
