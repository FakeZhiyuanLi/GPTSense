its been a pretty rough 24 hours i went to bed last night and for some reason kept on feeling like somebody was going to come in my room. i got out of bed several times and checked around just to make sure my home was secure and found nothing to be out of place. finally i got up at about 2:30 and locked my bedroom door. i slept much later then normal almost 11:00 before i got out of bed. i feel really really alone right now my family feels very disconnected right now. it does not help that nobody is around right now they have all left for the time being. i don't really feel like speaking with any of my friends right now. i'm not depressed just lonely and i cannot peg why. i have not been to fbx in almost a week which is very unusual. i wish i could write all my soul had to say but i'm afraid words would do it no justice. -a
