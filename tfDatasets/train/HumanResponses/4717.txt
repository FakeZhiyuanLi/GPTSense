ive decided to write a novel, now i dont know what of or what type either, but i have decided. a topic that just popped into my head. smart people, what goes on in theres? is it tones of complicated math like in the cartoons, or there somthing else. do they think like we do, on how life really isn't treating them fairly or somthing. how they are too fat or have a poor social life. i guess people dont see that there are people that are seen as nerds and geeks that actually the same iq as you do, but just work very hard. or maybe their head is filled with compicated math i dont really know, im not smart. (jake wright -> i.q.=127 and yet im still stupid)
