man this field trip sucked we didn't do anything, walking around not learning anything didn't make it any better. atleast if we were learning something i might have said it didn't suck. on the bright side it got us out of class for a day. it could have been improved if we got to ride the ferris wheel and eat. next year i think it would be better if instead of a field trip they just gave us the money that they wasted on the field trip.
