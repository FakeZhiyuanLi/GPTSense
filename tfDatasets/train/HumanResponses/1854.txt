jackie is actually speaking to me, which is very wonderful. she asked me if adam and i wanted to join this new website, and i had nothing better to do so i agreed. i just have to say that i love the color of the website. it is my favorite color in the world and ian knows that. anyway, i guess i need to get a cartoon picture of myself too, if i want to be in this little group.
