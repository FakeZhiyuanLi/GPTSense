i feel like such an idiot. i willingly gave up my first kiss to bradley, and my first french kiss to vincent. we were playing spin the bottle when i spin and it lands on bradley, so i kiss him. we stopped shortly after. so, we start to play truth or dare. stupidly i choose dare. sarah dares me to do her cat, or spend seven minutes in heaven with vincent, but bradley just has to say that we'd probably just sit there(so true, so true). so bradley adds "and we have to hear you two makeout." then sarah says that she doesn't have a closet to use anyway, and that we just have to makeout in front of them for a minute or two. so, i nodded to vincent, he stands up, then i stand up. we lean closer, and french kiss for about a minute. his tongue was moving around in my mouth so fast, so pationately. i felt the moment go by so quickly. truthfuly i loved it but i hate the reason for it ,so that just kills it. this all happened on july second, a day that i will never forget.
