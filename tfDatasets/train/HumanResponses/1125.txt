full of chicken and rice, that is. a personal favorite. remembered what i was thinking of earlier: we might go barge fishing this weekend with my dad and his friend from work -not real sure if its a plan, though. didnt play hockey-but did board a little at the mall in the parking garage across from nortrums. cracked my knee on a pole but it feels better now. gonna go and shower, then watch some tv -later
