goodness the most embarassing thing happened to me on my way to church! i think i touched some black paint while i was at the bus stop and i rubbed my left eye! no wonder everyone was looking at me in the bus! no one told me until i reached church and gabriel was like "my god. you got slapped or punched or bitten by your girlfriend or something?(i don't have one, he's just trying to psycho me or something)". argh. no wonder the school girls at the bus stop gave me a wierd look and started laughing! argh! damn damn damn.
