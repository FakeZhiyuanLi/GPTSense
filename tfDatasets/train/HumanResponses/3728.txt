so in the past 2 weeks i have learned and expirenced and have changed soo much. and i was so wrong about saying the trip was going to suck cause now i feel bad for saying that cause it was the opposite. i met a lot of really nice sweet people and i realized that i wasn't really quite living.i had a lot i was going to say in this but i forgot cause that was a while ago .but im sure ill have more to say later
