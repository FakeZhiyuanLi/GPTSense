just got back from 1st kendo practice. i got there early and managed to meet some people from a web board that helped me to find a dojo. they were kind enought to teach me some footwork and a basic men (head) cut. when the sensei arrived it was time to warm up, and i ended up looking like a fool. the warm up suburi (practice) kept on getting faster and faster, and i ended losing rhythm very quickly and i almost fell over a few times. then it was time for seiza, and after that the sensei taught me footwork again and 3 step, 2 step, 1 step and jumping suburi, which was the one i messed up totally in warm up. after that i watched everyone spar. some of the parents were kind enough to buy me some food :) .
