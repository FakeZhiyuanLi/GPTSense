the streets are number one. the only problem with this is that 'dry your eyes' is just another break up, love ballad kind of affair. it's hardly representative of the album. i reckon the individual songs on the album only really work when you listen to the whole thing, hear the full story being told. the streets aren't my favourite band in the world but i quite like the album. but the good thing is that now the bleedin' busted song is off number one i hate busted, they're just a poor excuse for a band - they seem to have 3 lead guitarists for god's sake. they epitomise everything i hate about pretend bands who simply play to the kiddy-pop market. i'd much rather listen to proper bands who make up their own minds about stuff and don't aim for the 10 year old market.
