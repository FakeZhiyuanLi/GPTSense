wow landlords are calling me back. this is great i went and looked at a place today it is a good deal, but it is just not close to anything. i think i should hold off for a better place. the list of books to read seems to be getting longer and longer. but, come fall i will have the time to nip that list in the butt. i love fall when i can crack a bottle of my favorite cab or merlot, and kick back with a great book. looking forward this fall/ winter will be great! there is nothing better than coffee/wine, and a good book. nothing else to report for now
