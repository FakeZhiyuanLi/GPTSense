well, its that time of night when i think to myself, i think "geez rob, it's about time you actually go and do something productive with yourself" - so i might go do some homework or play the air guitar (which is awaiting sale) or something - maybe i should stare at the wall and see what patterns appear, or go on a caffeine high (hey, this blog was created while on a caffeine high!) so i'll be back.anyhows, running outta ideas to post!
