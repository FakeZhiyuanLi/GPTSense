well, this morning i woke up at around 7:30 to head home. it had been a great night. my sisters and i went out around town and drove up to fast-food places. we'd park up by the person who give you your food and we'd blast micheal jackson's "beat it". i don't like mj, personally. he's quite creapy. that was pretty fun. we got back to the apartment at around 12:30 and watched "50 first dates" and fell asleep. i was on the floor of course. no complaints though. we got back at around 11:15, just in time for me to shower and get ready for my dentist apointment. i had no cavities, which proves that it was a waste to come all of the way back home for a measly dentist appointment. i am running out of things to keep me entertained. i should go upstairs and check whats going on. peace out.
