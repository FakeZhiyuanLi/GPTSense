so, i was in the bath, which i haven't had for ages ( i'm a shower person), and i go through, in my mind, all the things that i've thought of that could save the world, or entertain people, or at the very least generate some kind of response, which when you come down to it, is what we all want. so, i think wouldn't it be at least some level of good if i actually put these things down? i've tried a blog before, using moveable type, but there was more an exercise in me playing about, than actually putting my thoughts to screen. so, this is my first post, i'm gonna publish it, then go make a coffee or squash, and then come back and write something proper.
