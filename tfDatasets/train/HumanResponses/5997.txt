after mentioning this project to my dad this evening, he agreed to help me in any way possible. he said that he would acquire materials and devote time to this project as long as we don't put him on the spot. that is, have things designed and planned out as we hope to do over the course of the following school year. construction will most likely start whenever the weather permits it at the beginning of next summer.
