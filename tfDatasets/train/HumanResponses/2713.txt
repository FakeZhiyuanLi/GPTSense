"emotionless" hey dad i'm writing to you not to tell you, that i still hate you just to ask you how you feel and how we fell apart how this fell apart are you happy out there in this great wide world? do you think about your sons? do you miss your little girl? when you lay your head down how do you sleep at night? do you even wonder if we're all right? but we're all right we're all right [chorus:] it's been a long hard road without you by my side why weren't you there all the nights that we cried you broke my mother's heart you
