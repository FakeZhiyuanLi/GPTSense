well tod ay started off kinda dumb cuz of swim practice but after that it was amazing. i came home and talked to brandi and asked if she wanted to come over she did and we hung out watched some tube and listened to some musik. after that i went and pumpd some iron and then ate dinner. after brandi and i went rollerblading down by the river. it was so fun talking and lookin at all the puppies! the only bad part of the nite was goin back gettin bugs in our face and having to say goodbye. well hopefully 2marrow will be just as cool**peace out**
