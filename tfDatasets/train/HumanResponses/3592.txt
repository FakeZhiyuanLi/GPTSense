i must be geting old. i'm not as quick to hear about bands that i like, as i used to be :) my friend at work lent me the unleashed memories cd of this band, and i thought it was only their first, when in fact they have at least two others. the music is very similar to evanescence, but the female singer's voice is not as strong as amy lee's. that being said, the combination of female and male vocals adds something extra to the sound. from this cd the stand out tracks for me were when a dead man walks , purify and cold heritage . by the way, did i mention they were italian? dont worry though, most of their songs are in english ;)
