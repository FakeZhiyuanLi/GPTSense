king edward vii introduced the custom of setting the 180 or so clocks on the sandringham estate half an hour early to allow him more time to shoot. as a consequence, all business when the king was at sandringham took place in this unique royal time zone. george v maintained this tradition, but edward viii, when he acceded to the throne in 1936, reset sandringham's time pieces in synchronicity with the rest of his kingdom.
