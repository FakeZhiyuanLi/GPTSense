this is my pair of stanton str880 (straight) turntables. i've been mixing every day since i got them, and i'm seeing lots of improvement so far. we're thinking of doing a "privee" (or private party) two weeks from now, in which some friends and i will mix all night long. let's see how good i get so i can make one heck of a show :p; i know my friends will (they're really good).
