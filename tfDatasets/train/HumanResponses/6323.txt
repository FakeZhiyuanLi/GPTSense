i draw hearts on my sleeve and it all starts with an arm wave its so hard to achieve but when its all done its alarming embalming fluids on my mind, i want to preserve these thoughts the startling truth is we'll never find those words that we sought i'm not the worldly sort, this stirring plot i gave to you could be curdling pots while they're worrying which slave to choose so praise the clues that i lost i was never a detective but the few that i saw undisputedly swore that i was defective you chose the path of least resistance with a variety of wishes i went the highway, its my way to be what society sees misfits don't fight with me, i silently wish to be invisible now you drew lines in the dirt to draw me from the visible crowd its inadmissible how we saw the sun and moon in two ways whistling wow, i'm officially allowed to swoon for two days whatever you say, please don't try to croon and send hope i'm telling now, you're the full stop after my endquote.
