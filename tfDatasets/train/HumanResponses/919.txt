the begining of my posts and hopefully not the end, let's start with the past. about 6 years ago i was in 6th grade. meeting new people and not really caring to notice anything because i was only 10-11 at the time. we sat at our tables the first day of school, and i was pleased to notice that i was sitting by my best friend. no familiar faces but his were at our table, next to me, a rather "tough" yet soft kid with red hair, and a temper to boot. across the way was someone i'd met before but hardly remembered, next to her, a fellow math-liker, also a she. at the far end was a large young man, probably older than the rest of us, who later would leave and never be seen again after 6th grade. between my across-neighbor and the disappearing man, is the lefter.but at the time, she was the writer. ending it brief, the story shall unfold quickly as my mind twists away from the roots that have held me at bay for so many years.
