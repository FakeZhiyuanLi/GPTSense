so i just got my car back yesterday, and i'm so happy because i have wheels again, and it's no longer making these indescribable loud noises, and i'm a free woman once againbut now there seems to be a fuel problem of one kind or another, one kind being minor, and the other kind requiring a major overhaul. either way, it's blowing so much smoke that the people behind me can't see where they're going, and i am doing irreparable harm to the quality of the air. should make tomorrow morning's commute excruciatingly embarrassing .
