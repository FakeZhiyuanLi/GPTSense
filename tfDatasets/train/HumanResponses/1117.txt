gonna take my license test today! oh boy oh boy so i made it possible for anyone to post comments in here if they so desire, not just members (matt this is for you cuz you tried and couldn't) so.make me happy and do it. alrighty, i'm gonna go now and announce the test results when i return. byes! yes, so the ppl in anoka are mean and evil. especially the streets. and from those two comments you may think that streets are people toowell they're not, its just that the people that made the streets in anoka are dumb. so i decided to not pass the test today just to teach them a lesson and so that other drivers out there can have a few more days to prepare for the honor and extreme goodness(yes goodness) of having me be a fellow driver. and the person who cut me off coming home and tried to kill me.he should be punished and made to go cry in a corner. it was scurry. scurry. sinziana
