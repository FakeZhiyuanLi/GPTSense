i used to have a blog on blogspot through blogger, but the template was boring and there was much to be desired in their service. but blogger is back, and under google, they have made many new changes. i love the new templates and cvommenting among many other new changes. i am also able to have it under my domain, so thats always a good thing. more to come later.
