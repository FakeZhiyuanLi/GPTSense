i have to go back to work tomorrow, after a week of sickness/vacation. i'm really depressed. but of course i should hear about the trainer position i want. should get an interview, if i don't, i think i'll quit. and of course the only reason i'm even writing this post is to avoid cleaning my apartment. and it needs it. and i seriously would be surprised if anyone ever reads this. this is more therapy than anything else. oh well, guess i have to do something sometime. why does it have to be now?
