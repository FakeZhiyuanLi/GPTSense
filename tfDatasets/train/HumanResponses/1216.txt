sitting here watching the buses pull away from the curb. watching life zoom past the large windows that tease us with what goes on outside. i want to be out there announces the people on the bus, walking in the rain, going somewhere other then here. no more of this, no more sitting on this side of the window, its time to be on the outside looking in. birds don't sing on this side, sunshine does not pour out of the horrible fluorescent lighting, and there is no light breeze moving past. i am better than this place, i am better than what they think, i will walk away, i will walk to the busstop and zoom away, past the windows that once teased me.
