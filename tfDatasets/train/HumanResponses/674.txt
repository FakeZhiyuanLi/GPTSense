update: the tickets were sold out! so i saw the dead sea scrolls instead (boring!). i wanted to see taiko badly, but life enjoys making things unfair. the dead sea scrolls were so boring, there was no translation available, and it just was. pointless. some dirty pieces of paper under some dim strobing lights those dirty pieces of paper are so ridiculously pointless. i'm sorry to say that to all the religious nuts but think of all the people suffering around the world, then thinking of all the money going into preserving and showcasing that nonsense. even if that money went to giving 3 people fresh water it would be worth the loss. so my 2 cents again- but it's my weblog :)
