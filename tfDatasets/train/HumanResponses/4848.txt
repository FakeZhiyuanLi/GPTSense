so it's come to my attention that you have to have a password to comment. what's that all about? i didn't make up a password. but i'm on it. i'll figure it out eventually! until then just email me and let me know whats up i guess. and asha - we still need to chat! i got it worked out - but just make sure you put your name on the post cause i guess you have to post it anonymously. so i want to know who you are when you say something!
