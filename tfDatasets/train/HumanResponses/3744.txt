have you ever wondered who keeps sending all those ridiculous email forwards to you? t he ones with the warningsthis chain has not been broken for about nine months now.please do not be the one to break it  and the even "scarier" ones which say that if you do not send this to so many people something seriously bad will happen to you! where do these people manage to cook up all the doomsday stories? why isn't there a single sane person who believes that this is all a hoax and stops the mail there and then? they say that almost 50%of the email sent each day is spam. how many of these are chain mails? i float this question off into cyber space (or blogspace) does anyone out there actually know anyone personally who didn't send out the chain letter and suffered as a direct consequence? send in your answers and we shall soon see that this is all a hoax! on a personal note.i never forward these. except if the matter they contain is very nice to read
