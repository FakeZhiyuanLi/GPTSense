did you know you can taste mint through your eye?, i just found that outits not a good idea to take a liquid ice mints and pinch it between your fingers and watch them explode.they hurt quite a lot when theyre in your eye.however tasting something through something other than your tongue is pretty cool. well, at 5pm friday, im leaving to kalifia for a while, wont be back till july 3rd.i dont wanna go*
