well today is pretty cruisy. mum made me a scarf it looks so cool, actually she made me 2. they're purple and out of that feather wool stuff. oh so warm. today is raining and miserable but i think we really need it and its going to make the garden look pretty again- silver lining. i feel so tired yet so awake so the weather is actually pretty appropriate. i went to sleep at about 4:30 this morning. i really need to learn to go out earlier :p but it wasn't my fault. i'm looking forward to the tigers v parra game even though i will be incredibly out numbered.
