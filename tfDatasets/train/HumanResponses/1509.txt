guess wut? ccgh has invited me to visit their school. it will be interesting. i think i have made my decision on which school to go to in sixth form if i achieved at least 5as or more. i've been thinking recently. what have i got to lose? thinking about it. the people i hang around with in anglo never really accepted me. there's no point staying. cuz, the people i really wanna be friends with ignores me. except for luvly laura! have you ever want to be friends with someone so badly? well, i have. i've got a feeling that she thinks that i'm gay. but, the truth is. i'm not! gay people are strange!
