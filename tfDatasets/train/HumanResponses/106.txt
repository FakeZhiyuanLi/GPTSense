well, i'm packing my stuff. i'm off to turkey tomorrow with my parents. actually i've been thinking a lot about this and kind of decided that this would be the last trip with my parents. i mean i'm 23, time to "grow up". and if i would be alone i could do whatever i want. i guess that's one of the biggest problems. i like o go bed very late or rather early ;) and my parents. well not. i also have my moods, hard to cope with them sometimes. and sometimes i'm just annoyed of everything. so travelling alone would be an advantage momentarily, in this boyfriend-less time. *sigh* anyway i have no choice than to go so i should make the best of it. however, i don't think this will be as easy as it sounds.
