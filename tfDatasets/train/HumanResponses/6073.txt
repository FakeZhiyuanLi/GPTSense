goodbye dad you used to be a humungous star you used to be abroad so far and i won't ask you why you used to be so full of care because i craved to say goodbye can you please be so kind can you afford me your ghostly mind and i won't be gone awry can you ring and expire the wind because i lack to say goodbye will you be able to go above will you depart away as a dove and i won't utter a sigh will you bestow me your love because i will pine to say goodbye and i know i will be okay because i need to say goodbye ~kekua march 2004
