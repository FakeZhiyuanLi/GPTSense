yesterday was the day for my sister, she went to the u.s. embassy for a visa application/interview. i never prayed to god to help her pass the interview, conciously i want her to leave because that will mean cd's and t-shirts. sub-conciously it was different. i am scared and dont want her to go. she doesnt need it. our parents can provide more than enough for both of us, but then again its her life and her decision. she passed and if all goes smoothly she will be living by next month. what will happen to her there is among the many worries me and my parents will endure. we just hope that she succeeds and enjoy life as it comes
