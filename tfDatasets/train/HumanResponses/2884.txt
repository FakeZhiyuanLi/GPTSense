**my neighbor was bitten by a stray rabid dog. i went to see how he was and found him writing frantically on a piece of paper. i told him rabies could be cured and he didn't have to worry about a will. he said, "will? what will? i'm making a list of the people i want to bite!" **how to be healthly insane *in the memo field of all your checks, write "for sexual favors" *tell your children over dinner. "due to the economy, we are going to have to let one of you go." i might add on to it later but i'm too lazy right now
