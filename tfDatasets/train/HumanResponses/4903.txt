it's been a crazy busy week so far at work. that's honestly all i've been up to! but our demo is almost all working. so there's not much to say here.other than that i'm really looking forward to going to san francisco and getting out of the snow for a little while. and a big thanks to prashant for staying at work and hacking code with me when he totally didn't have to. you rock!
