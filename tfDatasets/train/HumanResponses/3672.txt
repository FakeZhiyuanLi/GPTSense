so, faithful blog readers. you have succeeded in your endeavors to find and start to read my blog! you obviously have no life. wooo posting. so lately i have been really stupidly spending a hell of a lot of credit texting matt foster, josh (who goes to my drama) and rachel (who also goes to my drama). yeah, so i now forget that i have a limit of credit. hi matt! my entire class thinks i'm hung, which is quite disturbing!
