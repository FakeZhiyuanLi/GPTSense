sigh, ya know computers do have their own life. this one truly acts strange at times. just had to re-fit the heatsink on my videocardagainit's sad. i think i should have the "right" to be able to have it working for longer as 2 months before i need to refit it.not? ah well, some nice things are coming here but not now yet! ya shall see!
