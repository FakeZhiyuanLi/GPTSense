you know, ive never really been patriotic, truly patriotic anyway, but a few nights ago when we had france on the ropes with 3 minutes to go, they managed to sneak a right hook, courtesy of zidane and we were knocked out for the count! but this will give us hope, we almost won the game, not the rubbish kind of almost winning where we took the lead after 5 minutes then concede two goals 15 minutes later. tonight we shall win, we should retain the same team that almost conquered the champions, im thinking 2-0 england with rooney and owen gettin a goal each, im hoping for that a cos i want them to win, and b cos steph thinks its gonna be 3-1 and we got a bet on wrestling news-i believe that rey mysterio will beat a now fired chavo classic for the crusierweight title, im pleased cos my cousin ross is an absoululty huge mysterio fan anyways the bad blood 2004 review shouild be posted a bit later, with some thoughts on todays football later m.c
