so we don't lose the work already featured on the surface website due to the move to a blog site, we're going to feature them again periodically. in a segment called, unoriginally, "from the archives" we'll post an interview, an artwork or review once a week. hopefully this will give greater visability to those artists already featured as well as encourage new submissions.
