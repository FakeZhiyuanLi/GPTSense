"do you know who's that girl who's all alone? do you care enough to see she's in pain and misery?" no one cares i've lost him forever i've cried so many tears but they won't bring him back to me. "dig my grave dig it deep dig my grave from head to feet and on the top place a dove and remember this: i died for love" i wish i would die why can't i do it myself? because a part of me hopes that he still cares because i love him and am literally dying without him but i've lost him forever.
