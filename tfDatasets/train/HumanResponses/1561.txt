missions is usually understood as something churches support that takes place somewhere else through specially trained professionals known as missionaries. evangelism is often seen as something a few persons do in a local congregation through a committee, or as one of the programs of the church, or as something done in and through a parachurch organization. there are two fundamental problems with such understandings. first, they fail to relate missions and evangelism adequately to the larger framework of the mission of god. secondly, because of this, they fail to recognize the relationship between the life and ministry of the church and god's mission in the world. mission and evangelism is to be inherent within the very nature of the church. it starts with the belief that the triune god is a missionary god.
