today i went to l.a. with some friends. no real purpose aside from checking out all the beautiful women. i mean can you really blame us? it was a nice break from the homework and what not that has kept be busy for the better part of the last three months. i have to take my finals next week and i will spend most of this holiday weekend working on my last reports and readings. thats about it.but let it be know, i love l.a.!
