well, last night it stormed something fierce. thunder, lightning and tons of rain. it sure made a nice evening to crochet. i finished with the 6th square now, and have started the one with the cluster braid. it is not hard at all, and seems to be going fairly quickly. i like this part. i will try to finish this one today. i have a terrible headache, so i don't know how much i will get to do. i am working on my squares in the order, going down the left, in strips. once i have 9 squares done, in the first row, i will attach them together and begin to really see some progress. it only has 7 strips, so once you get one done, it will go smoothly from then on out. well, until next time - happy crocheting from my hook to yours!
