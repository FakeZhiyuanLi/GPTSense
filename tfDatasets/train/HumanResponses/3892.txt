that's one thing i learnt from advertising. the effort doesn't matter, the struggles in getting the job done mean jack and everyone's going to judge you by the results: a grotesque communication piece that's more often than not been butchered by external forces. took me 24 years to see this but it seems that people are getting the game early on. cause i was just watching america's funniest home videos and there was a clip of this 4-year-old was on the computer bawling "i don't wanna lose! i wanna win! i wanna always win!" which was terribly endearing until i realised that he might end up being a bloody good blood-sucking client some day.
