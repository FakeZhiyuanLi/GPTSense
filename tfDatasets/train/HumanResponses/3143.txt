the great purging begins. i have decided to mentally vomit for everyone's amusement! i find it highly ironic that the anonymity of a blog allows us to delve into a cathartic state with total strangers. if that same inner catharsis was written in a diary, we would keep it under lock and key. never to see the light of day. why does the digital divide create a feeling of security? why are we able to speak volumes about someone we have a crush on in a diary yet become tongue tied when anywhere of a 10 foot radius of the person? maybe it is because the fear of rejection vanishes; conflicts resolve with a few taps of the keys, decisions are made by looking at the ever loyal, steadily blinking cursor. maybe it is the protected world from others seeing the emotions in our heart, the butterflies in our stomach, and the tears in our eyes. maybe i stumbled upon nirvana.
