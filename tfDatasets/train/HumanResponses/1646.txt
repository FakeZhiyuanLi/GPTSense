i have no idea who to tlak to about anything at the moment.i was just told that the one person i dotn like is the one person who deosnt hate me. he told me that most of my friends despise me and looking back, maybe i do see of a few hints of this. i guess i jsut wanted things to be good and all right so i just ignored what was really happeneing and i cant believe this.i actually thought people liked me. who do you turn to when all hope is lost? when the person who doesnt hate you is the one you hate? when the people who you thought you knew and trusted secretly or obviously never really like you to being with? who do you turn to when you're all alone? i guess this blog is my only salvation left.
