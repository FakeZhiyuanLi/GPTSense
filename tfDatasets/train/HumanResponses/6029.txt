the last few days have been some of the best in a long time. saturday was my 16th birthday, and ,as i said before i was at a recording studio. on our way back, we just happened to get on the same bus as caroline and her friends, although i didn't notice till they were getting off. (dunno if i woulda said anything even if i had noticed before.) well, later on, i got a text from her asking me out. after recovering from the shock i said yes and were going out next weekend.yay sunday was pretty uneventful, slept till 12, didn't do very much for the rest of the day. today was good, was back at the recording studio, had a great time, although they made me sing which was quite embarrassing.
