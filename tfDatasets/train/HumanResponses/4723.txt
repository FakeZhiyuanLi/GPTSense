dear michael, i so don't want to be here any more. these people are morons. some are nice, and some i'm pleased to call friends. but the rest are morons. i can't stand how it feels to be here. help me with my intentions, because i need the money. help me block the negativity. help me to remember my divine mission, my divine self. i hate this font. i'm really cranky today. no carbs so far. grrrrrr. not sure how long that will last. smokes will probably help. help me block the morons, please. thank you for your love and presence, and thanks for your help.
