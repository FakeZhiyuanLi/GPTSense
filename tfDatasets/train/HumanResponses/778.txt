today i woke up and went back over to the mall to go shopping.i didn't find anything, but i got a pretty necklace and hair clips from anchor blue. while i was there i saw nicole and phil.haha, its always funny how i catch them in anchor blue! while i was at the mall alyssa text messaged me and said "kyle was in the paper".i was like wtf? yeah so they were talking about his group getting ambushed in iraq and how it all happened. gosh, it was sad. i wish they didn't bring it up again, but i'm also happy they did because it shows that hes never forgotten.
