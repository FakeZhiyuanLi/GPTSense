this is my first ever journal, and so have decided to keep it very secret, and only advertising my innermost fantasies on the liberal party website, which very few people ever go to. i'm going to try and update this thing occasionally, but if i'm away for a long period of time, it probably means i'm on top secret missions for my johnnie, or tony, whom i work for. either that, or i'm watching absolutely fabulous and listening to my new kylie cds. coming up to the elections though, i'll try and post a little more. so here is a brief list of my likes and dislikes: like: liberal party of australia, john howard, george w. bush, tony abbott, philip ruddock, peter costello, wedge politics, usa, globalisation, gats, free trade agreements, the world trade organisation, britney spears, ru paul dislike: everyone not in the liberal party, um. i hope you like reading my journal as much as like creating regressive social policy.
