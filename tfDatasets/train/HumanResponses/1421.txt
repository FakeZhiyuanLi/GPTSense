i finished memoirs of a geisha. it was really brilliant and provided a window into the world of the geisha. i have much respect for them. they are not high paid prostitutes as many people seem to thing. they had honor and respect. i really would love to meet some real geisha when i go to japan. ha, i honestly don't believe i would ever have enough money though. perhaps one day. today i haven't done that much. i have just been spending time with my mom and brother. i know my mom and brother are going to miss me a lot when i leave. i know mom wishes i didn't leave the state, but i just know that this is the right path. i mean it was like a sign when i heard of wittenberg. it was last summer, and i received a pamphlet from them, and they knew about my interest in japan. i still don't know to this day how they found a guy in a small town in alabama, because they don't have a single student from alabama. it has to be destiny. well that is all for today. take care everyone and god bless.
