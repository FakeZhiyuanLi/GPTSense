i dance to the feel of bliss and the tune of true contentment. choreographed by the love you give. twirling and tapping like there's no tomorrow. parading my heart like the participants of mardi gras. full of passion.full of elegance. exotic, magical colours splash in the world that evolves around me. smittens me with your laconic heartfelt. i dare myself to melt but i melt all the same. will i be dancing to this feel and tune till the stars won't shine; because i know it won't tire me out. so take my hands, come dance with me for now, my love. for now.
