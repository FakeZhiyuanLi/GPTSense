doom 3 finally came out. so i went over to my friend john's house to watch him play it. i must say that the graphics are the best i have ever seen. i dont know much about the story though. it seemed that everything looked the same in the levels we got to play. the story is basically that you are stationed in mars when all hell brakes loose, literally. the stationed was then plagued with all sorts of monsters and zombies. so you go through the game, obviously, killing every last one of these monsters/zombies. one thing is for sure though, even if half-life 2 doesn't match up with doom 3 in the graphics department, it will definately beat it in the overall gameplay and story. -vs
