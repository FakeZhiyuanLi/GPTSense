2day got 2 go for fencing course. aiya, very sian. other than learning somethings about fencing, its quite a waste of time. the whole time go there n slack. but this is better than training. go there for 2 hours just to relax n learn a bit on how to fence. the best part is the demo match, then the rest is like very boring. learning how 2 move front n back . actually prefer 2 do others things than this. the worts of all, after course i have to write a report, omg, i really dun noe wat to write. must get my "facts" rite man, got to write a ns report. oh well, life lyks tt.
