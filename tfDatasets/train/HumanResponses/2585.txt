yes. this is the end. the end of life trapped in a uniform. the end of life with rules and regulations. the beginning of a lifetime of work dedicated to passion. drown yourself. hypnotise yourself. mesmerise yourself. is this a dream or is this reality? (thats a song - bohemian rhapsody). what does it feel like to be free?. its like opening your eyes and all you see is huge blank canvas. start painting. a huge blank music sheet. start composing. a huge blank piece of . life. start living.
