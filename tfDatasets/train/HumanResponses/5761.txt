well i'm back, sp2 for windows decided that it didn't like the fact that my pc was functional and swiftly took steps to correct the matter. long story short, i stumped myself and microsoft tech support, i couldn't even get past the loading screen, and safe mode wouldn't load. so i had to take it into the shop to get the hdd wiped. i also passed my aptitude and physical test for the canadian armed forces, i'm glad it's over, the physical wasn't as bad as i thought it was going to be. i'm on vacation for the next two weeks, nice to have sometime off.
