just found out that the state of missouri (where i hail from) has voted to ban gay marriage. wtf is the big deal i don't care if any two people who love each other want to get married. 2 women or 2 men, let them. in all honesty, with the number of divorces between hetero couples, i would almost guarantee that the divorce rate among gay couples would be much lower! people need to wake up and realize that there is nothing wrong with two people, gay or not, getting married. d
