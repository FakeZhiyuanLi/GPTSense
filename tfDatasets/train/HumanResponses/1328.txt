it is a proven fact : i cannot stay in the same place for more than a few hours without loosing my mind. im not joking either.ive been home for 2 days and im already depressed. the house is a mess, the dishes are piled up in the sink, and instead of taking care of all that im sitting here in front of my computer typing a letter to nobody bitching about my life, makes a whole lot of gaddam sense, right?it seems to me that i get like this whenever scott has to work and im left here with the kids. it wouldnt be so bad if he wasnt working nights. i hate sleeping alone. and because im working on his off days i really dont ever see him and it makes me feel so lonely.geez i guess i dont have much to say now.
