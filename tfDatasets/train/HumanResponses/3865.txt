i still havn't been to sleep yet. wait, i slept for like thirty minutes. that doesn't count. i stayed up reading orwell's 1984 for the second time and drinking no pulp orange juice. brice doesn't like pulp, i think he's a pussy. it doesn't matter to me, all oj is good. i played guitar for awhile. #34 is pretty damn hard to play. it's easy, but it's hard to get it to sound right. i don't know, maybe i just suck. we drove to cincy and got 900 garden mums. what fun, me being in the back of a ryder truck for hours. it sucked big goat testicles. i miss my girlfriend. :( i'm going to go get a shower and then go to pimp's b-day party with brice and vickers. it'll probably suck. i might start going out with a new girl there, that's where i usually date my girls, the thompson house. i'm going to run though, i'll holler back at you later. peace.
