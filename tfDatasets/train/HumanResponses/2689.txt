i was up at purdue this weekend and had such an awesome time. it was the cactus, then to a house party, i love the rain *wink wink* to pete. i would like to thank all of my friends.i know how lucky i am, you guys care about me so much. tina, you make me realize that i'm not stupid, and it's ok to make stupid decisions as long as i learn from them. and yes i did, a certain ex-boyfriend can go to hell. everything happens for reasons, i don't regret anything. and a side note.i'd like everyone at the party friday night to know i'm a good girl. promise! i'm normally an angel. if you don't believe me, ask tina! hey i'm just out to have fun, and i will try very hard to not break any hearts, including mine.
