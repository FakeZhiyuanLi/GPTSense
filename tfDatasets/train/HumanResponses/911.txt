well, it's two in the morning. probably wasn't the best idea in the world to stay up this late, but then, who the hell am i to care? i went to matt's house, and he had enough lager for everybody, which is always good. we tried to get martin (aka "pisshead") onto non-alcoholic becks, but the bastard noticed. ah well. at least i got invited to his girlfriend's birthday (i think it's her birthday - i really should listen more), which should have pissed him off a bit. well, i've been on prophet's inc. and fantasy essentials - my favourite forums - for the last few hours, chatting to random people. god, i live a sad life. oobs.
