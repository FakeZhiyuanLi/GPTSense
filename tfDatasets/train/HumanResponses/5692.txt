today me and my brother josh saw the movie saved! it was ok. they could of made it alot better! but i have to say that this is one of the good movie mandy moore was in. mandy moore ends up being the bitch of the movie though just the princess diaries except she was the bitch in the whole movie. also when me and my brother were watching it everyone around us was making noise! it was really annoying and the guy sitting next to me kept talking to his wife during the movie! also when we were going to sit in the theatre i saw someone i knew from an acting camp i went to! it was good to see her even though she was flirting with a guy and i think i interupted it.
