i got back to my school assignment today. my paper is about 80% complete now. i found that i don't have a lot to say about egyptian creation myths, though. i am trying to make a connection between the creation myths, and the sociological agenda of the authors of the myths. i presented some (what i believe are) good points for the hebrew and hindu myths, and passing observation for the japanese myth. but the egyptions are either too subtle for me, or they just didn't use their myths the way i expected them to. how dare they!
