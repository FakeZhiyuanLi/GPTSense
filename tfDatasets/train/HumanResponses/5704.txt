so i was setting my profile here at blogspot.com, and they ask you a question at the end of it. you can search through it until you find a question that suits you best. while i did my best to finally find a question that i liked. i had it all answered when low and behold i was over the max 150 character limit.which i thought at first wouldn't be hard to change until i try to do so.anypoop to make a long story short i had to choose another question. but i of course save this one to share with you all. enjoy! you're trapped in a well with a goat and a slinky. describe how you will escape. i would milk the goat and make feta cheese. then i would sit on the goat which i will name ernest and play with the slinky. after i have made a lot of feta cheese i would use it as a ladder and climb out and go sell my cheesedo you want to buy some?
