ahh. my archenemy. the staire o. he tried to kill me i swear it! all of my family just gave me the same blank stares and whispered to each other about the idea that it was the frying pan boxers i was wearing, but i tell you, he hit me first! you see, he was playing his music in the usual way, when i came running through and he tripped me! i fell face first into him, splitting my head open on one of his eyes, and thus ending my career as peter "pan". the scar is still there. i hate staire o's guts.
