if the good girls go to heaven, then where do the rest of us wind up. i am 23 tears rolling down my face, my father is dead, i am dead too, too sick to stand straight, too much pain to move away, i stand there next to his grave realizing that i am seeing him for the last time. he is dead. i miss him so much, i miss his smile his voice and his love. he was not just my father he was my hero, a man that bridged the parts of my life like a new colossoss, he holds such sway over me even now, he was the man i most wanted to be like and never could. he was a man of infinite jest, who bore me upon him back a thousand times, a great quote the describes my father, but another quote leaps out to me as well, tommorrow tommorrow tommorrow, life crawls forward at its petty pace,he a a poor player that frets and struts his hour on the stage, it is a tale told by an idiot of great sound and great fury, but ultimately signifinig nothing, as did my fathers life
