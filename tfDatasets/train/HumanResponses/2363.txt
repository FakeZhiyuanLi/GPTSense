well it's coming. that much i know for sure. so today victor takes me to the wig place at our local hospital to get me a new wig to wear for when my hair falls out. i had spotted that wig months ago on my numerous trips past the store. all went well and we bought the wig. i brought it home and the children were curious. mack: what's that hair in there for? me: it's a wig. mack: no it's not, it's hair! i then put the wig on so the kids could see it. noah could not stop laughing at me.
