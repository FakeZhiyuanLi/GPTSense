looks like we (michelle and i) will be going to see sawyer brown in anderson tonight. amanda is having jesse over, and i had to explain what exactly was not allowed to happen. previously, we have been very lenient about their behavior, but due to recent events that is going to be changing. unfortunately for her the new rules are going to take effect tomorrow and be in effect until further notice. let's see how she likes them and us after this weekend is over.
