the swiss sure now how to have a low-key national day. even the australia day-style bbqs were missing, although it's a perfect season for it (midsummer, and long, warm evenings). the concessions to celebration were some performances of the swiss national anthem and plenty of fireworks (the week leading up to august 1 is the only time it's legal to buy and sell fireworks in switzerland, so everyone makes the most of it!). impressive fireworks late in the evening made for a fun ending to the day, but i think the swiss dogs were as unimpressed as any by all the loud noises.
