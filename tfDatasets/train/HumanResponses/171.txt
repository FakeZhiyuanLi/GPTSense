i can get used to this, the sweet goodbyes, the soft kisses. i am twisted up inside only you know how to smooth me out. the night is young where shall we go to be alone with just you and me together. the moon lights up your face and it lights up my heart when i look in your eyes. chorus: can this universe be made for 2 perfect lovers? can it stand the test of time? or are you just a dream? you and i have had our share of challenges, i only canâ€™t wait to face the next one with you. all i have to do is dream and we sail together right into the sunset, we are launched into somewhere not quite real. are you just a dream? are you just a dream? oh. if you are then how are you in my living color? it comes to me that i only see you when i rest my head on the pillow case, its there where i am truly awake.
