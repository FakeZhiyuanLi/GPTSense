i let you fuck with my head, fuck reality, and see you in hell, i wish you played with someone else, i wish all of you to be dead. death is a great escape, it's almost like love in a sense, fucking with people's minds, clueless people they joyfully rape. fucked over too many times, because of you, it's not the same, your ego brought me down, i'm sick of it all, sick of your kind.
