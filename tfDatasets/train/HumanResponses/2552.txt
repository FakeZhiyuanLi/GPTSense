i have never been more confused in my life. do i love him? do i hate him? should i be mad at him? i mean wow. my head really did start hurting. i guess we're ok now, but geez that was tough. i wont tell the whole story b/c its long and confusing. wouldn't want to hurt all y'alls heads no would i? lol j/p. my life is pretty good right now i have no major complaints. that'll prolly change by tomorrow, but i'm happy now so oh well. thats all for now. bye'eye
