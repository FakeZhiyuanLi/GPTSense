its getting real nasty out there. this has to be the worst election year in the history of the u.s i'm not going to reiterate all the stupid things said on both sides, nor am i going to repeat the lies from both parties. let me just say, i don't want another reckless 4 years with bush. on the other hand, i don't want 4 years with kerry. but these are my choices. what i believe will happen after one of these bafones gets elected. the people will rise up, get it together, and find a true leader for our country.out of the shit grows daffodiles! hang on, its only going to smell worse during the next four years.
