what happens to a heart unanswered. does it throng evermore louder, till its call is undeniable or does it wilt, with the sorrow of emptiness unrequited, will it blacken with bitterness can it harden like stone, so it may never ever be unanswered again so the hurt can not wound yet the wound does show through cracks of granite flow despair and it beats no more does it die, does it bleed unanswered, it is a heart no more.
