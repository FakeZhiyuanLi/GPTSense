well, today was good, i posted three times including this one. i really like having a blog, i've never done any type of online journal before and i'm pretty excited about this one. today at school was good, pretty much a regular day. i've decided to run for class president, so hopefully that will work out for me. drumline is coming along nicely and tuesday is homework day. woo hoo! not. ;p o well, until next time.
