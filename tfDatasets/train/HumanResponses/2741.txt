it may seem very strange to alot of people as to how i can be happy when i'm sad.it is not exactly that cause i'm feeling both at the same time.the sad thing is that we lost another match on the 6th of june.and the happy thing is that some of our player had already awaken from their mistake.they used to think that basketball is a game based on individual skills and not team play.but they let me see it the other way round when they are on the court.the other thing that i'm happy about is that she actually called to chat with me when she is freeit is quite a strange thing to me as i don't usually chat with anyone on the phone for like 2 to 3 hours.its late in the night and other else den my sister.i've never chatted with ani1 for so long on the phone.lucky its not my cellphone or i'll be in deep trouble for the coming month.rm.i'll just end here and go to sleepnitez.
