tomorrow i'm going to have to enroll already? it seems only yesterday when i was sitting in my classroom taking my periodical exams and now summer's over already? time to say bye-bye to my summer friends, and hello to more homework. nooo! but then, i don't have to feel all sad about it. after all, i'm going to see my friends tomorrow.Ã¼ and i'm actually excited to go buying new school supplies, new rubber shoes, new everything. well, almost everything, that is. and above all that, going to school is not the most dreaded part of life. it's actually the most exciting, the most fun. especially now that i'm in high school. i know there is nothing really exciting about second year no prom, no parties, just studies but who knows? i might come across something while living what i think is a perfectly normal life
