today has been one of those days that feels like it's really actually not there. a day you feel bad for sitting around, when you know you should be using every second of your life. it feels like this whole summer has been filled with days like this. i don't know, maybe i feel empty because so many things are going on in my life and i just wish i can freeze time to sort everything out.
