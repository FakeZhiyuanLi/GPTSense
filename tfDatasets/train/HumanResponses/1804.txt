what more could be wrong with our world? my landlord feels she is legally entitled to tell me no one can spend a night in my apartment. she's full of opinions about me and acts like she knows all folks, this is like having a dog who consistently goes on the carpet. utterly annoying. i'm not sure what to do exactly and i haven't made my mind up about anything yet, but i really wanna get an ice pop. yeah, an ice pop. its hot out. temperature is rising. maybe i should consider moving, getting another place of my own. it seems bayonne is about the worse place in the world. people aren't people anymore, and no one cares about anyone else, yet they have their opinions about them. so you tell me. ice pop or flamethrower? and for all those in need of a good hug, *hug*! cheers y'all
