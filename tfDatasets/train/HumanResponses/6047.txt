sophie is turning 1 on 3rd of july. i am breaking my head about her birthday party. i found this on one of the sites: my daughter went to a summer birthday party when she was 3 and they had all the kids wear swim suites and they played hawaiian music and gave them all lays and. they had a bunch of kiddie pools some filled with sand others with water and lots of beach balls. they had a hula contest and gave out sea shells for prizes. they took individual polaroid photos of them in grass skirts and had each child make a frame decorated with shells and sand, that was their favor along with the skirts and lays, which she still uses for dress up. the cake was a pineapple upside down cake and the balloons were decorated to look like coconuts and pineapples what fun it was. may be i could do something with shells and stones and wooden sticks. what about party favors? i could not find anything decent yesterday> i think the idea od decorating their own picture is fabulous.
