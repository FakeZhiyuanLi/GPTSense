i had chemistry today. it wasn't so bad. except when i left out my favourite question and did another question which i had a hard time figuring out the differences between mixtures and compounds. it sounds kind of silly now i know. i mean. gosh. it sounds pretty much simpler now then in the test. sigh. it was really a blow out. anyway. just for the fun of it i tried the phone booth again. wasn't as funny as yesterday though. after tommorrow's physics test i'd be free from school til monday comes. damn. (don't you just hate mondays?) i got to go pack my stuff now. i'm camping at my cousin's place again. maybe i'd be going to church to check out who's there at night again. lotsa people were there last night. i'll write another later on.
