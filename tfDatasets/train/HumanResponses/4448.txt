why do i always have to be thinking about whats next. last week i had been working in the "real world" for less than two weeks, and i had already thought of what i might do next. don't get me wrong, i don't think its bad to think about the future and try to plan accordingly, but sometimes i wonder that me thinking about what''s next is just me not being content in what the lord has given to me. or maybe it me just anxious for new challenges or maybe its me wanting god's best for me and not settleing for second best. maybe its good maybe its bad, i dunno.as long as i follow that still small voice of the holy spirit inside of me, sometimes its just so hard to hear him :| >
