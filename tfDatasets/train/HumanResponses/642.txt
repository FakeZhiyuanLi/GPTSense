today i took a detour from my regular awesomely cool blazingly mixed with action and adventure life to go to saricks house. basically i gave him a shitload of songs, and he gave me a shitload, and it was fun cuz we lisetned to music and stuff. o ya and we watched hidalgo, where, sadly, the black guy dies. it was an alrite movie tho, cept viggo mortensen "sings" which is jsut kinda scary. listening to the clansman - iron maiden. good song. im using my new found "faith" in winamp wisely.
