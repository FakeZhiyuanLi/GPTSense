ok. aside from aim, i have f***ing nothing to do since i am ordering a new computer, the internet on my old one has been disconnected(damn bastards as frontier.) and now i can only use the internet at the library. i need some blogs to read. please post links to any blogs that you think are worth reading. thank you!
