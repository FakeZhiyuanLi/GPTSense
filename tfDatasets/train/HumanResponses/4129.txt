i went to the water park yesterday with my family. it was about a 2 hour drive, which wasn't bad. the bad part came when we got there. i don't really get the point of going to amusement parks and stuff like that. its always crowded, it's either really hot or really rainy, or some extreme, it can never be nice weather. and people seem to become stupider by every foot they get into the park. my biggest problem, was the sun. my hated advisary. i always wear shoes. it might seem an odd peice of information, but it will be importent in a minute. i was trying to get a tan, im tired of being so white im transparent. well, since i don't wear shoes, there whiter then the rest of me, and if a bit to lazy to put on sunscreen all the way down there. i was trying to tan, and i fell asleep. i didn't notice the effects until later that night, man, it burns. it still burns. heres a tip, never scratch a bad sunburn. youll regret it, forever.
