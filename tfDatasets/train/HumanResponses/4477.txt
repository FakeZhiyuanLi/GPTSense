i have a friend who is sad. sad and lonely. she didn't even feel like sewing. so i thought i would try an exercise with her with color  colored pencils and paper to be exact. i find with this particular friend, she thinks better in images than words. i had her pick colors and then draw an object. we concluded that with the imagery she drew she was telling of what she was going through. i think it was successful.
