wote a paper on yeats last night, even though it is not due until thursday, am reading ahead in my other classes, and have not turned in one late assignment. life is strange indeed. been thinking about josh a lot yesterday, had a great conversation with f. at pandoras last night about life etc, in between bouts of homework. think i know what is going on with that now, at least, i know what i want now. (if you want to know that, you'll have to e-mail me and ask) found out i am on the vip list for thursday, first time that's happened, and i am excited to see a free show. cheers devin
