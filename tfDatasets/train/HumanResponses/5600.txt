we left polonbaruwa and headed to kandy where we are nowon the way we went to sigiriya - and yes i made it to the top! the mirror wall and the cave with the paintings of the sigiriyan damsels were fantastic and the view from the top was absolutely amazing. we also went to dambulla to see the cave temples which were full of statues of buddha after buddha after buddha with the ocassional vishnu through in. the painings on the ceilings and walls were amazingly detailed. we also went to nalanda where the hindu temple was in amazingly good condition we also stopped at a spice garden to get a tour of the garden with a guide telling us about the different trees and what spices they produced. it was suprisingly interesting. after that we had a smell, rub, taste test and a look around the ayervedic shop. then onto kandy, which is in the hill country, where thankfully the weather isn't quite so hot.
