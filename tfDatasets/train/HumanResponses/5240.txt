my thoughts, like leaves on a forest floor, by gusts of autumn wind, have all been strewn around. quick now, lightening fast i leap from thought to thought and leaf to leaf to grasp and hold but a chosen few from all those that have gone askew. this one's interesting, that one's fine no not that one, oh - this one isn't even mine in youthful frivolity i do not mark the stealthy passing of the time. why the shock, the surprise, the horror when in a pools broken faded mirror stooped over the forest floor, i see an old old  old me!
