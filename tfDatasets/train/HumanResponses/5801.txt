hey there boys and girls. count out all the syllables. this is a haiku. jonno's vanished off to uni, and i'm left here to hold the fort. sigh. it's so dull. to continue with the japanese bent of previous posts, here's how to say "i am haggard" in japanese. i am haggard = watakushi wa yatsureta. remember; it's all about the pronounciation/pronunciation. get that right and you're rolling/laughing/chortling merrily.
