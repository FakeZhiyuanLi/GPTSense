do you ever go strange? you're going along, everything is feeling good and bam, you feel like scum of the earth. no one has said anything particularily bad to youbut there it is. you calling yourself down. like tonight, had a nice day with my husband, went out for dinner to a nice restaurant.had a good mean (seafood mmmmmmmmmmm), went to a movie (stupid movie. dodgeball. need i say more.) and i'm feelin' like a loser. i guess it's cause i'm havin' a tough time at my new job and i feel i should have everything under control after 4 days cause the pay is so low. i think i have some brain restructuring to do. where do we get these perceptions?tomorrow is a new day.a 7 hour shift and work pants that ride up my ass. lovely.this doesn't last long, thank god. c
