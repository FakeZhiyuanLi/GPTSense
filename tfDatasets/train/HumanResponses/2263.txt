just read a couple pages of a book i'd read before then felt blessedly tired but didn't go to sleep. i can never get to sleep these days. i recently had a dream where i would walk down this trail next to a boggy marshy little place to get to open bay water and climb onto the dock. i couldn't climb it though because of the nasty spiders hiding underneath. pity. also i remember something about a rich house. a large house.maybe. i forget. all of you shut your mouths and fetch me the.go fetch.
