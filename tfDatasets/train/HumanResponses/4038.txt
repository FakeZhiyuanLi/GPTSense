the other day i saw a woman try to use her giant bonus card to get a discount on pants at nordstroms. someone, i think it was a neoconservative, shat on my car the same day. i moved out of the group house. the woman who runs the house was a little sad, perhaps because she knew there would be one fewer person to watch her act like satan. the taiwanese housemate doesn't like to watch her act like satan. he prefers to order lingerie from victoria's secret for himself. he can be nasty sometimes.
