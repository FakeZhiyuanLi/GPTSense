i must admit, i felt better today than i did yesterday. i think it was the combination of the gorgeous weather (even though it is winter), the late start to the day (going to school later than usual), and the fact that i surprisingly got a butt load of work done last night. plus, american idol has started here, finally , lol. i love watching the shows at the beginning of a series: all the bad, the worse, and the horrible. they're playing season 3 episodes every night here, to try to catch up to the us so that the final show can play live. i hope it's gonna be as good as last season. now that i have accepted the fact that i am indeed. stressed, i can tell myself to slow down before i get all caught up in crap. overthinking, overanalyzing, over-worrying, over everything. i think i'll just get to bed early tonight. pretty pooped out.
