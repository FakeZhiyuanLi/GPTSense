kay, here's the deal. i don't think that it is fair for there to be a technology meeting after school for and entire friggin' hour when i have a friggin' bio test to cram for tomorrow! ok. done with my venting. i was just so frusterated at the tech people that i decided to not go.i'll probably get a detention. oh well. haven't had one all year. anywho, caint talk much now 'cause of the impending test. now i get to learn all about organisms. nevermind that the pages of my frog lab got stuck together with frog juice therefore preventing me from getting an a on the darn thing. sorry. c-ya.
