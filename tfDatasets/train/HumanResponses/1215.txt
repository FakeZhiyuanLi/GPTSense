i have noticed today that my wardrobe is mostly black and grayi don't understand when this happened and why this has happened. well i do know black hides the spots i can't imagine any one else seeing and well gray just goes with black. ok, so now i have it figured out, but i must add some color to my wardrobe, i am not as boring as i appear. i will make a conscience effort to buy at least one shirt that is not black or gray. damn this job.looking professional shouldn't be this boring, at least i dress better than half these yahoos that work herelol.
