last night i spent the night at my friend chrissy's house! we went online and i talked to the people she met in chatrooms. 2 of her ex online boyfriends kept hitting on me! it was so funny. this one guy i talked to chrissy told me tell him she was sleeping and chrissy told me to meantion her name and see what happens. nothing happened he ignored it! it was so funny. but that guy is also an asshole so who gives a shit! then i talked to this guy marrell and chrissy told him not to hit on me because he usually hits on every girl he talks too. he actually listened to her! it was a fun night at her house!
