ok, i kno i already wrote one today, but oh well. today was better then this morning. i talked to everyone and i think we have decided to offically dismember the sisterhood. i really wanted to thank everyone for saying that tiffany does not have the right to kick me out, she doesnt own the group. i love all the school group. and i hope tiffany will realize everything i told her.
