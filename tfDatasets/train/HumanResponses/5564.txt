7 days to the olympics! this year's olympics theme might be [return to athens], but for me, i'm celebrating something different. [return to tao nan] might just about summarize it! strangely, annabelle, tori, cheryl and i weren't the only ex-tao nanites that went back. in fact, most of my old classmates were there too, even the boys. you wouldn't believe how different each of them look! thankfully, all the teachers that i intended to visit - mrs tan, mrs abidin, miss heng, and all the rest - didn't forget me. i haven't been there since january!
