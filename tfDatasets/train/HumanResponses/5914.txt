the purpose of the blog is broadly to demystify and clarify general items of interest to community at large and if you feel you can contribute, please send me an email so that i can offer you an account. this blog is a tribute to hofstadter who first mentioned the skeptical inquirer in metamagical themas. unfortunately, my copy of the book has now gone to a friend with the consequence that i cannot remember who were the good guys, the skeptical inquirer or the national inquirer. so, if we get it wrong, then lets just call it irony!
