this is where the life bit comes in i've been in a relationship now for about a month with this girl steph.at first i didn't know if it would be a good idea, but just being around her made me see that was nothing to worry about, because she laughs at my jokes and my stupid sound effects, and so far has tolerated my wrestling obsession what a girl. have just finishes my gcses as well so this next few months are gone to be nervous ones to say the least, but with her with me i know i'll cope i mite do a wrestling tape review tomorrow the minute its a toss up between the great american bash 1991 or possibly something like bad blood 1997. any questions incidentally can be left here and i'll do my best to answer themas lions as their wrestling related. tlk tommorow m.c
