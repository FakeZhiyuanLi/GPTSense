ok, i am getting irritated. apparently, the ambericandaughter blog is still there, but not updated like the pydahl one is. also, i'm trying to change the look of the template here, but every time i do and then repubish the whole thing, there's an error but i can't click on it to see what went wrong grrrr. btw, it was really cool that jon came up last night, even though i had thought he was not going to be able to. he tried to make it a surprise, but i'm too clever to be tricked! hehe  he was a good sport about the jelly beans. and an even better sport about the "ice cream." :)
