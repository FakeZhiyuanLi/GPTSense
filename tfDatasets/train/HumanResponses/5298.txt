josh got his braces today. since i'm not hanging out with sam after school today after all, i was home flipping through the channels and decided to watch trl. usually, i hate this show but i'm in an odd mood today. avril lavigne was on and i swear if she wasn't stoned she is mentally retarded. she can't pull together logical sentences and went through the whole "i'm not punk!" sincero once more. i'm getting sick of hearing out it. most people who claim to be punk now-a-days aren't. most people have never even heard true punk music. screw stevie and her gc obsession. thats plain retarded. but, people like what they like, more power to ya. i'm also painting this kinda nifty painting on a canvas for art but since we only have 3 days left i am bringing it home so i can actually get it done in time.
