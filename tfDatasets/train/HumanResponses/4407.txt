some new ideas on the avatar thing: the use of faces/persons might increase the change in running into each other and look towards the other is looking, furthermore it might solve disorientation problems. if the user looks one direction and walks another, it could be shown by the avatar. recognition could be simplified by a name or picture floating above the user and clicking on a user might reveal more information, like the path he took, his name etc etc (everything that is stored in the dbase)
