grrrr. i bought a new printer back in march that is compatible with my mac and it was refurbished on ebay. no warranty! =( well, it's not working now and i need a new one. i just have to bite the bullet and buy a good one so i'm not spending 100 bucks per year to replace them. i've gone through more printers than anyone i know! here goes another 300 bucks out the door.
