i am soooo bored at work. i guess i should think of something to do to keep busy, then the day would go faster and then i wouldn't be so bored. i'll do that tomorrow :) i was very pissed last night, i came home, took a nap. before that i set the dvr thing to record the 2 south park episodes, and started to record sex and the city. then thought, i'll be awake from my nap by then. guess what? i was awake, but got busy chatting and thought. i'll just watch it later since i'm recording it. so later gets here, and i go to watch it, and its not there cause i didn't record it!@#$ so now i have the next weeks set to record :)
