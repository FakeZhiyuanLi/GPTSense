a few days ago i watched the blue man group live at berlin, germany, where they perform "the complex". i knew only little about the group (almost everything from the intel pentium commercials) and hence i did not know what to expect from the show. but it was extremely cool. the show is a ingenious combination of rock music, light show, very funny and sudden actions which also includes a wobble pudding. the show is definitely worth every penny.
