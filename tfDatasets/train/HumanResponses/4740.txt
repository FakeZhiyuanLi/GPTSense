well, it appears that the external email is currently not working for some unknown reason. no wonder i am getting so much done if you write to me on here, i will check it. if someone wouldn't mind emailing me a test email about once an hour or so, to see if the email starts working, i would appreciate it. kim is taking her car out to get tires on it tonight, so we are going to wander mills fleet for a little bit to see the sights, do some non-shopping, and putz around for an hour or 2. maybe wander out someplace, eat, and then come back. hope everybody is having a good day! cheers!
