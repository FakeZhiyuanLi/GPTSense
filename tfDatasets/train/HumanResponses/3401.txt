you know what i miss about the outside world? nobody just wakes you up in the middle of a nap and starts gang probing you. don't these things have any sense of chivalry? i have to be whined and dined, and would it kill you to get some lube or at least use some spit? oh well. apparently, everyone here gets probed at least once a day. some unlucky bastard gets it twice. poor unfortunate soul. i think i see some sunlight. cracks in the wall tease you with hints of what you think is sunlight. these days really suck. i need to find a way out.
