[ost : tamia's officially missing you] i don't feel to write something these days. especially today. it seems that everything goes wrong and sad, plus teary. bad day, i may say. really. i'm not in mood to write more. it has been hours and i still feel it's just only another bad dream, and i'm going to wake up soon. but it's really not. it's a reality. i must face it. he must, she must. i don't want to describe who 'he' is, and who 'she' is. life goes on, life never stops only for waiting. failure is only a delayed success. don't you ever give up. *ganbatte for 2 persons i love much!* [ m i t a ]
