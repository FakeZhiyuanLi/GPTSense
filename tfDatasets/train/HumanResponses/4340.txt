hey cho! young! i just got my big clark packet. the opening of school information one. and i was looking through the parent and student handbook for 2004-2005. in the faculty list, mimoto-sensei's name is listed. i don't know why the alpha room list indicated it as "mata." perhaps it is a misprint? typo? or even a student teacher? maybe mimoto will miss the first day of school. i don't know. but for one thing, the faculty list seems up to date. unless mimoto-sensei decided to quit "last minute." =t mr. z is not listed. and neither is mrs. myers. huh, too bad mrs. thompson is still at clark. there's also another thompson listed under science. hmmm. i hope that mimoto is still around. i don't want to have to get used to another japanese teacher. >__ okay. later then. =p school's approaching near! >__
