we attempted to follow the schedule that we had set up for ourselves.i'm pretty sure that the only thing we stuck to was our lunch time.today was pizza day!.apparently the $.60/slice pizza is free for your first time.so i took 3 lol.other than that i learned that life-savers are called life-savers because the guy that invented them had a friend that died choking on a hard candy.so in order to prevent more hard candy deaths he made a candy with a whole in it so that one is able to breathe even if one swallows the candy whole and it gets lunged in one's throat for all of eternity.
