especially in the warm weather. actually i am thinking it is not a cold but that i am allergic to my assistant manager. wouldn't that be a hoot!. i was fine til he came to my dept. and stood next to me. then i started sneezing and my eyes got all itchy. i have been thinking lately about dimensional stuff. like several dimensions living within other dimensions and not interfering with each other. i don't mean "not interfering" because they are being courteous, but because they are oblivious to the existence of these other dimensions. i think it can explain alot of strange occurances in peoples lives. i know it can explain alot in mine. i have to give this more thought. i am not a real "heaven or hell" person. and i have found a sort of comfort in this dimensional thinking. anyways, i will get back to you on this. laters! me
