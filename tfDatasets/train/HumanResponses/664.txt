today is a bad day. the weekends festivities are killing me. god we had a good time though. i am touched because someone confided in me, something huge, on saturday night. he has a problem and needs help. this will be possibly be an emotionally charged one. i wish i could say more. but even though noone reads this but me, or cares for that matter, i can't seem to. i am scared of someone 'figuring out its me'. can you believe it. there's no way it could happen. i have so much in my head today. will try to take it easy and lay low. peace out
