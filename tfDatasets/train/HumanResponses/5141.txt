i just recently got in a serious argument with a supposed good friend. wtf seriously. how exactly would i justify being a feminist if i let a friend have someone walk all over them? i just don't get people sometimes, and she actually let him too, thats what pisses me off. all for love? bullshit dude, mabye an obssession to sex because in the end, it is all about the sex. but whatever, don't let me help or give advice. fucking dumbasses.
