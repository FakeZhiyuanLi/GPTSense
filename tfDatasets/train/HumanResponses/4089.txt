i was chatting with my good friend tanya today. i haven't spoken to her in quite some time. i've severely missed her and am so very glad that i got the chance to contact her. she said that the weather was like uber horrible and then five minutes later the sun popped out and the weather was goergous again just like that. she said she knew there had to be some kind of meaning because she then saw two rainbows and i immediately called. talk about coincidences. talk about aloha! lol!
