golf is the stupidest game ever to be invented. i wonder why i like to play it so much? i just finished playing a round with my dad. i made so many stupid mistakes i was about to cry. then i come home and i get a letter from the high school that says "golf team tryouts are on aug. 26. that's in two weeks and i'm still shooting in the low 50's. (for those of you who know golf the 50's are pretty bad. i don't know what i'm gonna do but i have to do something and i have to do it fast. in other more interesting news i start school on the 6th(i think). i'm really, really happy about this. not! i'm kinda angry right now .ok well at least i got to vent. that helped a little. sjd
