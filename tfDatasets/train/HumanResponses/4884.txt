i had to go to the dentist today. *shudders*. i hate having people play around with my teeth especially since i can't see what their doing! our car got assaulted by a tree branch today in the wegmans parking lot. i could have sworn i told my flagglets to protect the trailblazer with their little lives. hmmmm. maybe i need to pay them more for that kind of work.
