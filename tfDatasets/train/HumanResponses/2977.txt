well this is it. i've got to go travelling now. i've had 8 jabs, bought a rucsac and boots, plus i've started this weblog. my official leaving date is 17 september but i'm hoping to get gardening leave so i won't have to do much more work. don't know when that'll be, i've heard dates from the end of july to the middle of august. who knows?!
