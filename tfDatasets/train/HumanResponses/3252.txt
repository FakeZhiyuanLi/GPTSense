the real president, that is. president bill clinton. i'll be leaving the office in about 20 minutes to walk a couple blocks away and meet him. he's having a book signing for his new book and when i bought a copy last week i also got a ticket so i could attend the book signing. he's not my hero or anything, but he was about as real of a politician as we've seen in a while and i am a fan. plus, while i have had a couple of celebrity "brushes" in my life with some pretty big names, this will be my first time where i'll have the chance to speak to one.
