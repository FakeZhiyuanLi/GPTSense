beware, it appears that when making the posters for spider man 2 that there was a typo. in reality, the film is called spidermon 2, and is the newest digimon movie. don't be fooled by the bad spelling (or possibly clever marketing) its not what it seems. there is no spider man 2, its spidermon vs octupusmon, the digimon movie. well i haven't actually seen it but i heard it from a reliable source, i think. it could have just been the water cooler making noises, but you can trust me, right?
