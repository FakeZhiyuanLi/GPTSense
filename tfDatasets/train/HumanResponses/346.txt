i got an mp3 player a few days ago! it's a tiny rca lyra one with 190megs of space with my card in. i have 101 tracks of pure 'tones, blink, lostprophets, and other good shit. it's so small! anyway, school's out and i'm now officially a grade 8. for our last day of school we went to playland, the theme park place in vancouver. i got whiplash, sick and bruised, but it was fun. over and out.
