why : is life so complicated? won't he be my friend? did i do that? did i shoose him? didnt i say i still loved him? didnt i try harder? did i lead him on? did i have rebounds? is mum always right? is she with her? am i alone? can't it be normal? did it change? can't i get over him? did i carry on? isn't he here now? did i have to lose him? can't i just say what i feel? can't i tell her? do i like him? am i so frustrated? couldn't i wait? did i tell him? am i doing this? is he doing this? won't they help? aren't i that happy? won't the hurting stop? why must it go on? when will it stop?
