so i haven't blogged in while. not much has been going on. last weekend i went to west viginia with will's family for his family reunion. was sorta boring but okay. i am sure that i will not remember anyone that i met. just been hanging around the house. well i shall try to find more intersting subjects to write about soon. i promise.
