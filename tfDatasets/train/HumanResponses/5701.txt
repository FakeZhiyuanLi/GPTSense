ugh there's this problem that has been bothering me for a couple of days.about a week ago something happened to my friend and she had to go to the doctor, well two particular people whom shall remain un-named due to the dramatics that would follow if their names were released.any ways these two people started spreading these rumors about my friend, well not long the whole school had heard what was wrong.now the problem is, they don't ever talk to my friend and they don't need to be in her business if she wanted everybody and their mom to know she would've told them herself! god people are so narrow minded its so aggravating. ciao
