1. how does the increasing use of cameras affect privacy? it'll efect peoples privacy because they dont want a camera in the shower! thats crazy! and if we're telling some important plan for the world and its caught on tape they'll be so sued! 2. where do you think it is fair to have cameras installed? not fair? its fair cause criminals can be caught on the tape and its not fair because no one can have any privacy 3. what is your opinion on this subject? my opinion on the cameras is that its alright to have them but its not alright to have more than 1000 camera in one state! 4. if you feel that this is an invasion of privacy, how do you feel governments should help increase protection from the inclining terrorist threats? it is and if they have to do thatthan its alright! but just put in polite places. not like in bathrooms and bedrooms! they can put it in hotels and places like the mall and cafes!
