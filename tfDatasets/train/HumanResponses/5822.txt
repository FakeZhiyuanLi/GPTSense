there is one word that other people tell someone else but they don't mean it. you say it to the one you want to spend the rest of your life w/, some people say it so they can get w/ the other person there w/. some people take it seriously and think that person really wants to be w/ them, but they don't. i've heard it to many time and people don't mean it i'm tired of hearing it, so if you don't mean it don't tell it to someone. the word it love it hurts to watch it end and it's exciting to watch it begin.
