well it is really boring. i got so many channels in my tv and satellite and i don't care about any of the movies that are on. what a sick day. none of the movies i have ever heard of and the only thing that i stop at is the soccer channel with games that i saw about a million times already. why don't these hollywood buttheads tape their movies faster so that there is more good stuff to watch on tv. so the only thing i am doing apart from zapping right now is talking to some people from back over at the midwest and the person i am really waiting for aint coming on and i sure hope that that person will come on really quick. i know it is early but i am already really tired. watching tv and eating the whole day makes everyone really tired. but on the other hand i am on break, so i can sleep tommorrow :-) for now i am still hoping for that person to come online and then we will see!
