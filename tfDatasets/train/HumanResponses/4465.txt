man, i hate getting sick. i mean, it's hard enough for me to sleep during the night, having a headache and stuffed up nose doesn't help any. i'm gonna make love to the person that comes up with a cure for the common cold (considering it's a woman (considering she's hot)). does anyone know how i got sick during the summer anyway? that's never happend to me before, i dunno why. due to the fact that i stay up so late, i've started watching "hawaii 5-0". it's pretty badass, almost as badass as "matlock". i figure if i get a vacuum and put it in my nostrils, they will finally clear up. that would be badass.
