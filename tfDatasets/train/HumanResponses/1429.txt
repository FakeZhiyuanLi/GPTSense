this afternoon i am captain of the single's cruise at a local marina. i have been asked to sail around some local singles while they mingle. i get paid for it. it's about a five person boat, so i am not sure what the deal is. how many can they possibly fit? unless they are kinky and looking for a three or four-some, it doesn't seem like a practical way to meet people. not that i am anyone to judge. i just hope i don't get hit on. i will threaten to keel haul them if even one suggests he swab my poop deck. there is a guy who works on the deck down there who is perversely hot. he has skin that looks like leather, and when he once helped me out of the boat his hand felt like a monkey's, but he has this incredibly tanned thing going on. i don't want to get the first sexually transmitted melanoma, but as captain of the single's cruise, i should have certain rights.
