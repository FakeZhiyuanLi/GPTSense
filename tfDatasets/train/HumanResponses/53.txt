seriously, i'm tired of hearing arguments from people about whether a tomato is a fruit or a vegetable. i would like to settle this once and for all. a tomato is a vegetable because who would put a fruit on a hamburger? it would be like putting celery in a fruit salad. if anyone can back me up with any scientific proof that a tomato is a vegetable than please do. i think that somehow my argument would not hold up in court.
