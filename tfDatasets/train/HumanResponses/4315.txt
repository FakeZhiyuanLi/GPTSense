last night went well, if you know what i mean ;) 'nuff on that subject. have you ever wondered which of these is true? is it . absence makes the heart grow fonder. or is it . out of sight, out of mind. i hope it's the first where todd is concerned. we talk almost every weeknight, but still, we haven't seen each other since last july. i honestly thought we'd at least be engaged by now. i wish there was something i could do, but i know there's not. and i do admire him for wanting to get his problems straightened out before we start a life together. but still, don't you think it's a fine line between stubborn and stupid?
