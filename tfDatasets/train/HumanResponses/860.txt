well hello there! this is my first time with this and i tink that a lot of the stuff i'll write in here will be boring, but oh well. so well my sister got married yesterday and i'm so tired. this whole week i've been getting home like at 3 or 4 in the morning. its so dumb that i have beeen doing that. damn i knew that a wedding was a lot of work, but not as much as i did. it was way to much. even though i'm complaining aboot that the wedding was good. the service went by pretty fast. i had to sing that was soooo nasty. i had fun at the reception. i got to hang out with my buddy fez so that was pretty cool. well i better be going. i missed no doubt in concert cuz of the wedding.
