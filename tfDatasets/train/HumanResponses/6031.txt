why do things always have to be like this? just when things had started to get better, i go and totally fuck up and end up making things worse for everyone. last week i got talking to a girl (a friend of a friends friend), funny, random, and about as totally nuts as they come (which, don't get me wrong, isn't a bad thing). and even though i haven't actually met her, i think she's a great person. well anyway, last night when i was talking to her, she said something completely out of the blue that surprised me quite a lot, and i didn't quite know what to say. what i said was pretty stupid, and now she thinks that i don't feel the same way about her as she does about me. i wish there was something i could say to put all of this right, but i'm afraid that what i say will just make things worse.
