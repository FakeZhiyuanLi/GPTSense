i'm going to start off with a little about charlotte. unlike everybody else in our year she isn't gay. infact she's quite cool. she absolutly beautiful and has blossomed these last few years after being along with me the only 2 girls in our year who actually looked like boys. but now she is the most chased girl, and so makes the old clueless crew jelous. charlotte likes nick and has done for quite sometime.theyr'e made for eachother and even more he really like her too which makes it hard for her as she dosn't understand why he isn't with her. charlotte is the funniest and most stylish person i have ever met and isn't affraid to speak her mind. making her a fantastic person to be mates with yet if your a hainuss bitch that is jelous of her then you probably would'nt no why she's so cool. talking of bitches the next passage is about the mongs in our year.
