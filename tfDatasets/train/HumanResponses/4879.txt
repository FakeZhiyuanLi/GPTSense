but if you think you're free, try walking into a deli, and urinating on the cheese! i read that "normal" people are doing so much to themselves now that they are becoming punk. this was in reference to girls with blond streaks in their hair. that's not punk. maybe green, or purple or black or red streaks. but still, fashion is no indication of punkness. duh. girls with hair-streaks and tattoos and piercings are just that: girls. only when you talk to them can you determine what their social and political affiliations are. rg
