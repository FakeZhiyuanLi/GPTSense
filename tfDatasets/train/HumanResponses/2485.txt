i know i've been far from you recently, but i was just trying to find the truth out. i didn't succeed. my blog isn't going anywhere but i've realised that i do need you. may every word i ever speak to you be true and from my heart. i want to love you like other do. i feel nothing for you lord, but i really need you to be there. i am a nasty kid i know. i wish i could love you. i wish i could. please help me.
