well, scott and i have basically booked the major things for our trip. flights? check. tour? check. insurance? check. what we still have to do: pay everything off! book accommodation for when we arrive in london. and some other stuff too. but i am happy, as i was a little stressed out about the tour and not getting a place on it! but it's all worked out just fine. yay!
