i have come to realize that the food available in kuwait is much tastier than in dubai. the shwarmas are drier here as well as the pastries. i have been searching and searching for some good ol' cheese sambusas, but my search has been in vain. *sigh* how i'm craving the halloum sandwiches from the dahia co-op and the cheese sambusas from the 3delillah co-op in kuwait. talking about co-ops. they have set up some co-ops here in dubai. they have emulated every aspect of the kuwaiti co-ops. i was impressed. the one i frequent, doesn't sell magazines/nespapers. it felt like the kaifan co-op. although i think the reason behind not selling nespapers/magazines in the emirati one is due to some business motive rather than a conservative one.
