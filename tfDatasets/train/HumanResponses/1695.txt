today i had a bad experience with my friend.he think he's so good at joking and don't think of people's feeling's.i was so hurt.he juz took my things and i was feeling mad but i couldn't be angry.haiz if he continues like this i may have to breakup our friendship.its so harsh of me actually but since i know him since i was quite young i have no idea what to do.i think i will give him a chance and hope he will change for the better.thats all for today.6/7/2004
