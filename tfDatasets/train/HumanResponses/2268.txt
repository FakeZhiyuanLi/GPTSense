it's kind of interesting, that, when something happens to make you feel down, you can't really concentrate on anything that sits in the sunny side of your life. we love to be the unsinkable and unshakable. if you too are of the same kind then pause. read the next few lines slowly. "usually, anything along the lines of "it's my life, and i don't care what anyone else thinks!" is a warning that you're doing something stupid." sorry friends. i am also among these category. but a small difference (maybe true or not) i am cool in criticizing others. but, if someone dare to be a critic of mine; i will be down. am i stupid? . . yes . . no ok if yes or no you people answer i have happy. 'coz i am not coping to get criticized.
