mood : very sad weather : nice and sunny (happier than i am) well this is it. after some testing, and thinking, this is my blog v 0.9 almost done ;). my favorite anime got lisenced by funimation today, no more amazing subbed episodes for me. it's called fullmetal alchemist, and in short - its amazing. i wish there was somthing i could do, but i'm afraid there isn't. i don't have cable or satelite, so i probably won't be able to watch it when it comes on tv. it make me so angry. well that's the downlight for today.
