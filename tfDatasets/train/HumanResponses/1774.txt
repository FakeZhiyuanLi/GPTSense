when you tried to kiss me i only bit your tongue. when you tried to get me together i only came undone. when you tried to tell me the one for me was you, i was in your mattress back in 1982. daria, i won't be soothed. daria, i won't be soothed over like, smoothed over like milk, silk, a bedspread, or a quilt, icing on a cake, or a serene translucent lake. daria, daria, daria, i won't be soothed. i won't be soothed. when you tried to tell me of all the love you had, i was cleaning oil from beaches seeing only what was bad. when you tried to feed me i only shut my mouth. food got on your apron and you told me to get out. daria, i won't be soothed. daria, i won't be soothed over like, smoothed over like milk, silk, a bedspread, or a quilt, icing on a cake, or a serene translucent lake. daria, daria, daria, daria, daria, daria, daria, i won't be soothed. i won't be soothed.
