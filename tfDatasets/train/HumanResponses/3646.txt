hi again, today i went to the library. i go to the library about once every 2 months which isnt very often, but when i do go whell lets just say my bag is a lot fuller than when i went in. for example i got about 3 large books on php/mysql for my student to which i am teaching programming. also i got a very large book on linux which i have always been interested in but never really got enthused into. so pretty much i just had the most boring day in history. but tommorow may be a little more interesting but that reamins to be seen so until tommorow its dinner time and i'm not one to waste food :d.
