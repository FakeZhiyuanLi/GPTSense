tomorrow i start college algebra, i'm nervous about starting this class. college algebra has been my achilles heel for years. i don't understand algebra, i don't know why i hate it so much i just do. i can do statistics perfectly, but do ask me about algebra. i know i'll get through the class with a good grade, i'm just concerned because graduation depens on this class.
