dan's dog will play a huge part in [secret snowfall], of which the storyline i've only recently come up with. i think his dog's a siberian husky, or is it an alaskan malamute? i'm not sure. that probably means, i'm going to have to check it out. along with the name. darn it, i can't remember a thing about his dog! don't get me wrong - i totally love dogs. it's just, i've only come across that information once. i know i should've taken that data down! okay, it's like this: the dog goes missing, the girl finds it, she brings it back, in the process meeting dan. there, simple. ciao!
