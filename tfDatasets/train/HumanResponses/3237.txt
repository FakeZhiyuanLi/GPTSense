if only people realized how little they actually need to do to make the world a better place then people wouldnt have such a hard time doing it and really if people only understood that theres no shame in caring for the world then people wouldnt be afraid to do it and if people realized that what they do to the world will eventually come back to haunt them, well maybe not them but their children or their childrens children, they would actually want to care about the world so spread the word to help clean up the earth and over time you'll see a difference.
