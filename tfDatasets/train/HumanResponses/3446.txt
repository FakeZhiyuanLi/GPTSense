after my lunch at the lucky spot cafe (on north audley, just off oxford street - has the nicest waitress in the world), dorothy and i wandered to my favourite place - selfridges' foodhall. after staring at a chocolate eclair for about ten minutes dorothy made me buy it, saying life is too short to let good cakes pass us buy. i bought said eclair and they wrapped it in a lovely white box. am i the only one who thinks that cakes in boxes are the most wonderful things ever? the elegance of the box makes the difference. the office was obviously jealous. i am now obviously fat.
