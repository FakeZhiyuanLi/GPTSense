i'm soo wired and cornfuzed. one min. i'm fine and the next min. i start remembering. i love the memories, but sumtimes i wish i had never ended it. y the hell did i end it?! oh, i remember y. it's all my fault. those precious memories came after and not during. i guess i couldn't control it. i hope i'm not the only one feeling this way. actually i hope the other end of this knot is as determined as i am to untie it and start all over again. i wish it could all be real. i wish i could still live with it. but 4 now, all i have are my memories
