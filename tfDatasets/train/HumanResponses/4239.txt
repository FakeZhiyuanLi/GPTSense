i don't know if anyone likes football too much, but i just had to comment on the new york jets. they basically demolished the colts today, and if everyone stays healthy, i predict a division title, or at least a wild card. the exiting jets are a site for my sore eyes, seeing as though the ny mets (baseball) have been horrendous. go jets! okey dokey there's my "i'm exited about the new season" rant.
