i saw my ex-fiance a couple of days ago. it wasn't really by choice but she was at my friends birthday get together (thats what happens when u're best friends is the sister of your ex-fiance and the other is the fiance of your ex-fiance's sister). didn't really care much if she was or wasn't there but it did make me feel sad if not more. not sad because i miss her or that i want her back but sad because i felt abandoned. abandoned by not only my ex-fiance but by my other relationships that i have really cared about, especially from my last one (after my ex-fiance). i think that last one is having more of a lasting impression on me because i think i haven't completely healed from the damage from the last one (my ex-fiance).
