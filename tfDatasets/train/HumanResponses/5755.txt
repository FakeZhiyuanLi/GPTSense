sundays are the bastards of the week. people like them on friday but hate them on saturday. on a friday, you know that you don't have to go to work tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, but on saturday, when you get up at 12 noon with a headache because of too many bloody maries yesterday, you are thinking 'oh no!', only one more day of cessation of chores, after which, it's back to the grinding mill! heeeeeeelp
