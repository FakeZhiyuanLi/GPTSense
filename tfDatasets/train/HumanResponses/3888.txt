i don't think anything else can be as sick as "monday morning". it is only at this hour that i keep imagining of rushing countrysides, lazy afternoons, or reading a book, or travelling for that matter. well, i can think of anything other than office. i think everything else looks better. but the point is, if i feel bad on a monday morning, it means that i've had a fantastic weekend. and i am looking forward for more.
