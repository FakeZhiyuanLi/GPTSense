well i am happy yet for some reason there is still a sadness inside me burning terribly from some where deep inside my heart. i was so upset when i was told what was going on and all i could think of was being there. i know what it feels like to go through these things alone and i know i didn't want to but i had to. well i just don't know sights for sore eyes and all that but i still feel very sad
