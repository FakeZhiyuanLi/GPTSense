the beach was too perfect for words. i really had such a great time. every minute i spend with lisa is awesome. i really appreciate her letting me come. i couldn't stop smiling the entire time. what a perfect weekend. four weeks left of summer.not nearly enough. maybe even three. i don't know, i don't count. but i know once school starts, i'll be missing lisa so much and getting down again. for once, i can honestly say i still do not want to go back to school. usually durig summer by this time, i actually have a want to sort of go back. not this year.
