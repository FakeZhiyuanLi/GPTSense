ok, so i come home from school and i go downstairs to see what bill is up to. on my way down the stairs i miss a step and flip all the way down the whole freakin' flight of stairs and roll into the shelf, and if that wasn't bad enough the god damn shelf tips over and falls on top of me. painful as hell, hurt like a mother. well that is what has happened today on this horribly exciting afternoon. if anything else happens i'll post it on here because i'm a loser that has no life. i have no girl friend, all the sports i play are done for the summer, my life is super boring, i have no friends (i'm kidding i do have friends), and to top it all off i sit here at my computer posting messages nobody will ever read. i really need some hobbies.
