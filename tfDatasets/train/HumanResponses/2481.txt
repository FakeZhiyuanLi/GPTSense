did you ever have one of those days when you just know everything is going to suck, and no matter what way you look at it it still sucks.and then for some crazy reason it turns out exceptionalty well? well i did today.we had two subs! and a feild trip!and a movie! and also one of the subs was for casford yay but the math class still smelled badand the movie was stupid, in a funny way it was really poor quality with bad actors trying to be dramatic and serious but they werent and i laughed.then after lunch we went to the legislature and that was a little boring because they took 20 minutes to great us (erlack!) and then talked about 3 cents of gas.it would have bean better if they talked about education seing how there were two schools there and no one watching could drive or needed gas but thats just me.it was also creepy how the waitresses had to bow before they came in. than i had a shower with my sandals on and wrote this and that was my day.wa friken hoo
