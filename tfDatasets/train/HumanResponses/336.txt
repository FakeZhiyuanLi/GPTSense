nuthin' to write about. just typing for fun. downloaded a couple of songs from the itunes music store. trying to be the 100,000,000 download (yeah, like that will happen). anyway. also started to listen to jem's "they." downloaded a couple of weeks ago (was a free download highlight thing) it is actually kind of catchy. gonna be a long weekend, thank the goddess. 3 days of doing nuthin' sounds fun. found myself singing along to que sera sera. it was wafting from my roommate's room. very odd.
