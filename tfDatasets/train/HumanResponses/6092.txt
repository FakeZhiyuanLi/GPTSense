aaaah. hot and sour soup. sawap! always been my favorite. first time i "discovered" i like this stuff was way years back. i was sick then. my wife prepared me a knorr hot and sour soup with toasted bread. i think it was some kind of garlic bread. it was the best! parang yun yata ang nagpagaling sa akin e. fast forward to now and to another place. still my favorite here in arizona. wala nga lang yung bread. buti may soup. the best time to eat soup is when it not so hot and definitely not cold. syempre! but here's the thing, when you eat it so fast so that you won't lose the warmth, you lose the chance to appreciate it. when you slow down and savor every spoon, you might lose the warmth and it becomes cold. so you really have to find the right balance to enjoy. hmmm, pretty cool analogy huh?
