yes, i am talking about the ad that comes on msn messenger, what made creators of msn romace think the "will you marry me?" label on msn messenger with some slutty image attract people to "msn romance",going to msn romance with the intentions of marrying someone.thats the last thing one would do, the ad would have been better for some porno site with some change in the label text :-).
