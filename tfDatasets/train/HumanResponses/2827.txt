man.i have a friend named jason.and he was homeless but not anymore.he got an apartment but he has to pay so much for it that he barely has any money left over.so i always try helping him out ya know but i always get this feeling that im bugging him and that he doesnt want me there.i went and talked to him about it and he was like no, no,no thats not it at all.just sometimes little things bother me.maybe hes still mad because i didnt have sex with him.maybe i should.i really, really like him.i dont know what i should do.im home all alone right now on a friday night typing on a stupid computer about my stupid fucking life i dont even have.just great, great, great.
