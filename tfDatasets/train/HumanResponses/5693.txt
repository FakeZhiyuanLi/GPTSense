when the tampa bay lightening won the stanley cup i was so excited! me and my friend stephanie were talking on the commericals about the game and we were complaining about how many commericials there were! and every time we scored a goal we kept going on about it and at the end we were soooo excited for the bolts. stephanie said that brad richards (the mvp)was so "sexay" (her words exactly). haha
