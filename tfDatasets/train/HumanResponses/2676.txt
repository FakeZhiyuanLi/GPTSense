damn kids are outside throwing rocks and those little poppy things. im going to shove a firework in their schphincters if they interrupt my sonic game one more time. on a lighter note, i would like to point out that the comments on blogspot, unlike such shitbox sites as xanga and livejournal, are open to anyone. so if you feel the need to write naughty stuff, go ahead because anybody can regardless of whether you are a member of the site. owwww
