i see you most different, than some people do. i stare at the stars, then i look at you. i see a twinkle, in you beautiful eyes. i sit there staring, i'm hypnotized. i then start dreaming, of what could be. i see true love, i see you and me. our love is strong, can't you see. i was meant for you, you were meant for me. -troy
