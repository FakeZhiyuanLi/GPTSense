never seen a blue sky yeah i can feel it reaching out and moving closer there's something about blue asked myself what it's all for you know the funny thing about it i couldn't answer no i couldn't answer things have turned a deeper shade of blue and images that might be real may be illusion keep flashing off and on free wanna be free gonna be free and move among the stars you know they really aren't so far feels so free gotta know free please don't wake me from the dream it's really everything it seemed i'm so free no black and white in the blue everything is clearer now life is just a dream you know that's never ending i'm ascending
