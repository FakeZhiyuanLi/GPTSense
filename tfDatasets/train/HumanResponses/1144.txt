so i sit here in the dark… you made the rules…i played the part. i never pushed or rushed my fate. when times were tight, i knew to wait. with tangled strings i learned to dance. i bid my time and took my chance. now in the dark i lie awake and watch you drive in deep your stake. in the dark it all unwinds. i pray for change…for better times. and in my thoughts i sit and dwell. my past is gone…tomorrow’s hell. and all the things you never heard while in my mind, i searched for words. now time is lost…the curtain fell… i bid goodnight…and wish you well. learning how to survive in the dark is the hardest challenge in anyone’s life. this is my way of dealing with my fears; learning how to endure the dark.
