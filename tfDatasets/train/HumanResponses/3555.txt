so far august sucks pretty bad for me. it's my own damn fault, i brought this sh** on myself. september is not looking too good either. work was great tonight. i love doing home health. some of the families are so great. if i have to work, i choose there. i guess since my husband slept on the couch last night, it's going to be my turn tonight. never will i ever get married again. ever. they say 'never say never' but i'm saying never. sometimes i feel like the only person in the world. the effexor isn't working.
