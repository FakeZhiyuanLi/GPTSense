well today my mom told me that is shouldnt be writing what i do on the internet but i dont care what she thinks? do you care what your mom thinks? she said that people sit on the internet all day just tring to figure out who we(bloggers)are.i thought to my self that this lady is losing her mind. but she is my mom and i have to do what she says.not! i aint listening to her until i get my birthday gift. my dads house is looking alot better to me after putting up with my mom for the past 9 years. i should have lived with him every since they separated.
