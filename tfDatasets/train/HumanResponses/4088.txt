i finished school on tuesday, and it's me birthday tomorrow kya! i'm so happy. i can't wait to see what my dad has planned for me, and what i'm getting. i'm really excited, i'll be turning sixteen. my brother played a birthday song he wrote for me tonight, it was really nice of him. he's a great guitarist and songwriter, by the way, i can tell he's gonna be a great and famous musician someday. not much else to write about, except to let you all know that miranda is getting her restricted driver's license tomorrow! congratulations, miranda! i'm still talking with god about leaving early for my dragon hunting journey, though i'm not sure if i told you guys about that. as is, i'll just prepare, get stronger, and live for the lord as much as i can. signing off. ~pabo
