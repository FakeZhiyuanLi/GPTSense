ok so here i am in a historical part of the ol usa valley forge. you know i should have learned more about this when i was in school. i didn't. why? becuase i was a stupid kid much like the morons that parade around me now. they have no care for the history of this place. i don't really blame them too much. they are young. the young can't understand things that happened to other people yet. they are still way too stuck on themseleves. kristine, my girlfriend, is near her home town as well this weekend. she went on some cave tour and appearently she deems me more knowledgable than the tour guide. while its granted i know more than a masters and less than a phd on the subject of geology i am not perfect yet. who knows perhaps i will some day learn all i like on many many subjects. have a good memorial day and remember those who fought and die or served in service of our country.
