this is my first time writting a blog. the blogs i write here will mainly focus on the problems i see at work (and am trying to fix) and the good things i see at work that i want to write about for future reference. i don't have any expectations for this blog besides personal use (i have a bad memory, so writting my thoughts down helps me remember them later). however, if i write an astoundingly good blog, i might rewrite it as an article and submit it to a web site or magazine. who knows?
