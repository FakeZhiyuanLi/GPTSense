there’s something about rain pattering on the window. all night i lay in my warm bed, duvet wrapped round me listening to the sound of the rain outside, hitting the pavement, dripping off the window ledges and gutters. it’s been lashing it down, saturating the whole world while i stay dry and warm. nothing in the world like it. it’s such a safe feeling.
