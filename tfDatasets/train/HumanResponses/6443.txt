im so happy right now. i cant wait for tomorrow night. everything seems to be working out heaps good. im really happy with chips, an even david has come to accept that im going to be with him. all he wants now is that im happy. chips was worried about david being angry, an i dont want them to ever meet, but i think if i get hurt now, david would be so pissed off. i dont think i will get hurt though. but im really scared of hurting someone with all of this. it just feels too good to be true, so i'll make the most of it while its here. i dyed my hair, an it looks retarded. its too red, lisa i dont like it. :( oh well i guess ill get used to it. mum didnt buy me alcohol :( i think i'll just have to take something out of the cupboard lol they wont even notice but i'll tell them, just in case. any hoo im going to bed, got a big night tomorrow ;) bye
