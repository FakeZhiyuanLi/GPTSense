leaves and lives a lonely leaf makes its way across the concrete driveway. leftover from fall, it was not carried by the winter winds. now it makes a journey with the fresh, new spring. who knows where it will be led to with these winds: if it will be dumped somewhere to disintegrate, or if it will continue to be blown until the day. we are each a leaf during our life. we bud out, and eventually break away from the foundation which formed us. from that point on, we are our own. we can fall to the ground and decay, or we can go with the wind and never stop.
