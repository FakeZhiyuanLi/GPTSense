i personally don't have problems being friends w/anyone from any other schools, but when i tell people from my school that i have friends @ s.v. they flip out and say they hate them cuz they beat us at sports.and i'm like, uh.that's a stupid reason to hate them. and one kid told me people from s.v. are a bunch of crack-heads, but i honestly hope/don't think that any of you are that way! but. you know lol i'm just less biased than other people i guess.w/e this summer.i'm working.and going to campraise like i have every year for the past 8 years. :) nothing too greatly exciting. oh, i'm getting my license too! that's exciting!
