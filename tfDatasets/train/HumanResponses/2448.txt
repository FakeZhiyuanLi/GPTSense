apparently if everyone else jumped off a bridge, i would too. i was innocently poking through "more" section of google and clicked on the blogger link. suddenly they wanted me to create a blog. i figured "hey, everyone seems to be getting blogs, so i guess i should have one" and jumped on the bandwagon. i hope you're not upset, mom, you really did teach me not to give in to peer pressure.
