in the lead up to the trip, i am starting to get a little stressed out about stuff. like: what if i am rejected for a visa? what if there are no places left on the contiki tour we want to go on? what if we can't get accommodation in london? what if we don't get jobs over there? arrrrrrgggghh! stress!
