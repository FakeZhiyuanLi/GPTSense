i came across this on a forum i frequented i hate the way you talk to me and the way you cut your hair. i hate the way you drive my car. i hate it when you stare. i hate your big, dumb combat boots. and the way you read my mind. i hate you so much it makes me sick – it even makes me rhyme. i hate the way you’re always right. i hate it when you lie. i hate it when you make me laugh – even worse when you make me cry. i hate it that you’re not around. and the fact that you didn’t call. but mostly i hate the way i don’t hate you not even close, not even a little bit, not any at all. yes, it's from "10 things i hate about you" kinda made me smile, and reminisce. but things has been set in motion that couldn't be taken back. everything is so surreal now, it's like i'm living a day-to-day existence. this is the best recourse, the best option. when would i find a unicorn to call my own?
