i got down to thinking, its such a waste to spend six dollars on a grande size mocha frap at starbucks! its an absolute rip off! so anyway, here is a recipe for one. take a blender, add in -2 heaped tablespoons full of milo -1 heaped table spoon of cadbury hot chocolate powder -1/2 tablespoon boncafe mocca coffee powder -1 near full cup of hl milk or any full cream or skim milk, your preference. -1/2 tablespoon condense milk (you can adjust as you try) -12-14 cubes of ice (remember to wash the ice cubes first to remove any fishy, meaty smell that the ice takes on from storage in your fridge) blend until smooth, taste, and adjust taste as required. enjoy this simple drink! ^^ adieu!
