my husband just doesn't get why i am on here again. he needs a hobby that is for sure. other than doing the laundry i mean. i have never in my life seen someone so obessed with laundry. it has to be washed. it can be piled up in the laundry room all clean but it has to be clean. i think it would be fine if he put the stinking ( not anymore ) stuff away. he just sits and watches me. drives me batty.
