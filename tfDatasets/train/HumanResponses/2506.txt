it's time to blog, i feel good, but tired tonight, the silence is blissful husband to wife land, so that is super and life goes on i think i got lots done tonight which will in turn help to ease the pressure, but there is always more there, so i don't just look at all of it with dread now as some things are crossed off. i had a nice day with kobi today, not too stressful, she is always so beautifully behaved when he is not around. well, time for a cuppa and a smoke and i am off for a early night. goodnight fellow bloggers. d
