kids got away ok, so now i'm here alone. very quiet. i used to get this peace every weekend, but this is the first time i have been alone in the last 5 months, since the kids stopped seeing their dad. it's very quiet. i have a friend who might come over for the day on thursday. i'm pretty sure he's only coming for sex. which suits me - might be another five months before i get the house to myself again.
