seems that a lot of our friends have left town on vacation. some went to mexico, some went to montana, some are in houston, and others are on a road trip south. we are still here counting pennies, and holding down the fort i guess. it is really quiet all the sudden though. the phone isn't ringing as much, and we find ourselves wondering what to do with our time. this weekend will be a quiet one too. which is quite alright with me! next weekend will be very busy on the other hand, so i guess i should enjoy it while it lasts. and, maybe i could catch up on some projects around the house, or friends i havn't connected with in a while. i have also decided that this blog needs more pictures. the one in this post is of a summer sky near my home. looking down the avenue toward lake superior.
