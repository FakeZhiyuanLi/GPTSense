have now been at home for nearly a week, and i am still operating in a kind of stupefied state. i think i might be having trouble adapting to english humidity. however a purely psychological explanation would also be in order. the weight of the past crushes me whenever i return home, all the little forgotten things, habits most of all. all my attempts to invent myself as a new person abroad get folded back onto the old me as a meagre layer of sediment. saw my old friend m. his impulsive dismissive nature was not very helpful. he went someway to reminding me just how fragile my sense of self is, how the smallest comment can shatter my self-esteem. everything feels tainted, exhausted, unbearable. i am restless, incapable of focus/clarity and relate to the future only with apprehension. am i getting depressed?
