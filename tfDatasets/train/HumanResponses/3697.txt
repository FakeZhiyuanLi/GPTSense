well after two days of playing i have found that still enjoy the game but there are some people i don't enjoy playing with. i know some great players people who know the classes and skills of those classes. and others well don't. one of my players seems to think that her characters are always a teenagers. no matter how much direction you give her or background you ask for they are just lost. i think i will always play but i don't think i want to play with her anymore. i hope she lives long and plays. somewhere else angie
