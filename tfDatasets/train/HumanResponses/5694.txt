yesterday me and my friend chrissy talked about going to busch gardens! i might be going with her and her friend winn! i hope i can go because i want to ride roller coasters! (wow i just sounded like jamie) ive only been on 3 roller coasters that liked montu, kumba, and gwazi and when we went to busch gardens in march with my school i was forced to go on a roller coaster (i was terrified of them at the time) and i loved it! (all thanks to jamie who forced me) and after that we went on montu, kumba, and gwazi all twice! the 2nd time on gwazi we got to duel so that was cool. so now i like roller coasters all thanks to my friends pushing me on them at busch gardens! haha
