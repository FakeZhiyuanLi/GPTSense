i am so grateful hurricane charley went west - not grateful for the devastation it left behind in punta gorda. i moved to south florida in feb-00. we have yet to have a busy hurricane season, and have not had any close calls, that is until charley. for close to 6 hours we didn't know if he was going to go west, nwest or east. he was a little erratic for a whilealmost like a drunk you watch trying to find their way to the bathroom in a crowded bar. i know i will encounter a hurricane sooner or later. it's the nature of the beast down here in miami. i'm just hoping it's much later than sooner. chow
