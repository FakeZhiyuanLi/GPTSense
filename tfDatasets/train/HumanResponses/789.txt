(this isn't really a poem but still read it) life can be hard but it is also sweet. when you think of life it seems so far away, and you feel your on delay. don't even think your life is right for you? well your wrong. god gave us our lives for a purpose. no doubt about that. maybe you can't find love. god knows why you wonder. maybe you can't have a child. god must want you to adopt. that will be whats best. maybe your struggling with buying a car or a house. god has a different plan you, and you have to stick to what he wants you. well life is what life is. and you you can't turn away. if you turn away from life you will never get anything acompished.
