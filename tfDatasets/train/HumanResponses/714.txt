well this is how my day went so far i woke up took a shower got dressed when to see how everything was was it still the same or did it all change. my thoughts were correct when all this mess was scatterd here and there. no longer was this room mine. i cant seem to figure out waht to do with my life but to sit and wait till this pain someday ends. i am the person who tries to be nice to evveryone polite and kind and helpful and over all i want to be a nice guy to everyone but for some reason pay back for being so nice is me getting hurt. i lose my mom how hard is that super hard im still not fully over the fact that shes gone and never will be. i lose my family im alone im forced to lose the gurl that i like. forced to say goodbye and hope that shes gunna be allright. life so complicated the hardships just keep comming faster then ever i sure hope this will someday end and i will be happy once again. lata -troy
