ok, so i went to bed at 4.48 a.m. yes, very late. but it's not my fault! the medicine makes me sleep earlier and then i wake up and voila, its that time. so i didn't go to school all week. oh well, and i should be studying for exams, but if i sit in a chair, i just feel like fainting. oh, and my mother is a bitch. my computer isn't working and she refuses to call dell up to fix the problem! ugh! meanwhile, when i eventually fall asleep, all i can dream about is my damn biology exam. maybe it's telling me that i should actually study. who knows!?
