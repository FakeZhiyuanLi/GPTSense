i seem to have a bit to say today. the jumbling in my brain is still an issue. might as well type it out. i wonder how much work is too much. i gave away to my receptionist a few of the duties i had before, because the scheduling/tracking portion of my job was taking up more time. today, i get another task. what was the point of getting rid of some if they keep giving me more? burn out is inevitable.
