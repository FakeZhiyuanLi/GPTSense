argh got "jumped" (oh how i hate that word). rather large group of neds came swarming out of there little holes as we were going past. mainly little fuck bitch girls. they followed us halfway down the street, then started beating up my friend's girlfriend. i mean, how can you do that? meanwhile my friend just stood there trying to think what to do.(we kinda have this thing about hitting girls.) i couldn't just do nothing, threw some of them off so maxine and ferg could run. then along came the boyfriends, armed with, guess what.their own shoes. another one of my friends, (who happened to be carrying a baseball bat)turned round and they ran like hell. not the nicest night ever. i'm kinda ok, cut just below my eye, probably some bruises on my face, but i'm ok.
