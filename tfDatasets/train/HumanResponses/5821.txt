their are so many places to go to college. i thought u wanted to go to a college called cotty in neveda missouri. i got the info. from my neighbor martha, she was needing help to move one day so i decided to come and help her move. she asked me where i wanted to go to college i told her about my swimming and my cousins how i want ed to be near them she told me that there is a college named cotty in neveda missouri.(which is where my cousins live) i thought about it and told my mother and she told me that is where she went to school at. she told mew it more of a prep school kind and it was a girls only school, so i told her no thanks. a few months later i found out about a school in texas that has a great swimming program.
