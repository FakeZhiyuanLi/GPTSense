o' lady! reveal not your bosom and prove, you are beautiful to some let it talk for itself i will judge myself. a flower naturally says its fragrance and nothing causes it a hindrance let me not see bright red marks on your forehead, like hungry sharks to prove your matrimony and disrupt my harmony let your eyes speak that language and give me the freedom to gauge have i caged you, with your freedom? and makes you writhe in boredom from your mind, speak out but carefully murmur not by time i am getting older does that make you bolder? allow me to feel still i repeat, do not reveal.
