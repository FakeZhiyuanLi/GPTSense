so i'm sitting here, mocha in hand, wondering why i wrote that pt.1 of 2 story in my previous entry. i started off just letting my mind work it's magic to see what i would come up with. i didn't even know what the story would be about, i just wanted to write. i think i'm pretty satisfied with how it turned out, yet i didn't mean it to be so long. and now i'll have to do a follow-up, which is fine because writing is something i love to do. so is that little mind flowing exercise. but i'm not sure when i'll follow it up. i forgot how much i like poe.
