even pilz-e doesn't have this much shit running through his mind. when i just sit in one spot i get soooooo many ideas for the dumbest, and most genius comics. but i only tend to choose 1/5th of the ideas. i hate that, i want to do them all. but i keep forgetting that i always have my little note book with me. so. i'm gonna put a wallet chain on it! and add little machine that will be wired to my brain, when i get an idea, it shocks me! then i write it down before it shocks me again. smart huh?. when you sleep deprived i notice you think about "things" alot more then your use to. i mean, i made a comic on why de-caff coffee shouldb't exsist. that means i need sleep! ttyl peeps
