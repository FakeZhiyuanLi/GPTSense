i knew it, maddy was aware of the fact that we will be chucked out of class. reason simple, we were not in coll uniform. i can uderstand the problem with school teachers but then we are in coll netra made some rules with bhama today they are as follows: rule 1: every one in proper uniform rule 2: one class missed means attendance of the day gone (this one sucks) rule 3: no one keeps funky beards.whatever (i think aman needs to shave of his so called funky gotti) these, i mean all of them really suck but then rules are meant to be broken
