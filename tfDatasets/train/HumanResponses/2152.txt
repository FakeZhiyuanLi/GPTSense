awesome finish. 6 of the top 7 gc riders are usp, outstanding. they are going to have a tough decision, because even it they don't want to defend the jersey, it may work out that way, just to keep his main rivals behind him. if some purely sprinter riders take it away, they won't sweat it much, but look to him to stay in yellow if it suits their strategy of holding off the real mountain threats.
