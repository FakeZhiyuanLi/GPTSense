this saturday my mom and stepdad are going camping, so i will be home by myself which is good because i am grounded so i am going to have will come over. my mom has not yet told me how long i am grounded for but i am not going to bug her about it cause she will get mad at me and it might turn into a longer time. i have not seen will in 4 days now and i miss him. all i hope is that my brother chris dose not tell on me cause he will be home this weekend to. well i have to get back to work now. till next time whenever that is.
