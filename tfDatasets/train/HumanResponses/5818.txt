when i was a child i didn't really have many friends i was short, not that smart, shy, and didn't know anybody, or i didn't try to know anyone. i had a babysitter that i would call my best friend cause she was like a nanny to me she stayed with us and would comfort me when i was sad and hurt. my sisters where not really people that i wanted to look up to cause my sister shannon would scare me and my sister wendy was to busy with all her friends and boyfriends. when my babysitters boyfriend would come over in the morning we would go to mcdonalds. when my babysitter had to leave i didn't know what to do. i had no friends and i felt like no one wanted me there. i just had no friends until i hit 3rd grade. her name was krista talley and i will never forget her in my life.
