in my book today, i read about how the girls in the different sororities had to choose which fraternity house they were going to be running with for "greek week." of course it had to be the house with the most coolest and most cutest guys in it. i mean they couldn't risk not winning greek week. or even fathom going to the homecoming dance with any guy that is less than perfect. i definatly think i will take a second look at the sororitiy house i want to be in when the time comes. whoa! too much drama for me to deal with.
