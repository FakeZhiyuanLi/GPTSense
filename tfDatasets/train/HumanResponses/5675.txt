i have insomnia. it sucks. send me money so that i may buy pills to stop my insomnia. if you help me i will thank you very much, but thats about it since i'm broke. if you are an insomniac comment and tell me why you hate it so much. after a while my posting will decrease after my schoolwork starts to increase. remember kids: school blows. there isn't anything you can learn in school that you can't learn on the street. just look at albert einstein. he grew up a poor german boy. then he failed math, science, couldn't tie his own shoes. maybe i should have picked a better example. but you have to admit, that guy was a fucking genius.
