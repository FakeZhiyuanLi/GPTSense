im still a minor which means that when i get hired anywhere that i have to get a new work permit. i dont see why i have to since i will be working for my school. i woke up this morning and had 2 pepperoni pizza pockets. one before i let out the chickens and one after i got back in the house. it was a mess when we went to my school. my coordinator told us that the permit would be all filled out and that all we had to do is take it to my doctor and then back to the school and we'd be done with it. but it turned out that it wasnt even close to being filled out so we took it to my doctors and we have to take it back to the school tomarrow morning. after my doctors visit i got an oreo cookie ice cream from the store and ate it as my under 250 calorie snack. then i talked with my dad and ate 2 hot dogs for dinner. i ended up eating a reeses cup and some chips and dip after that. i hope that i start exercising soon so that my clothes will start to fit again.
