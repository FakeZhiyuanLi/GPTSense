so, yeah. i know that you all are really getting tired of listening to me complain about all of my aches and pains  but i am so sore! muscles that i didn't even know existed are screaming at me. i keep lifting up my shirt and examining my stomach. after that workout you would think that i have abs of steel. but no. same squishy soft tummy. great pic, huh? i have no idea what i was shocked by at that particular moment, i just remember being astounded at what i saw. it may have been the tiny, cute little girl from the press all dolled up in tommy jeans and dirt free shirt emerging from a tunnel with immaculate hair. i was such a mess, i think that i am still scraping clay out of my skin. this picture was taken somewhere around five minutes into the tour. i'll have to get one of the aftermath. oh, the horror!
