abe and i have long bemoaned the fact that churches (and christians in general) tend to worship the money god over the true god. in churches we have both worked for in the past, it was common for the first question about any activity to be "how much does it cost?" rather than "is this what god wants us to do?" i wonder why we christians can't get it through our thick heads that money just really doesn't matter? we should just be focused upon pleasing god and accomplishing his will. he will handle the details. makes me mad.
