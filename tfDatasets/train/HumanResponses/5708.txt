this has been such an uneventful day. i'm not even going to bother updating this tonight. but since i'm here today's main event was changing my duvet cover. that was the first problem, duvet covers are luggage, all you need is a duvet. same goes for pillows. i spent the rest of the day playing "low" by foo fighters on the guitar. i'm not very good. jeepers creepers was crap last night, not very impressive. i didn't watch all of it, but that little bit i did see was enough. blues brothers, theres a good film. at least jeepers creepers was followed by "borats television programme" which was sheer entertainment. that's pretty much it for tonight, i'll finish by saying reading buses to purley are shite. infact, reading buses are shite full stop. stay together for the kids!
