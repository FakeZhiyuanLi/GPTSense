okay, i'm sure everyone has picked up on this. a network such as, oh, we'll say.almost all of them.has an award show that nobody really cares about. for example, the recent g-phoria on g4techtv, the mtv movie/video/ego-trip awards, the tv land gives trophies to people in walkers who were on one episode of 'leave it to beaver' in 1962 and can now barely talk awards, and so forth. so these are fun, sure, but do they really need to repeat them like 150 times within the next month and a half? the answer is no. my compliments to espn for limiting the broadcast of espy awards to only a few repeats.
