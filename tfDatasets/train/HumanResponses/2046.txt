when we went to the aquarium, we had a tour and explored about the many fish of the deep blue sea. we looked at an electric eel, red snapper, nurse shark, and had a chance to touch a stingray! after we completed the tour, we hopped on a train and did some more research on shark. we went inside a tunnel thatcontained 7 tons of water held up only by 5 inches of thick glass! we seen several different types of sharks. i learned about so many fish and what may happen if you weren't careful with certain fish. when we went there, we weren't able to ride anything, i would like it if we could have did something to enjoy. maybe they can go to a kind of zoo where they can feed the animals. they can see how they are bred and mantained.
