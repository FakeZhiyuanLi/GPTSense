well, its been a few days, but i'm back. we've been rehearsing at the centre for two nights now, and both of those nights i have wanted to just kick a certain someone. any guesses on who that someone is? but, i have a new entrance in "paris original." its hot. so i saw the notebook. was it good? yes. did i cry? of course. i still really wanna see fahrenheit 9/11, tho. today was white trash/redneck day. i didn't partake, but megan l. and tyler for sure did. wow. so excited for attitude t day tomorrow. and 80's day on friday. can't wait!
