well, i seem to be able to open a zoo if it goes on like this. the mouse is still there and i just dicovered a big and too small wasps' nests in the garage of my car. this is not funny anymore. i like animals but not those and not in these places. apart from that we have tons of lice on the plants in the garden. this is all so. not nice.
