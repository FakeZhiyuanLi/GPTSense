hey everybody. it's almost 9 here on sunday night. i feel like my mind is in a haze.i can't seem to motivate myself out of it, and that troubles me. i mean, there are so many things i can, or should , be doing right now (writing, schoolwork, reading, watching dubcheck's place, going out with frank). i dunno. i mean, sometime it feels like i'm perpetually half-asleep, and the only reason i get anything done is because i go on auto-pilot, and my body allows me to run through the motions. pretty pathetic, i know.
