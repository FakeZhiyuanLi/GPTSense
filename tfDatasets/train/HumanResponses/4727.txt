well, connectivity wasn't as good as planned, so i didn't get to blog too much of the trip. saturday was grueling: kids: what state are we in? me: montana. kids: what state are we in? me: montana. kids: what state are we in? me: montana. . don't ever try to drive across montana in a day, especially going west to east on i94, because at the end of the day you'll end up in western north dakota and have to drive across half the state before you find a place to stay. anyway, we made it to greenville on saturday, and will stay until thursday morning and then head out for new mexico.
