i can't believe that my great journey starts tomorrow. i've spent most of the day packing my car, with a brief interuption to have lunch with andy, deren, and becky. i really enjoy seeing andy. we can go for long periods of time hardly communicating and then when we get together it's as if we just saw each other yesterday. unfortunately i was not able to see jarusha and kurt. i hope she understands that i rarely see andy and i will see her again in october. i just wish that i had called sooner to clarify what was happening. my car, which seemed so roomy just a few days ago suddenly seems so very cramped. i'm not sure i will be able to take everything that i would like. i already have one box packed for mom to send after i get to school. i hope to keep up with this as much as possible during the big trip but only time will tell.
