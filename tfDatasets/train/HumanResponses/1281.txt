this is the new film from michael moore, who did "bowling for columbine." it came out on friday, june 25, and it is probably the best film i've seen all year. in it, michael questions the abilities of our president to do his job, and suggests that dubya has iraqi and sudan business interests ahead of his duties to this country. it also showcases everything that is wrong with this "war" in iraq and critcizes bush on his actions, post-9/11. michael paints a very convincing picture of our moronic president and i'm going to see this movie again.
