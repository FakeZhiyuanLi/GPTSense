if you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball! this movie was a disappointment, but that's not to say that i didn't enjoy myself. in fact, i really enjoyed it. what's not to love with vince vaughn, ben stiller, rip torn, gary cole, and jason bateman. this movie seemed like a remake of baseketball, right down to the disgusting tongue-filled kiss at the end. two and half stars out of five.
