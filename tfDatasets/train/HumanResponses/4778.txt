it is friday morning and i just finished learning how to properly brief a case. at least i think i learned how. i suppose i will not know for sure until i am forced to complete a brief on my own. regardless, i feel like now i am authroized to throw around legal jargon such as torts and case briefs. i just hope too many people don't ask me what they mean. i also met a girl who is originally from the valley. she said she was born in sepulveda but currently lives in saugus. the only bad thing about her is that she went to notre dame. there are actually quite a few people here from southern california and it is kind of nice.
