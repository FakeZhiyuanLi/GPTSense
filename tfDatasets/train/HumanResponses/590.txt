talk about a rude awakening i guess that string really was at hand's reach. and now i've been pulled back to ground with quite a stiff pull. everyone has one of those days. today i'm having it multiplied by about 5. what does it take to make me get up and leave? at this point not much. watch me do it. cheersh
