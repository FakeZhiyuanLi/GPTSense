well the last letter i wrote about was.nothing. who cares if he called tim i don't. i told him the truth about everything, so i know that he believes me and that is all that matters talked and we are fine, we will all ways be fine. i know that he still loves me it just takes a while. i am more an willing to wait. someone told me if it is meant to be than it will work out in the end. i know it will. everything in life happens for a reason. you know sometimes i wonder why i dwell on the dumn things, from now on i am not going to do it anymore. from here on out if it is something to dwell on then i will but if it is this dumn thing than i am not going to, it is just a waste of time. well with that i promise myself not to dwell on the dumn things. i love myself *zia
