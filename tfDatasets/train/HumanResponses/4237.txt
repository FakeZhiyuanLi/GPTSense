um today was pretty boring. i was about to get a dress for graduation, but my fucked up mother and i got into a fight on the way there so she turned the car around. oh boy was i mad! i screamed my head off at her then they dragged me to a movie (godsend which scared me and i didn't like it) and dinner (3 margaritas ?) yeah i barely spoke 2 words to them and my brother did too. so we talked instead. anyway now i'm home and bored so i dunno.
