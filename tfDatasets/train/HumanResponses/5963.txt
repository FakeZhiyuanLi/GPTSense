soooowhat is it about gay men that we need to have drama in our lives? don't get me wrong.a little spice in life is nice, but why do we have to constantly hurt each other (or talk behind each other's back)? we constantly have a desire to dish each other. i look at the example of a pride event that i attended last weekend. the purpose of the whole event was to celebrate who we are as a family. it was really nice seeing our community come together at such an event and be able to be who we really are. i also notice the dark side to the event. we all were constantly reviewing each other and critiquing other men. why do we do this? i really think that it is a defense mechanism for us so that the attention is not upon us. if we ridicule another person, maybe everyone else will not look at me! hmmmm
