not really a whole lot went on today, just hung out with my friends for the first time in weeks after work. my wife works also, but hates her job at wal-mart. as far as my writing goes, i gotta keep it up, no matter what, but i need more motivation, which is the main purpose of this journal; let out my thoughts and happenings and see if what i can get. tommorow i work late, and will probably be too tired to write, but i'll give it a shot. just a few more days till payday, for the both of us! gotta get my car paid and get the loan back up to date, the problem being that this week we can only do one or the other, being that we both started our jobs a week ago and haven't worked enough to get full paychecks. the car payment can wait another 2 weeks hopefully, the bank already sent out a letter about the loan. i will be served a court summons in 10 days if i don't bring the loan back up to date by then. so it's obvious what will be more important.
