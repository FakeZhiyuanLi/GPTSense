tonight i phoned my hostsister in ohio, she's so cool! well, we have to share a room but i think there's no problem cause we're getting along well. i'm so exciting, it must be awesome to spend a year in another country with other cultures! and when i'm back in germany my english will be really improved! ;) i'm thinking all the time of my ex-boyfriend. on tuesday it's 12 weeks when he left me. yeah, he left me because of another girl. i don't know what likes about her. i know her from seeing and she doesn't seem to be nice; but it's his choice. now they aren't together anymore and i would like to call him but i think if he would like to talk to me, he would have called but he didn't and so i better leave it this way. but maybe i'll call him the day before i'm going to leave berlin and say goodbye.what do you think? should i say goodbye or should i just leave?
