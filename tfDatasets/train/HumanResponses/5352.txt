alex you turn to me and with a single wave of you hair, you flash that smile again, you know the one. the same that's sweeter than the finest scents of all the world combined. i envy how you live your life with not a single care in the world , but for being real and living to the fullest of your potential rising. i love the way your skin is as golden as if you resided in the depths of the midday sun. i marvel at how you are gentle always, even as we splash and fight until we're drenched but still we laugh because for just that moment in my life, everything was right . i hate how infinite barriers separate us, but i will never, ever , forget you. you are the best for me that i have seen in my few and numbered years. thank you.
