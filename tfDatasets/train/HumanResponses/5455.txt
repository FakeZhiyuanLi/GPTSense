this weekend was so boring i couldn't think. i had absolutely not think to do. dwight and i have been spending a lot of time together, so naturally he would be with me. that is the way it went for the better part of the weekend. then sunday, the day of rest, came and all hell broke lose. i started out by doing dwight hair. that took five damn hours. then we went to his house so we could get him some cloths. here it come the i am going to scream if i didn't do something more part. we went back to my house and low and behold we were bored again. this getting to be a pain in the butt. so i snapped, i got a attitude that you would not believe. i did not want to talk to anyone or see anyone for the whole night. it was one in the morning before i talk to dwight again. see i am special; i know i need help.
