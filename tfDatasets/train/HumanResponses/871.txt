ok today i got some stuff to say. it all started when i went to go put some air in a bike tire. i asked my step dad where the pump was, he said that it was under the table in the storage room. so i went to pump the tire but it had a huge hole in the tire so the air wouldnt stay in so i said forget it. then when i came back into the house to tell him iwas leaving he told me to hold the phone for him while he looked for some numbers. when he came back, i told him i was leaving. then he says ok. when i came back the garage was down and he was not there. so here i am locked out. so i go to my friends house and stay there for a while so i could call my sister to let me in. somehow my mom gets a call saying that i locked out so now she trippin about me leaving w/o telling my stepdad. i the one who cant remember shit and just lied on me. so now i am on lock down for who knows how long. aint that a bitch?
