i am a legally ordained toaist minister in the universal life church so theoretically i have a congregation, and they (or me as it were) deserve a media member who represents their point of view. so with this in mind i thought i would apply for press credentials for the debates. not so fast buddy, the cpd has covered this angle too. on their media accreditation page is the following restriction. "only full-time employees of news organizations are eligible, no stringers, freelancers, interns, students or family members will be credentialed." only media members already bought and paid for need apply.
