the yankees home opener was today! since they are playing in japan i had to wake up at 6:00 this morning and it was already the 6th inning lol. they lost 8-3 thoughoh well. i guess stacey didn't think my idea was so good because she didn't say anything and i know from experience that when they don't bring it up, it probably means no. maby i am wrong though. well, atleast i tried right? i don't think we will be going to the concert because there are only 100 tickets left.
