my first hack is not going to be a computer hack, and it's not going to be a hack per se, but it shall be cool none the less. imagine 14th century france and a bunch of smelly english men outside your castle. all of a sudden a dead horse is launched into your courtyard. off in the distance you see.yes! a trebuchet. dreaded tool of seige. and soon, (im thinking mid summer) you shall see one in the left hand corner of my pasture flinging tennis balls filled w/ napalm and matchhead bombs at the remains of an old shed. heheh. i can't wait.
