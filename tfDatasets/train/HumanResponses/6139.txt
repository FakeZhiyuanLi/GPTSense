well it has been a while and i am back, to be honest i havent really been on my computer in a while either, so dont think i am ignoring all you people out there.not much happening, work sucks and i want to change jobs but i dont know what to do, plus i have to wait for my house to close in september before i can even look, so i am kinda stuck here, as long as it pays the bills at the end of the month than i am okay. cars suck too, my wipers arent working and i have to get them fixed for the second time, hopefully its not going to cost an arm and a leg.went out with some friends the other night and played some ntn trivia, that was tons of fun, felt good to be out and about, anyways i'll try to be more on top of this thing, until then cheers!
