i have been wanting a gmail account since i heard about it. i have emailed google multiple times requesting one, i have posted a swap for 20,000 songs for a gmail account. i am even considering giving a kidney for a gmail invitation i don't want to do this, but a gmail account would be incredible. i would be the perfect candidate to try it out also, right now i have three different email addresses in order to get all of my email. i have about 30 mb's of disk space between the three accounts, this just does not cut it. i need something bigger. please send me an invitation. wanne83@hotmail.com
