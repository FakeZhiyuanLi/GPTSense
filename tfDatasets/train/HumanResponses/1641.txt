something just doesnt make sense.i cant place my finger on it but for some reason the world actually seems happy. which i suppose is a good thing, but then nothing ever stays happy, nothing ever ends good, so eventually all this happy stuff will leave and we'll be left with the rest of the crap. ehoh well, ive lived a lifetime of that crap whats a little more? sorry, bringing down the happiness, wanna make that last as long as possible!
