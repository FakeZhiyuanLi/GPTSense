hey crazy ninos! i've decided to start one of these bloggy things. god has been teaching me suh much lately.tis a shame not to write it down somewhere. so alas, i turn to the wonderful world of internet. so hopefully i can keep up and remember to write the things in here. i guess we will see how it goes, eh? (that was for all of you canadians out there) peace.
