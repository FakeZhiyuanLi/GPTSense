why do all the dumb "extro" blonds in a typical school end up as secretaries or in administration jobs in an mnc? ah, the very essence of masochism in a typical male brain. called "thought discrimination" as coined by freud; "fate" as proclaimed by the spiritualists. anyways, these pretty things bring immense joy and are great stress-busters in a typical "heated" office environment. but hang on, there are exceptions. ever heard of the movie "legally blond"? detouring to dubai news, visa applications and processing has now become online. the government relies heavily on the internet. is it becoming too heavy? a much welcomed move, this would reduce the much despised queues and leads to faster processing. whatever it maybe, i'm still awaiting my visa and there seems to be no change in the application status. if only the pros' were "responsible".
