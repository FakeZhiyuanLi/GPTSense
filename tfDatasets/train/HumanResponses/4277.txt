so yesterday i was supposed to have a match with some of my friends against another team on jka, but a few hours before it, i started feeling sick and fell asleep, and lo and behold i missed it! afterwards, we went to the store to pick up xbox live which totally kicks all ass and i played it for about hours yesterday after having to wait for the damn credit card so the account could be approved. oh well, all's cool now so i'm really happy.
