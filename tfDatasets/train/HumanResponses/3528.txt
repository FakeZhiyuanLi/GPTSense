i just hit my sugar crash, now everything seems uninteresting. for those of you out there who bother to read this, don't eat to much sugar without any real food. it really sucks later on. but since i got back from the lake, i still haven't run into any of my friends on aim. so i still feel a little homesick despite the fact that i'm at home. i think i'll go play morrowind.
