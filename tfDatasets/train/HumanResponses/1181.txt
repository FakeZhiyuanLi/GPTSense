i have really enjoyed this class a lot and i would like to have a career in computer engineer. i really enjoy making the first website cause when i showed it to my friends they didn't even want to believe that i did it. so i explained it to them and then they were like damn you did do it. they want me to teach them how to do it. i might have to make some money off this skill that i have learned. of coarse i haven't done the best that i could have done but if i have an opening in my schedule i might have to take another class with mr. rea. this class is going to help me in the future because when i go to college and if they try to teach me to make a web page i will already know how.
