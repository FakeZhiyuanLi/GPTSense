you know, at my old school, i had been called a headbanging devilworshiping kracka everyday. even though i don't headbang, or worship the devil (heil satan! o__o) but at my new school, thats what everyone is (without the devilworshipping. stupid christian foos.), but everyone now calls me a poser for not headbanging everytime smells like teen spirit comes on the radio. i was never aware nirvana headbanged at all. i was never aware heroin users could haedbang either. anyways, for the first day of school this year, i'm gonna be as gangsta as i can be, even though i know i'd be a wanksta. yeah, its sad. either that or i'm gonan become a conformist hating mall goth. w/e.
