for half the day i practiced a song that my sisters and i are singing at my dad's 4th wedding friday night. the song is a bit ironic considering his track record, but what are you going to do? i was pleasantly surprised with how well it went. now we just have to try it at the church with amplification. scary it is mildy terrifying as i haven't sung in public for approx. 11 years. i figure if i just close my eyes i'll be okay. i am really dreading the whole weekend. we have the rehearsal on thursday night, rehearsal for a wedding my son is in at 3pm on friday, dad's wedding at 6:30pm friday night, than the other wedding at 1pm on saturday. i won't have a minutes breathing space until sunday, on which we are invited to my nephews birthday party. bleah and sometime in there, b has to fix his bosses car that is apart in our garage. i really do hate weekends like this almost as bad as guard weekend.
