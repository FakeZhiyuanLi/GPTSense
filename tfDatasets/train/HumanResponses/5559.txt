went to watch [spiderman 2] today! i'd got front-row seats, all the others were sold out. for every show! but it wasn't that bad after all. is tobey maguire cute or what? he's got this funny accent in his voice tone, as if he's not quite yet broken his voice. but it only makes him much cuter! there's this mad scene when spiderman takes the lift down, because his web-blasters aren't working! there's a whole lot of other crazy scenes, but they're too many to name. i don't doubt its 5-star rating one bit, tobey rules!
