i thought i might as well try this blogging phenomenon myself. read about it all over the internet and thought why not. i will post info on what i'm doing with the pic-micro and jal here. my latest project was interfacing the pic16f84 with a 7-segment led (the type that can display numbers.) counting down from 50 and then holding the 0 for another 5 seconds, then starting the whole procedure again. today i will start my next project, which will be to interface the 16f84 with a 40character -/ 2lines lcd display. i don't believe this will be a problem, but somehow i never know these things. geir
