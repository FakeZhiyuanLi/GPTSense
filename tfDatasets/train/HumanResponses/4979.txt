so, he said he'd be back to talk after the basketball game. i teased him and asked "even if they lose?" and he said "especially then. i'll need cheering up" so the game was over an hour ago and he still isn't back. an his im just went offline. i hate that this makes me paranoid. i have 100% faith in his love for me. but why doesn't he want to talk to me? i don't want to push him or bug him and there could be a thousand and one reasons for it.he's still at his friend's housethey've been drinkingetc that would explain why he's not home yet, but the im going offline after 4 hrs of being idle really does bother me. it's only 10pm where he is. surely he's not going to bed. gah. i'm turning into one of those awful girls that just sit by the phone. my husband already took his sleeping pill, so we have privacy and he's not here. i guess i just need to pout a bit here so that i don't do it to him. i don't want him to feel smothered. *pout*
