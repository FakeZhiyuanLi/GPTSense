mail in rebates are becoming the norm these days. everything you buy has a mail in rebate. i recently purchased a new notebook computer, cell phone, and flash drive by the time i walked out of best buy i had seven rebates to send in. mail in rebates are annoying because you have to pay the full price of the item not the advertised price. you have to pay taxes on the total price before rebates. then to top it off you have to wait six to eight weeks to get your rebate. if the retail establishment really wanted to give the consumer a good deal they would make it a instant rebate.
