21st of june all over france; everyone goes out onto the streets into the centre and listens to hundreds of live bands of every type of music. its a bit crazy, but its interesting and its different. we were at place st pierre for a while to watch the final round of the euro group stages. fortunately both france and england went through. before heading around town to capitol, la daurade and then back to pierre. the roads in toulouse are not wide so when you pack them full of people and kebab vans and guitars it holds things up a bit. as do the people who insist on trying to drive through the thousands into the mélé, and then wonder why people start climbing on their vehicle. the main act in capitole was a bunch of middle-aged folk dressed in medieval attire led by a bald singer in a leotard and a keyboard toting man in a rabbit costume. vive la musique français!
