has any ever thought why people have expectation.when they know that if their expectations dont come true there is going to be sorrow, because of sorrow one can get angry and distrubed in life, when one is angry.the person will not be in a position to think properly, may take hastey decisions, which may prove very costly, and even may bring his down fall. so why people have lot of expectations.? cant we just do our duty and not worry about the results.coz i believe, what ever has to happen will happen, what we can do is just do our best. i dont know if all will agree with me.?!
