i wish you knew how much i care/d for you, how much beauty i see inside you, how much i see that you can and will do for good - and no, i'm not saying this because i have to, and no, i'm not saying this because i want you, but i am saying that you're worth more than you know, you're more special than you realize, and someday, someone who you'll be worth and will be worth you will see that, and know that, and love you forever.
