as you know, i come from royalty, but i am living out what began as a huge mix-up from the very moment i slipped out of the birth canal. if you saw me with the rest of my family you would say, "there is no-way those people who claim to be her family and meryl are swimming in the same gene pool." the thing is we don't even speak the same genetic code. this is how it happened; some overworked, crackhead nurse fucked up and put me in the wrong baby holding tank, then took me to the very wrong mother. let me tell you, it isn't easy having royal blood flow through you veins while you are living on a used shoe string. sigh. champagne on a 40 budget. paris hilton/ simple life my ass!
