(i wrote this poem for my sister tami) she works hard all the time, but she get through the day without any pain, washing her clothes with her gain. everynight she pours out poems as she goes along. when she writes her poems thats were she belongs. do not disturb her, do not talk. when she is done and you read you'll be in shock; for what she writes is so great and true. every single one she writes is knew. after writing poems she goes to bed, and falls a sleep, and counts many sheep. she dreams of a place were only she can go. goodnight and don't wake her til' morning.
