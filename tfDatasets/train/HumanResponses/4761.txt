i just don't get all of the hype over michael moore. i have heard enough about his latest "movie", fahrenheit 9/11, to know that i do not wish to support him by plunking down $9 to see it. i have talked to a few people who have seen fahrenheit 9/11 and have accepted it as fact. i have suggested to these people that they do a little research and come to their own conclusions. a good start would be the 911 commission report which is free and is available on the internet. perhaps i will purchase a ticket for another movie and instead watch fahrenheit 9/11.
