pouring rain, clear blue. it alternated all day long in zurich today. luckily i was inside for all the wet bits, except for on my way home, which just made the riding even more fun! found some more awesome single track in zurichberg, although it gets a bit tricky when the nobbly tree-roots are slick from the rain. since it was a bit cooler i could try out my snazzy new cycling top for the first time as well, and it made me feel so much faster! and it's got much more cred now that it's a bit mud-splattered.
