there was a time when everything seemed so simple. we knew where we stood. life was not so complicated as it is today. here's what's happening, this is what you can do. "there, do it, off you go now." easy stuff. as time progresses i see a change, constant change. not everyone is aware of this. the world slips through the lives, minds and fingers of the unenlightened. for those people choosing to live consciously, we can create our world accourding to our consciousness and view it at our own level. what a wonderful thing the realm of the relative is.
