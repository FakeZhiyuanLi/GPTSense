i dream in black and white although i am still alive there is a park bench painted black and white in a beautiful park in dark gray sky and in dark black trees and here i sit dressed in black and white death i see is sitting next to me he offers me a living rose a rose that is black and white death smiles and laughing, stands and offers me a hand i take his, and stand i ask if i'm still alive he tells me yes and points to the skies the clouds open up and show me the world in color in rainbow humans talking and laughing humans talking and killing and asks heaven, hell? i ask what does it all mean? he shrugs and says you tell me.
