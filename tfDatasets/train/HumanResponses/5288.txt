i feel sick. like someone has taken me aprt over night and didn't know how to put me back together afterwards. he came over and saw my car. we watched the first two harry potter movies. my sitting there the whole time. he did something that made my want to break my glass then shove the pieces into my heart so that he wouldn't think about what my dad just did, and my dad will feel bad because it was his fault i attempted suicide.
