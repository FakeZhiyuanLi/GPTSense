i was thinking. what is up with this government? they act like a hypocritical parent. "i know what's best for you" "do as a i say, not as i do". since when was this a democracy. i guess conservatives can't really run a democracy. at least not if most of the country isn't. it's like one of the toughest things about being a parent who raises your kid to think on their own and make up their own mind. is when they do make up their own mind and they don't agree with you. you don't want to accept it because you are sure you're right, so how could they come up with something different, and be right?
