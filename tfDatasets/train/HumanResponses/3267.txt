as my life moves towards things i don't want. i feel myself drawing inward into me. closing myself off from the outside world. becoming quieter and quieterfriends aren't acting like true friends.love that can't be had.because we can't do distance. not sure where i'm going to live for a month. this adds up.this may be more than i can take. the love that's lost is the hardest to deal with. i can make new friends.i can find someone to take me in. i just want that feeling againlove its been too long from the last time. i've said i want a change in my life.to find someone i respect like i do you. to stop running through "girls". to let someone get in and be close to me. to push aside the walls and let them see the real me. "to be love and to love some else" simple things if you just look at it typed out like that. its another for it to actually happen. i go on the hopes of it will happen "someday". someday seems too far too unknown. is it wrong to to want that now?
