today was cool. i actually look forward to school now. just to see my friends though. ok stacey. lemme tell you what i think. there's what a month and a half left of school right? so if we did go out and you ended up like hating my guts then you would never have to see me again. if it was a good thing then we would have a nice few months and we would keep in touch. even though you leaving would suck atleast we tried it out right? well i wish you would give me atleast a chance, eh? think about it! bye. oh and my parents said the concert would be ok. yay!
