oh god, this is strange. i just got back from the enchanted castle (oh yay, tokens for everyone!) with my church and i am as exhausted as hell. since this is my first post, i'm not sure what to write. guess you should get to know me a little bit better. umm, here are some things that i love: elijah wood, music, mocha javas, reading, relaxing, elijah wood, movies, vampires (of course who doesn't?), asian stuff, elijah wood, speaking in different languages to infuriate people, going crazy go nuts, and elijah wood. i think that's all the time we have for today, folks. it's 11pm and i'm tired, so g'night. take care of yourselves rachel/mouse wood
