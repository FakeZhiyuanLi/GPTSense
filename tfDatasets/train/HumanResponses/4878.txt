web assessment tests. i have recently had to fill a few of these out for various jobs. they have statements that you need to agree to, disagree to, strongly agree to, etc. statements like; "i find most people annoying" and "i think it's ok to give my friends unauthorized discounts." what the fuck. who would answer these in any way except the "right" way? there was also a question like, "how much money have you stolen from employers in the last year? $0, $5-$10, $10-$20, etc." it's more of a way to find out if you are rock-stupid, rather than a criminal. rg
