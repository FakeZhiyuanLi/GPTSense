i went out tonight and hung out with everyone something i have not done in awhile. it was fun just kinda different lol. i was very shocked today davina told me she loved me and i just dont think i have felt that good in a long time. i mean i really hope things work out i just feel like she is the one i have been waiting for. i dont know how long the long distance thing will work but because i do love her so much i am willing to do whatever it is going to take not to lose her
