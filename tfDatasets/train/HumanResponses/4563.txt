by the theories of oo we should use the private member within the class but not the property. but properties can be used to validate a value before being assigned to the private variable. my personal idea is, when validation is required, have a separate private method to do validation and call that method inside the propertyâ€™s setter and else where. i.e: private m_name as string public property name() as string get return m_name end get set(byval value as string) dim validvalue as boolean validvalue = validatename(value) if validvalue then m_name = value end if end set end property private function validatename(byval p_name as string) as boolean if p_name.length or should we set the property in side setname method? what is the best practice to use in such situations? please send in your ideas
