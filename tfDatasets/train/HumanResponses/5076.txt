hmm.i ws reading sum stuff last night and came across thesei like them "true love isn't just something that comes once in a lifetime.it's a feeling that comes once and lasts a life time." "somtimes we hold on to things so tightly the grip begins to hurtthen finally we realized we could have saved a whole lot of pain by just lettin go." "there is love of coarse. and then there's life, its enemy" .still home alone-woot! bored as hell though.o well!
