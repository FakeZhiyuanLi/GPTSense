big spill at the end of today's stage, but everyone seems ok. the french have to be thrilled to see their national champion in yellow for a 2nd day in a row. france hasn't had a tour winner since 1985, but i am curious as to how many stages a frenchman has held the yellow jersey in recent years. i am still looking for the site that can tell me that. the next couple of days are still relatively flat, though the road is starting to point up. by next wednesday, the climbers and the sprinters will be seperated, the pyrennes are looking quite vertical this year.
