i am officially a member of world financial group. i guess it's time to let the hard work begin. i hope that my friends will support me through these times. i'm going to the golf range in the afternoon, sounds like a lot of fun. the bbq last night at greg's house was a blast. thanks greg for the wonderful bbq, the cakes were very good. back to a lot of cardio starting monday.
