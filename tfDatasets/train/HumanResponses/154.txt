almost everyone i know online is saying blog. what is it i ask and after reading a few from those i know, i learned that it’s an open journal; that almost everyone online can read. “but why, isn’t a journal supposed to be private?” i asked. some say that they want their life to be an open book and others may say “well i don’t really post everything that happened.” still, i am a bit off with this. so in order to know more of this, i decided to make my own so i may experience and learn about this thing called blog. this will be something from what i do and i don’t know what will happen. only time can tell.
