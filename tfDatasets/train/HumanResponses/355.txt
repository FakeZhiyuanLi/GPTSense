i got my wallet back! nothing missing, i was really thrilled about that. someone picked it up and went through a lot of trouble to return it, making a bunch of phone calls before finally getting ahold of my job and getting them to call me. other than that, things are going well. class went all right today, then i went to the gym and headed to the jewelry studio to finish up my latest project. it's coming along really well but there is one problem i'm worried about. it's a belt buckle and this one piece i soldered on didn't hold up in the kiln too well during the enamelling process. the enamel came out great, but it might crack if i try to re-solder the piece. and if i don't re-solder it it's kind of useless as a buckle because it won't last very long as is :( i guess i just get to solder it again and then try to repair any cracks in the kiln, and hope that the piece stays on this time. grr. i'll post a link to a pic of the piece when it's done.
