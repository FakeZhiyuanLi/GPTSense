i was in my kitchen, and i heard a crash outside, and i thought " awww cool someone hit something". i open up my kitchen door only to find that a honda civic has rear ended my car. he hit a parked car. lemme say that again. he hit a parked car. my parked car. his recount of the situation was " well i was turning right, but then my car just stopped moving, and i was like 'why is my car not moving?'".to which i replied" because you hit my car" that's about as basic as you can get. anyways, his insurance, progressive, is very prompt and courteous. it was a very well choreographed show this morning when i went to give them my car, and pick up the rental. hopefully my scoob will be returned in an acceptable condition, and i can forget my bumper ever looked like that. here's some pics for ya.
