we are so saved edge of eternity looks so dirty i am so unworthy ledge of the universe looks so perverse i can see the human race sledge hammer of salvation broke the damnation oh how we are saved! crying on the inside for the landslide no mortal seems to care lying in the valley is right up our alley the enemy found us there rock solid foundation built on crucifixion oh how we are saved!
