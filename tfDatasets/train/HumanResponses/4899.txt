so today was a good day. i talked to a lot of people about the idea of moving to ca, and got a lot of good responses. all were in favor of me moving as long as i came back for cubs games :) on a more serious side though, i met someone at the mit chicago holiday party that has a connection at ideo palo alto, so maybe this little dream can really become a reality. we'll see! seeing a bunch of current students and new admits made me really miss the environment of mit though. all the more reason to head out west! it didn't give me much hope that all the non-finance, non-architect people at the party all said that chicago is not the place for anyone who wants a challenging tech job with a ton of other highly motivated great engineers.a friend from work told me the same thing today as well. too bad i didn't know that a year ago a final note: it's 3 days until christmas i hope everyone reading this has a safe travel where ever they are going! :)
