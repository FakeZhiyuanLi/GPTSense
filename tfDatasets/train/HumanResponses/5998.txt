hey all, i hit the streets today in search of a job. i would like some cash flow, seeing that i spend alot i should provide my own means of income. had all my classes today, my english teacher looked over my transcript and said i might be able to graduate by january. hmm.i guess i have to burden myself with work and school. i don't mind, i need to do something someday for whatever reason right? of course. met some."interesting" people today during lunch, feels better to not be a social outcast now. well, less so at least. i'm currently getting a set ready for my new clay movie, but i need r.t. *lindsey* to help me with a script. quite frankly i don't beleive i will be able to commit much time to the upcoming ones with school and possibly a job, but don't be concerned, it'll be great, but it'll take longer. -hush
