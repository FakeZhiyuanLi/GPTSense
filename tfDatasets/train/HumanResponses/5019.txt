you can't just say to yourself that things are okay because they aren't. they will never be okay until you put them to eternal rest. you must forget and shallow the pain pretending as if it's a watermelon without any seeds. and so i say to you move on to a new beginning and leave behind your old trail map for someone else to pick up and try to follow in your footsteps to achieve the goal that you easily lost.
