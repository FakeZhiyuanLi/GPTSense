today was my first full day of knowing that on monday, i'll have absolutely nothin' to do. that will be friggin' amazing. i really can't wait for summer to really begin. went out with ryan tonight. we saw shrek 2. god that was hilarious. first of all, there were referances to literally every fairy tale one could possibly think of. i mean everything: the three little pigs, cinderella, and there was this great spoof of hollywood called far far away land where there was a street that looked suspiciously like rodeo drive. before that, ryan and i went to stir crazy, this amazing asian restaurant where i had yummy sweet and spicy chicken. ummmm. tomorrow is church and that's cool. anyway, sorry i haven't posted in a while. laters. oh, p.s. i really don't think kevin reads this, but on the offhand chance that he does, thanks for the tip about lung cancer and all that. really, like no one's ever told me that before! i am forever in your debt.
