i got to see fire lily today. yay! she's out at kittyhawk kigers and she's in heat. she was teasing the stud, hombre, so they had to move her to a different pasture. anyway, she's fat. well, not fat, she's actually in really good shape. she's out with two geldings who she gets to boss around. she loves it out there, which is good. she always hated being in a stall. oh yeah, my mom called on of the people at the stables a bad name yesterday. she never fails to make my life worse.
