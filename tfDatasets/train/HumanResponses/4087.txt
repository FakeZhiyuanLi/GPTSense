local time 11pm tuesday not a lot to report today, pretty much stayed at yuqi's parents apartment. yuqi needed to see the dentist today, so i spent most of the afternoon doing laundry and using their computer. weather today was cooler than yesterday's 36, but still quite hot and sticky. in the evening we had some delicious noodles together before watching tv until bedtime. tomorrow, we'll be taking yuqi's nephew zhou xun out for the day, so will have more to say tomorrow :). interesting china fact #10 - karaoke is very popular here. in the cities you can see several karaoke bars (so called "ktv") where you can have a private karaoke room with your friends. also, watching chinese tv, you'll find nearly all theme tunes or songs are subtitled so you can sing along (if, unlike me, you can read chineses characters!)
