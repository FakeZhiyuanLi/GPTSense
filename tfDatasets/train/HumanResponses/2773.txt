yep thats where me and mom should be today. wait a minute i didn't even sleep last night! but it's turning out to be just one of those days. went to work for 2 hours and got put on a tour, i wasn't even in uniform, and "g'day folks welcome to the bonnechere caves!" so, needless to say, i'm a little pre-occupied with the singing and the talking to people who don't speak english (they speak french), and i hope that that tour raked in some tips. lol. anyways going to return movie. watched starsky and hutch and it was disappointing. then anything else, except it was too boring.
