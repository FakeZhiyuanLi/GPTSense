hi, my name is janelle and this is my blog. my life is messed up and weird somtimes. well most of the time my life is weird. i have a sister, 2 brothers, a mom,and a dad. one of my brothers are in jail and the other one is in track and cross country. my parents are devoriced and my sister is just my sister. some of you other people may think that your life if weirder then mine, you may be right but now i think that my life is weirder. there are these boys that play down in the feild by my house. they always pick on me . they say that im fat and well, maybe they are right. but i'm not that fat.just a little. everywhere i go they are close by. my life is not the way that i would have pictured it to be. i have only have one boyfriend and i'm not that good looking. i just want people to like me for who i am and not like me because i am fat.my life is not the way i would havve wanted it to be. my life is so not nice.
