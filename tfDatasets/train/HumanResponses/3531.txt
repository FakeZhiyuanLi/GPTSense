ok here is the deal. my good friend said that he was glad that he did not get asked to the sadie hawkins dance tonight. hell fighter said this because he thinks that our school is full of crazy weird chicks. well for the most part he is right. but i believe that out there some where there is a very cool gal lookin for him. but hey i am sure things will get perkier for him soon. check out his post at the hell fighter boy link. and see what he says. bye again.
