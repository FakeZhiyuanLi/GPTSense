re-written some of [the last chance], so that i've re-invented kaelin's character. instead of being such an astronomy guru, kaelin is now a reckless all-rounder exceling in comc and astronomy. i'd based kaelin upon myself, but i really over-exaggurated the part about astronomy. kaelin's character is now, more than ever, like yours truly. its almost as if it were me in there! also, england played croatia last night, won 4-2 england's in the quarter-finals, celebration!
