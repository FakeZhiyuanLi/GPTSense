my mother in law is coming in less than 15 hours and i am not even freaking. ok i am freaking but i am not ready. i need to vac the family room and clean the upstairs bathroom. i just can't get into it this time. maybe it was the horrible broccoli reaction i had from my lunch. omg i am in so much pain from the stupid green junk. that will teach me. i do have a great little parent moment to share. caleb my oldest was at a friend's house last night while the parents were out. he only had a small bowl of icecream because he knew that his father and i would be upset if he had, had a huge one! to me this shows great control and shows that he listens, and can be trusted. today it is a bowl of icecream, in a few years it will be a beer at a party.
