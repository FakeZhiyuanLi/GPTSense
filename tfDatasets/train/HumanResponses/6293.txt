today was a boring yet exciting change from the ordinary day. i dident mind being in school today. school life improving, thats a good thing. im starting to get my life back together everything seemed normal untill the afternoon bus ride, poring rain and thunder, windows down on bus, water pouring into bus, everyone was wild on the bus today, it was a definte change from the ordinary. as for nicki and kristen, well i really dont want to talk to them, they have changeed too much. the rest of my day was spent hanging out at the park not really doing much.
