i am back again. i am thrilled in life. i got some stuff from home. lots of shrikhand. had that for lunch ;-) was just thinking, what does it mean to really hate something. i mean its not that i have never hated anyone or anything ever but guess my hatred never reached a stage where i would really want bad things to happen to the one concerned. i think i really want to see that negative side of me where i would want terrible things to happen to what i hate ;-) kenya won the match and i really hated that but then i didnt want terrible things to happen to kenya. well guess when one genuinely hates something one would want to be as mean as possible. does that mean i have never genuinely hated something? does it mean that none of my feelings are genuine? may be thats too much of an extrapolation.let me remain happy with the (mis?)conception that only my ill feelings are not genuine ;-)
