heh, i was just playing ut2004, with my fellow hunters. we pretty much owned the whole time except for 1 or 2 games. ugh yea, hunters own at onslaught. also, i started the ut2004 class for making your own game, coding it and stuff, it's going to take me sixty hours to complete. so i have no clue if i'm going to finish it or not but today i watched an one hour of it, and surprisingly i was focused in what they were saying. usually in school i tend to drift off because either the work is to easy for me or i'm just not interested in what they are teaching. though in ut2004 classes you have no idea how fun it is, just knowing at the end of this you will have the ability to make your own games. i can already see me making hunter themed games. it's gonna be fun.
