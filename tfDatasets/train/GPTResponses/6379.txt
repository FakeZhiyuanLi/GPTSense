The natural decay series of uranium starts with 238U which undergoes a series of decays to produce several different isotopes including 234U. As each isotope decays, it emits alpha particles (helium nuclei).According to the decay chain of natural uranium, about 0.006% of the alpha particles come from 234U.Therefore, about 0.006% of the alpha rays of natural uranium are emitted by 234U.
