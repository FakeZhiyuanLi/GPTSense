Napoleon III planned to relieve pressure from an expected German attack by forming alliances with other European powers, including Italy and Austria. He also hoped to secure the neutrality of other countries, such as Britain and Russia. Additionally, he invested in modernizing the French army and fortifying the country's eastern borders. However, despite these efforts, the Franco-Prussian War still broke out in 1870, which led to the downfall of Napoleon III's regime and the unification of Germany under Prussian leadership.
