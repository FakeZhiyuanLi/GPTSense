Some eukaryotic organelles, like mitochondria and chloroplasts, have their own circular DNA molecules called mitochondrial/chloroplast DNA or mtDNA/cpDNA. These DNA molecules are distinct from the nuclear DNA of the cell and encode for specific proteins and RNA molecules necessary for the functioning of the organelles.
