The Czech language typically uses a grammatical case system to handle cardinal numbers, which means that the form of the number changes based on its position in a sentence, its grammatical function, and the noun it modifies. For example, the number "one" has several forms depending on whether it is a subject, object, or possessive modifier.In addition, Czech numerals follow a decimal system, like in English, and use the same conventions for thousands, millions, and billions. However, unlike in English, there is no separate word for "and" between hundreds and tens. For example, the number 125 would be read as "sto dvacet pÄ›t" (literally "one hundred twenty five").Overall, the Czech handling of cardinal numbers can be complex and requires a good understanding of the language's case system and grammatical rules.
