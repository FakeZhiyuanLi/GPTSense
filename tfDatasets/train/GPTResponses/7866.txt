The special protocol during a USB 2.0 device reset is called the USB Reset signaling. This protocol initiates a reset sequence that clears the endpoint buffer and re-enumerates the device with the host. This sequence ensures that the device is ready to communicate with the host and also helps in resolving any errors or issues that may have occurred during the previous communication.
