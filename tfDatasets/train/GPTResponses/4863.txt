Adolescence is typically accompanied by a gradual increase in independence and a corresponding decrease in parental supervision. As teenagers begin to mature and acquire new skills and responsibilities, they are usually given greater freedom to make decisions and explore their interests. However, this process can vary depending on cultural, social, and familial norms, as well as the individual needs and characteristics of the adolescent. Some families may place more emphasis on guidance and structure, while others may prioritize autonomy and self-reliance. Ultimately, adolescence is a complex and dynamic period of development that requires ongoing support and guidance from parents and other caregivers.
