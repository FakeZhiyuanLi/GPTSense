There is no specific positive integer that is used to divide the sum of two positive integers in modular mathematics. It depends on the given problem or equation. In some cases, the modulo operator (denoted by %) is used to find the remainder when the sum of two numbers is divided by a positive integer. In other cases, the division itself may be carried out using modular arithmetic techniques.
