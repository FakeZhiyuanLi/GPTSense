According to Buddhist teachings, the eradication of defilements can be achieved through the practice of the Noble Eightfold Path, which includes right understanding, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. When these factors are developed and perfected through sustained practice, they can lead to the gradual eradication of defilements such as greed, hatred, and ignorance. Ultimately, the attainment of enlightenment results in the complete eradication of all defilements.
