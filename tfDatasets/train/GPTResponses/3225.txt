It is believed that the first inhabitants of the Marshall Islands arrived in the second millennium BC, although the exact origin and migration patterns of these early settlers are still debated among historians and archeologists. Some theories suggest that they may have migrated from Southeast Asia or Polynesia, while others propose that they were already native to the region and simply expanded their territory over time. Either way, these early settlers were known for their seafaring skills and navigational prowess, which allowed them to traverse great distances across the Pacific Ocean in search of new resources and opportunities.
