The Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was the primary basis of policies developed during the Civil Rights Movement. This amendment, ratified in 1868, granted citizenship to all individuals born or naturalized in the United States, and prohibited any state from depriving any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, or denying any person within its jurisdiction equal protection of the laws. Civil rights leaders utilized the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to challenge discriminatory policies and practices, such as segregation in schools and public accommodations.
