Houston's land use policies are credited with producing a low-density urban sprawl characterized by single-family homes, commercial areas, and large highway systems. The city has minimal zoning regulations and instead relies on private landowners and developers to make land use decisions. This approach has led to low housing costs but also increased traffic congestion, air pollution, and sprawling development patterns. Additionally, it has contributed to the city's susceptibility to flooding and other natural disasters due to the lack of land-use planning and regulation.
