The abbreviated electrical characteristics of smaller capacitors typically consist of:1. Capacitance value: This is measured in Farads (F) or in smaller units, such as microfarads (µF) or picofarads (pF). It indicates the amount of electrical charge that a capacitor can store.2. Voltage rating: This refers to the maximum voltage that can be applied across the capacitor without damaging it.3. Tolerance: This indicates the allowable deviation from the specified capacitance value. It is usually expressed as a percentage.4. Temperature coefficient: This reflects how the capacitance value changes as the temperature varies.5. Leakage current: This is the small amount of current that flows through a capacitor when it is charged. It is usually measured in microamps (µA) or nanoamps (nA).6. Equivalent series resistance (ESR): This is the overall resistance of the capacitor, including the internal resistance of the electrodes and the dielectric material. It is usually expressed in ohms.
