In the Baroque era, keyboardists, particularly organists and harpsichordists, were expected to improvise preludes. These preludes served as an introduction to a larger piece of music, allowing the musician to showcase their skills and set the tone for the performance. It was also common for composers to write preludes as part of their keyboard suites, leaving room for performers to embellish or improvise within them.
