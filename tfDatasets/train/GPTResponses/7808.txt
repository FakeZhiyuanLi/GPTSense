The USB specification provides guidelines and standards for the physical connections, communication protocols, and power delivery of USB devices. It sets limits on the maximum data transfer rates, cable lengths, and power output of USB devices. For example, the current USB 3.2 specification supports data transfer rates of up to 20 Gbps, cable lengths of up to 3 meters, and power delivery of up to 100 watts. However, the actual performance and capabilities of USB devices may vary depending on their hardware, firmware, and software implementations.
