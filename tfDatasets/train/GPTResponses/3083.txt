Coding regions can be split into several parts, including:1. Exons: These are the segments of DNA that code for proteins and are spliced together to form the final messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript.2. Introns: These are non-coding segments of DNA that are transcribed into pre-mRNA but are removed during RNA splicing.3. Promoters: These are the regions of DNA that are upstream of the coding region and are responsible for initiating transcription.4. Enhancers: These are regions of DNA that can increase the rate of transcription of a particular gene.5. UTRs (untranslated regions): These are segments of mRNA that do not code for proteins but play a role in regulating translation.6. Polyadenylation signals: These are sequences of DNA that signal the end of the coding region and the addition of a poly-A tail to the mRNA.
