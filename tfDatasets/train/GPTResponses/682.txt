The concept of the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha as one is known as the Three Jewels or Three Treasures in Buddhism. It is mentioned in several sutras but most notably in the Mahaparinirvana Sutra. In this sutra, the Buddha says:"The Tathagata has proclaimed the Dharma, which is like a raft for crossing over, and the Sangha, which is like a ferryboat. Once you have crossed over to the other shore, you no longer need either raft or ferryboat. Thus, the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha are inseparable, and they are like the three parts of a single body."
