The FBI first appeared in popular media in the 1930s, with the rise of gangster films such as "Public Enemy" and "Little Caesar," which often featured the FBI as a hero organization. However, it was not until the 1950s and 1960s, with the popularity of television shows like "The FBI" and "Dragnet," that the FBI became a household name and a regular presence in popular media.
