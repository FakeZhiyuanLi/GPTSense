Article 10 of the Berne Convention calls certain uses that limit copyright "permitted uses" or "exceptions and limitations to the exclusive rights of the author." These are specific instances where copyright laws may be bent or relaxed in order to promote the public interest, such as in cases of educational, scientific, and social advancement. Examples of permitted uses include the right to quote from a copyrighted work for purposes of criticism, review, or news reporting, and the right to make copies of a work for personal use or for use in libraries and archives.
