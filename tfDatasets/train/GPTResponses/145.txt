Prime ideals can be used in algebraic number theory by using quadratic reciprocity to prove the law of quadratic reciprocity for a number field with a quadratic extension, such as the Gaussian integers. In this setting, prime ideals are used in place of prime numbers to define the Legendre symbol and to establish quadratic reciprocity. Specifically, prime ideals are used to distinguish between quadratic residues and non-residues, which helps to determine the sign of the quadratic reciprocity symbol.
