Excessive regulations can lead to increased costs and reduced innovation, as companies have to spend more on compliance and less on research and development. It can also create barriers to entry for new businesses, making it harder for them to compete against established players who have already invested in compliance. This can ultimately lead to less competition, less choice for consumers, and slower economic growth.
