The astrolabe is believed to have been invented by the ancient Greeks around 200 BCE, but it was further developed by Islamic astronomers in the 8th century. The Persian astronomer and philosopher, Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī, is one of the most famous astronomers associated with the development of the astrolabe.
