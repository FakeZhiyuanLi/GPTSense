The mycobacterial cell wall is the most challenging part of the tuberculosis bacterium that makes it difficult to treat. It contains a high amount of mycolic acids, which provide structural integrity and resistance to most antimicrobial agents, including antibiotics. This unique cell wall structure also prevents certain drugs from entering the bacterial cell, limiting the efficacy of treatment options. Additionally, tuberculosis bacteria can enter a dormant, non-replicating state, further complicating treatment efforts.
