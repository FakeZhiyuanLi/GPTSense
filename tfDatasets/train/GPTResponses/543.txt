Dukkha is a Pali term often translated as "suffering," "unsatisfactoriness," or "stress." It refers to the inherent dissatisfaction or discomfort that arises from the impermanent and unsatisfactory nature of conditioned existence.Dukkha can manifest in various forms, including physical pain, emotional distress, mental anguish, and existential unease. It is not limited to specific types of experiences and affects all sentient beings, regardless of age, gender, or social status.The Buddha explained dukkha as one of the Three Universal Truths, along with impermanence and non-self. He taught that the cause of dukkha is craving or attachment to impermanent phenomena, and the path to liberation from dukkha involves ending craving and attaining a state of peace and equanimity.Overall, the meaning of dukkha emphasizes the transitory and unsatisfying nature of worldly experience and calls for a radical transformation in our relationship to reality. It invites us to cultivate wisdom and compassion, and to seek ultimate freedom from suffering.
