The grounds on which the Ottoman Empire struck at the Armenians are subject to much debate and controversy. However, many historians cite a combination of political, economic, and religious reasons.1. Political: The Armenians were seen as a threat to the Ottoman Empire due to their demands for autonomy and their ties to Russia, the Ottoman's rival empire. The Armenians were also seen as potential allies of the French, who had a history of supporting Christian minorities in the Ottoman Empire.2. Economic: The Armenian population was seen as influential in the Ottoman economy, particularly in terms of banking and finance. Many of the wealthy Armenians were targeted and their businesses confiscated.3. Religious: The Armenians were a Christian minority in a predominantly Muslim empire. As tensions between the two religions continued to rise, the Ottoman Empire sought to eliminate the Armenian population as a means of ensuring its dominance.Ultimately, the reasons behind the Ottoman Empire's strike at the Armenians are complex and multifaceted. It is widely recognized that the genocide of the Armenians was driven by a combination of political, economic, and religious factors, as well as a deep-seated desire to eliminate the Armenian population as a whole.
