1. Dilution: Adding water to the brew can bring down the alcohol percentage.2. Fermentation temperature: High temperatures can kill yeast, which slows down the fermentation process and results in lower alcohol content.3. Yeast strain: Using a yeast strain with a lower alcohol tolerance can affect the final product.4. Length of fermentation: Shortening the fermentation time can limit the amount of alcohol produced.5. Amount of sugar: Reducing the amount of sugar or other fermentable ingredients can decrease the alcohol content.6. Filtering or centrifuging: Removing some of the yeast and other solids can decrease the alcohol percentage.7. Boiling off: Boiling the brew for a longer time can result in more alcohol being burned off.8. Aging: Allowing the brew to age for a longer time can break down some of the alcohol content.
