Disk encryption and trusted platform module (TPM) are designed to prevent unauthorized access and protect sensitive data stored on a computer. Disk encryption ensures that if a computer is lost or stolen, the data on the hard drive is protected and cannot be accessed without the correct credentials. TPM helps to ensure the integrity of the system by verifying that the hardware and software components are secure and have not been tampered with. Together, disk encryption and TPM provide a robust security solution that can help protect against various types of attacks and threats.
