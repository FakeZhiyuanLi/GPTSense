The two types of group boundaries are physical and psychological boundaries.Physical boundaries are tangible and visible barriers that separate groups, such as walls, borders, or gates. These boundaries can be natural, such as mountains or bodies of water, or man-made, such as fences or walls.Psychological boundaries are more abstract and refer to the perceived differences between groups, such as cultural, social, or religious differences. These boundaries can be reinforced by language, values, beliefs, and traditions, and can often be more difficult to overcome than physical barriers.
