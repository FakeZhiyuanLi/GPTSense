It depends on the country and time period. In Australia, Indigenous Australians were not granted the right to vote in federal elections until 1962 and in state elections until 1967. In New Zealand, MƒÅori were granted the right to vote in 1867. In Canada, Indigenous Canadians were not granted the right to vote in federal elections until 1960. In the United States, Native Americans were given citizenship and the right to vote in 1924, but many faced discrimination and barriers to voting well into the 20th century.
