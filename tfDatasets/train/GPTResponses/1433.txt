atoms?The theory that matter is made up of discrete building blocks called atoms is known as the atomic theory. This theory was first proposed by the ancient Greek philosopher Democritus in the 5th century BC, but it was not widely accepted until the 19th century, when scientists made important advances in the field of chemistry and atomic physics. The atomic theory states that all matter is composed of indivisible particles called atoms, each with a unique structure and physical properties. These atoms combine in various ways to form molecules, which make up the substance we see and feel around us. Today, the atomic theory is a fundamental concept in chemistry, physics, and other branches of science.
