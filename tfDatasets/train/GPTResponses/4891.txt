The process where unnecessary neuronal connections in the brain are eliminated is called synaptic pruning or synaptic elimination. This process occurs during normal brain development, particularly during childhood and adolescence, and is a critical part of shaping the brain's structure and functionality. During synaptic pruning, weaker connections between neurons that are not being utilized are eliminated, allowing for stronger connections to develop and enabling more efficient neural communication. Synaptic pruning is also believed to be involved in the pathophysiology of certain neurological disorders, including autism and schizophrenia, where abnormal synaptic pruning may disrupt normal brain function.
