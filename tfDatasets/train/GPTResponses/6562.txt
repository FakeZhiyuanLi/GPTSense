The first truly Gothic building is considered to be the Abbey Church of Saint-Denis in Paris, France. Built in the 12th century, it is considered the first building to fully embrace and showcase the Gothic style of architecture, with its pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and elaborate decorative elements. It was the final resting place of many French monarchs and played an important role in the development of Gothic architecture across Europe.
