Charles Darwin did not directly address Karl von Nägeli’s objections to his theory of evolution. However, in later editions of his book “On the Origin of Species,” Darwin clarified some of his arguments and provided more evidence to support his theory. He also acknowledged that there were some gaps in his knowledge and observations of certain species, and continued to revise and refine his ideas throughout his life.
