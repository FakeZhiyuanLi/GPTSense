After being displaced from their ancestral lands, Native Americans were often forced to live on reservations or in designated territories. These areas were typically located in less desirable and less fertile regions of the country, making it difficult for them to maintain their traditional way of life. The U.S. government also attempted to assimilate Native Americans through programs like boarding schools, which separated children from their families and attempted to erase their cultural identity.
