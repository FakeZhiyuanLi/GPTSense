Ski-jump ramps allow STOVL (Short Take-Off Vertical Landing) aircraft to take off with a smaller runway length and with a heavier load compared to taking off on a flat deck. Additionally, ski-jump ramps allow STOVL aircraft to take off at a higher angle, providing more lift and reducing the speed necessary for takeoff. This is important for carrier ships with limited runway space, as it increases the operational flexibility of the ship and allows for the deployment of heavier aircraft.
