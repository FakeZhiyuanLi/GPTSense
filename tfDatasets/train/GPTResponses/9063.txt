"Dulce et Decorum Est" by Wilfred Owen is a poem that demonstrates that the war became a symbol of failures. The poem vividly describes the horrors of war and the effect it had on soldiers who were disillusioned by the reality of it. The line "The old Lie: Dulce et decorum est Pro patria mori" translates to "It is sweet and right to die for your country," effectively exposing the falsehood and propaganda that convinced young men to enlist in the war. The poem highlights the physical and emotional toll of the war and critiques the misguided glorification of military sacrifice that perpetuated its continuation.
