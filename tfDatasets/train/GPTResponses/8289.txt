The word "races" in Darwin's book generally refers to variations within a species that have developed due to differences in environmental factors, such as geography or climate. In the context of human evolution, Darwin used the term "races" to describe different groups or populations of humans that had distinct physical characteristics and cultural practices. However, it is important to note that Darwin's use of this term has been criticized as reflecting the biases and prejudices of his time.
