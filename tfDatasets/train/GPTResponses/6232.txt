The differentiation process is driven by various signaling molecules and transcription factors. These factors regulate gene expression and influence cell fate determination by activating or inhibiting specific gene expressions. Differentiation signals are vital for embryonic development, tissue repair, and regeneration, and are known to involve calcium signals, protein kinases, growth factors, and other signaling pathways. Differentiation is a complex and multistep process that requires the coordinated regulation of gene expression, cell proliferation, cell migration, and extracellular matrix remodeling.
