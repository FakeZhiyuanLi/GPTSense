Nicholas Steno, a Danish scientist, is known for developing the Law of Superposition in geology, which states that the layers of rock closest to the surface are younger than the layers below them. He also proposed the principle of original horizontality, which states that sedimentary layers are originally deposited horizontally, and the principle of lateral continuity, which states that sedimentary layers extend laterally until they thin out or encounter a barrier. These principles are the foundation of modern stratigraphy, the study of rock layers and their chronology.
