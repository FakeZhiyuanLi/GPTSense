The factor that allows a state to withdraw from any treaty at any time is the doctrine of treaty termination or denunciation. This doctrine provides that a state has the sovereign right to decide whether to continue to be bound by a treaty or not. Article 56 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties codifies this principle and stipulates that a treaty may be terminated or denounced by the consent of all the parties to it or in accordance with the provisions of the treaty. In practice, a state can withdraw from a treaty by giving notice to the other parties, either through diplomatic channels or by following the procedure set out in the treaty itself. The withdrawal takes effect after a specified time period, which is usually provided for in the treaty or customary international law.
