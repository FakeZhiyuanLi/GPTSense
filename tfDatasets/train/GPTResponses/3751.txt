One feature of the climate that produced a more tropical world is higher global temperatures. Warmer temperatures can create more humid and wet conditions that are favorable for tropical vegetation and biodiversity. This can result in the expansion of tropical environments and the growth of species that are adapted to these warm and wet conditions. In addition, higher temperatures can also lead to increased evaporation rates, which can create more moisture in the air and contribute to the formation of tropical weather patterns like monsoons and hurricanes.
