There is no specific person recorded in history who did not concur that 1 should be the first prime number in the mid-18th century. However, it is known that among mathematicians and scholars, there was a general agreement that 1 was not a prime number during that time period. This is because prime numbers are defined as positive integers greater than 1 that have no factors other than 1 and themselves. 1, on the other hand, is not a prime number as it only has one factor, which is 1 itself.
