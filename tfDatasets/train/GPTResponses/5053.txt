The first synthetic dye was discovered by Sir William Henry Perkin in 1856. He was a young British chemist who accidentally discovered the first synthetic dye while he was trying to synthesize quinine, a drug used to treat malaria. He noticed that one of his experiments resulted in a purple color, which turned out to be a new synthetic dye that he called mauveine. This discovery revolutionized the dyeing industry, as previously colors were derived from natural sources such as plants and minerals, and opened up new opportunities for the chemical industry.
