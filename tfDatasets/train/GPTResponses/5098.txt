Many countries have experienced unintended consequences from species invasion. Some notable examples include:1. Australia: The introduction of rabbits and cane toads have had devastating impacts on native species and ecosystems.2. United States: The introduction of European starlings, zebra mussels, and Asian carp have caused significant damage to native environments.3. New Zealand: The introduction of stoats, rats, and possums have had severe impacts on native bird populations.4. Pacific Islands: The introduction of mongoose, rats, and cats have caused the extinction of many native birds and reptiles.5. South Africa: The introduction of plant species such as Australian acacias and American prickly pears have had negative impacts on native vegetation and ecosystems.6. India: The introduction of water hyacinth has led to the clogging of waterways and has had negative impacts on fish populations.
