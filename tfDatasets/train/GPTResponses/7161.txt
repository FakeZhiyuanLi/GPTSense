Medicines and recreational drugs can come from a variety of sources, including natural sources such as plants, fungi, and animals. Synthetic drugs are also created in laboratories. Some examples of natural sources of drugs include opium from the opium poppy plant, cocaine from the coca plant, and cannabis from the hemp plant. Synthetic drugs are artificially created or altered to mimic the effects of natural substances or create new effects altogether.
