The first Protestants criticized the Roman Catholics for their practice of selling indulgences, which were seen as a way to reduce the punishment for sins and earn salvation. Protestants believed that salvation came by faith alone, and that the sale of indulgences was a corrupt practice that ultimately undermined the authority of scripture and the role of Jesus Christ in redemption.
