Penguins migrate by swimming long distances in search of food and nesting sites. They typically follow the ocean currents, diving up to 500 feet deep to catch fish, crustaceans, and squid. During the breeding season, Emperor and King Penguins undertake a particularly grueling migration by trekking inland over snow and ice to reach their breeding grounds. They may travel hundreds of miles over several weeks, enduring extreme weather conditions to reach their destination. Once they have laid eggs and hatched their chicks, both parents remain at the breeding site to care for and feed their young until they are old enough to fledge and begin their own migration.
