Some examples of equipment that use the infrared spectrum in the absence of sufficient visible light are:1. Infrared cameras: These cameras are designed to detect and capture images based on the heat emitted by objects in the infrared spectrum, even in complete darkness.2. Night-vision goggles: These goggles use the infrared spectrum to amplify visible light and enhance the image in low-light conditions.3. Remote controls: Most remote controls use infrared signals to transmit commands to devices, even in the absence of visible light.4. Security systems: Infrared sensors are commonly used in security systems to detect motion and presence even in the dark.5. Electrical heaters: Some electrical heaters use infrared radiation to emit heat, which is absorbed by objects in the room, providing warmth.
