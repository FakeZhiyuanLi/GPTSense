The Law of Conservation of Mass did not directly disagree with any theory but it contradicted the theory of phlogiston which stated that materials contained a substance called phlogiston that was released during combustion. The law of conservation of mass, however, demonstrated that the total mass of the reactants and products remains constant during a chemical reaction, which contradicted the phlogiston theory.
