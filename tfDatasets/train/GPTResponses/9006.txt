Spirometry is a useful diagnostic tool for asthma because it measures various lung function parameters that are affected by asthma, such as forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). These measurements allow doctors to assess the severity of the disease, monitor its progress, and adjust treatment plans accordingly. Spirometry can also help differentiate asthma from other respiratory conditions with similar symptoms. Therefore, spirometry is an important tool in the diagnosis and management of asthma.
