Queen Victoria was facing the major life event of her coronation as Queen of the United Kingdom when she also had to contend with her first assassination attempt in 1840. She had ascended to the throne following the death of her uncle, King William IV, and her coronation was held on June 28, 1838, at Westminster Abbey. Just two years later, on June 10, 1840, as she was riding in a carriage with her husband, Prince Albert, outside Buckingham Palace, a man named Edward Oxford attempted to assassinate her by firing two pistols at their carriage. Fortunately, he missed both times and was quickly disarmed and arrested. Despite the attempt on her life, Queen Victoria went on to reign for another 63 years, becoming one of the longest-reigning monarchs in British history.
