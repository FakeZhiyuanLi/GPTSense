1. Compact Size: Pancake motors have a flat, pancake-like shape, which makes them small and compact. This allows them to be easily incorporated into various types of devices and systems without taking up too much space.2. High Torque: Pancake motors have high torque capabilities due to their large diameter and short axial length. They are ideal for applications that require high torque and low speed, such as robotics and automation systems.3. Low Profile: Pancake motors have a low profile, which means they can be easily integrated into tight spaces, making them ideal for applications in areas where space is limited.4. Efficiency: Pancake motors are highly efficient, meaning they can convert a high percentage of the power supplied to them into useful mechanical energy. This reduces energy waste and makes them more cost-effective in the long run.5. Low Noise: Pancake motors operate with minimal noise, making them ideal for applications that require quiet operation, such as medical devices, robotic limbs or prosthetics, and other similar applications.6. High-Speed Capabilities: Pancake motors have a high-speed capability due to their low rotor moment of inertia. This makes them ideal for high-speed applications, such as spindle motors in machine tools, positioning systems, and other applications, where speed is critical.7. Easy to Control: Pancake motors can be easily controlled, thanks to their simplified construction and design. They can be easily integrated into motion control systems with feedback devices such as encoders or resolvers, making them an ideal choice for precision motion control systems.
