If the sovereign does not sign the bill within the six-month time frame, the bill will automatically become law. This principle is known as "Royal Assent by default." Once the six-month period has expired, the bill becomes law as if the sovereign had given their approval. This process ensures that there is a limit to the amount of time that the monarch can hold onto a bill and ensures that the legislative process can continue to move forward.
