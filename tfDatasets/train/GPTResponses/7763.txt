When agriculture failed in Bermuda, Bermudians turned to other forms of livelihood, such as fishing, shipbuilding, and sailing. Due to its strategic location in the Atlantic Ocean, Bermuda became an important center of maritime trade and commerce. Bermudians also began to provide services to the growing number of tourists and vacationers who visited the island. Tourism, along with the finance industry, has become a major source of income for the island nation in recent times.
