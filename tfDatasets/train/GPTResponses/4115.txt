This statement is subjective and can vary based on cultural, religious, and societal norms. Some societies may view secular education as superior to religious education, while others may view the opposite. Additionally, the perception of education and its value may vary depending on the individual's goals and career aspirations. Therefore, it is not accurate to generalize the societal view on secular education as being necessary but inferior.
