There are various factors that can affect the thermal conductivity of a gas, including:1. Temperature: The thermal conductivity of a gas increases with an increase in temperature.2. Pressure: The thermal conductivity of a gas also increases with an increase in pressure.3. Molecular weight: The thermal conductivity of a gas is inversely proportional to its molecular weight. Gases with lighter molecules have higher thermal conductivity.4. Molecular structure: The thermal conductivity of a gas also depends on its molecular structure. Gases with simple molecular structures, such as noble gases, have higher thermal conductivity.5. Gas density: The thermal conductivity of a gas increases with an increase in its density.6. Gas composition: The thermal conductivity of a gas is also influenced by its composition. Gases with a higher percentage of molecules with polar bonds have higher thermal conductivity.
