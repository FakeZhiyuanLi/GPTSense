T roads are typically small, local roads that are used for local traffic and access to smaller communities or neighborhoods. They are usually the lowest level of roads in a highway hierarchy and may not connect to major highways or interstate roads. T roads generally have lower speed limits and are not designed for heavy traffic or long-distance travel. Instead, they serve the needs of local residents and businesses, providing access to homes, schools, shops, and other local destinations.
