The tradition and meaning of Cubism were formed by the work of two artists: Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. They were the pioneers of this new art form, developing it during the early 1900s in France. The movement was characterized by the use of intersecting planes and multiple viewpoints to create a fragmented and abstracted representation of the subject matter. This gave the viewer a sense of the subject from multiple perspectives simultaneously. The cubist movement had a profound impact on modern art, and its influence can still be seen in contemporary art today.
