The disadvantage of more critical infrastructure being controlled via computer programs is the increased risk of cyber attacks. Malicious actors can exploit vulnerabilities in software and systems to gain unauthorized access to critical infrastructure, causing disruption, damage, and potentially endangering human lives. Additionally, reliance on technology can make systems more vulnerable to physical damage or power outages, which could also impact critical infrastructure. Finally, the complexity of computer programs and the potential for human error in programming, maintenance, and operation can also increase the risk of failures and accidents.
