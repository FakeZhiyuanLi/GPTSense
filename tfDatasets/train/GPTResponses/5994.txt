Constans was a Byzantine Emperor who ruled from 641 to 668. When he died, there was a power struggle for the throne between his two sons, Constantine IV and Heraclius. This struggle weakened the Byzantine Empire and made it vulnerable to attacks from its enemies, including the Arabs and Bulgars. It also caused instability within the government and the military, leading to a period of political and social unrest. Eventually, Constantine IV emerged as the victor and became the new emperor, ruling from 668 to 685.
