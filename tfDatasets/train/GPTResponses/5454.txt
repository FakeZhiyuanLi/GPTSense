The Eritrean-Ethiopian war of 1998-2000 was mainly caused by a longstanding border dispute between the two countries. The border dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea dates back to their colonial era, as both countries were part of Italian East Africa until 1941.After gaining independence from Ethiopia in 1993, Eritrea claimed the town of Badme, a border town which was historically part of Ethiopia. Ethiopia rejected Eritrea's claim and mobilized its military to retake the town, leading to armed clashes between the two countries.The conflict escalated as both countries increased their military presence along the border and engaged in intermittent battles that resulted in significant loss of lives on both sides.Other factors that contributed to the war include economic competition, ethnic tensions, and political differences. Ethiopia accused Eritrea of supporting separatist groups in Ethiopia, while Eritrea accused Ethiopia of interfering in its internal affairs and supporting rebel groups.Attempts by regional and international organizations to mediate and resolve the conflict were unsuccessful until the Algiers Agreement was signed in 2000, which ended the fighting but did not resolve the underlying issues. The border dispute between the two countries remains unresolved to this day.
