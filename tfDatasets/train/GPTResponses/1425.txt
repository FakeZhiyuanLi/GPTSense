In Central Europe, the Slavs intermixed with various Germanic tribes, such as the Bavarians, the Thuringians, and the Saxons. They also came into contact with the Avars and the Hungarians. Additionally, in some areas, there were also significant populations of non-Slavic groups like the Balts and the Finno-Ugric peoples.
