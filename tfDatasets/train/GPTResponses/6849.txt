Edward VIII gave up the throne of England in order to marry Wallis Simpson, who was an American socialite and twice-divorced. At the time, the Church of England did not allow divorced people to remarry if their former spouse was still alive. Edwardâ€™s decision to marry Simpson caused a constitutional crisis in Britain, and eventually led to his abdication in 1936. The couple married in France in 1937 and were known as the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.
