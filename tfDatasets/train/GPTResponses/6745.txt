The distinguishing design element in German Gothic cathedrals is the emphasis on height and verticality, achieved through the use of pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and slender columns or piers. The use of stained glass windows and intricate stone carvings also add to the overall aesthetic of the cathedrals. Another characteristic feature of German Gothic architecture is the use of external buttresses to support the weight of the high vaulted ceilings.
