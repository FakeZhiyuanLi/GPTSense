Lyrics are typically sung in the language of the song's origin. For example, songs from English-speaking countries such as the United States, England, and Australia are sung in English, while songs from Spanish-speaking countries such as Mexico, Spain, and Argentina are sung in Spanish. However, some songs may contain lyrics in multiple languages, particularly if the artist or producer is bilingual or the song is a collaboration between artists from different countries.
