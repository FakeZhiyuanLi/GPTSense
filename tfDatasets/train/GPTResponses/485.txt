The Second World War led to the increased popularity of institutes of technology and polytechnics. During the war, there was a need for skilled technicians and engineers who could contribute to the war effort. The governments of several countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany, invested in the establishment and expansion of technical and vocational education institutions to meet the demand for skilled workers.After the war, the need for technical education continued to grow, as the rebuilding of war-torn communities and the expansion of infrastructure required skilled technicians and engineers. Governments and private organizations invested in the development of new institutes of technology and polytechnics to provide training and education to meet the demand for skilled labor.As a result of these investments, institutes of technology and polytechnics became increasingly popular and important in the decades following the Second World War. They have continued to play a significant role in providing education and training in technical and vocational fields and are seen as important institutions for the development of skilled workers and the promotion of economic growth.
