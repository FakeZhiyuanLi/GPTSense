Burma is officially identified in the United States as Myanmar. However, some people still refer to the country as Burma. The U.S. government began to use Myanmar to recognize the military government's name change in 1989, but some maintain the name Burma as a way to show solidarity with pro-democracy movements and oppose the military regime.
