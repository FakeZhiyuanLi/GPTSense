During the Triassic period, reptiles, particularly archosaurs, dominated animal life. These included various types of dinosaurs, such as the small, fast Coelophysis and the massive herbivores like Plateosaurus and the early crocodilians. Other notable animals included early mammals, amphibians, and marine reptiles such as ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs.
