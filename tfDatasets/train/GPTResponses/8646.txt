Darwin notes that the embryos of many different species within the same class, such as mammals or birds, are strikingly similar to each other in their early stages of development. This suggests that these different species are descended from a common ancestor that had a similar embryonic development pattern. Darwin referred to this as embryonic recapitulation, which is the idea that the developmental stages of an organism mirror its evolutionary history.
