Uneven bars, also known as asymmetric bars, are a piece of gymnastics apparatus used by female gymnasts. They consist of two horizontal bars of different heights, with the lower bar set at approximately chest height and the higher bar set at approximately eight feet. The bars are not parallel, creating an "asymmetric" setup. Gymnasts perform a variety of acrobatic skills, swings, and releases on the bars, often switching back and forth between them. The uneven bars require great upper body strength, flexibility, and precise timing.
