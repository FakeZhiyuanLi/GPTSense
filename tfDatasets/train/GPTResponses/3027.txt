Migration mainly occurs within and between countries, particularly in developing regions such as Africa, Asia, and Latin America. However, there is also significant migration between developed countries such as the United States, Canada, and European countries. The reasons for migration can be voluntary or forced, with factors such as economic opportunities, political instability, natural disasters, and war playing a significant role.
