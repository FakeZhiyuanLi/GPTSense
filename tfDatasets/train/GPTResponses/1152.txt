It is impossible to provide a specific answer to this question as there are countless individuals who were assimilated into Arab slave owner families throughout history. However, during the Arab slave trade, which lasted from the 7th century until the 20th century in some parts of the Arab world, many African and Asian slaves were brought into Arab families as domestic servants, laborers, and concubines. In addition, there were also instances where prisoners of war or individuals from conquered territories were assimilated into Arab families.
