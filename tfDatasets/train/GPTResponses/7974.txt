Classical music became a mark of status in the courts, particularly during the Baroque and Classical periods. Many nobles and royalty employed composers and musicians to create and perform music for their entertainment, and the ability to host a grand musical performance was a sign of wealth and sophistication. Grand operas, ballets, and symphonies were commonly commissioned and performed in European courts during this time.
