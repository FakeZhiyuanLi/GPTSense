Native populations in the Hellenistic world were discriminated against by the Greeks and Macedonians who had conquered their territories. They were often persecuted, enslaved, and forced to assimilate to Greek culture and language. In addition, other non-Greek groups such as the Persians and Egyptians were also discriminated against by the Greeks during this period.
