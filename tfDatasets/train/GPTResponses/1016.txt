The Cyrillic alphabet. The brothers Cyril and Methodius, who were born in the region of Thessaloniki (present-day Greece), created the Cyrillic alphabet in the 9th century. They later traveled to Bulgaria, where they were welcomed by the ruler, Prince Boris I. The brothers and their disciples translated the Bible and other religious texts into the Old Church Slavonic language, using the Cyrillic script. This writing system was later adopted by other Slavic nations, including Russia, Serbia, and Ukraine. Today, the Cyrillic alphabet is used by millions of people around the world.
