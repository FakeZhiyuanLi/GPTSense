During the 19th century, the Danubian Principalities (Moldavia and Wallachia) were under the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire. However, they had a certain degree of autonomy and were ruled by local princes called voivodes. In 1859, the two principalities were united under the rule of Alexandru Ioan Cuza, who became the first ruler of a unified Romania.
