Sea surface temperature is often the highest in the tropical regions, especially around the equator where the sun is most intense. The warmest areas lie within the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans, with some areas having water temperatures consistently surpassing 30 degrees Celsius. For example, the Arabian Sea, the Persian Gulf, and the Red Sea typically have very high sea surface temperatures. In addition, the waters around some islands in the Pacific, such as Fiji, Samoa, and Kiribati, can also have high temperatures due to their equatorial location.
