The BCG vaccine for tuberculosis (TB) provides partial protection against the disease and is most effective in children. The length of time that the vaccine offers protection varies widely. Most studies show that it protects against severe forms of TB for 15 to 20 years, although protection against tuberculosis infection can last around 10 years. However, depending on individual immune response and other factors, the protection may last much shorter or longer, or it may wane over time. Therefore, regular testing and booster doses may be necessary in some cases.
