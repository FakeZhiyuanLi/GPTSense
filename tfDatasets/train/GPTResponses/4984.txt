Antarctica's annual precipitation along the coast is generally very low, with estimates ranging from 50 to 200 millimeters (2-8 inches) of precipitation per year. Some areas may receive slightly higher amounts of snowfall or rainfall, but the overall climate is extremely dry and cold. Inland regions of Antarctica may receive even less precipitation, with some areas being considered the driest places on Earth.
