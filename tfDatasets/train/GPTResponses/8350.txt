The "Fullwidth Forms" section of code points (U+FF01 to U+FFEF) includes a range of characters that are designed to take up the same amount of space as the standard Latin characters, but are wider and taller in appearance. These characters are typically used in East Asian typography and in some cases, in graphic design and digital media. This section includes fullwidth versions of numbers, letters, punctuation marks, symbols, and other miscellaneous characters.
