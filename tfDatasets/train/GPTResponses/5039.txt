The Carboniferous period was a geological period that lasted from about 359 million to 299 million years ago. The period was marked by a significant increase in the number and variety of plant and animal species, as well as the formation of vast coal reserves.During this period, large forests of primitive plants, such as ferns and horsetails, covered much of the land. These plants were able to grow to giant sizes thanks to the high levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide and oxygen during this time. These forests eventually formed the coal deposits that are still mined today.The Carboniferous period also saw the evolution of many new animal species, including amphibians, reptiles, and insects. Insects, in particular, experienced explosive diversification during this period, with many new species evolving to take advantage of the abundant plant life.Towards the end of the Carboniferous period, the first reptiles appeared, marking the beginning of the reptilian domination of the earth, which would last until the rise of the mammals millions of years later.
