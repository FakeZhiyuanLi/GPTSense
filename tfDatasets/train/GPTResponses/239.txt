Theravada is a school of Buddhism primarily practiced in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar. The term "Theravada" can be translated as "the way of the elders" or "the doctrine of the elders." It is based on the Pali Canon, which is the oldest and most complete collection of Buddhist scriptures. Theravada emphasizes the importance of individual effort and meditation practice in achieving enlightenment, and it is regarded as the most conservative and traditional form of Buddhism.
