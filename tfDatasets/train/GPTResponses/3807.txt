During the Mesozoic era, the dominant plant species were gymnosperms, especially conifers like cycads, ginkgos, and pines. These plants evolved adaptations to the changing climate and environmental conditions and thrived in the warm and humid climate of the time. Flowering plants, or angiosperms, also emerged during the Cretaceous period and eventually became the dominant plant group in the following Cenozoic era.
