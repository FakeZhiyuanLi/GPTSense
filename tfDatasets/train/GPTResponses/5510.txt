Edward Oxford was found guilty of high treason on April 12, 1840, for attempting to assassinate Queen Victoria. He was sentenced to be hanged, but due to concerns about his mental state, his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in a mental institution. Oxford spent the next 24 years in Broadmoor Hospital, where he was treated for mental illness. In 1864, his mental condition improved, and he was declared sane and released. Oxford was then deported to Australia, where he lived the rest of his life under an assumed name. He died in 1900 in a mental hospital in the town of Sunbury, near Melbourne, at the age of 83.
