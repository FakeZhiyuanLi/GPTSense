The fall of the monarchy in Brazil was caused by a combination of factors. One of the main reasons was the growing pressure from the republican movement, which had been gaining support throughout the 19th century. Another factor was the economic and social changes taking place in Brazil at the time, which had led to the emergence of a new class of wealthy industrialists and entrepreneurs who favored a more modern, democratic system of government.In addition, the monarchy was plagued by internal divisions and political instability, with multiple coups and political crises occurring throughout the reign of Emperor Pedro II. The government was also struggling with issues such as slavery, which was finally abolished in Brazil in 1888.Finally, a key moment in the fall of the monarchy was the military coup that took place on November 15, 1889, which removed Pedro II from power and established a provisional government that eventually led to the establishment of the Brazilian Republic.
