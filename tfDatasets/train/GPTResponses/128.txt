European imperialism was focused on the acquisition of territories and resources outside of Europe, often through the use of military force or economic coercion. European imperial powers sought to expand their empires, increase their wealth and power, and spread their cultural and political influence around the world. European imperialism was also driven by racist ideologies that justified the subjugation and exploitation of non-European peoples and cultures.
