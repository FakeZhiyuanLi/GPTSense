The formation of calcified tissues surrounding eukaryotic cells results in the formation of bone or mineralized tissue. This process is called mineralization or ossification. The collagen and elastic glycoproteins provide a framework for mineral deposition, and the minerals such as calcium and phosphate provide strength and rigidity to the tissue. Over time, these tissues can become hard and durable, providing support and protection to the body.
