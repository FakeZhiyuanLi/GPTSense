Distributing money into multiple instances discourages the concentration of wealth and encourages its equitable distribution among a larger group of people. This reduces the likelihood of a small group of individuals controlling the majority of resources and power, while increasing the potential for economic diversity and stability. Additionally, distributing money across multiple instances can help to reduce the impact of financial loss or volatility in any one particular investment or market, as the risks are spread over a wider range of opportunities.
