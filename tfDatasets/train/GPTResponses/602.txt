The type of anthropology that tries to understand the social aspects of mass media is called Media Anthropology. Media Anthropology is concerned with the study of how media technologies and practices shape and are shaped by social and cultural processes, values, and norms. It examines the production, circulation, reception, and impact of various forms of media on individuals and societies, as well as the cultural and economic contexts within which media are situated. Media Anthropology thus seeks to understand how media shape and reflect our ideas about identity, representation, power, and social change.
