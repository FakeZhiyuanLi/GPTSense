The Mudéjar architecture is a prominent influence on the design and form of Gothic cathedrals from the Iberian Peninsula. The Mudéjar style is a unique blend of Islamic and Christian architectural traditions and was prevalent in Spain during the Muslim rule. When the Christian kings conquered the Iberian Peninsula, they retained the Mudéjar style, which can be seen in the intricate designs of the cathedrals built during that period.
