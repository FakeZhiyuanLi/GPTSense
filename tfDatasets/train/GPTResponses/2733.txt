It is not clear where Virgil's name became a generic term for a magic-worker. While there is no evidence that Virgil was himself a magical practitioner, there are many legends and tales about him that associate him with magical powers, such as his ability to tame animals and control the elements. Over time, his name came to be associated with magic and the practice of magic, and in some cultures, it became a common term for a magician or wizard. However, the exact origins and evolution of the term are not well-documented.
