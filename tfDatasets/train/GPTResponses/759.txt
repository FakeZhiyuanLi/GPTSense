The financial crisis resulted in a significant recession and economic downturn across the world. Many financial institutions collapsed, and others required government bailouts to stay afloat. The public confidence in the financial system was severely shaken, and there was a decrease in lending and investment activity. The crisis led to a focus on greater transparency and regulatory oversight in financial markets to ensure that risk levels are adequately disclosed, and proper risk management is in place. The effects of the financial crisis are still felt today, with ongoing efforts to prevent a similar crisis from occurring in the future.
