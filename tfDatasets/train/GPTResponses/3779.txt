Denial of Service (DoS) attacks are designed to make a machine or network unavailable to its intended users. These attacks flood a system with a large volume of traffic or requests, overwhelming its resources and causing it to crash or become inaccessible. DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks involve multiple machines or networks working together to launch a massive attack on a single target. Other types of DoS attacks include SYN floods, UDP floods, and amplification attacks.
