Brushes need to be in contact with a surface to perform their function, whether it is to apply or remove materials, clean, polish, buff, or scrub. The type of brush, bristle or filament, and its configuration will determine the type of material or surface it can handle, the pressure and speed applied, and the effectiveness and longevity of the brush. Brushes may need to be in contact with water, oil, chemicals, or other substances, depending on the task. Proper maintenance and cleaning of brushes are necessary to ensure good contact and prevent damage or contamination.
