A filter that requires a larger margin for error is one that is used in critical applications such as in medical devices, aerospace, or defense. These filters need to have a high level of precision and accuracy to ensure the safety and reliability of the products they are used in. Any mistake or deviation in the filter's performance could cause serious consequences, therefore requiring a larger margin for error.
