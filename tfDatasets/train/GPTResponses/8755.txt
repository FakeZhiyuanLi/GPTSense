The scientist who supported Darwin's theories on evolution despite it having little impact on his own research was Thomas Henry Huxley. He was a British biologist and one of the most prominent advocates of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. He is also known as "Darwin's Bulldog" because of his vocal defense of evolution during the 19th century. Despite having little impact on his own research, Huxley devoted much of his career to promoting Darwin's ideas and becoming a champion of the theory of evolution.
