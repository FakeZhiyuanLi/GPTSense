If a wrestler does not break a hold when instructed to do so by the referee, they may receive a warning, deduction of points, or even be disqualified from the match. Additionally, if the hold is a submission move or a chokehold, the wrestler may cause serious injury or harm to their opponent. It is essential for wrestlers to follow the rules and break holds when necessary to ensure the safety and fairness of the competition.
