It varies from one developing country to another. In some countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, many children may attend fewer years of formal schooling due to factors such as poverty, distance from schools, conflict, and cultural attitudes toward education. In contrast, some developing countries in Asia, particularly those that have made significant investments in education, have achieved high rates of primary and secondary school enrollment, which have resulted in greater years of formal schooling. However, even in countries with high enrollment rates, the quality of education and the availability of education beyond primary school may be limited.
