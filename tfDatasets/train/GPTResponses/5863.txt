The belief in the existence of God and the immortal soul was not replaced in the Constitution. The Constitution does not address or promote any specific religious beliefs or ideologies. The First Amendment, however, guarantees the freedom of religion and prohibits the establishment of a state religion. This means that individuals have the right to practice any religion or no religion at all, and that the government cannot favor one religion over another or promote any particular religion. Therefore, the Constitution recognizes the diversity of religious beliefs and protects the individual's right to choose and express their own religious beliefs.
