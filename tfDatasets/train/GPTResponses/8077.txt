During the Middle Ages, the important scientific works were primarily translated into Latin for use in universities and monasteries. Latin was the language of scholarship and education throughout Europe, and most educated individuals could read and write in this language. However, in later centuries, some scientific works were also translated into the vernacular languages of various European countries, such as English, French, German, and Italian.
