There were several scholars who challenged the early Islamic philosophy's views, including:1. Al-Ghazali (1058-1111 CE): He was a prominent scholar who rejected the Greek philosophical influences on Islamic thought and argued for a more traditionalist approach to Islam.2. Ibn Taymiyyah (1263-1328 CE): He criticized the use of Aristotelian philosophy in Islamic theology and emphasized the importance of the Quran and Sunnah as the primary sources of Islamic knowledge.3. Ibn Rushd (1126-1198 CE): He was a philosopher who attempted to reconcile Aristotelian philosophy with Islamic theology, but his views were criticized by conservative scholars who saw him as too influenced by Greek philosophy.4. Al-Farabi (872-950 CE): He combined elements of Aristotelian philosophy and Islamic theology to create a new system of thought, but his views were also challenged by traditionalist scholars who saw him as deviating from traditional Islamic teachings.
