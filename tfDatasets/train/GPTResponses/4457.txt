There is no clear answer to this question as the ancestry of Hrothgar is not extensively documented in the original Old English text of Beowulf. However, it is noted that Hrothgar is a descendant of the Danish king Scyld Scefing, who was found as a baby and adopted by a group of Norse warriors. Therefore, it could be assumed that Hrothgar's ancestor was also a member of Scyld Scefing's lineage and was possibly also adopted at some point in his life.
