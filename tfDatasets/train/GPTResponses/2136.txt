Latewood.While the formation of earlywood is relatively well understood, the formation of latewood is still an area of active research and debate among scientists. Latewood is the darker, denser part of a tree ring that forms later in the growing season when environmental conditions may be different. The formation of latewood is thought to be influenced by a combination of factors, including temperature, moisture, and resource availability. However, the precise mechanisms that lead to the formation of latewood in different tree species and environments are still being studied.
