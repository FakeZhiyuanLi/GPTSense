Capacitors are used for power factor correction in scenarios where the power factor of a circuit is low. This usually occurs in systems that have a lot of inductive loads, such as motors, transformers, and fluorescent lighting. These loads can cause the current to lag behind the voltage, resulting in a low power factor.Capacitors are connected in parallel with the loads to generate reactive power, which counteracts the lagging current and improves the power factor. This results in a more efficient use of electrical power, increases the capacity of the system, and reduces the cost of energy consumption.Power factor correction using capacitors is commonly used in industrial, commercial, and residential applications to improve the efficiency of power usage and reduce energy waste.
