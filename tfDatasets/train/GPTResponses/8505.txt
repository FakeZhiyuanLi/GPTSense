Adam Smith's work primarily covered economics and political philosophy, particularly the theory of free market capitalism. His most famous work, "The Wealth of Nations," published in 1776, explored the idea that a free market economy, guided by the invisible hand of self-interest, would lead to the greatest wealth and prosperity for society as a whole. He also wrote extensively on other topics such as ethics, psychology, and education.
