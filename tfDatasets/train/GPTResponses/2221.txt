The doctrine of terra nullius was overturned by Mabo v Queensland, which established the concept of native title. Terra nullius refers to the legal principle that land can be considered "nobody's land" until it is claimed by a European power, disregarding the prior ownership and occupation by Indigenous peoples. The Mabo decision recognized the prior existence of Indigenous land rights, dating back to their traditional laws and customs.
