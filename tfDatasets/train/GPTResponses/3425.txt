The NASA Program that benefited from the use of decision science applications is the Mars Exploration Program. The program utilized decision science techniques and tools to make informed decisions on mission planning, resource allocation, risk management, and other critical aspects of the program. Decision science helped NASA to optimize its resources, minimize risks, and increase the chances of success in its Mars missions.
