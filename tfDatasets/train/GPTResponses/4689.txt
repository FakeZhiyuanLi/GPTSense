Copper has been expanded to include its use in interior design, particularly in kitchen and bathroom decor. Copper is used for kitchen sinks, faucets, range hoods, and countertops. It is also used in bathroom fixtures such as sinks, showerheads, and bathtubs. Additionally, copper is used for decorative items such as light fixtures, mirrors, and accessories like candle holders and vases. Its warm and inviting color adds character and style to interior spaces.
