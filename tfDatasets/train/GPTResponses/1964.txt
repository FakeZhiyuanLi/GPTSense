Copra is the dried kernel or meat of a coconut, which is commonly used to extract coconut oil. It is obtained by cutting open the coconut, removing the white fleshy part, and letting it dry in the sun or a dry kiln. Copra is widely produced in tropical countries and is an important agricultural commodity. It is used for various purposes, such as making soaps, cosmetics, food products, and animal feed.
