The governing body of a country, such as its constitution, laws, and elected officials, typically govern things such as military, money, foreign relations, and other aspects of national policy. In a democratic system, the executive branch, legislative branch, and judicial branch work together to make decisions and policies that affect these areas. The military may have its own specific regulations and reporting structure, but ultimately answers to civilian leadership. The central bank and department of treasury oversee financial matters, while the State Department and other diplomatic agencies manage foreign relations.
