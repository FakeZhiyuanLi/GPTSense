Immunology began to become codified as a scientific theory in the late 19th century, when scientists such as Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch began to develop the germ theory of disease. This theory proposed that diseases were caused by specific microorganisms, and that the body's immune system could be harnessed to fight these invaders. The discovery of antibodies by Paul Ehrlich in the early 20th century further solidified the foundation of immunology, and laid the groundwork for the development of vaccines and other treatments that use the body's own immune system to fight off disease.
