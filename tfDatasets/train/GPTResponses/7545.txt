The entire connecting assembly of a USB connector is often protected by a molded plastic or metal casing. This casing not only provides a physical barrier against damage or exposure to the elements, but it also helps to hold the connector in place and prevent accidental disconnection. Additionally, many USB connectors have additional features such as integrated strain relief or locking mechanisms to further protect and stabilize the connection.
