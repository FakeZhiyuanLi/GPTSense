During the financial crisis of 2008, many financial institutions were bailed out by various governments and central banks around the world. In the United States, the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) was created to provide bailout funds to banks deemed "too big to fail." The Federal Reserve also provided aid to financial institutions through various programs. Other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Germany, and France, also provided bailout funds to their financial institutions.
