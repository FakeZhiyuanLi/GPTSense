was known as the "Jewish quarter" of cities and towns. These were often overcrowded and impoverished areas that were isolated from the rest of society. Laws and attitudes towards Jews also contributed to their exclusion from mainstream society. For example, in many places they were barred from certain professions and faced discrimination in education and housing.Additionally, the maintenance of Jewish customs and traditions, such as language, religion, and marriage practices, also contributed to the separation of the Jewish community from the majority culture.Overall, the lack of assimilation of Jews in Central and Eastern Europe was a complex issue that was influenced by social, cultural, and political factors.
