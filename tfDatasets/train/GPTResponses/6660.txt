Once the president signs a bill into law, it becomes enforceable and goes to the Office of the Federal Register. The Office of the Federal Register publishes the law and makes it available to the public on the Government Printing Office's website. The law is then added to the United States Code, which is a compilation of all federal laws currently in effect. Finally, the law is enforced by the appropriate federal agencies and departments.
