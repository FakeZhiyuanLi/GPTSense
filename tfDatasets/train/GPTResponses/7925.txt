The patrilineal nature of succession in Japan allowed the paternal line of the imperial family to gain influence over royal succession. According to traditional Japanese law and customs, only males born into the imperial family as descendants of the reigning emperor could succeed to the Chrysanthemum Throne. This meant that the paternal line carried significant weight in determining the next emperor, as the father often played a key role in transmitting the family's heritage and values to his son. Additionally, the paternal line could also consolidate power by strategically marrying their daughters to influential nobles and allies, thereby expanding their political influence and securing favorable succession outcomes.
