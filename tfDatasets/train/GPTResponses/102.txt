There are many groups of people who are often left out of the colonialism debate, including:1. Indigenous peoples: Indigenous peoples around the world who have historically experienced colonization, dispossession of land, forced assimilation, and cultural genocide are often excluded from discussions of colonialism.2. African countries: While some regions of Africa were colonized by European powers, there are many countries in Africa that experienced colonization by other powers, such as the Ottomans and Arabs.3. Southeast Asia: Many Southeast Asian countries were colonized by European powers, such as the Dutch and British.4. Latin America: Although it is often discussed as a post-colonial region, Latin America was heavily colonized by Spanish and Portuguese powers for centuries.5. Caribbean nations: Similar to Latin America, many Caribbean nations were colonized by European powers and have a complex history with colonialism.6. Pacific Island nations: Numerous Pacific Island nations, such as Fiji, were colonized by European powers, resulting in cultural disruption and economic exploitation.7. Middle Eastern countries: Many Middle Eastern countries have experienced some form of colonialism, particularly during the 19th and 20th centuries, but this is not often included in discussions of colonialism.
