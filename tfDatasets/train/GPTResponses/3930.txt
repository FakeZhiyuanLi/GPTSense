The group referred to in this statement is likely a group of marginalized or vulnerable individuals such as immigrants, refugees, or minorities. Due to their social and economic disadvantage, they may have been taken advantage of by those in positions of power or authority, such as employers or landlords. Without legal protection or recourse, they may have been forced to endure mistreatment or exploitation without any means of seeking justice or redress. This lack of protection can perpetuate cycles of poverty and discrimination, exacerbating existing social inequalities.
