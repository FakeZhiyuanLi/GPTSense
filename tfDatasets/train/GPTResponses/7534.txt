Tuberculosis (TB) is relatively uncommon but still present in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there were 8,920 cases of TB reported in the United States in 2019. However, the majority of these cases occurred in certain high-risk groups such as individuals born in countries with high TB rates, individuals experiencing homelessness, and individuals with compromised immune systems. Overall, TB incidence rates have been declining in the United States in recent years.
