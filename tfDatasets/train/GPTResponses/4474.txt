Boiling sweet wort is an essential step in the brewing process that helps to sanitize the wort and extract flavors and bitterness from hops. It doesn't necessarily destroy anything in the wort, but it does cause changes to the composition of the wort. During boiling, proteins in the wort denature and coagulate, and enzymes that may still be active are deactivated. This helps to clarify and stabilize the wort, and it also breaks down complex carbohydrates into simpler sugars that yeast can easily ferment. Additionally, the boiling process can help to remove any unwanted flavors or compounds in the wort, such as DMS (dimethyl sulfide).
