Larger weapon systems are usually mounted on military vehicles such as tanks, armored vehicles, military trucks, and warships. They can also be installed in fixed installations such as military bases and forts. Additionally, some larger weapon systems like missile defense systems and long-range artillery can be placed in portable hardpoints or deployed in the field on a temporary basis.
