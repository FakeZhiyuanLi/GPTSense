To be classified as extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), the TB bacteria must be resistant to at least four of the main TB drugs: isoniazid, rifampicin, a fluoroquinolone, and at least one of three injectable second-line drugs (amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin). This means that the minimum number of second-line medication classes that the TB bacteria would have to resist is one of these three injectable second-line drugs, in addition to the resistance to the first-line drugs isoniazid and rifampicin and a fluoroquinolone.
