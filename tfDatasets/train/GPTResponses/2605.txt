The Enhanced Definition Television (EDTV) format was viewed by some as an enhanced television format and not true HDTV format. EDTV has a resolution of 480p, which is an improvement over standard definition television but still lower than the 720p or 1080p resolution of true HDTV formats. EDTV was marketed as a more affordable option for consumers who wanted higher quality picture but were not willing to pay the high prices of HDTVs.
