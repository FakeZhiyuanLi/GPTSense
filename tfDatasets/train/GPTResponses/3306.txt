Capitalization of significant words is also applied to proper nouns, such as the names of people, places, and institutions (e.g. John Smith, New York City, Harvard University) acronyms and initialisms (e.g. NASA, FBI, CEO) and important events, periods, and movements (e.g. World War II, the Renaissance, the Civil Rights Movement). Additionally, some style guides recommend capitalizing certain common nouns that refer to specific regions or populations (e.g. the West, the South, African Americans).
