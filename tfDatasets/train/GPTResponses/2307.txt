Women were granted status as abbesses in Christian societies during the Middle Ages. These women were leaders of religious communities known as abbeys, which were often home to both men and women who wished to live a life devoted to prayer and contemplation. As abbesses, these women had authority over the members of their community and were respected for their spiritual knowledge and leadership.
