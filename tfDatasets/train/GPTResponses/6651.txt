This is a difficult question to answer definitively because towers can be found detached from main buildings in many countries around the world for a variety of reasons. However, one possible answer is Italy, where many ancient freestanding towers called "torre" can be found in cities such as Florence, Pisa, and San Gimignano. In some cases, these towers were built separately from the main buildings for defense or status purposes, while in other cases they were added later as architectural features.
