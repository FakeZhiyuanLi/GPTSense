Using VBR (variable bit rate) instead of a constant bit rate encoding makes the bit rate less predictable, as the encoding process adjusts the bit rate based on the complexity of the audio signal being encoded. This means that portions of the audio with less complexity will be encoded with a lower bit rate, while more complex portions will be encoded with a higher bit rate. This results in a more efficient use of the available data rate and improves the overall quality of the encoded audio. However, because the bit rate is variable, it is more difficult to predict the exact size of the resulting file.
