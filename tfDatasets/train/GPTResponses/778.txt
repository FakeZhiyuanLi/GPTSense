The Buddhist doctrine of impermanence states that all things in the world are constantly changing, and nothing is permanent or fixed. Life expresses impermanence in various ways, including:1. Birth and death: Human life is transitory and limited, and all beings eventually experience death.2. Ageing: As time passes, everything, including living beings, undergoes decay and ageing.3. Changing circumstances: Life is full of unpredictable changes, such as changes in health, relationships, and financial status.4. Seasons and natural cycles: The changing seasons and natural cycles of the earth demonstrate the impermanence of all things.5. Impermanence of emotions and thoughts: Emotions and thoughts are constantly changing, and they come and go like waves in the ocean.6. Impermanence of material possessions: Material possessions are also subject to decay and deterioration over time.In essence, everything in life is impermanent and constantly changing, and the Buddhist doctrine of impermanence reminds us to accept and embrace change, rather than resist or cling to what is passing.
