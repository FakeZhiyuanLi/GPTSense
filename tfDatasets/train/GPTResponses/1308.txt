The fallen empires of the 19th century, namely the Ottoman Empire, Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the Qing Dynasty in China, were replaced by several new political entities. In the Middle East, the British and French drew up new national borders, creating the modern states of Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Jordan, and Palestine. In Europe, the Austro-Hungarian Empire was replaced by several new nations, including Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. The Qing Dynasty was replaced by the Republic of China (ROC) in 1912. However, the ROC was later replaced by the Communist Party of China in 1949.
