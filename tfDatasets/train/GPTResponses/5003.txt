Lancashire emerged as a major commercial and industrial region during the Industrial Revolution in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The region had natural resources such as coal and water power, which were used to power textile mills and other factories. Lancashire became a hub for textile production, with cotton mills and weaving factories dominating the landscape. This led to the growth of key towns such as Manchester, Bolton, Blackburn, and Preston as centers of industry and commerce.
