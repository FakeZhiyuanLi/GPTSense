The basis of an analysis can vary depending on the context and purpose of the analysis. However, in general, an analysis is based on data, information, evidence, or criteria that are relevant to the subject or topic being examined. This may include quantitative and qualitative data, research findings, case studies, expert opinions, historical or cultural contexts, and other relevant factors. The analysis may also involve the application of theories, models, frameworks, or methods that are appropriate for the subject or topic, and the interpretation and synthesis of the information to draw conclusions, make recommendations, or solve problems.
