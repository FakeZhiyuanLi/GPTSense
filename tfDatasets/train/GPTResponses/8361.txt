Hyperinsulinemia, which refers to high levels of insulin in the blood, can have a negative effect on the levels of several important molecules in the body, including:1. Glucose: Insulin regulates glucose levels in the blood by promoting the uptake of glucose by cells. In hyperinsulinemia, cells become resistant to insulin, leading to high blood sugar levels.2. Triglycerides: Insulin also promotes the storage of fat in adipose tissue. In hyperinsulinemia, excess insulin can lead to increased levels of triglycerides in the blood.3. HDL cholesterol: High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is considered "good" cholesterol because it helps remove excess cholesterol from the body. Hyperinsulinemia can decrease the levels of HDL cholesterol in the blood.4. Nitric oxide: Nitric oxide is an important signaling molecule that helps dilate blood vessels and improve blood flow. Hyperinsulinemia can decrease the production of nitric oxide in the body, leading to reduced blood flow and increased risk of cardiovascular disease.5. C-reactive protein: C-reactive protein (CRP) is a marker of inflammation in the body. Hyperinsulinemia can increase CRP levels, which may contribute to the development of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.
