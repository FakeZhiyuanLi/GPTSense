The FBI is required to process requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The FOIA is a federal law that provides individuals with the right to request access to records held by federal agencies, including the FBI. The FBI is required to review and process these requests in a timely and efficient manner, and to release information that is not exempt from disclosure under the law.
