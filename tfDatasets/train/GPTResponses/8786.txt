The Treaty of Verdun was signed in 843 AD between the three surviving sons of Charlemagne, who had died in 814 AD. It divided the Frankish empire into three parts, with each son receiving a portion of the land to rule.The treaty confirmed Louis the Pious' son Lothair as the ruler of the Middle Frankish Empire, which included the area of modern-day France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Italy. Charles the Bald was given the Western Frankish Kingdom, which became the precursor to modern-day France, while Louis the German was given the Eastern Frankish Kingdom, which eventually became the Holy Roman Empire.The Treaty of Verdun is significant because it marked the end of the unified Frankish Empire and the beginning of a new era of regionalism and the growth of feudalism in Europe. It also helped to shape the political, linguistic, and cultural divide in Europe that persists to this day.
