The two languages that strongly influenced Czech are German and Latin. German had a significant impact on the development of the Czech language due to the centuries-long presence of German-speaking communities in the Czech lands, which led to the adoption of many German loanwords and even grammatical structures. As for Latin, it was the language of science, scholarship, and the church in Europe for many centuries, and therefore had a considerable impact on the development of Czech vocabulary, especially in scientific and religious areas.
