The pencil test is a controversial, informal test to determine if a person is of mixed race heritage. It involves placing a pencil in an individual's hair and seeing if it stays or falls out. The test relies on the notion that people of African descent have coarse, wiry hair that is more likely to cause the pencil to fall, while people of Asian or Caucasian descent have more slippery, smooth hair that will hold the pencil in place.However, the test has no scientific basis and has been widely criticized as a way to reinforce racist stereotypes about physical and racial differences. It is important to note that hair texture is not an accurate indicator of race or ethnicity, and using a pencil to test for it is both inaccurate and offensive.
