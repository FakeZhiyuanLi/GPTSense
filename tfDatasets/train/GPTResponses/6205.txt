Transliteration for computer systems uses various techniques such as:1) ASCII encoding: This is the most commonly used encoding system for transliteration. ASCII codes represent each character on a computer with a unique number, which helps in transliteration by converting one character set to another.2) Unicode: Unicode is a character encoding standard that encompasses all possible characters used in the world's scripts, including Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Arabic, and many more. This allows for easy transliteration and language processing on computers.3) Transliteration software: There are many software programs available that can perform automatic transliteration of text from one language to another. These programs use algorithms to map one script or character set to another based on predefined rules.4) Keyboard mapping: Computer keyboards can be mapped to different language scripts, allowing users to input text in one script and have it appear in another script.Overall, transliteration for computer systems employs a variety of techniques to facilitate the conversion of text between different scripts and languages.
