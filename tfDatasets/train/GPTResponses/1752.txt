The traditional social organization of the Marshall Islanders revolved around the concept of extended family units known as clans or "mattangs." Each clan was composed of several households headed by a male member of the family known as the "ijwij" or elder. The ijwij was responsible for making important decisions for the family, mediating disputes, and representing the clan in community affairs.The clans were organized into larger groups known as "dri-jele" or districts, which were headed by a chief or "imwej" chosen from one of the leading families. The imwej had greater authority and were responsible for managing the affairs of the district, maintaining order, and settling disputes.Above the districts were the "Iroij," or high chiefs, who were regarded as the ultimate authority in the Marshall Islands. The Iroij were always male and descended from a founding ancestor, and their authority was largely symbolic, however, they could also exercise influence on political and social matters.The traditional social organization of the Marshall Islanders was closely tied to their culture, customs, and traditions. These customs were observed in ceremonies and events such as "kamol≈ç" (nuptial ceremonies) and "jorej" (funerals), which were crucial in maintaining social order and cohesion.
