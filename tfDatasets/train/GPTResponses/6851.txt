Plant taxonomy was developed in order to classify and organize plants into different categories based on their physical and anatomical characteristics. This classification system helps identify and compare different species of plants, and provides a framework for understanding their relationships to one another. It also helps with identification, conservation, and cultivation of plants, and provides a common language for scientists and researchers to communicate about plants. Overall, plant taxonomy helps us better understand the diversity and complexity of the plant kingdom.
