The maximum frequency that can be accurately captured with an 8 kHz sampling rate is 4 kHz, according to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. This means that any signal with a frequency higher than 4 kHz will not be accurately represented in the digital signal, and could lead to the loss of important information. Higher sampling rates, such as 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz, are commonly used in digital audio to capture a wider frequency range and improve the fidelity of the signal.
