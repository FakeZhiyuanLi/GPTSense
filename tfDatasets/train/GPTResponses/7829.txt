The ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes is credited with determining the area under a parabola using a method called "the method of exhaustion." The method involved approximating the area with a series of rectangles of increasingly smaller widths and summing their areas to get a closer and closer approximation to the actual area. This method is considered a precursor to the modern calculus techniques developed by Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz.
