It is not specified in the question which Athanasius is being referred to, but assuming it is Athanasius of Alexandria, one of his teachers could have been Alexander of Alexandria, who was a mentor and predecessor of Athanasius as bishop of Alexandria. Alexander is also known for his role in shaping the doctrine of the Trinity and supporting the Nicene Creed.
