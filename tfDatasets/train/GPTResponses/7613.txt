The Swingle Singers primarily used their voices to emulate musical instruments. They are known for their technique of "vocal percussion" or beatboxing, where they create rhythmic patterns with their mouths to mimic the sound of drums and other percussion instruments. They also use their voices to create melodic lines that imitate the sound of instruments such as the trumpet, saxophone, and guitar.
