The modern piano did not take over any specific instrument in the Romantic era, it was actually developed as a result of improvements made to the harpsichord and clavichord in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. The piano gradually became more popular during the Classical and Romantic periods and eventually replaced earlier keyboard instruments due to its wider range of sounds and dynamic ability.
