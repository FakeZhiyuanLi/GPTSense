Most formal academic institutions, such as colleges and universities, use academic success to judge admissions. This means that factors such as high school grades, standardized test scores (such as the SAT and ACT), and coursework rigor are considered when evaluating applicants. Some private schools and selective high schools also use academic success as a primary factor in their admissions decisions.
