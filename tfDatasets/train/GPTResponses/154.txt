The Scottish Parliament has several tools at its disposal to scrutinize the Scottish Government, including:1. Parliamentary Committees: They are responsible for scrutinizing the activities of government departments and holding them accountable to the public. The committees have the power to call witnesses, hold hearings, and request documents.2. Question Time: Every week, the First Minister and other cabinet ministers answer questions from MSPs in the chamber. This provides an opportunity for parliamentarians to probe the government's policies and decisions.3. Debates and Motions: MSPs have the power to debate and vote on motions relating to government policy. This can be a useful way to highlight issues of concern and to hold the government to account.4. Freedom of Information: The Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 gives citizens the right to access information held by public authorities, including the Scottish Government. This allows MSPs and the public to scrutinize the government's activities and decision-making processes.All these mechanisms enable the Scottish Parliament to scrutinize the government and hold them accountable to the public.
