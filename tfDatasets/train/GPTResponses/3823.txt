Transferred genes can enter different types of cells, depending on the mechanism of transfer.For example, in bacterial transformation, the transferred genes can enter bacterial cells through the cell membrane. In bacterial conjugation, the transferred genes can enter bacterial cells through a specialized structure called conjugation pilus.In eukaryotic organisms, gene transfer can occur through various methods such as viral transduction, electroporation, microinjection, and gene editing techniques like CRISPR-Cas9. The transferred genes can enter different types of cells such as blood cells, muscle cells, and nerve cells, depending on the targeted tissue.
