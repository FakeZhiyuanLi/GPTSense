During the German reannexation, many French families were forced to leave their homes and belongings behind and flee to other parts of France. Some were arrested or deported to concentration camps, while others were forced to work for the German war effort. Many French children were also forcibly enrolled in German schools and were taught German culture and language. Women were subjected to forced labor, sexual violence, and abuse. Overall, the German reannexation had a profound and long-lasting impact on French families, who suffered greatly under the German occupation.
