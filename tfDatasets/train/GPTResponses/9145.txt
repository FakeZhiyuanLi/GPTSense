on the way we read and understand literary works?The evolving definition of literature has a significant impact on the way we read and understand literary works. As the definition of literature changes, so does our perspective on what literary works are and what they should be. For instance, in the past, literature was primarily defined as written works that were considered to have aesthetic or intellectual value. However, with the advent of new forms of media and the rise of digital technologies, the definition of literature has expanded to include various forms of written, visual, and oral media.This expansion of the definition of literature has led to a more diverse range of literary works and has challenged traditional notions of what constitutes literature. As a result, readers must approach literary texts with a more flexible and open-minded perspective, recognizing that literary works can take many different forms and can be created using a variety of media.Additionally, the evolving definition of literature has emphasized the importance of recognizing different cultural perspectives and voices. Literature is no longer limited to a Western canon rather, it includes stories and narratives from diverse cultural and social contexts. This has led to a more inclusive approach to studying and analyzing literature, emphasizing the value of diverse voices and perspectives.
