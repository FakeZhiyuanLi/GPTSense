Rooms 128 and 128a at the V&A Museum were designed by William Morris and his company Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co., later known as Morris & Co. The rooms are known as "The Morris Rooms" and were originally designed for the Green Dining Room of the South Kensington Museum (now the V&A Museum) in 1866. They were later relocated to their current location within the museum.
