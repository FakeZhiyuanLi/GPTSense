Literary readings are usually used in various settings, such as academic institutions, literary festivals, book clubs, libraries, and cultural centers. They may also be held in theaters, cafes, or other public spaces. The purpose of these readings is to showcase literature and allow audiences to become engaged with the written word in a deeper way. Typically, authors read excerpts from their works or offer commentary on their creative processes, providing insight into their literary themes, techniques, and meanings. Literary readings can also provide a platform for social and political commentary, as well as a forum for discussions and debates around important issues.
