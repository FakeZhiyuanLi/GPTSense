Major FBS teams can have lopsided victories against weaker opponents such as smaller and less-funded schools, teams with less experienced or skilled players, teams with poor coaching or management, or teams with a history of losing seasons. They can also have lopsided victories against opponents who have suffered injuries to key players or who are rebuilding after significant personnel changes.
