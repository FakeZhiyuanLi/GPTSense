The flaw in the color of light produced by an incandescent bulb is that it is too warm and yellowish. This is because the bulb emits light by heating a tungsten filament until it becomes white-hot, but the resulting light contains more red and yellow wavelengths than cooler light sources. This can make colors appear less true and can cause eye strain over long periods of time.
