The cracking of the ice can create various sounds and physical effects, such as loud booms, pops, groans, and creaks. It also creates cracks and fractures in the ice, which can lead to the formation of ice ridges, pressure ridges, or ice floes. Additionally, the cracking of the ice can cause vibrations and disturbances in the surrounding water or ground, which may affect nearby animals or structures.
