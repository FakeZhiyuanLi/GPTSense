Sponges typically feed by filtering food particles out of the water that flows through their bodies. They have specialized cells called choanocytes, which have flagella that move water through the sponge. As water flows through the sponge, tiny food particles are caught in the choanocyte's sticky collar and ingested as food. Sponges may also absorb dissolved organic matter directly from the surrounding water.
