The federalist model works best in large, diverse countries with a history of regional or state-based political systems, such as the United States, Canada, Australia, and India. These countries have multiple levels of government, including central and state/provincial governments with defined powers, and a constitution providing for a division of powers and responsibilities. The federalist model allows for local and regional interests to be better represented and promotes greater participation in decision-making. Additionally, it provides a checks and balances system which prevents the central government from becoming too powerful and infringing on the rights of local governments and citizens.
