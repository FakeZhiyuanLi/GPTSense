The Umayyads often left the local tax collectors in place after they conquered regions. These tax collectors were known as mukhadhdhamin and were responsible for collecting and managing the collection of tax revenue from their respective regions. This policy allowed the Umayyads to maintain a system of taxation that was already in place, which helped to ensure a steady flow of revenue into the government coffers. Additionally, it also helped to maintain stability in the conquered regions, as the people were familiar with their local tax collectors and could continue to pay taxes as they had done before the Arab conquests.
