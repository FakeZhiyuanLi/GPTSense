Darwin theorizes that different species exhibit a variety of traits and characteristics which have arisen through the process of natural selection. He proposes that these variations are a result of random genetic mutations and are selected for or against based on their ability to enhance an organism's survival and reproductive success in its environment. Over time, as successful traits are passed down through generations, new species may arise from previously existing ones, each with their own unique assortment of traits and characteristics. This process of evolution through natural selection leads to a vast array of diversity in the natural world.
