There is no specific record of who ordered the composition of the hymn that first mentioned the Somalis. It is likely that the hymn was written by a missionary or a Christian believer who had encountered Somalis and was inspired to write about them in a religious context. The hymn may have been composed during the late 19th or early 20th century when Christian missionaries began evangelizing in Somaliland, which was then a British protectorate.
