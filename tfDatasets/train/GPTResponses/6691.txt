Pope Pius XII was accused of not condemning the atrocities committed during the Holocaust, specifically the mass extermination of Jews by Nazi Germany. Some critics claim that the Pope did not speak out enough against Nazi Germany's actions, even when reports of the genocide were widely known. However, defenders of Pius XII argue that he worked behind the scenes to help rescue and protect Jews, and that open condemnation could have put those efforts at risk. The controversy over Pius XII's actions during the Holocaust remains a contentious issue among historians and scholars.
