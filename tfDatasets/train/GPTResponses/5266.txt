During the reign of King Aretas IV (9 BC â€“ 40 AD), Nabatean culture began to show Greek influence. King Aretas IV was known for his support of Greek philosophy and culture, and he invited Greek scholars and artists to his court. This led to the adoption of Greek language, literature, and art in Nabatean society. Furthermore, King Aretas IV built a public library in his capital city of Petra, which housed Greek and Latin books alongside Nabatean works. This cultural exchange with Greece had a lasting impact on the Nabatean civilization, and their culture continued to evolve with influences from both the East and the West.
