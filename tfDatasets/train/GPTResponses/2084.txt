Historical linguistics describes how factors of languages change over time. It examines how languages evolve and diversify over centuries and millennia, including the sound, grammar, and vocabulary changes that occur as languages come into contact with other languages or as they are impacted by socio-cultural and historical factors. Historical linguistics also studies language families and reconstructs proto-languages, or the hypothetical ancestor languages from which modern languages have developed.
