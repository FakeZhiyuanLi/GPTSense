Theorists in diverse fields began to notice that there were similarities between the way animals communicate and human languages. They observed that animals, like humans, use sounds, gestures, and body language to communicate with others of their species. They also observed that animals have their own unique systems of communication, with different species using different types of vocalizations or physical signals to convey different messages. Additionally, researchers noted that animals are capable of learning and adapting to new forms of communication, suggesting a degree of intelligence and cognitive ability akin to that seen in human language acquisition. Overall, these observations led theorists to see parallels between the structure and function of animal communication and human language, and to speculate on the evolutionary origins of language in the animal kingdom.
