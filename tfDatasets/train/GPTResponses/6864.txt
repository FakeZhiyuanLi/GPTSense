One example of a popular feud is the ongoing feud between pop singers Taylor Swift and Kanye West. The feud started in 2009 when Kanye West interrupted Taylor Swift's acceptance speech at the MTV Video Music Awards. Since then, the two have exchanged disses in their music and social media posts. The feud was reignited in 2016 when Kanye West released a song with lyrics referring to Taylor Swift, which she publicly denounced.
