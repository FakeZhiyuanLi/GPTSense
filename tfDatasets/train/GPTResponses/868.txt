This question is a little unclear, but it sounds like you're asking for the name of the philosopher who believed that the process of thought and the reality it represents are difficult to understand because we have to separate them from our normal way of thinking.There are likely multiple philosophers who have explored this idea, but one who comes to mind is Martin Heidegger. Heidegger believed that our everyday understanding of reality is based on what he called "ready-to-hand" or "present-at-hand" knowledge, which doesn't fully capture the essence of things as they really are. He argued that we need to engage in deep, contemplative reflection in order to access more fundamental modes of being that are obscured by our habitual ways of thinking. This involves a kind of "deconstructing" or "uncovering" of our preconceptions about reality, which can be a difficult process.Another philosopher who explored similar themes is Immanuel Kant. Kant believed that our perception of reality is shaped by our innate categories of understanding, which are imposed on raw sensory data in order to make sense of it. He argued that we can never know things-in-themselves, but only the phenomena that we construct through our conceptual frameworks. This means that our understanding of reality is always mediated by our thought processes, which can be a barrier to truly knowing the world as it really is.There are likely many other philosophers who have explored similar themes in different ways, but hopefully this gives you a starting point!
