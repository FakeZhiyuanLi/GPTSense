Orthodox women typically dress modestly, with clothing that covers their entire body, except for their face, hands, and feet. This includes wearing long skirts or dresses that reach the ankle, long sleeves, and high necklines. Some may also wear head coverings, such as scarfs or hats. The clothing is loose and not form-fitting, as modesty is key in Orthodox Jewish culture. Colors and materials vary depending on the occasion and personal preference, but clothing is generally more conservative and reserved.
