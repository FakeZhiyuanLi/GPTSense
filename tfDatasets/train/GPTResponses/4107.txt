The lunar calendar was used to calculate the phases of the moon and the timing of religious and cultural events, such as Ramadan, Chinese New Year, and the Jewish High Holy Days. It was also used to determine planting and harvesting seasons, as well as hunting and fishing times. Additionally, early astronomers used the lunar calendar to track the movement of the moon and stars to make predictions about celestial events.
