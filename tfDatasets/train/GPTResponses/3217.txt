Somali women may wear a variety of footwear during Eid, depending on personal preference and the level of formality of the celebration. Some common options include sandals or open-toed shoes, traditional Somali slip-on shoes called baati or babouches, or more formal closed-toe shoes such as pumps or heels. It is also common for women to wear henna or other decorative adornments on their feet during Eid.
