The greater threat of disease transmission can depend on various factors such as the type of disease, mode of transmission, prevalence in the population, and the susceptibility of individuals. Generally, diseases that are highly contagious and have airborne or droplet transmission, such as COVID-19, pose a greater threat to disease transmission. Other factors that can increase the risk of disease transmission include overcrowded and unsanitary living conditions, poor hygiene practices, and lack of access to healthcare. However, it is important to note that even diseases with low transmission rates can pose a significant threat if left unchecked or untreated.
