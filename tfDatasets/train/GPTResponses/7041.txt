A power factor of 1 means that the voltage and current in an electrical circuit are in phase and the circuit is using energy efficiently without any loss or wastage. It indicates that all the electrical power delivered by the source is being effectively used by the load without any reactive power component. A power factor of 1 is the ideal situation for electrical systems as it minimizes utility costs and reduces energy losses.
