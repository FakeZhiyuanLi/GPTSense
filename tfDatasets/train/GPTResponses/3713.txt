Older operating systems used different methods to mark the end of text, depending on the specific system and its software. Some common methods included using a specific character or code, such as the ASCII code for end-of-text (ETX) or the control character for null (NUL). Other systems used a specific combination of characters, such as a carriage return and line feed (CR/LF) combination, or a line feed (LF) only. The specific method used depended on the system, its software, and its intended purpose.
