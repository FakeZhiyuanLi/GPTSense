Population density is a constant that can create disparities in analysis by way of distribution over differing land areas. If two cities have different population densities, it can affect how resources are distributed, how public transportation systems are designed, and even social and cultural norms. For example, if one city has a high population density, there may be a greater need for public transportation and smaller living spaces, while a city with a lower population density may have more space for individual homes and fewer transportation options. These differences can greatly impact the analysis of social and economic factors in each city.
