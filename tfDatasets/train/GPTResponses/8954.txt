The population of Detroit shifted to the suburbs and other parts of the country in the second half of the 20th century due to various factors such as the decline in the auto industry, racial tensions, and urban unrest. Many people left for better economic opportunities, affordable housing, and safer neighborhoods. This resulted in a significant decrease in Detroit's population, from a high of over 1.8 million in the 1950s to around 670,000 in 2019.
