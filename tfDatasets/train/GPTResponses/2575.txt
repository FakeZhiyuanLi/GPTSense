Guinea-Bissau has a history of political instability, military coups, and civil war since independence. The country gained independence from Portugal in 1973 after a long and bloody struggle. However, its post-independence era was marred by political instability, corruption, poverty, and harsh living conditions. The country's first president, Luis Cabral, was overthrown in a military coup in 1980, and the country was ruled by a military junta until 1994. Since then, Guinea-Bissau has experienced several coups, political assassinations, and civil wars, making it one of the most politically unstable countries in Africa. The ongoing instability has severely hindered economic development and is a major impediment to Guinea-Bissauâ€™s long-term peace and stability.
