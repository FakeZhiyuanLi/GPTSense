One primitive trait that is present even in non-migrating birds is the presence of feathers. Feathers are a hallmark of birds and are a characteristic feature that has been present in their evolutionary history since the earliest bird-like dinosaurs. Feathers serve multiple functions, including insulation, aerodynamics for flight, and display for courtship and territorial defense. Even non-migrating birds have retained this primitive trait as feathers continue to provide them with important benefits.
