The von Neumann architecture is named after John von Neumann, a Hungarian-American mathematician, physicist, and computer scientist. The von Neumann architecture is a computing structure that consists of a central processing unit (CPU), memory, input/output (I/O) devices, and a bus that connects them all. This architecture is widely used in modern computers as well as in many other electronic devices.
