The characters with macron and acute accents should be displayed as follows:1. Macron accent (ā, ē, ī, ō, ū): A horizontal bar placed over the vowel, extending to the right and left of the letter.2. Acute accent (á, é, í, ó, ú): A diagonal line placed above the vowel, slanting from the bottom left to the top right of the letter.For example, the word "māori" should be displayed with a macron over the "a" to signify a long vowel sound, and the word "papá" should be displayed with an acute accent over the second "a" to signify a stressed syllable.
