One of the effects of having employers cut jobs and closing plants in Detroit was a significant increase in unemployment and poverty rates. Without job opportunities in the city, many Detroit residents were left without a source of income and struggled to make ends meet. This also led to a decrease in the city's tax revenue, making it harder for local government to provide essential services and maintain infrastructure. It contributed to the overall economic decline of the city and resulted in a large-scale population loss.
