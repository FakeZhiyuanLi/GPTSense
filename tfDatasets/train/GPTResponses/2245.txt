Leapfrog migration refers to the pattern of migration where migrants skip the nearest, logical destination and move on to a more distant one. This can occur for several reasons, such as political instability, lack of economic opportunities, or a desire to join friends or family in a particular location. For example, migrants from South Asian countries may bypass closer destinations in Europe and instead move to the United States or Canada, where they perceive better job opportunities and quality of life. This type of migration can lead to unique settlement patterns and demographic shifts in destination countries.
