There are several species that have declined due to hunting in Afghanistan and Asia, including:1. Snow leopard - These elusive cats have been hunted for their fur and bones, which are highly valued in traditional medicine.2. Siberian tiger - Habitat loss and poaching for their skin and organs have caused a decline in their numbers.3. Markhor - These wild goats have been hunted for their impressive horns, which are a prized trophy.4. Asiatic black bear - These bears have been hunted for their bile, which is used in traditional medicine.5. Indian rhinoceros - These large mammals have been poached for their horn, which is a valuable commodity in some Asian cultures.Overall, the decline of these species is a result of illegal hunting and trade driven by demand for their parts and products.
