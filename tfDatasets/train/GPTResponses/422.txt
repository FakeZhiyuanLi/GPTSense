The amount of hot water that can be produced by solar heating systems in low geographical latitudes depends on various factors such as the size of the system, the amount of sunlight available, and the temperature of the water required. However, in general, solar heating systems in low latitudes can produce a significant amount of hot water as they receive ample sunlight throughout the year. In areas with high solar radiation, such as the Middle East and North Africa, solar heating systems can produce hot water at temperatures of over 60°C (140°F) throughout the year. On average, a typical solar water heater system in low latitudes can produce about 60-70% of a household's hot water needs.
