The theoretical maximum efficiency of reflective capsule bulbs, also known as halogen bulbs, is approximately 40%. This is because they operate at high temperatures, and a significant amount of the energy input is lost as heat radiation. However, in practice, the efficiency of these bulbs is typically lower due to losses from the reflector, filament, and other factors.
