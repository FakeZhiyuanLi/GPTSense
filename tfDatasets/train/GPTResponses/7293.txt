A governor is a device that regulates the speed of an engine. If an engine is running too fast, a governor can slow it down by controlling the flow of fuel or air to the engine, or by limiting the throttle opening. The exact method of adjustment will depend on the type of engine and governor system in use. The governor may need to be adjusted or replaced to ensure the engine runs at the proper speed. If the governor is not functioning properly or has failed, it may need to be repaired or replaced by a qualified technician.
