Thomas Aquinas is said to have helped Albertus Magnus bring the Aristotelian curriculum to Dominican classrooms. Aquinas was a Dominican friar and theologian who studied and wrote extensively on Aristotle's works, using them to develop his own philosophy and theology. Albertus Magnus was Aquinas's teacher and mentor, and the two were instrumental in introducing Aristotelianism to theological education in the medieval period. Together, they helped shape and define the field of scholasticism, which was heavily influenced by Aristotelian thought.
