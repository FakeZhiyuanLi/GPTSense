The 2013 study of Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA found no evidence to support the Khazar descent idea, which suggests that Ashkenazi Jews are descendants of Khazar converts to Judaism. The study concluded that Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA mostly originated from the Near East and Europe, with a smaller contribution from North Africa. This supports the hypothesis that Ashkenazi Jews are primarily descended from the indigenous Jewish population of the Levant (which includes modern-day Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, and Syria) and from European converts to Judaism.
