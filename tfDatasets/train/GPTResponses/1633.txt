The type of construction often used now to build homes in much of the world is conventional wood frame construction. It involves creating a wood frame structure consisting of walls, floors, and a roof. The wooden frame is then covered with sheathing and insulation, followed by exterior cladding and interior finishes. This type of construction is quick and cost-effective, making it a popular choice for residential construction. However, there has been a growing interest in alternative construction methods such as modular, prefabricated, and sustainable building practices.
