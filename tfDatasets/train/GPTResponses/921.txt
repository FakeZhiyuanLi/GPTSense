Special relativity predicts that matter can be converted into energy, and vice versa, through the famous equation E=mcÂ². This means that matter can disappear by converting into energy, and energy can also be transformed back into matter under the right conditions. This discovery led to the development of nuclear weapons and the field of nuclear energy.
