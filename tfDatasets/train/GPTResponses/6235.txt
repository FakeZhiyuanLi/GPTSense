The language texts that are as much as 70% Sanskrit are primarily found in Indian languages such as Hindi, Bengali, Gujarati, Marathi, and Tamil. These languages have borrowed extensively from Sanskrit, which is considered the mother of many Indian languages. Sanskrit has had a profound influence on Indian culture, philosophy, and literature, and its influence is evident in many aspects of daily life in India.
