The approach to Judaism that subscribes to a tradition of mass revelation is known as Orthodox Judaism. This tradition emphasizes the belief that God revealed the entire Torah to Moses on Mount Sinai in the presence of the entire Jewish people. The Torah is considered to be the written word of God and the foundation of Jewish law and practice. Orthodox Jews believe that the Torah is binding and unchanging, and its laws must be followed exactly as they were given at Sinai. This approach also emphasizes the importance of Jewish tradition and the oral law, as passed down from generation to generation.
