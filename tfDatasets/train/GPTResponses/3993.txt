Protein digestion occurs mainly in the stomach and small intestine. It begins in the stomach, where hydrochloric acid and enzymes called proteases break down proteins into smaller fragments called peptides. The partially digested food then moves to the small intestine, where enzymes called peptidases further break down the peptides into single amino acids that can be absorbed into the bloodstream and used by the body.
