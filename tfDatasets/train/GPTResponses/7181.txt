Visibility: Clothing with bright colors, reflective materials, or high-visibility strips can make the wearer more visible, reducing the risk of accidents and injuries.3. Comfort: Clothing designed for hazardous activities should be comfortable and breathable to minimize the risk of heat stress, fatigue, and dehydration.4. Insulation: Clothing can provide insulation against extreme temperatures, helping to keep the wearer warm or cool depending on the conditions.5. Barrier: Clothing can act as a barrier between the wearer's skin and hazardous materials, preventing exposure and minimizing the risk of contamination.6. Functionality: Clothing designed for hazardous activities should be functional and allow the wearer to move freely, without affecting their performance or safety.
