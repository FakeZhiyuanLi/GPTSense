The primary legal issue at the center of the suit filed against New Haven by firefighters was allegations of racial discrimination in the city's promotion process. The city had invalidated the results of a promotion exam that resulted in no black firefighters qualifying for advancement, citing concerns that the test was unfair and discriminatory. However, the white firefighters who had passed the exam argued that the city's actions violated their rights under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
