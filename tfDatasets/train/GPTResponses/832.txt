A diverse sample size provides chances for comparative study with a large range of subjects. A diverse sample size may include participants from various age groups, genders, ethnicities, socio-economic backgrounds, cultural backgrounds, educational backgrounds, and life experiences. This allows researchers to examine differences and similarities between groups and better understand how different factors may impact individuals or a specific population.
