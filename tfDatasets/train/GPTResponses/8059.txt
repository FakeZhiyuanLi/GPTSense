Charles Darwin's book "On the Origin of Species" was written for a general audience, but it was primarily aimed at educated individuals such as scientists, naturalists, and scholars. It was intended to provide evidence for his theory of evolution and to challenge the prevailing beliefs of creationism and fixity of species that were held by many religious people and scientists at the time.
