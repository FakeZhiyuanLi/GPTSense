Multipoint Control Unit (MCU) technology enables videoconferencing to connect three or more remote points. The MCU acts as a central hub that can merge multiple audio and video streams from various endpoints into a single conference call, allowing participants to see and hear each other. Additionally, modern videoconferencing software and hardware support cloud-based multipoint video calls, where the video and audio streams are routed through a secure internet connection rather than a physical MCU.
