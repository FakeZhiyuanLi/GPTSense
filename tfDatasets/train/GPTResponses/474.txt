The number of terms a person can serve as mayor varies depending on the city and country. In the United States, for example, the number of terms may be limited by local or state laws or by the city's charter. In some cities, a mayor may serve for two consecutive terms and then be required to take a break before running again, while in other cities, there may be no such term limits. It is best to check with the specific city's government to understand the term limits for their mayor.
