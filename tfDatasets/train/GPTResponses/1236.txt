Genomics allows the study of the complete genetic information or DNA sequence of an organism, including identifying and analyzing all of its genes, as well as the interactions between these genes and with the environment. It also enables the study of genetic variation and evolution, the detection of disease-causing mutations, and the development of personalized medicine and treatments. Genomics can also help in understanding genetic predispositions for complex diseases like cancers and neurological disorders.
