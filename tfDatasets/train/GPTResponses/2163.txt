More sophisticated MP3 encoders use variable bit rate (VBR) in order to target an average bit rate. VBR allows the encoder to dynamically adjust the bit rate based on the complexity of the audio being encoded. This means that simpler audio segments will use a lower bit rate to encode, while more complex segments will use a higher bit rate. This results in a higher quality audio file with a lower overall file size compared to a constant bit rate encoding.
