Chromosomes contain genetic information in the form of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), which encodes the instructions for the development, growth, and function of all living organisms. The DNA on a chromosome is organized into genes, which are the basic units of hereditary information. Each gene contains a specific sequence of DNA that codes for the production of a particular protein or RNA molecule. These proteins and RNA molecules are involved in a wide variety of cellular processes, including metabolism, growth and development, and the maintenance of proper cellular function. The DNA on a chromosome also contains noncoding regions that regulate gene expression and provide structural support for the chromosome.
