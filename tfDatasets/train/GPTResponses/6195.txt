Shipbuilding was a major industry in Seattle during World War I and World War II, from approximately 1917 to 1945. During this time, Seattle was one of the largest shipbuilding centers in the United States, producing a significant portion of the nation's wartime fleet. However, the economic master of Seattle has changed over time and is not solely based on shipbuilding today.
