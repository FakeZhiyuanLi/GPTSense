The capability of diffuse-porous woods to carry water and nutrients is spread out in the growth ring. Their vessels are evenly distributed throughout the annual ring, allowing for efficient and consistent transport of fluids. This uniform distribution of vessels also makes diffuse-porous woods less susceptible to earlywood and latewood formation, resulting in a more homogenous appearance.
