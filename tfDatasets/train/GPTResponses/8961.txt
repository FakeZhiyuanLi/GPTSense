The two Oklahoma ports, located in Catoosa and Muskogee, are connected by the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System. This system allows for commercial barge traffic to travel along the Arkansas River and connect to the Mississippi River, providing a cost-effective means of transporting goods both within Oklahoma and across the country.
