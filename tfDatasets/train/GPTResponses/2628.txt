During the later period of the Greek language script, the cursive or uncial letter forms were increasingly mixed into the script. Uncial letter forms are rounded, and cursive letter forms are joined together. This mixing of letter forms resulted in the development of the minuscule script, which is a more formal and easily readable form of Greek script. The minuscule script replaced the older script, and it was widely used for many centuries in Greece and other parts of the world.
