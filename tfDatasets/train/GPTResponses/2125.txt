In his novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, George Orwell created a dystopian world in which citizens are constantly monitored and controlled by a totalitarian government known as the Party. The world is bleak and controlled, with no individuality or freedom of thought or speech allowed. The Party's slogan "Big Brother is watching you" represents the pervasive surveillance and manipulation of citizens through propaganda and censorship. The protagonist, Winston Smith, becomes aware of the government's lies and attempts to resist the Party's control, but ultimately fails in his struggle for freedom. The book portrays a dark, oppressive world with no hope for change, highlighting the dangers of totalitarianism and the importance of personal freedom and autonomy.
