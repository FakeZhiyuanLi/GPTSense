The Mesopotamian people originated in the region known as Mesopotamia, which is located between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in modern-day Iraq. The civilization of Mesopotamia is considered to be one of the cradles of civilization, with the Sumerians being the first known people to settle in the region around 4000 BCE. Over time, Mesopotamia was home to many different peoples and empires, including the Akkadians, Babylonians, and Assyrians.
