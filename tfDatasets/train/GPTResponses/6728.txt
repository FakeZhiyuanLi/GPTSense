Incandescent light bulbs typically use more energy compared to CFLs and LED lamps. Incandescent bulbs convert only about 5% of the energy they consume into light, while the rest is emitted as heat. In contrast, CFLs and LED lamps are more energy-efficient and can produce the same amount of light using far less energy consumption. A CFL uses about 75% less energy than an incandescent bulb, and an LED lamp uses about 80% less energy.
