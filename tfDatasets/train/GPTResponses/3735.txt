There are several species that have gone extinct due to the expansion of coastal shallows, including:1. Steller's sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas) - This species was once abundant in the waters around Alaska and Russia, but was hunted to extinction in the 18th century.2. Giant ground sloth (Megalonyx jeffersonii) - This species roamed North America during the Pleistocene epoch, but became extinct around 11,000 years ago, likely due to climate change and human hunting.3. Sea mink (Neovison macrodon) - This species, which lived along the coast of New England and eastern Canada, was hunted to extinction in the 19th century due to its valuable fur.4. Schomburgk's deer (Mazama rufina) - This species, found in the Caribbean islands of Trinidad and Tobago, was driven to extinction by habitat loss and hunting.5. Caribbean monk seal (Neomonachus tropicalis) - This species, which once inhabited the waters of the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, was hunted to extinction in the 1950s due to human overexploitation.
