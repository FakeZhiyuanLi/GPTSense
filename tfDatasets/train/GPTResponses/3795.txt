One physiological change related to emotions is increased heart rate. When people experience strong emotions such as anger, fear, or excitement, their heart rate increases due to the release of stress hormones like adrenaline and cortisol. This increased heart rate prepares the body to respond to perceived threats and can result in an increase in blood pressure and respiration rate as well.
