Historically, various Christian churches and leaders have expressed concerns or objections to the seasonal drift in the date of Easter. For example, in the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD, a group of bishops attempted to standardize the date of Easter across the Christian world. In more recent times, the World Council of Churches and the Anglican Communion have also addressed the issue. Additionally, some individuals within these communities may also find the seasonal drift to be unacceptable or inconvenient.
