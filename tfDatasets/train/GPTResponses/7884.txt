the popularity of international competitions?The growth of national leagues caused a serious decline in the popularity of international competitions because top players preferred to play for their club teams rather than their national teams. The national leagues provided huge financial incentives for players, making it more attractive for them to play in domestic competitions. As a result, players were getting injured more frequently and were exhausted due to excessive playing time in club competitions, which resulted in them withdrawing from international games. Consequently, the quality of international fixtures began to suffer, and fans lost interest, leading to a decline in attendance and revenue. Additionally, the scheduling conflicts between national and club fixtures mean that top players are unavailable for international duty during crucial periods, making it difficult for countries to field their strongest teams.
