There is no specific extinction event known to be directly caused by the splitting of Pangaea. However, the breakup of the supercontinent did have significant effects on Earth's climate and ecosystems, leading to gradual ecological changes over millions of years. Some of these changes may have contributed to extinctions of certain species or groups of organisms, but they cannot be attributed solely to Pangaea's breakup.
