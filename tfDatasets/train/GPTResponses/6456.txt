1. Oil Sands - These are large deposits of sand, clay, water, and bitumen, a thick, heavy, black or brown substance that is a combination of hydrocarbons. Canada, Venezuela, and Russia have large deposits of oil sands, which are the primary source of asphalt for construction.2. Oil Shale - Oil shale is a sedimentary rock that contains kerogen, a precursor to oil, which can be converted into liquid hydrocarbons. Oil shale deposits are found in the United States, Estonia, and China.3. Tar Sands - Tar sands, also known as oil sands, are a mixture of clay, sand, water, and viscous oil called bitumen, which can be refined into asphalt or gasoline. The largest deposits of tar sands are found in Alberta, Canada.4. Natural Seeps - Asphalt can also be found naturally on the surface of the earth, where it oozes out of the ground in areas known as seeps. These seeps can be found in places like the La Brea tar pits in California, USA.5. Oil Field Residues - When crude oil is refined, asphalt can be produced as a residue. This is a secondary source of asphalt and is commonly used in the roofing, paving, and construction industries.6. Volcanic deposits - In some parts of the world, asphalt can be found in the form of natural volcanic deposits. These deposits are often formed by the solidification of molten asphaltic materials that are ejected during volcanic eruptions.
