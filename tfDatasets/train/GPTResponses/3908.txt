The gastric phase of digestion is stimulated by the presence of food in the stomach. When food enters the stomach, it is mixed with stomach acid and digestive enzymes. This triggers the release of gastrin, a hormone produced by G-cells in the lining of the stomach. Gastrin then stimulates the release of more stomach acid and digestive enzymes, which continue the process of breaking down the food. Gastrin also stimulates contractions in the stomach muscles, which helps to mix the food and move it through the digestive tract.
