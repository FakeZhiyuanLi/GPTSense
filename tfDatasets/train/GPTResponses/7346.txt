Burma (also known as Myanmar) is attempting to reach a market-oriented economy, which involves a combination of private enterprise, foreign investment, and free trade. In recent years, the government has implemented several economic reforms aimed at attracting foreign investment and improving the business environment. However, the country still faces challenges such as corruption, inadequate infrastructure, and a lack of skilled labor.
