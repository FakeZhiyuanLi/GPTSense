Moraines are accumulations of rocks, soil, and other materials, such as sand and clay, that are left behind by glaciers as they move down mountains or valleys. These deposits can vary in size and shape, ranging from small piles of rubble to massive hills or ridges, and can be found in a range of landscapes, such as valleys, plains, and mountains, depending on the nature and extent of glacial activity. There are different types of moraines, such as lateral moraines, formed along the sides of glaciers, medial moraines, formed when two glaciers merge and their lateral moraines combine, and terminal moraines, which mark the furthest advance of a glacier and are often found as long, winding hills or ridges. Moraines provide valuable geological and environmental information by indicating the past locations and movements of glaciers, and can also serve as important habitat and water sources for plants and animals.
