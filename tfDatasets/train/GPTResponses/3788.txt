The type of life that varies greatly with the elevation in the mountains is vegetation and wildlife. As the elevation increases, the temperature and climate change drastically, leading to distinct ecological zones or biomes. For example, at lower elevations, there may be lush tropical rainforests, whereas at higher elevations, one may find coniferous forests or alpine tundra. Similarly, different species of animals are adapted to different elevations, with some thriving at higher elevations and others specific to lower elevations.
