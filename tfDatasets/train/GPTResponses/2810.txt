The allowed bit rates depend on the specific settings used by the encoder, such as the audio quality level and the desired file size. Generally, the lame encoder can support a range of bit rates from 8 to 320 kbps (kilobits per second) for stereo MP3 files, and from 16 to 192 kbps for mono files. However, the recommended bit rate for high-quality MP3 files is usually between 192 and 320 kbps.
