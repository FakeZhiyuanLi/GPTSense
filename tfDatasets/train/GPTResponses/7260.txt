a long black robe (the cassock) and a white, flowing garment worn over it (the surplice). The cassock is often buttoned down the front and can have a high collar. The surplice, which is typically made of lightweight cotton or linen, is worn over the cassock and falls to just above the ankles. This traditional garb is typically worn by clergymen and altar servers in liturgical services in some Christian denominations.
