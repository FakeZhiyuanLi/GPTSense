Charles Darwin believed that the accumulation of adaptive variations over time was the driving force behind evolution. He proposed that these variations occurred randomly, and that those that were advantageous for the survival and reproduction of a species would be passed on to future generations. This process, called natural selection, would lead to the development of new species over long periods of time. Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection has been widely accepted by scientists and is one of the most important scientific theories of all time.
