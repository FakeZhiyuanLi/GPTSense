There are a few types of renewable energy sources that do not acquire their energy from the sun, such as:1. Geothermal energy: This energy is generated from the Earth's internal heat. Geothermal energy is extracted by drilling deep holes in the ground and accessing the heat produced by the Earth's molten core.2. Tidal energy: Tidal energy is generated by harnessing the natural ebb and flow of the tides. This energy can be captured by building tidal barrages, tidal fences, or underwater turbines.3. Hydroelectric energy: Hydroelectric energy is generated from the energy of falling or flowing water. This energy can be harnessed by building dams, hydroelectric power plants, or water turbines.4. Biomass energy: Biomass energy is generated from organic matter like trees, grasses, agricultural crops, and waste products. This energy can be obtained by burning these organic materials, or by converting them into biogas, biofuel, or other forms of energy.
