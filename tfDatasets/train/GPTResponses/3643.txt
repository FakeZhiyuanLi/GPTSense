The line feed function is a control character used to move the printing position to the next line in a text document. It is usually represented as "LF" or " \n " and is used in programming languages, text editors, and operating systems to create a new line or start a new paragraph. When the line feed function is encountered, it moves the cursor or printing position down to the next line, allowing for continuous text on separate lines.
