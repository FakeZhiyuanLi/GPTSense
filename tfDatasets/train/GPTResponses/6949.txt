Misdemeanors are typically considered less serious crimes and are punishable by fines, community service or short-term imprisonment of up to one year in a local or county jail, rather than a state or federal prison. Depending on the specific misdemeanor offense, the consequences may also include probation, restitution or other penalties. Misdemeanor offenses include minor drug offenses, traffic violations, disorderly conduct, petty theft, and other non-violent crimes.
