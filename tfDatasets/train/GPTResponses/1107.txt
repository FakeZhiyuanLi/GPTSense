European colonists used the term "black" to refer to people of African descent who were brought over to the Americas as slaves. The term was often used in a derogatory manner to dehumanize and denigrate enslaved Africans, and to justify their brutal treatment and exploitation by white Europeans. The use of the term "black" was also part of a broader system of racial categorization that classified people based on physical appearance and ancestry, with "blackness" often associated with inferiority and subjugation.
