Asthma should be suspected when a person experiences recurring episodes of wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. These symptoms may worsen at night or early in the morning, with exercise or exposure to certain triggers such as allergens, cigarette smoke, or air pollution. If these symptoms persist, it is important to seek medical attention to receive a diagnosis and start appropriate treatment.
