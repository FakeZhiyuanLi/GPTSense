Climate change is closely linked with changes in biodiversity. As the global climate changes, so too do the habitats, range, and behavior patterns of many species, leading to changes in biodiversity. Climate change can also exacerbate other threats to biodiversity, such as habitat destruction and pollution, leading to further declines in species populations.
