Every step of digestion requires enzymes, acids, and other digestive secretions to break down food into smaller molecules that can be absorbed by the body. It also requires muscular contractions in the digestive tract to move food along and mix it with digestive juices. Additionally, the process of digestion requires adequate intake of water and fiber to maintain proper bowel function and elimination of waste products.
