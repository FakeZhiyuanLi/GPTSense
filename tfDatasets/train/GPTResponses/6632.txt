One major factor that enabled federal law to begin expanding into other areas such as aviation, telecommunications, railroads, etc. was the growth of interstate commerce and transportation. As businesses and industries began to operate across state lines, it became increasingly important to establish federal regulations to ensure consistency and safety.Additionally, advancements in technology and communication made it easier for the federal government to oversee and regulate these industries. For example, the development of radio and later television made it possible for the government to communicate with citizens across the country on issues related to aviation and transportation.Finally, court decisions such as Gibbons v. Ogden (1824) and Wickard v. Filburn (1942) established federal authority over interstate commerce and agriculture, respectively, providing a legal basis for federal involvement in new areas.
