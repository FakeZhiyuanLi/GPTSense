Nassim Nicholas Taleb made a fortune by making a big financial bet on the market crash of 1987. He had bought out-of-the-money options on the stock market, which most investors considered to be highly unlikely to pay off. However, when the crash occurred, his options gained massive value, and he earned millions of dollars in profits. This experience helped him develop his theory of "black swan events," which states that rare and extreme events can have a disproportionate impact on financial markets and societies.
