The result of English Presbyterian congregations becoming Unitarian in doctrine can be traced back to the late 18th and early 19th centuries. One of the main factors was the influence of the Enlightenment, which emphasized reason and individual autonomy, and led many to question traditional Christian doctrines such as the Trinity. Additionally, the influence of Unitarian preachers and theologians such as Joseph Priestley and Theophilus Lindsey, as well as the formation of Unitarian societies and chapels, provided an alternative religious community for those dissatisfied with orthodox Christianity. The process of Presbyterian congregations becoming Unitarian varied over time and place, with some congregations making the transition relatively quickly, while others retained Presbyterian affiliation while adopting Unitarian beliefs.
