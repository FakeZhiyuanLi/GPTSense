Other American lodges obtain their authorizations from various Masonic Grand Lodges. Each state in the United States has its own Grand Lodge that governs and regulates the Masonic lodges within its jurisdiction. These Grand Lodges have the authority to grant charters and issue warrants to establish new Masonic lodges, and to recognize or revoke recognition of other Grand Lodges and their affiliated lodges. Additionally, there are also several unrecognized Masonic bodies that operate independently, without recognition from the mainstream Masonic community.
