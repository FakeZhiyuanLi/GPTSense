The primary role of a union is to represent and advocate for the collective rights and interests of workers. This includes negotiating with employers for fair wages, benefits, and working conditions, as well as providing support and protection to individual workers who may experience discrimination, harassment, or other workplace issues. Unions also play a role in promoting social and economic justice, and advocating for policies that improve the lives of working people and their families.
