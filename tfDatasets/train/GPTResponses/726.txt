There are various reasons why some species are becoming endangered in Portugal. Some of the major factors are:1. Habitat loss: Portugal's rapid urbanization and expansion of agriculture have led to the loss and fragmentation of natural habitats, threatening the existence of various plant and animal species.2. Climate change: The rise in global temperatures and changes in rainfall patterns can negatively impact the biodiversity of ecosystems in Portugal, leading to a decline in species populations.3. Pollution: Industrialization, intensive agriculture, and urbanization have resulted in pollution of air, water, and soil which can have adverse effects on the health and survival of species.4. Overfishing: Overfishing by commercial fisheries has led to a decline in the populations of various marine species, including some commercially important fish species.5. Poaching and illegal trade: The illegal hunting and trade of wildlife species such as birds, reptiles, and mammals have led to declining numbers of certain species, particularly those with high commercial value.6. Invasive species: The introduction of non-native species in Portugal can have severe impacts on endemic plant and animal species, threatening their survival.
