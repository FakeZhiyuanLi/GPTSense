By definition, an even number is divisible by 2. Therefore, any even number larger than 2 cannot be considered prime. This is because if a number is divisible by a number other than 1 and itself, then it is not prime.For example, 4 is an even number larger than 2, but it is not prime because it is divisible by 2 and 1. Similarly, 6, 8, 10, 12, and so on are all even numbers that are not considered prime.
