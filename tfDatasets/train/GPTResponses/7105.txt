The artificially low limit on bulb life placed by the cartel was 1,000 hours. This meant that light bulbs were designed to burn out after 1,000 hours of use, even though they could potentially last much longer. The purpose of this limit was to ensure that consumers would need to replace their bulbs more frequently, therefore increasing demand and profits for bulb manufacturers.
