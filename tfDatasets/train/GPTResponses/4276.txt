Microsoft attempted to deal with potential heat-related expansion with GPU and CPU components by designing the Xbox 360 with a unique cooling system. The console had two heat sinks and two fans, with one heat sink and fan dedicated to the GPU and another set dedicated to the CPU. This allowed for targeted cooling and prevented the components from overheating and expanding due to prolonged use. In addition, Microsoft also utilized thermal pads and paste to help dissipate heat and prevent overheating.
