None of the Western Premier was murdered in the Igbo Coup. The Igbo coup of 1966 targeted mainly Northern politicians and military officers. It was carried out by mostly Igbo army officers who were dissatisfied with the political situation in Nigeria at the time. The Western Region was not targeted in this coup. However, the aftermath of the coup resulted in a series of retaliatory coups, counter-coups, and ethnic tensions that eventually led to the Nigerian civil war.
