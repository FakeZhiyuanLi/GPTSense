Nobles held land from the king or monarch in a feudal society. The king granted land to nobles in exchange for their loyalty and military support. The nobles then would grant portions of their land to knights or vassals who would serve and protect them in battle. This system of land ownership and loyalty formed the basis of the feudal system during the Middle Ages.
