Field windings provide a magnetic field that interacts with the currents in the armature to produce torque and rotational movement in motors and generators. These windings are typically made of copper wire and are wound around the stator, which is the stationary housing of the motor or generator. The strength of the magnetic field produced by the field windings can be controlled by varying the current flowing through the windings, which allows for precise control of the motor or generator's speed and output.
