The rise in sea levels opened up new seaways, such as the Northwest Passage, which were previously inaccessible or difficult to navigate. These new routes have significant implications for shipping and trade as they provide shorter routes between Asia and Europe, allowing ships to avoid longer routes via the Panama Canal or the Suez Canal. However, the opening of these seaways also raises concerns about the environmental impact and the potential for increased shipping and oil exploration in previously untouched areas.
