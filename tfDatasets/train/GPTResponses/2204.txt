As a tree ages, its wood production generally increases. This is because the tree grows larger and has more branches and leaves, which means it can produce more energy through photosynthesis. This extra energy can then be used to grow more wood. However, there are some exceptions to this rule. Some species of trees may experience a decline in wood production as they age, especially if they are subject to stressors such as disease or damage. Additionally, environmental factors such as water availability and temperature can also impact wood production.
