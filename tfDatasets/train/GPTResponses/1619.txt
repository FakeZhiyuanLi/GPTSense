There is no specific person or group that "vanished" from the population of the Balkans. However, the region has a complex history and has seen the rise and fall of various empires and states, leading to population shifts and migrations over time. Some notable events include the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans in the 14th century, which led to the displacement of some communities, and the Balkan Wars and World War I, which caused significant population upheaval and movement.
