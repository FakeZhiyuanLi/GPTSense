Sometimes, fandoms can become toxic and divisive, with individuals resorting to personal attacks and harassment towards others who don't share the same opinions or views. In extreme cases, this can lead to cyberbullying and stalking. Additionally, some fandoms can become obsessed with their favorite celebrities or fictional characters to the point of intolerance towards any form of criticism or negative feedback. This can result in groupthink and an inability to accept differing perspectives or views.
