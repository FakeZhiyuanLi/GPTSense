Federalism is a system of government in which power is divided between a central government and various regional governments. In this system, the central government has certain powers and responsibilities while the regional governments have their own powers and responsibilities. The purpose of this system is to create a balance of power and prevent any one group or individual from having too much control over the government. Federalism is often found in countries with large geographic areas or diverse populations, and it is designed to promote local control and prevent tyranny.
