The credit for popularizing the use of the name Terra Australis to Australia goes to the Dutch explorer Willem Janszoon. He was the first European to set foot on Australian soil in 1606 and named the land "Nieu Zelandt" after the Dutch province of Zeeland. Later, the name Terra Australis was used by other explorers and cartographers to refer to the southern continent. The name Australia was officially adopted in 1824.
