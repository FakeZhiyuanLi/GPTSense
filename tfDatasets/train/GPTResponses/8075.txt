Darwin's concept of evolution became widely believed and central to the modern theory of evolution in the late 19th century, after the publication of his book "On the Origin of Species" in 1859. It took some time for the scientific community and the general public to fully accept his ideas, but by the 1870s and 1880s, evolution had become a dominant concept in biology. Today, the theory of evolution is widely accepted by scientists and is considered one of the fundamental concepts in the study of life.
