The final investment decision made by Royal Dutch Shell in May 2011 was for the construction of a floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) facility. The facility, named Prelude FLNG, was to be built off the coast of Western Australia and was designed to extract and process natural gas from offshore fields. It was expected to be the largest floating structure ever built and would produce around 3.6 million tons of liquefied natural gas (LNG) per year. The project was completed in 2017 and has been in operation since then.
