OpenType tables that allow for the selection of alternative glyph representations include:1. Glyph Substitution Table (GSUB): This table allows for the substitution of one glyph with another, based on context or user preference. For example, a font may contain alternate versions of a letter that can be substituted for the default version based on the adjacent glyphs.2. Glyph Positioning Table (GPOS): This table allows for positioning of glyphs relative to each other. This can be used to adjust the spacing between glyphs, or to place specific glyphs in certain positions based on context.3. Alternate Substitution Table (salt): This table allows for the selection of alternate glyphs for certain characters, typically for decorative or stylistic purposes. For example, a font may include alternate versions of letterforms with flourishes or ligatures.4. Stylistic Set Table (ssXX): This table allows for the selection of specific glyph sets based on user preference or application context. For example, a font may include several stylized versions of certain letters, and the stylistic set table enables users to easily switch between them.
