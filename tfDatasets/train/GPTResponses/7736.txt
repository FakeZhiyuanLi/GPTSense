The discovery of vitamin A was notable as it was the first vitamin to be discovered and isolated. It was initially described in the early 1900s as a factor in the diet necessary to prevent night blindness, which was a major public health problem at the time. The isolation of vitamin A led to the understanding that there are essential micronutrients that the body requires in order to function properly, which has had a significant impact on human health. Today, vitamin A is known to have many important functions in the body, including supporting eye health, immunity, and growth and development.
