The amount of precipitation (both rain and snow) is low and limited in Antarctica. This is because the continent is a desert and receives very little moisture from the atmosphere due to its extreme cold temperatures. The majority of the precipitation that does fall occurs in the form of snow, which can accumulate over time and create ice sheets and glaciers.
