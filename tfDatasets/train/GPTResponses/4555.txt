The US intervened against ISIL (also known as ISIS) through a combination of military air strikes, providing support to local ground forces, and covert operations. In 2014, President Obama authorized the use of military force against ISIL, and the US-led coalition began air strikes against its targets in Syria and Iraq. The US also provided training, weapons, and other support to local ground forces, including the Iraqi military and Kurdish Peshmerga fighters. Additionally, US special operations forces conducted raids and targeted killings of ISIL leaders. The intervention significantly weakened ISIL but did not fully eliminate the terrorist group.
