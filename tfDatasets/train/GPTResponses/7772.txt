One major branch of knowledge that the Dominican Order created works in is theology. The Dominicans were known for their expertise in theological studies, and many prominent theologians and scholars emerged from the order. They played a significant role in shaping Christian theology and philosophy during the Middle Ages and beyond. Some notable Dominican theologians include Thomas Aquinas, Albertus Magnus, and Catherine of Siena.
