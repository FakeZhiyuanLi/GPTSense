This is a bit of a confusing question, but based on the description provided, it seems like the answer is a demonstration of fluorescence or phosphorescence. The plate below the phosphorescent tablet is likely coated with a material that fluoresces or phosphoresces (emits light) when excited by the light from the burning magnesium ribbon. The 25 pigmented squares might be some kind of pattern or design intended to demonstrate the behavior of the phosphorescent material. Without more context or information, it's difficult to say for sure.
