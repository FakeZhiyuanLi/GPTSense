"Appeasement" was a term that was disgraced in diplomatic and military circles. It referred to the policy of giving into the demands of aggressive nations in the hopes of avoiding war, which was seen as weak and ultimately ineffective in preventing conflict. The appeasement policy of British and French leaders in the lead-up to World War II is often cited as an example of this failed approach.
