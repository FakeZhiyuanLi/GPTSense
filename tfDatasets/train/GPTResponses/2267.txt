The fortifications in the Maurienne Valley were built by the French military during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Specifically, the forts were built as part of France's effort to fortify its border with Italy, and were constructed in the years leading up to World War I. Some of the key structures in the Maurienne Valley include Fort Victor-Emmanuel, Fort Barraux, and Fort Saint-Gobain. These forts played an important role in defending France during both World War I and World War II, and some of them remain standing today as historic landmarks.
