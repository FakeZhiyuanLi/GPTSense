The new antiseptic being used to treat abscesses in the 1870s was carbolic acid, also known as phenol. It was introduced by British surgeon Joseph Lister, who promoted the use of antiseptic techniques to prevent infection during surgery. The use of carbolic acid helped reduce the number of postoperative infections and significantly improved surgical outcomes.
