The Rhine River is not traditionally considered part of the core area of the Hallstatt culture, which emerged in the Alpine regions of central Europe around 1200 BCE. The Hallstatt culture is typically associated with the Hallstatt Period (1200â€“800 BCE) and is characterized by distinctive material culture, including bronze and iron tools, pottery, jewelry, and weapons. The core area of the Hallstatt culture was centered around the salt mines near Hallstatt, Austria, but it extended throughout much of central Europe, including modern-day Austria, Germany, Switzerland, and France. While the Rhine River was an important transportation and trade route during this period and likely played a role in the spread of Hallstatt cultural influences, it was not considered part of the core area of the culture.
