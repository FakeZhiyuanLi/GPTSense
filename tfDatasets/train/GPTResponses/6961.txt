Standardized contract law refers to a set of legal principles and regulations that govern the creation, interpretation, and enforcement of contracts in a consistent and uniform manner across a jurisdiction. These principles and regulations may be codified in statutes or common law, and are intended to promote fairness, predictability, and efficiency in contractual relationships. The goal of standardized contract law is to provide a clear and consistent legal framework that all parties to a contract can rely on to ensure that their rights and obligations are clearly defined and enforceable.
