Silla had a well-organized government system with administrative officials, high officials, and royal family members. Silla also had a strong military and established a centralized government system, which allowed for efficient decision-making and better management of its territories. The kingdom's economy also flourished due to its strategic location for maritime trade and the development of agriculture and handicrafts. Silla also made significant cultural achievements during this period, including the creation of the Hwarang, an elite group of young men devoted to cultivating intellectual and martial skills.
