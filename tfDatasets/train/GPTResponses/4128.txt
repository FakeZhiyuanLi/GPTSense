The land surface of Houston is underpinned by a variety of materials including:1. Sedimentary rocks such as sandstone, shale, and limestone2. Loess and alluvium deposits3. Clay and silt4. Sand and gravel5. Igneous and metamorphic rocks in some areas6. Man-made materials such as concrete, asphalt, and building foundations.These materials have been shaped and reworked by natural forces such as erosion, weathering, and deposition over millions of years, ultimately shaping the geography of the Houston area we see today.
