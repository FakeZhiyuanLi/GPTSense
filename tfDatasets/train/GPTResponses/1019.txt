During the Taiping Rebellion, much of Zhejiang came under control of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, a quasi-Christian theocratic state led by Hong Xiuquan. The rebels established their capital in Nanjing and aimed to overthrow the ruling Qing dynasty in China. They controlled large parts of southern China, including Zhejiang, from 1853 to 1864. However, the rebellion was eventually crushed by the Qing government with the help of foreign powers.
