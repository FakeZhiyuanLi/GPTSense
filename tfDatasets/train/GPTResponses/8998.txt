The Black Sea clause was a provision in the Treaty of Paris (1856) which limited the naval presence of Russian and Ottoman military ships in the Black Sea. In 1871, during the Franco-Prussian War, Russia renounced the Black Sea clause which had been imposed upon it after its defeat in the Crimean War. The decision to renounce the clause was made by Tsar Alexander II.
