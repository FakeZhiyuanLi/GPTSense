1. Vocational schools: These schools were developed to provide practical training to students in various vocational fields, such as plumbing, electronics, mechanics, etc. The aim was to equip students with relevant skills that would enable them to join the workforce immediately after completing their education.2. Grammar schools: These schools offered a more traditional academic curriculum, with a focus on subjects such as maths, science, and languages. They were typically selective, admitting students based on academic ability or through a rigorous entrance exam. The idea was that grammar schools would provide an alternative route to higher education for academically inclined students who might not be suited to vocational training.
