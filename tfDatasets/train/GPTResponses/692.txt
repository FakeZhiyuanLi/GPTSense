The period that followed the Carnation Revolution in Portugal was a transition from authoritarianism to democracy. This period lasted from 1974 to 1976, during which time a provisional government was established and a new constitution was drafted. Numerous reforms were implemented, including nationalizations of key industries, land redistribution, and the establishment of a comprehensive social welfare system. Despite significant progress, the transition to democracy was not without its difficulties. There were several attempts by conservative forces to derail the process, leading to a number of political crises and the suspension of the democratic process on several occasions. Ultimately, however, the country emerged from this period with a stable, democratic government and a renewed sense of optimism for the future.
