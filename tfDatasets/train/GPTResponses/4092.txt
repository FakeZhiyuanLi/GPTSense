Events are usually shown as they appeared on the Julian calendar for historical events that took place prior to the adoption of the Gregorian calendar in different countries. The Julian calendar was used in many parts of the world from its inception in 45 BC until it was gradually replaced by the Gregorian calendar in different countries from the 16th century onwards. Therefore, events that took place before the adoption of the Gregorian calendar in a particular country or region may be shown on the Julian calendar. For example, the Russian Orthodox Church still uses the Julian calendar to calculate the date of Easter, which sometimes falls on a different date than the Western Christian Easter.
