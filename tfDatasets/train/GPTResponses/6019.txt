Uranium is naturally formed in the Earth's crust and is most commonly found in sedimentary rocks, such as sandstone, shale, and phosphate rock. It may also be found in igneous rocks, such as granite and basalt, and in hydrothermal veins associated with these rocks. Uranium deposits can be found around the world, but the largest reserves are located in Canada, Australia, Kazakhstan, Russia, and the United States.
