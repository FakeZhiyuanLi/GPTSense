A comprehensive or inclusive definition could be used to conveniently encompass the complexity of diverse phenomena. Such a definition would incorporate different aspects, variables, and perspectives that are relevant to understanding the phenomena. It would consider the various dimensions, contexts, and relationships involved in the phenomena, as well as the different ways in which people might perceive, interpret, and experience them. A comprehensive definition would also reflect the dynamic and evolving nature of the phenomena, and allow for flexibility and adaptation as new information emerges.
