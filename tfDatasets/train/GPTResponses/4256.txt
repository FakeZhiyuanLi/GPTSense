Each FBI branch, also known as a Field Office, is managed by a Special Agent in Charge (SAC). The SAC is responsible for overseeing all operations of the office and members of the office's management team. The SAC reports to the Assistant Director in Charge (ADIC) of their respective division or branch within the FBI.
