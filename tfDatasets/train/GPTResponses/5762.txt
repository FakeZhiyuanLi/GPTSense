One of the quickest areas to evolve in military technology in the 20th century was aviation technology. Rapid advancements were made in the development of aircraft, from the first successful powered flight by the Wright brothers in 1903 to the emergence of jet propulsion and guided missiles during World War II. The development of aircraft carriers also revolutionized the way war was waged at sea, enabling planes to take off and land on ships and extend the reach of the military into areas previously unreachable. Additionally, the use of drones and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in modern warfare has further advanced aviation technology in recent years.
