It is difficult to pinpoint a specific foreign news service that consistently viewed Napoleon as a dangerous tyrant because different publications had varying views of him depending on their political affiliations and national interests. However, during the Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815), British newspapers such as The Times often depicted Napoleon as a power-hungry dictator who threatened the stability of Europe and whose ambition knew no bounds. Similarly, some conservative European publications, such as the Gazette de Cologne (Cologne Gazette), criticized Napoleon's expansionist policies and his disregard for traditional monarchies and aristocracies. On the other hand, liberal and republican newspapers, such as the Moniteur universel (Universal Monitor) in France, tended to portray Napoleon as a heroic leader who modernized his country and promoted equality and democracy.
