Amphibious assault ships require a large contingent of landing craft and helicopters for carrying Marines and their equipment during deployment. These landing craft and helicopters allow for rapid deployment of the Marines and their equipment to the shore or other landing zones during amphibious operations. The ships also need specialized decks and storage areas to accommodate the vehicles, weapons, and equipment that the Marines use during their missions. Additionally, the ships require advanced communication and navigation systems to coordinate and direct the Marines during complex amphibious assaults.
