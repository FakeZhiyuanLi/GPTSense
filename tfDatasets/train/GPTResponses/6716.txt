The principle of Chevron provides a framework for judicial review of administrative agency decisions. It allows courts to defer to an agency's interpretation of a statute if the statute is ambiguous and the agency's interpretation is reasonable. This principle helps ensure consistency and predictability in administrative decision-making, while also respecting the expertise and unique perspective of these agencies.
