The type of fungi that help shape rock formations in Antarctica are called cryptoendolithic fungi. These fungi grow inside rocks and contribute to the weathering process by breaking down the minerals in the rock. Over time, this can lead to the formation of distinctive patterns and shapes in the rock, known as biological weathering.
