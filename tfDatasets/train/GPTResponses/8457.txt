There is no specific year mentioned in any official announcement about the printing of the core specification for Unicode in physical form. However, the Unicode Consortium has been publishing the Unicode Standard in printed book form since 1991, and it has always included the core specification along with other relevant information. In recent years, the Consortium has shifted its focus to providing digital versions of the standard, but they still publish a printed version for those who prefer physical copies.
