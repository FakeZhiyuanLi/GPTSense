In the 17th century, various substances were used as insecticides, including tobacco, arsenic, mercury, and sulfur. However, many of these substances were also poisonous to humans and animals, and their use was not regulated or controlled in the way it is today. Some natural remedies, such as pyrethrum derived from chrysanthemum flowers or neem oil from the neem tree, were also used for insect control.
