Medieval political philosophy had much in common with religious thinking, specifically Christian theology. Many medieval political philosophers were also theologians who believed that political order and authority were ordained by God and that rulers had a divine mandate to govern. They also believed that the ultimate goal of human existence was to achieve salvation and eternal life in heaven, which influenced their views on the role of the state and the relationship between earthly and divine authority.
