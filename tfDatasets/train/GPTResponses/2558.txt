The initial difference between majuscule and minuscule letters was the size and complexity of the letters. Majuscule letters were large and often ornate, while minuscule letters were smaller and simpler. Majuscule letters were typically used for important documents and titles, while minuscule letters were used for everyday writing. Additionally, majuscule letters were often written in a formal script, while minuscule letters were written in a cursive or script-like handwriting.
