The relationship between advanced and emerging/developing economies that was completely overturned by the financial crisis of 2007 was the perception that emerging/developing economies were more susceptible to economic crises and financial instability, while advanced economies were considered to be more stable and less risky. However, during the financial crisis, many advanced economies experienced severe economic contractions and financial instability, while some emerging/developing economies experienced relatively mild impacts. This highlighted the fact that advanced economies were not immune to economic crises, and emerging/developing economies were becoming more resilient and capable of withstanding external shocks.
