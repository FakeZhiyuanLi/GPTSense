The concept of duration that was left behind for a more concrete frame of reference was introduced by philosopher Henri Bergson, who believed that time is a subjective experience that cannot be objectively measured or divided into discrete units. This idea was challenged by the development of modern physics and the theory of relativity, which introduced a more objective and mathematical view of time as a measurable and relative construct.
