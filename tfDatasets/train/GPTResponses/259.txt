Trichomoniasis is caused by a single-celled protozoan parasite known as Trichomonas vaginalis. This parasite has an estimated genome size of approximately 160 megabases, containing around 60,000 predicted genes. However, the exact number of genes in Trichomonas vaginalis is still under investigation and may change as more research is conducted on this organism.
