Czech dictionaries usually provide the infinitive form of the verb, which is the basic or dictionary form of the verb. For example, the Czech dictionary entry for the verb "to go" would be "j√≠t" (infinitive form). However, some dictionaries may also provide conjugations of the verb in various tenses and forms.
