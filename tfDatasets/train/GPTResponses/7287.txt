When pesticides don't reach their intended target, several things can be affected, including:1. Non-target species - Pesticides can harm or kill non-target species, such as beneficial insects, plants or animals that are useful for farming or ecosystem health.2. Environment - Pesticides can contaminate soil, water sources or air, thereby impacting the environment and local communities.3. Human health - Pesticides can put human health at risk especially for people who are exposed to them through consumption of contaminated water, food, and air.4. Crop yield and quality - Pesticides that do not reach their intended target can also negatively impact crops, resulting in decreased yield, and lower quality of produce.In summary, when pesticides do not reach their target, the environment, non-target species, crop yield and quality, and human health can all be affected negatively.
