Phonology is a subfield of linguistics that studies the sound patterns in language and the underlying phonological processes that govern how speech sounds are organized, perceived, and produced. It is a component of a language system that deals with the study of sounds, phonemes, phonotactics, stress, intonation, and other elements that constitute the sound structure of language. Phonology is considered a systemic and rule-governed component of a language, and it plays a crucial role in understanding the relationships between sounds, meaning, and grammar in speech.
