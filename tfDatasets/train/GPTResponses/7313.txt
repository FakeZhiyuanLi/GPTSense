The Church of England and the Congregational Church in England and Wales did not unite in one specific year. However, in 1972, a merger between the Congregational Church in England and Wales and the Presbyterian Church of England formed the United Reformed Church. This new denomination later entered into a covenant with the Church of England in 2002, which established a partnership between the two churches by recognizing their shared mission and ministry.
