The leading literary figure who often mentioned the Virgin in his poetry is T.S. Eliot. His most famous work, "The Waste Land," includes references to the Virgin Mary in multiple parts of the poem. In "The Burial of the Dead" section, he references "the Lady of the Rocks" and "the Queen of Heaven," which are both titles traditionally associated with Mary. Additionally, in the "What the Thunder Said" section, he includes a reference to "Mary, Undoer of Knots," another title for the Virgin Mary. Eliot's Catholic faith was a significant influence on his work and likely contributed to his frequent references to Mary in his poetry.
