Bermudian blacks can trace their ancestry back over centuries in Bermuda because their ancestors were brought to Bermuda as slaves during the colonial period. Bermuda was settled by English colonists in the 17th century and soon became a hub for the transatlantic slave trade. Thousands of African slaves were brought to Bermuda and forced to work on plantations and farms. Over time, these slaves had children who were also born into slavery. When slavery was abolished in Bermuda in 1834, many former slaves stayed on the island and continued to work for their former masters. This continuous presence of black Bermudians over centuries has allowed them to trace their ancestry back to their enslaved ancestors who were brought to the island.
