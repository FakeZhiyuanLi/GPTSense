There were several factors that led scientists to believe that plants should be classified according to something other than just sexual system:1. Morphological differences: Scientists observed that plants show significant morphological differences in their structure, growth habit, leaf shape, flower form, etc. These differences were not always related to their sexual traits.2. Hybridization and polyploidy: Scientists found that plants could hybridize and form new species that did not fit neatly into the sexual classification. Moreover, some plants could undergo polyploidy (doubling or tripling of chromosomes), which also led to the formation of new species.3. Evolutionary relationships: Scientists saw that plants could be grouped based on their evolutionary relationships and common ancestry, which could not be explained solely by their sexual traits.4. Practical considerations: The sexual system was found to be inadequate for practical purposes, such as plant breeding, agriculture, horticulture, and conservation. A more comprehensive classification system was needed that took into account all aspects of plant life.Overall, these observations led scientists to develop a more comprehensive classification system that included non-sexual traits such as morphology, ecology, molecular markers, and evolutionary relationships. This resulted in the modern system of plant classification, which is based on a combination of genetic, morphological, and ecological characteristics.
