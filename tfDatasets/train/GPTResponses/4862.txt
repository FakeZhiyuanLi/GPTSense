LSOs used a system of hand signals and flags to signal corrections to the pilot prior to angled deck designs introduced in the 1950s. They would stand on the edge of the flight deck and use their arms and hands to guide the pilot onto the correct landing path. Flags were also used to indicate wind direction and speed.
