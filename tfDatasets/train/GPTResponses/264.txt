The previous overseer of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) was the British Bankers' Association (BBA), which was responsible for the administration and calculation of the benchmark rate. In 2013, the BBA was replaced by the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which now oversees the calculation and publication of LIBOR.
