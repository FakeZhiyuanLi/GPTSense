During the Kokang offensive, the Chinese government was accused of supporting the ethnic Chinese rebel group, the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), which was launching attacks against the Myanmar government. The Chinese government was accused of providing the MNDAA with arms, ammunition, and financial support, as well as allowing the rebels to retreat into Chinese territory to regroup and resupply. The Myanmar government protested against China's support of the rebels, and the incident strained the relationship between the two countries.
