Early mammals were active at night to avoid competition and predation from the dominant reptiles that were active during the day. Being active at night allowed early mammals to exploit available resources, including insects, small mammals, and fruits, without the risk of being preyed upon by large carnivorous dinosaurs. Additionally, being active at night allowed early mammals to regulate their body heat by avoiding the heat of the day and staying active when the temperature was cooler.
