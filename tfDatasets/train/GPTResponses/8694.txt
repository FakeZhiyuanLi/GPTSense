The drastic drop in temperature in Oklahoma on November 11, 1911, was likely due to the passage of a strong cold front. The cold front was likely caused by differences in air pressure, wind patterns, and temperature gradients, which can result in a sudden and dramatic change in weather conditions. Other factors, such as the location and intensity of high and low-pressure systems, may have also contributed to the extreme temperature drop.
