Unrecognized faiths and denominations in Eritrea have to undergo severe religious persecution, including imprisonment, torture, and forced renunciation of their faith. The Eritrean government recognizes only four religious groups: Sunni Islam, Eritrean Orthodox Church, Roman Catholic Church, and Lutheran Evangelical Church. All other religious groups, including Jehovah's Witnesses, Pentecostals, and Seventh-Day Adventists, are deemed illegal and face repression from the government. The government has closed churches, confiscated property, expelled foreign clergy, and arrested and detained worshipers. The Eritrean government claims that these unrecognized faiths and denominations pose a threat to national security and promote divisions in society.
