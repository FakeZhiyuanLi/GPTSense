After the rebellion of 1857, the British government took direct control of British India and administered it through the Secretary of State for India, who was a member of the British Cabinet. The administration was carried out through a Governor-General and a Council consisting of British officials who were appointed by the British government. The Indian Civil Service was also established to help administer the country, and British officials held most of the important positions in the government.
