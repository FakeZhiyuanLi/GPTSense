The Somali Family Law, also known as the Personal Status Law, gave spouses equal rights in matters of divorce, inheritance, and custody of children. It also gave women the right to initiate divorce in some circumstances and allowed for polygamy but only under strict conditions. Additionally, the law abolished forced marriages and outlawed female genital mutilation.
