Rivers form the natural channel or pathway by which water flows from higher elevations to lower elevations until it reaches the sea or an endorheic basin. They also contribute greatly to the drainage system of a particular region or watershed and provide essential water resources for agricultural, commercial, and domestic uses. Moreover, they shape the landscape and provide habitats for a variety of plant and animal species.
