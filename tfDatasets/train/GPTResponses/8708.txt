Characters with diacritical marks are represented using Unicode encoding. Diacritical marks are added as combining characters to the base character. For example, the letter "e" can be combined with an acute accent mark (é) or a diaeresis mark (ë) by using the Unicode code points U+0301 and U+0308 respectively. When rendered in a font that supports diacritical marks, the base character and the diacritical mark are displayed as a single glyph.
