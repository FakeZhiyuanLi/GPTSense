The primary mechanism by which genes for antibiotic resistance can be passed between individual cells is through horizontal gene transfer (HGT). HGT refers to the transfer of genetic material (such as plasmids or transposons) from one bacterial cell to another, not through reproduction but through various mechanisms such as conjugation, transformation, and transduction. This process enables antibiotic resistance genes to spread rapidly among bacterial populations, including those that are not closely related, increasing the risk of antibiotic-resistant infections.
