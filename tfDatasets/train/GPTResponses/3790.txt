The separation of Pangaea is believed to have caused several species to become extinct. The splitting of the supercontinent led to massive changes in climate, ocean currents, and habitats that made it difficult for many species to adapt and survive. Additionally, the vast distances created by the breaking apart of the landmass made it difficult for many species to migrate to new habitats. Some of the species that are believed to have become extinct due to the separation of Pangaea include several types of dinosaurs, marine reptiles, and amphibians.
