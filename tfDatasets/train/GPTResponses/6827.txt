Pointed arches and vaulted ceilings are commonly found in Gothic cathedrals and religious structures, rather than secular buildings. However, some Gothic secular structures, such as castles and palaces, may have incorporated these elements in their design as well. Examples include the Palais des Papes in Avignon, France and the Doge's Palace in Venice, Italy.
