. This principle is known as the principle of coercion and is recognized under international law. Coercion can take different forms, such as economic sanctions, military threats or actual use of force, and can be directed at a state or its representatives. If a state's consent to a treaty is obtained through coercion, that consent is considered invalid under international law, and the treaty is not binding on that state. This principle is important to ensure that treaty negotiations are conducted in a fair and transparent manner, and that states are not forced into agreements that are against their interests or violate their sovereignty.
