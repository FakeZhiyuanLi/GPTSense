The traditional focus of phonology is on the sound systems of languages, including the organization and structure of speech sounds and their distribution in different contexts. This includes the study of phonemes, allophones, phonological rules and constraints, syllable structure, stress and intonation patterns, and other aspects of sound patterns in language. Phonology also includes the study of historical sound changes and the relationships between the sound systems of related languages or dialects.
