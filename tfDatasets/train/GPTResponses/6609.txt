The compilation and codification of all federal statutes is the process of organizing and consolidating federal laws into a single, easily accessible document or set of documents. This process is typically carried out by a dedicated agency, such as the Office of the Law Revision Counsel of the United States House of Representatives, and involves reviewing, amending, and updating existing laws to ensure they are consistent with each other and with current legal principles. The resulting codification serves as a comprehensive reference guide for lawyers, judges, lawmakers, and the general public, and is essential for ensuring the consistency and accuracy of federal law.
