An international tribunal might review the preparatory work from the negotiation and drafting of a treaty in order to clarify the intentions and understanding of the parties involved in the creation of the treaty. This can help ensure that the treaty is interpreted and applied correctly, and can be particularly important in resolving disputes that arise over the meaning or scope of the treaty. Additionally, reviewing the preparatory work can help to identify any inconsistencies or ambiguities in the text of the treaty itself, which may require interpretation or clarification in order to be fully implemented.
