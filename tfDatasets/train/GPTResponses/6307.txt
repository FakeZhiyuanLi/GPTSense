The degrees of Freemasonry were derived from medieval guilds and stonemasonry practices. The first three degrees, known as the Entered Apprentice, Fellowcraft, and Master Mason degrees, were developed in the early 1700s by the Grand Lodge of England. Additional degrees were added over time by various Masonic organizations, with many of them having symbolic ties to the history and teachings of Freemasonry.
