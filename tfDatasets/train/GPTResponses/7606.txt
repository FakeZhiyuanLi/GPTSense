The British Empire began encroaching on Tibet in the late 19th century, with the Younghusband Expedition of 1903-1904 marking a significant moment in their efforts to exert influence over the region. The Russian Empire also began to show interest in Tibet during this time, with some Russian explorers making attempts to penetrate the region in the late 1800s. However, it was primarily the British who were seen as the main threat to Tibet an independence in the early 20th century.
