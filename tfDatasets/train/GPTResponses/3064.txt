The two factors that determine whether it is possible to withdraw from a treaty are:1. The language of the treaty itself: Some treaties have specific provisions that allow for withdrawal, while others do not. If the treaty does not specify a withdrawal clause, it may be difficult or impossible to withdraw without violating its terms.2. Customary international law: Even if a treaty does not specifically provide for withdrawal, customary international law may recognize the right of a state to withdraw under certain circumstances. These circumstances could include a fundamental change in circumstances or a breach of the treaty by another party. However, customary international law is not always clear, and the process of withdrawing from a treaty can be complicated and contentious.
