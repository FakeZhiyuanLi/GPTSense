The industry that is supported by animal labor in Burma (also known as Myanmar) is primarily agriculture. Animals such as oxen, water buffalo, and elephants are commonly used to plow fields, carry heavy loads, and transport people and goods. In addition, horses and mules may also be used in some areas. Animal labor is still an important part of the economy in many rural areas of Burma.
