During 1951, King George VI's health was deteriorating gradually. He was suffering from several health issues, including a lung infection, arterial disease, and circulatory problems. The King underwent multiple surgeries on his left lung to remove a malignant tumor, which took a toll on his overall health. He was frequently in and out of the hospital, and his public appearances were limited. Despite his health struggles, George VI continued to fulfill his official duties and responsibilities as the monarch of Great Britain and the Commonwealth.
