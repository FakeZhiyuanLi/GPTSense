Incandescent lights have a shorter lifespan than other lighting sources such as LED and CFL lights. The average lifespan of an incandescent bulb is around 1000 hours, while LED bulbs can last up to 50,000 hours and CFL bulbs can last up to 10,000 hours. This is because incandescent lights use a filament that eventually burns out, while LED and CFL lights use electronic components that are less prone to wear and tear.
