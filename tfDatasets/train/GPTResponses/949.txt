The neighborhood that became particularly impoverished in the mid-to-late 20th century in Atlantic City was the predominantly African American and Hispanic neighborhood known as the "Northside." This neighborhood was originally a thriving African American community but was hit hard by the decline of the city's manufacturing and tourism industries, as well as urban renewal projects that displaced many residents. By the 1970s and 1980s, the Northside had high levels of poverty, unemployment, crime, and drug addiction.
