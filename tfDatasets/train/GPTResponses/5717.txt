It is important to clarify which lineages are being referred to in order to provide an accurate answer. However, assuming that this question pertains to human lineage, all studies agree that genetic overlap exists between modern humans and Neanderthals in both lineages. Both modern humans and Neanderthals share a common ancestor that lived approximately 600-700 thousand years ago, and interbreeding between the two lineages occurred approximately 50-60 thousand years ago. As a result, modern humans of non-African descent carry anywhere from 1% to 4% of Neanderthal DNA in their genomes. Additionally, recent studies have shown that some ancient humans from Eurasia, including the Denisovans, also contributed genetic material to modern human populations.
