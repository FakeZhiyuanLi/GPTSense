When semicircular arches overlap each other, a pointed arch or Gothic arch design is accidentally created. This design is characterized by a pointed apex or peak at the top of the arch, which creates a more pointed and elongated appearance compared to a semicircular arch. This style of arch became popular in Gothic architecture during the 12th century and is still used today.
