A bit reservoir is a technique that is typically used in lossy audio compression formats such as MP3 or AAC. It allows for better quality audio at lower bitrates by temporarily storing surplus bits from one part of the audio and reallocating them to another part that requires more bits for encoding. Therefore, any audio that uses a lossy compression format and has variable bit rate (VBR) is suitable for utilizing a bit reservoir.
