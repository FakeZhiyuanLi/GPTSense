Shramanas were a continuation of the ascetic and renunciant traditions of Indian thought, which aimed to liberate oneself from the cycle of birth and death through spiritual practices and self-discipline. These traditions were also influenced by non-Vedic and non-Brahminical sects, such as Jainism and Buddhism.
