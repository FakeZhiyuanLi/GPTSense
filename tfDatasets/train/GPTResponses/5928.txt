The most significant natural protection that ships in Montevideo can receive is from the Rio de la Plata estuary. The estuary's shallow depth and the many sandbars around it prevent large waves from forming, reducing the risk of a ship being damaged or capsized. The bay in Montevideo also provides some protection from high winds and storms. Additionally, the area's unique geography helps to shelter the harbor from ocean currents, making it easier for ships to enter and exit the port.
