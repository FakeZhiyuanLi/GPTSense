Detroit built its tax base through the auto industry, which dominated the city's economy during the mid-20th century. The city was home to major automakers such as General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler, which provided jobs and revenue for the city. Additionally, Detroit was a major hub for steel production, which also contributed to its tax base. However, as the auto industry declined and manufacturing jobs moved overseas, Detroit's tax base eroded, leading to long-term economic and financial struggles for the city.
