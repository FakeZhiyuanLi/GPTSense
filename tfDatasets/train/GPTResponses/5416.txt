At the end of the Napoleonic Wars, Germany had established itself as a significant political and economic power in continental Europe. The Congress of Vienna in 1815 recognized the German Confederation, a group of independent states that were united by a loose political alliance. The Confederation became a significant force in Europe, playing a leading role in the balancing of power between the great powers of the time. Germany's industrialization and economic growth during the 19th century further solidified its position as one of the leading nations in Europe.
