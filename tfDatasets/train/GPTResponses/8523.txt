One notable person who promoted the rights of Eastern Orthodox Christians was Patriarch Athenagoras I of Constantinople. He served as the spiritual leader of the Eastern Orthodox Church from 1948 until his death in 1972 and played a significant role in promoting interfaith dialogue and unity among Christians. Athenagoras I also worked to improve relations between the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church, as well as with other religions such as Judaism and Islam.
