Parties to an original treaty and an amended treaty are bound to the terms of both the original and amended treaties, as long as they have ratified both. The provisions of the original treaty that are not affected by the amendment continue to remain in force, while the amended provisions supersede the corresponding provisions of the original treaty. Therefore, the parties are obligated to abide by all the terms of both the original and the amended treaty.
