Valencia's main food exports in the early 20th century were oranges, rice, and almonds. Valencia's fertile soil and warm climate allowed for a bountiful harvest of these crops, making them a significant source of income for the region. Additionally, Valencia's location on the Mediterranean Sea made it an important port for exporting these goods to other countries.
