Skills that guaranteed survival in mountain valleys were most important throughout human history. These skills were essential to the survival of ancient and traditional mountain communities who had to adapt to challenging living conditions, such as harsh climates, rugged terrain, lack of water resources, and limited agricultural lands. These communities had to acquire skills such as hunting, fishing, farming, herding, foraging, and traditional crafts to ensure their survival. In modern times, these skills are still important for people living in mountain valleys who rely on subsistence agriculture and traditional industries for their livelihoods. Additionally, these skills are valuable for outdoor enthusiasts, hikers, and mountaineers who travel to the mountains for recreational purposes.
