Birds migrate north for multiple reasons, including:1. Breeding: Many bird species travel north to breed and raise their young in the summer months, as these areas offer ideal nesting conditions and abundant food sources.2. Climate: In the northern hemisphere, as winter comes to an end, areas in the north once again experience a longer period of daylight, warmer temperatures and the emergence of spring foliage all of which provides bird species with ample food, shelter and longer days to breed and raise their young.3. Food Availability: As spring arrives various insects and other food sources begin to emerge, making it easier for migratory birds to feed themselves and their offspring.4. Survival: Birds often embark on long journeys over thousands of miles to find safer breeding and nesting grounds as well as areas with the best food sources for survival.
