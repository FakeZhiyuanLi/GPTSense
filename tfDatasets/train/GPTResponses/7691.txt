A new type of USB port called the charging port is defined by its ability to deliver higher charging speeds to devices, without the need for data transfer. Unlike traditional USB ports, the charging port does not support data transfer speeds, and can only be used for charging. They also feature a higher power output than traditional USB ports, with some offering up to 100W of power delivery. Charging ports are commonly found in wall adapters, power banks, and car chargers, and are often marked with a lightning bolt symbol to indicate their charging capability.
