This means that there is a constant demand for new housing to accommodate the growing population.2. Improved Job Market: The job market in Melbourne is strong and continues to improve, with many new businesses choosing to set up shop in the city. This has led to increased demand for housing, as more people move to Melbourne to find work and career opportunities.3. Lifestyle: Melbourne is known for its vibrant culture, diverse communities, and world-class entertainment options. Many people are drawn to the city's lifestyle offerings and are choosing to move to Melbourne to live and work.4. Low Interest Rates: Interest rates in Australia are currently at historic lows, making it easier for people to secure home loans and enter the property market.
