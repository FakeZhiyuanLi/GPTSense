Isaac Newton was a firm believer in God and saw the theory of natural law as evidence of God's divine plan. He believed that the natural world, including its laws and phenomena, reflected the wisdom and design of a supreme Creator. Newton thought that studying and understanding the laws governing nature could bring us closer to understanding God's will and purpose, and that the universe was infused with a divine order that made it intelligible to human reason. He saw his own scientific work as a means of exploring and revealing this order and demonstrating God's greatness and wisdom.
