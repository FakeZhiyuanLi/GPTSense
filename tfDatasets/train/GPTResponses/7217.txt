Yes, the British protected Burma as its colony during WWII. In fact, Burma was strategically important to the Allies because it was a key territory that provided access to India, and the British fought fiercely to defend and hold onto it. However, the Japanese eventually managed to invade and occupy Burma in 1942, leading to a brutal and grueling campaign to retake the country that lasted until 1945.
