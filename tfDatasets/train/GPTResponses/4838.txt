Several things can be detected via infrared prior to emitting visible light, including:1. Fires and hot spots: Infrared cameras can detect heat signatures from fires or hot spots before they start emitting visible light.2. Human and animal movements: Infrared sensors can detect movements of living organisms, like humans and animals, even in low light conditions.3. Electrical faults: High resistance connections, overloading, and other electrical problems in devices can cause them to emit infrared radiation before visible light.4. Pollution: Infrared sensors can be used to detect air pollution, such as carbon emissions, before they are visible to the naked eye.5. Night vision: Infrared technology can provide night vision, allowing people to see in complete darkness.6. Tumors: Infrared cameras can detect abnormal growths or tumors in the body, which emit more heat than surrounding tissues.7. Thermography: Infrared technology can be used for thermography to detect temperature differences in a wide range of applications, including building insulation and HVAC systems.
