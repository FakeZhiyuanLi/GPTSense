The oldest surviving Buddhist school is Theravada, also known as the "Doctrine of the Elders." This school of Buddhism is prevalent in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, and Burma. It is based on the early teachings of the Buddha and focuses on personal liberation through the practice of meditation and ethical behavior. Theravada Buddhism is considered the most conservative form of Buddhist doctrine and practice.
