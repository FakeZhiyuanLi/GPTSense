The expression of genes encoded in DNA begins with a process called transcription. During transcription, an enzyme called RNA polymerase binds to a specific region of the DNA called the promoter. The DNA strand at the promoter region unwinds and RNA polymerase begins to read the DNA sequence and build a complementary RNA strand using nucleotides. This RNA molecule, called messenger RNA (mRNA), carries the genetic information from the DNA out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm of the cell. Once in the cytoplasm, the mRNA is translated into a protein by another cellular structure called ribosomes. Proteins carry out numerous cellular functions and are essential for the growth and maintenance of all living organisms.
