Napoleon referred to the Congress of Vienna, which was a peace initiative held in 1814-1815 with the aim of reestablishing peace and order in Europe after the Napoleonic Wars. The Congress was attended by representatives from the major European powers, including Austria, Prussia, Russia, and Great Britain. Despite Napoleon's attempts to participate in the Congress and negotiate favorable terms for France, he was ultimately exiled to the island of Elba.
