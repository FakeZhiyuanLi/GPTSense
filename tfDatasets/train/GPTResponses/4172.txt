In 1922, Barcelona did not build any major landmarks or monuments. However, during that time period, there were some events and projects that took place in the city such as the construction of new neighborhoods and the expansion of the transportation system. Additionally, the city hosted the "Exposición Internacional de Barcelona" (Barcelona International Exposition) in 1929 which resulted in the construction of several notable buildings, including the Palau Nacional and the Magic Fountain of Montjuïc.
