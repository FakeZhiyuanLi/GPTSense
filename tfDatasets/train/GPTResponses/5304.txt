The Min and Wu dialects originated in the southeastern and eastern regions of China, particularly in the provinces of Fujian (Min dialects) and Jiangsu and Zhejiang (Wu dialects). The development of these dialects can be traced back to the Shang and Zhou dynasties (1600-256 BCE) and were heavily influenced by neighboring dialects and languages such as Cantonese and Mandarin.
