The Short Takeoff and Vertical Landing (STOVL) technique is used by other navies because it allows aircraft to operate on smaller, less-equipped or less-capable ships or land-based airfields. It gives navies flexibility in their operating environment and allows them to conduct missions in areas where traditional, longer runways are not available or feasible. Additionally, STOVL aircraft can take-off and land vertically, providing greater safety in emergency situations and reducing the need for long runways or complicated aircraft launching systems. This makes them ideal for use in modern amphibious missions and other types of naval operations.
