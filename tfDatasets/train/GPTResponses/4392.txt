the United States declared war on Iraq in March 2003. The airstrikes were part of the overall air campaign designed to degrade Iraqi military capabilities and pave the way for ground operations. The primary targets were Iraqi air defenses and command and control facilities, which were critical to Saddam Hussein's ability to defend against U.S. and coalition forces. The U.S. military continued to conduct airstrikes throughout the war until the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime in April 2003.
