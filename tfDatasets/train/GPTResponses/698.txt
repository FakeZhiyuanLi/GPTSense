One hindrance to understanding Buddhist philosophy is the language barrier. Many of the Buddhist texts are written in ancient languages such as Pali and Sanskrit, and require specialized knowledge and training to understand. Additionally, cultural differences and varying interpretations can also lead to confusion and misunderstanding. Finally, some concepts within Buddhist philosophy are abstract and difficult to grasp for those without a background in philosophy or metaphysics.
