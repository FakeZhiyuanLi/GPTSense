The autonomy and privileges of the Polish nobility, also known as the szlachta, were very important to them. They valued their rights to elect their own kings, control their own internal affairs, and have their own system of justice. They also prized their individual freedoms, including the right to own land, hold local offices, and participate in political and military affairs. The szlachta considered themselves to be a privileged class with a duty to defend and uphold the honor of their nation.
