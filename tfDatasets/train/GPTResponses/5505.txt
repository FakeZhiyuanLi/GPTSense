In theory, a variety of sensors or systems could be used for ranging calculations at long range. Some examples include:1. Radar: Radio waves emitted from a radar can bounce off distant objects and be detected by the same or another radar. By measuring the time it takes for the waves to return, the distance to the object can be calculated.2. LIDAR: A LIDAR system emits laser beams that bounce off objects and return to a sensor, which can be used to create a 3D point cloud of the environment. By analyzing the points, distances can be determined.3. GPS: A GPS (Global Positioning System) receiver can use signals from satellites to determine the distance between the receiver and the satellite, which can be used to calculate the receiver's location on the Earth's surface.4. Sonar: Similar to radar, sonar uses sound waves instead of radio waves to determine distance to underwater objects.5. Optical rangefinders: These use laser or other optical technology to measure distances between the device and a target, usually up to several kilometers.
