The Civil War (1861-1865) changed the way the United States looked at race. The war was fought over the issue of slavery and ultimately resulted in the abolition of slavery in the United States. This change in the legal status of African Americans was a significant step towards equality, but it did not end racial discrimination and prejudice. The period following the Civil War, known as Reconstruction, saw the enactment of civil rights legislation and the establishment of institutions such as schools and churches which allowed African Americans to exercise their rights more fully. However, the backlash of white supremacy groups like the Ku Klux Klan and the implementation of segregation laws in the South did not fully end inequality until the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s.
