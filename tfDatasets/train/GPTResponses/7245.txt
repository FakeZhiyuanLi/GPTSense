Carbon dioxide (CO2) can be determined from fossilized leaf sizes and shapes as it is known to influence plant growth and development, including leaf morphology. Higher levels of atmospheric CO2 are associated with larger leaf sizes and simpler leaf shapes, while lower levels of CO2 can result in smaller and more complex leaf shapes. Therefore, by analyzing fossilized leaves, scientists can estimate past levels of atmospheric CO2 and determine how they have changed over time.
