Several species of fish have been overfished, leading to regulations on fishing. However, some of the most notable species include:1. Atlantic cod: Overfishing of this species in the 20th century led to a collapse of the fishery and subsequent regulations on fishing.2. Bluefin tuna: The demand for this highly prized fish has led to overfishing and a decline in populations, leading to regulations on fishing.3. Pacific salmon: Overfishing and habitat loss have led to declines in salmon populations, resulting in the implementation of regulations on fishing.4. Pacific halibut: Overfishing of this species has led to declines in populations and the implementation of fishing regulations.5. Sharks: Overfishing of shark populations for their fins and meat has led to declines in populations and the implementation of fishing regulations in many countries.
