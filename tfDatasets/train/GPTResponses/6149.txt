If two overlapping grand lodges are in amity and decide to waive exclusive jurisdiction, other grand lodges must recognize both of them as legitimate and equal, and any Masonic lodge under their respective jurisdictions may work with one another without interference or conflict. However, it is important to note that not all grand lodges may choose to recognize this arrangement and may choose to maintain their own exclusive jurisdiction over their territories.
