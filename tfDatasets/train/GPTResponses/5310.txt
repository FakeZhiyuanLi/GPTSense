Ian Smith's regime in Rhodesia lasted from 1965 until 1979, when it was forced to accept a peace agreement that led to the creation of the independent country of Zimbabwe. Despite the imposition of sanctions by the international community, Smith's government managed to maintain its grip on power for more than a decade, but ultimately was unable to withstand pressure from both internal and external forces seeking political and social change.
