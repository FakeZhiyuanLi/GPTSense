After 1291, the titular king of Jerusalem did not have a definite place of residence as the Kingdom of Jerusalem ceased to exist after the loss of Acre to the Mamluks. The title of King of Jerusalem was still claimed by various European monarchs, but it was more of a symbolic and honorary title rather than one with any real political power or territory.
