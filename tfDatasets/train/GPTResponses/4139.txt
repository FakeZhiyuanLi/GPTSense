Johan Cruyff introduced the concept of "tiki-taka" - a style of play characterized by quick, short passes, fluid movement of players, and maintaining possession of the ball as much as possible. This style of play prioritizes teamwork, strategy, and creativity over individual brilliance and relies on the collective quality of the team. Cruyff's style of play helped transform Barcelona into one of the most successful and captivating teams in world football.
