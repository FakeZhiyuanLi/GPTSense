Tetanus outbreaks are caused by the bacteria Clostridium tetani, which is found in soil, dust, and animal feces. Tetanus can occur when the bacteria enters the body through a cut or wound, and produces a toxin that affects the nervous system. Outbreaks can occur in areas where there is poor sanitation or where people have limited access to vaccination, such as in developing countries. In some cases, outbreaks may also occur due to natural disasters or conflicts that disrupt healthcare systems and vaccination programs.
