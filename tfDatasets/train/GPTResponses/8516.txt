John Maynard Keynes was an economist who is best known for his ideas about government intervention in the economy to promote growth and stability. He wanted to separate the economy from the whims of free market forces and argued that governments should have an active role in managing the economy through fiscal and monetary policies.Specifically, Keynes believed that the government should be responsible for ensuring full employment, stable prices, and promoting economic growth. He also argued that monetary policy, through the manipulation of interest rates and money supply, was an effective tool for controlling inflation and managing economic cycles.In contrast to classical economists who believed in laissez-faire policies, Keynes believed that the government had a duty to intervene in the economy to stabilize prices, promote growth and prevent the economy from falling into deep recessions. His policies influenced the development of macroeconomics and continue to shape economic policy today.
