Unicode has been criticized for not separately encoding all forms of kanji (Chinese characters used in Japanese writing) because it can cause confusion and misinterpretation. Some argue that certain forms of kanji have unique meanings or cultural significance that cannot be accurately conveyed through other means, such as font variants or annotations. This can lead to incorrect translations or misunderstandings, particularly in cases where the differences between two similar-looking characters can be subtle but significant. Additionally, some have criticized the process by which characters are selected for inclusion in Unicode as being opaque and favoring standardized forms used in printed media over less common handwritten or regional variations.
