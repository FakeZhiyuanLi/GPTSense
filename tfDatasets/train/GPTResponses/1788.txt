Some applications use the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) system to avoid problems with time changes. This system is based on the time at the Prime Meridian, which runs through Greenwich, England, and is not affected by time zone changes or daylight saving time adjustments. By using UTC, applications can ensure that their time stamps are consistent and accurate regardless of the user's location or time zone.
