When grain is soaked in water, it absorbs water and swells up. This process is called hydration. The moisture softens the outer layer of the grain, making it easier to digest and cook. As the grain absorbs water, some of its nutrients, such as starch and protein, become more readily available for use by the body. Soaking grain also helps to reduce cooking time and improve the texture of the cooked grain. However, prolonged soaking can lead to spoilage and fermentation, so it is important to follow recommended soaking times for each type of grain.
