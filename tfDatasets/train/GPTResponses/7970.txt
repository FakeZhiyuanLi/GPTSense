Drydocks are used for repairing, maintaining, and constructing boats and ships. When a vessel requires extensive repairs or maintenance, a drydock provides a safe and stable platform where repairs can take place without the risk of the vessel moving or being exposed to unfavorable weather conditions. Additionally, drydocks are commonly used for inspecting and cleaning the hull of a ship, as well as for painting, welding, and modifying the ship's structure. Furthermore, they are also used for building new ships, as they provide a controlled environment where shipbuilders can assemble the vessel's components and install the required equipment.
