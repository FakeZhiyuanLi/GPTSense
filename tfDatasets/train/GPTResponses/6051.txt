The books of the New Testament were not fully standardized by any one individual or group. The process of canonization was gradual and complex, involving various communities and church leaders over several centuries. The earliest known listing of the books considered authoritative is found in the Muratorian Canon, a document from around the year 200 AD. However, it wasn't until the 4th century that most of the current New Testament canon was accepted by the mainstream Christian church, with Athanasius of Alexandria's Easter letter of 367 AD providing the first known list of the complete New Testament canon as we know it today.
