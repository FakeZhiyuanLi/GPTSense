During the Heian period in Japan (794-1185), the primary crop that served as a source of income was rice. Rice cultivation and trade were key to the economic prosperity of the period, and it was used as a form of taxation by the government. The aristocracy and the imperial court, in particular, amassed great wealth through their control of land and rice fields.
