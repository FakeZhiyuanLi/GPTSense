testament era?The writer who referred to the Christian period as the "New Testament Era" was likely Eusebius of Caesarea, a Christian historian who lived in the fourth century. Eusebius used this term to distinguish the time period after the birth of Jesus Christ from the earlier "Old Testament Era" which covered the time before the birth of Jesus.
