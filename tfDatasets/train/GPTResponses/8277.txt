Eastland believed that the founders of affirmative action did not consider the potential negative consequences of using race as a factor in hiring or college admissions. He believed that affirmative action policies could lead to reverse discrimination, where individuals are discriminated against based on their race or ethnicity, and that it could also create resentment and tension between different racial groups. He also believed that affirmative action could lead to the perception of inferiority among certain races and perpetuate racial stereotypes.
