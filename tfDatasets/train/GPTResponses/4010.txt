The just-noticeable difference (JND), also known as the difference threshold, depends on several factors, including:1. The sensory modality: JND varies for different senses like vision, hearing, touch, taste, and smell.2. The nature of the stimuli: JND is affected by the characteristics of the stimuli, such as their intensity, duration, frequency, and complexity.3. The level of background stimulation: JND is influenced by the amount of background stimulation present when the stimuli are presented.4. The individual's attention and sensitivity: JND can vary based on an individual's attention to the stimuli and their sensitivity to the changes.5. The context: JND can be influenced by the context in which the stimuli are presented. For example, the JND for taste may be affected by the previous flavors consumed.Overall, JND is a subjective phenomenon that varies from individual to individual and from situation to situation.
