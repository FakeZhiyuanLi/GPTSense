The research performed in the 1970s by psychologists Sandra Bem and Robert Spence showed that masculinity and femininity were not two distinct categories, but rather a continuum with varying degrees of traits that were considered typically masculine or feminine. They developed the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI), which measured an individual's level of masculinity, femininity, and androgyny (having both masculine and feminine traits). Their research found that individuals who were androgynous scored higher in overall mental health and had more flexibility in their behavior and attitudes than those who scored highly in either masculinity or femininity. The research challenged traditional gender roles and encouraged society to embrace more gender-neutral attitudes and behaviors.
