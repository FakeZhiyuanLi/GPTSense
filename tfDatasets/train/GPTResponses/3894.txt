Chemical digestion is the process of breaking down large molecules of food into smaller molecules with the help of enzymes and other chemicals present in the digestive system. This process involves the breakdown of carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids into their respective constituent molecules, such as glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids. Chemical digestion usually takes place in the stomach and small intestine and is essential for the absorption of nutrients from food.
