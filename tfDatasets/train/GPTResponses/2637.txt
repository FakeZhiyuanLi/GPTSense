Replication origins are specific locations on a DNA molecule where the process of DNA replication begins. These origins are recognized by enzymes called helicases, which unwind the double-stranded DNA molecule, creating a replication bubble. The replication machinery then proceeds to replicate the DNA sequence in both directions from the origin, resulting in two identical copies of the original DNA molecule. The number and location of replication origins can vary between different organisms and even between different cell types within the same organism.
