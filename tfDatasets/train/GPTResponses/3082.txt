Genocide is an example of a type of universally prohibited action that no state can legally assume an obligation to commit or permit through a treaty. The United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide sets out that genocide is a crime under international law and prohibits any act committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group. No state can enter into a treaty that allows or condones the commission of genocide.
