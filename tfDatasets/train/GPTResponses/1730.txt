Most modern treaties typically outline the locations of treaty copies in their "Article XXI - Depositary and Authentic Texts" section. This is where the treaty will specify the office or institution responsible for keeping the original treaty text and distributing certified copies to signatory nations. The treaty may also specify which languages the treaty text will be available in for distribution.
