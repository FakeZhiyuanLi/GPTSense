During the flash smelting process, the silicate slag is created as a byproduct of the reaction between the copper concentrate and the high-temperature furnace gases. The silicate slag has a lower density than the molten copper and can be tapped off from the bottom of the furnace.The silicate slag is then cooled and crushed into a fine powder, which can be used as a raw material for cement production or as a construction material. The silica content in the slag makes it an ideal substitute for sand in concrete production.The flash smelting process is designed to maximize the recovery of copper without creating excessive amounts of waste. Therefore, the silicate slag is considered a valuable byproduct of the process that can be reused in other industries.
