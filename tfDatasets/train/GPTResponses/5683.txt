The historical record attests to Jewish communities in southern Europe since at least the Roman Empire, with evidence of Jewish presence in Italy, Greece, and Spain dating back to the first centuries CE. However, many Jewish communities in southern Europe were established during the Middle Ages, particularly in the 10th-13th centuries, when Jews from the Middle East migrated to the region and were granted protection and rights under Islamic and Christian rulers.
