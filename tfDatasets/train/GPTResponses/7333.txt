The rotor of a hysteresis synchronous motor is a smooth cylinder made of a ferromagnetic material such as steel or iron. It is solid and cylindrical in shape, with a length that is usually greater than its diameter. The rotor does not have any windings, but it is magnetized due to its construction. Its magnetic properties are such that it resists changes in the direction of the magnetic field, hence the term hysteresis. This resistance to change ensures that the rotor maintains a consistent speed and phase with the rotating magnetic field produced by the stator.
