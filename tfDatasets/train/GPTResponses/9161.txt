The flexibility and ambiguity of ordinary language make it difficult to apply the formalist definition. Ordinary language can be used in a variety of ways and can often contain multiple meanings or interpretations. In contrast, the formalist definition requires precise and rigid definitions of terms and concepts. Therefore, it can be challenging to fit the fluid nature of ordinary language into the strict requirements of the formalist approach. Additionally, ordinary language is often influenced by context, emotion, and personal experience, making it even harder to apply a standardized and objective approach like formalism.
