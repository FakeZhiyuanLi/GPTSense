There is no single "Asian Presbyterian Church" in the United States, as there are many different Presbyterian congregations and denominations that are made up primarily of Asian American members. Some examples include the Korean Presbyterian Church in America (KPCA), the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan (PCT) in America, the Chinese Presbyterian Church in America (CPCA), and the Taiwanese Presbyterian Church of Greater Los Angeles.
