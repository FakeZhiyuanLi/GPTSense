FLNG technology (Floating Liquefied Natural Gas) was based on several developments, including:1. LNG technology - This technology involves cooling natural gas to a liquid state in order to transport and store it. It was first developed in the 1960s.2. Offshore platform technology - Floating platforms for drilling and production in offshore oil and gas fields were first developed in the 1940s.3. Shipbuilding technology - The development of advanced shipbuilding techniques, including lightweight materials and advanced propulsion systems, enabled the construction of large, floating LNG production facilities.4. Safety and environmental regulations - Improved safety and environmental regulations in the oil and gas industry led to the development of FLNG technology, which allows for the production of LNG in remote offshore locations without the need for onshore infrastructure.5. Computational fluid dynamics - Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software allowed engineers to simulate the complex fluid dynamics of LNG production processes, leading to more efficient and effective FLNG designs.
