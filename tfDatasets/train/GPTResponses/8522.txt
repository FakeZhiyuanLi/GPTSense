One possible objection to the theory of integrated variation is that it does not account for the possibility of independent variation in different traits. The theory assumes that traits have to be coordinated and integrated in order for the organism to function optimally, and therefore any variation in one trait must be compensated for by a corresponding variation in another trait. However, it is possible for traits to vary independently without affecting the overall function of the organism. For example, an individual may have longer fingers without any corresponding changes in their other traits.
