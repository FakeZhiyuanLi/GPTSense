Brahmagupta is credited with being the first to use the number zero as a placeholder in mathematical equations and calculations. He also demonstrated how the number zero can be used to solve equations involving addition and subtraction. This was a significant development in the history of mathematics, as it paved the way for the development of algebra and other advanced mathematical concepts.
