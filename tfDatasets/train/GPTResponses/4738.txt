is being studied and to ensure that the research remains focused and on-task. Boundaries can take many different forms, such as geographical boundaries, temporal boundaries, or conceptual boundaries.For example, a researcher studying the effects of air pollution on human health might define their study within specific geographic boundaries, such as only including data from cities with populations greater than one million people. They might also establish temporal boundaries, such as only looking at data from the past decade. Additionally, they might set conceptual boundaries, such as only looking at the effects of air pollution on respiratory health, rather than examining its impact on overall well-being or other health outcomes.Overall, boundaries play an important role in ensuring that research is thorough, focused, and objective, and they help to prevent the research from becoming too broad or unfocused.
