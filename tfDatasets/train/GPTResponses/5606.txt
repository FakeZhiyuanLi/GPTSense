Excessive drug regulation is said to suppress innovation and increase the cost of drug development and prescription drugs. It can also limit patient access to potentially life-saving medication, delay the availability of new treatments, and increase the time and cost of clinical trials. Some argue that excessive regulation can also stifle competition, discourage investment, and harm economic growth.
