The current US fleet of Nimitz-class carriers will be replaced with the Gerald R. Ford-class carriers. The first ship of this class, USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78), was commissioned in 2017, and several others are under construction or planned for the future. The Gerald R. Ford-class carriers are designed to be more advanced and capable than the Nimitz-class carriers, with better weapons systems, sensors, and propulsion technology.
