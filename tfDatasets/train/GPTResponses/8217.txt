Maxwell's equations are a set of four fundamental equations in electromagnetism that describe how electric and magnetic fields behave, interact and propagate in space. The four equations are:1. Gauss's Law for electric fields: This equation describes how electric charges create electric fields, and is represented by the equation ∇⋅E=ρ/ε₀, where ∇ is the divergence operator, E is the electric field, ρ is the electric charge density, and ε₀ is the permittivity of free space.2. Gauss's Law for magnetic fields: This equation describes how magnetic fields behave, and is represented by the equation ∇⋅B=0, where B is the magnetic field.3. Faraday's Law: This equation describes how a changing magnetic field induces an electric field, and is represented by the equation ∇×E=−∂B/∂t, where ∂/∂t represents the partial derivative with respect to time.4. Ampère's Law: This equation describes how a changing electric field can induce a magnetic field, and is represented by the equation ∇×B=μ₀(J+ε₀∂E/∂t), where J is the current density and μ₀ is the magnetic permeability of free space.
