A calculator or a computer can be used to demonstrate modular addition. The modulo function can be used to show the remainder obtained after division of two integers, which is the basic concept behind modular arithmetic. Alternatively, a physical modular arithmetic kit can also be used to demonstrate modular addition, which includes modular arithmetic blocks, number line, and other tools to perform modular arithmetic operations.
