Australia also has a curriculum that includes nutritional education. In fact, the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority (ACARA) includes a specific health and physical education curriculum that covers topics such as healthy eating, nutrition, and physical activity. The curriculum is designed to help children develop the knowledge and skills they need to make informed choices about their diet and lifestyle, and promote overall health and wellbeing.
