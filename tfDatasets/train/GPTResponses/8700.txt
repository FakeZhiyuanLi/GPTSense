Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection posits that species gradually change over time as they adapt to changing environments and interact with other species. This process results in the formation of new species over millions of years. This theory supports many observations and phenomena, such as:1. The existence of transitional fossils: The fossil record shows many species that have features of both their ancestral and descendant species. These transitional fossils provide evidence of gradual change over time and support the idea of evolution.2. Biogeography: The distribution of animals and plants around the world makes sense in light of the theory of evolution. For example, Darwin observed that similar species were found on different continents, but not on nearby islands. This is consistent with the idea that these species evolved separately on their respective continents.3. Homology: Many organisms have similar features, such as the forelimbs of mammals. This suggests that these features evolved from a common ancestor, rather than being individually designed.4. Artificial selection: Humans have been selectively breeding plants and animals for thousands of years, resulting in the evolution of new breeds and varieties. This process demonstrates that traits can be selected for and passed down from generation to generation.All of these observations and phenomena can be explained by the theory of evolution, but are difficult to explain if each species were independently created. Therefore, Darwin's theory provides a unifying framework that can support many different areas of biology and natural history.
