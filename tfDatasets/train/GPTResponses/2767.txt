the basis of traditional practices?The state affairs partly grew up on the basis of traditional practices because these practices had been established and followed by the people for a long time. These traditional practices had become deeply ingrained in the culture and customs of the society. Therefore, when the state was established, it was natural for it to adopt and incorporate these practices into its functioning. Additionally, traditional practices provided a sense of continuity and stability to the state, which made it easier for people to accept and follow the rules and regulations imposed by the state. Thus, the state affairs partly grew up on the basis of traditional practices as they provided a strong foundation for the governance of the society.
