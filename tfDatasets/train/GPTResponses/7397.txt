No, lignified cells cannot continue dividing. Lignification is a process where cells become inflexible and rigid due to the deposition of lignin. This process usually occurs during the maturation of cells, and once cells are lignified, they lose the ability to divide. Lignified cells are dead cells that provide structural support to the plant. However, cells that are not fully lignified, such as those in the cambium or vascular tissue, can still divide and differentiate into various cell types.
