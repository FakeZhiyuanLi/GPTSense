During World War II, Buckingham Palace was the London residence of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth (later known as the Queen Mother). They were in residence at the palace throughout the war, with the exception of a brief period in 1940 when they temporarily relocated to Windsor Castle due to bomb damage to the palace.
