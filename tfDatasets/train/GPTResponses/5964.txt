The approval process for a product in the United Kingdom and other countries varies from that of the United States, and the timeline for approval can differ significantly based on a variety of factors, including the product type and the regulatory agency responsible for the approval. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a generalized answer as to when approval would occur in these countries after approval in the United States. Typically, companies will need to submit separate applications and undergo the approval process in each country where they want to market their product.
