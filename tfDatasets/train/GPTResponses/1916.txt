The use of genetic engineering techniques, such as CRISPR-Cas9, has become a common research tool with model organisms. This approach allows scientists to modify specific genes in a precise manner, allowing for the study of gene function and the creation of disease models. Other common research tools with model organisms include imaging techniques, behavioral assays, and biochemical assays.
