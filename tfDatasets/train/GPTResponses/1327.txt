Apartheid was a system of institutionalized racial segregation and discrimination in South Africa from 1948 to the early 1990s. It was a policy enforced by the National Party government that privileged white South Africans over non-white citizens and attempted to maintain the political, economic, and social dominance of the white minority. The term apartheid itself means "apartness" or "separateness" in Afrikaans.
