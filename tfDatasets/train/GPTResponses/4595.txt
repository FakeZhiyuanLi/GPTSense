It is unclear which specific federal judge and case is being referred to, as there have been multiple instances throughout United States history where immigrants from Mexico faced discriminatory obstacles to citizenship due to their race. However, a notable example is the 1909 case United States v. Wong Kim Ark, in which the Supreme Court ruled that a child born in the United States to Chinese parents was a citizen, establishing the principle of birthright citizenship. This case did not directly involve immigrants from Mexico, but it set a precedent for the interpretation of the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment that would later be applied to all individuals born in the United States regardless of their parents' race or nationality.
