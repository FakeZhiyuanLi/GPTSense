The biggest cathedral in Switzerland is the Cathedral of St. Pierre in Geneva, and it was originally built between the 12th and 13th centuries. However, it has undergone numerous renovations and additions over the centuries, including significant work in the 16th and 18th centuries. The current form of the cathedral reflects a mixture of Gothic and Neoclassical styles.
