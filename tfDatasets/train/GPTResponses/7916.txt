The larger three-byte split token with a seven-bit hub number, 12 bits of control flags, and a five-bit CRC were created to improve the performance and efficiency of token ring networks. The split token methodology is used in token ring networks to manage the access of nodes to the network. The larger split token allows for more efficient management of the network by providing more control flags to handle multiple network events and error conditions. The increased CRC size also helps to ensure data integrity while transferring data across the network. Overall, the larger three-byte split token helps to improve the reliability and stability of token ring networks.
