The first stage of Jewish marriage is the engagement period, also known as the Shidduch or Shidduchin. This is when the couple's families, or a matchmaker, introduce them to each other with the intent of marriage. During this stage, the couple gets to know each other and decides whether they are compatible and want to move forward with the wedding.
