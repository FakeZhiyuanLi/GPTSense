One of the most important genome maps that greatly aided the Human Genome Project was the map of the genome of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. This map provided scientists with valuable insights into the organization and function of genes, and helped to identify many of the genes that are also present in the human genome. Additionally, the genome map of the bacterium Escherichia coli was also instrumental in the early stages of the Human Genome Project, as it provided a model for gene sequencing and analysis. Other important genome maps that aided the Human Genome Project included those of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, and the mouse.
