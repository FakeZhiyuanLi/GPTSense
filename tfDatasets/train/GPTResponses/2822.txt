Heartwood is the non-living or dead central part of a tree trunk that is usually darker, denser, and stronger than the outer sapwood. Despite being dead, heartwood can continue to have chemical reactions with various substances, particularly with wood preservatives, which can penetrate the wood and react with the existing chemicals to enhance its durability and resistance to decay. Heartwood can also react with water and undergo a process called heartwood extractives leaching, where certain chemicals are leached out of the wood, making it less susceptible to decay and insect attacks. Additionally, heartwood can react with tannins, which are found in some wood species, and form a chemical complex that gives the wood a characteristic dark color.
