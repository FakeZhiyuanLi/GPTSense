One type of architecture that heavily influenced the New Delhi town plan is the Mughal architecture. The use of red sandstone, marble, and intricate carvings are prominent features of Mughal architecture that can be seen in many of the buildings in New Delhi, such as the Rashtrapati Bhavan and the India Gate. The Mughal architecture style was incorporated into the town plan by British architects Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker, who sought to create a fusion of Indian and European architectural styles.
