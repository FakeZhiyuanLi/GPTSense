The process that plants undergo in order to obtain carbohydrates is called photosynthesis. In photosynthesis, plants use energy from sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose, a type of carbohydrate. Chlorophyll, the pigment found in plant cells, absorbs light energy which is then used to split water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen ions. The hydrogen ions are transported across the inner membrane of the chloroplast and combine with CO2 to form glucose, a type of carbohydrate that the plant uses for energy and to build other molecules. The oxygen produced during photosynthesis is released into the air as a byproduct.
