The technique used in art to examine underlying layers of a painting without damaging it is called non-invasive imaging or non-destructive testing. This can include using technologies such as X-ray, infrared, ultraviolet, or multispectral imaging to view different layers of a painting without physically altering or harming the original artwork.
