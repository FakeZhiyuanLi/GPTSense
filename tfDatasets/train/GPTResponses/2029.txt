The law that regulates the rules for time shifts in Israel according to the Jewish calendar is called the "Time Act" or "Summer Time Act". It was first enacted in 1946 and has been amended several times since then. The law determines the start and end of daylight saving time (DST) in the country, which is based on the Jewish calendar and the date of the Passover holiday.
