The Comstock Law, passed in 1873, prohibited the distribution of any materials or information related to birth control, including contraception and abortion. It was named after its sponsor, Anthony Comstock, who was a self-appointed moral crusader against obscenity and vice. The Comstock Law was not fully repealed until 1971.
