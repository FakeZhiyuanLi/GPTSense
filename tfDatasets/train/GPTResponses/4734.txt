A redshift indicates that space objects date from the early days of the universe. This is because as objects in space move away from us, the light waves they emit stretch out, causing them to appear more red than they would if the object was stationary or moving towards us. This redshift can be used to determine the distance and age of objects in the universe, with objects exhibiting a higher redshift indicating they are farther away and therefore older.
