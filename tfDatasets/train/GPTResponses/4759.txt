The vibrational frequencies of molecules usually correspond to the stretching and bending of chemical bonds between atoms in the molecule. The different vibrations correspond to different modes of motion, and the frequency of the vibration is determined by the mass and stiffness of the atoms and the strength of the chemical bond between them. The vibrational frequencies of molecules can be used to identify and characterize them, and can also be used to study chemical reactions and molecular dynamics.
