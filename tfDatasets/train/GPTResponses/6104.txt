The use of Sanskrit as an upper class language produced resistance among the lower castes and non-Hindu communities in India. Sanskrit was associated with Brahminical culture and was used to maintain the social hierarchy, promoting the dominance of the higher castes over the lower castes. This led to a sense of discrimination and exclusion among the lower castes and non-Hindu communities who were not proficient in Sanskrit. The use of Sanskrit also contributed to the marginalization of indigenous languages and cultures, which were considered inferior to Sanskrit. As a result, the use of Sanskrit as an upper class language sparked cultural and linguistic resistance movements, especially during the colonial period, as a symbol of anti-Brahminism and anti-colonialism.
