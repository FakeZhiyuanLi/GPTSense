Sweet wort is separated during the brewing process after the mash is complete and the wort has been boiled with hops. The separation process is called lautering, where the liquid wort is separated from the spent grain solids. This usually takes place in a vessel called a lauter tun, where the wort is drawn off from the bottom while the spent grains are retained on top.
