international breaks, which are periods of several days when national teams gather to prepare and play matches. These breaks typically occur during the club football season and allow players to represent their countries without disrupting domestic league schedules. Friendlies during international breaks are often used as opportunities for teams to experiment with tactics, try out new players, and build cohesion ahead of important competitive matches.
