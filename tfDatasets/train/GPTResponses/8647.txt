The fire, which was started by British forces, destroyed a large portion of the city center, including many homes and businesses. The resulting chaos and destruction caused many deaths and forced thousands of people to flee their homes. The exact number of casualties is unknown, but it is estimated that around 500 people died as a result of the fire.
