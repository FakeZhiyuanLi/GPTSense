The general sentiment following the losses in World War I was one of disillusionment, despair, and an overwhelming sense of loss. The war had claimed millions of lives, destroyed homes and communities, and left entire nations devastated. Many people felt that the sacrifices had been in vain and questioned the leadership and decisions that had led to the conflict. The aftermath of World War I also contributed to the rise of authoritarianism and extremist ideologies, which would eventually lead to another world war.
