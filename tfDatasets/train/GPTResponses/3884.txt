The molecules are absorbed through a variety of mechanisms depending on the organism and the type of molecule.For example, in humans, carbohydrates and proteins are broken down into smaller molecules by enzymes in the digestive system and absorbed through the walls of the small intestine into the bloodstream. Lipids (fats) are broken down and absorbed through a similar process but also require the assistance of bile produced by the liver.In plants, molecules are absorbed through different parts of the plant. Water and minerals are absorbed through the roots via osmosis and active transport. Carbon dioxide is absorbed through tiny pores called stomata on the leaves.In bacteria, nutrients are absorbed through the cell membrane through a process called passive diffusion or active transport. Some bacteria also have specialized mechanisms for uptake of specific molecules such as iron.Overall, the process of molecule absorption varies widely depending on the organism and the specific molecule being absorbed.
