Airfield protection in WWII was mostly carried out by ground troops, including Anti-Aircraft Gunners, Infantry, and Armored units such as tanks. The responsibility for airfield defense was often shared among different units, depending on the location and threat level. Additionally, Allied and Axis powers both developed variations of airfield defense tactics and techniques throughout the war.
