The significant portion of BYU's operating costs is subsidized by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The LDS Church provides significant resources to BYU, including financial support, leadership, and educational programs. According to the university's financial reports, approximately two-thirds of BYU's operating budget comes from the LDS Church. In addition, BYU also receives funding from research grants, tuition fees, and private donations.
