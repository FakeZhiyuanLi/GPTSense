A neutron poison absorbs neutrons, which are subatomic particles that are essential for nuclear reactions to occur. By absorbing neutrons, neutron poisons can effectively shut down nuclear reactions and prevent further fission from occurring. This can be useful in case of an emergency, as it can help prevent a nuclear reactor from overheating and potentially causing a catastrophic meltdown. Some examples of neutron poisons include boron, cadmium, and silver.
