Smaller organizations typically use simple integrations that can be easily implemented and managed. These integrations may include basic software integrations such as email marketing tools, customer relationship management (CRM) systems, and accounting software. They may also use cloud-based solutions and APIs that connect different software systems and automate processes such as data collection and analysis. Additionally, smaller organizations may use pre-built integrations that come with their software solutions or use easy-to-use plug-ins and extensions that simplify the integration process.
