A solar chimney is a passive solar ventilation system that uses natural convection to circulate air in a building. It consists of a tall vertical chimney that is situated on the sunny side of a building and is connected to a lower intake vent. As the sun heats the air inside the chimney, it rises and creates a suction effect that draws cool air from the intake vent into the building. This system is particularly effective in hot and arid climates, where it can reduce the need for mechanical air conditioning by up to 50%.
