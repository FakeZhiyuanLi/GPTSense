Rawhide is a common material sometimes used for dog chews that reacts similarly to wood because of its water content. When rawhide dries out, it becomes harder and more brittle, making it a good choice for satisfying a dog's chewing instinct. However, it is important to supervise dogs when they are chewing on rawhide to prevent choking or other digestive issues.
