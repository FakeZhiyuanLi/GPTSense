The first step in a school of Buddhism is typically taking refuge in the Three Jewels (Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha) as a way of committing to the path of Buddhism and seeking guidance from the teachings and community. This may involve reciting specific phrases or taking part in a ceremony to formalize the commitment.
