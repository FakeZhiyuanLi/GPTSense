The Treaty of Sch√∂nbrunn (1809) did not establish an independent Poland, but some territories were handed over to the newly created Duchy of Warsaw, a client state of the French Empire. These territories included parts of Galicia, Western Belarus, and the western part of the Imperial Russian-controlled partition of Poland.
