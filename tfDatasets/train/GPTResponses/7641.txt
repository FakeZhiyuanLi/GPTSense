The monarch can make use of a few options if they refuse to give royal assent to a bill passed by Parliament:1. The monarch can seek the advice of the government and the House of Lords, and ask them to reconsider the bill or make amendments to it.2. The monarch can withhold their assent indefinitely, effectively "vetoing" the bill. This is a very rare move and would be seen as a constitutional crisis.3. The monarch can choose to abdicate their role in the legislative process and delegate it to a representative, such as the Lord Chancellor or a designated member of the royal family.However, it is important to note that the monarch's role in the legislative process is largely ceremonial and symbolic, and they are expected to follow the advice and guidance of the elected government. A refusal to give royal assent would be seen as a violation of this constitutional norm and could lead to a constitutional crisis.
