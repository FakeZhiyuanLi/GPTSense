One of the most well-known herbalists and writers about medicinal plants in the 16th century was English physician Nicholas Culpeper. His book, the "Complete Herbal," was first published in 1653 and contained detailed descriptions of over 400 medicinal plants and their uses. Culpeper believed strongly in the power of nature and was a proponent of using herbs and plants for healing rather than relying solely on the medical practices of his time. Other notable herbalists of the 16th century include Hieronymus Bock, Leonhart Fuchs, and William Turner.
