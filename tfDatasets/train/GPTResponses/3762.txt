Animal recovery after the Permian-Triassic extinction took a long time. It is estimated that it took around 5-10 million years for the ecosystem to recover and for biodiversity to return to pre-extinction levels. However, it took much longer for some groups of organisms to fully recover, with some groups taking up to 100 million years to reach pre-extinction levels.
