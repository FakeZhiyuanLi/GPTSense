There were several factors that exacerbated segregation in Detroit, including:1. Discriminatory Housing Practices: Real estate agents and landlords largely restricted African Americans to certain neighborhoods, leading to the formation of segregated communities.2. The Great Migration: The influx of African Americans from the South during the early 20th century led to overcrowding in certain neighborhoods and further fueled segregation.3. Government Policies: The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) backed loans for white Americans to purchase homes in suburban areas, while largely denying loans to African Americans. The practice, known as redlining, further entrenched segregation.4. Riots: Racial tensions boiled over in the 1940s, 60s, and 70s, leading to riots in predominantly African American neighborhoods. These riots further deepened segregation as white residents fled the city.5. Economic Decline: As Detroit's economy declined in the 20th century, African Americans were disproportionately affected. This led to further segregation as individuals who could afford to move to other areas left behind a predominantly African American city.
