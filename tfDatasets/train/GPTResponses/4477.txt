The lack of records in non-Wessex dialects after the unification of Alfred is also attributed to the fact that Wessex became the dominant political and cultural power in England at that time. As a result, the language of Wessex, which eventually evolved into Early Modern English, became the standardized form of the language, and other dialects were marginalized and eventually absorbed into it. This process of language shift and assimilation was facilitated by the spread of education, literature, and bureaucracy, which used the standard form of English as the norm. Therefore, non-Wessex dialects were not actively preserved or recorded, nor were they used for official purposes or cultural expression, leading to their eventual obsolescence or extinction.
