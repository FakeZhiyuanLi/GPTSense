A post-vedic form of Sanskrit is found in the Buddhist and Jain texts from the 4th century BCE to the 12th century CE. This form of Sanskrit is called Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit (BHS) or Jain Hybrid Sanskrit (JHS) and is heavily influenced by the Prakrit languages spoken in the regions where Buddhism and Jainism originated. It also shows a degree of simplification and standardization in grammar and pronunciation, making it more accessible to non-Brahmin communities. BHS and JHS have their own distinct phonetic and grammatical features, and their vocabulary includes loanwords from Prakrit and Pali, as well as new words coined to express Buddhist and Jain concepts.
