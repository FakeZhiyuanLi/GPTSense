Theologians attempted to find a way to reconcile the theory of evolution with the concept of divine creation. This led to the development of theistic evolution, which is the idea that God created the universe and the natural laws that govern it, including evolution. Theistic evolutionists believe that God is the ultimate cause of all things, including evolution, and that the natural world reveals his wisdom, creativity, and power. Some theologians also saw Darwin's theory as a way to better understand God's method of creation and argued that evolution should not be seen as a threat to religious faith.
