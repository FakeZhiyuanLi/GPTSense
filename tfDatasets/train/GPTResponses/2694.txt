The ITU-R started working towards setting a single international HDTV standard in the 1980s. Specifically, it was in 1986 that the ITU-R established a study group to explore the technical parameters for a global HDTV standard. This eventually led to the development of the first HDTV standard, known as ITU-R BT.709, which was adopted in 1990. Since then, the ITU-R has continued to refine and update the HDTV standard to keep up with advances in technology and consumer expectations.
