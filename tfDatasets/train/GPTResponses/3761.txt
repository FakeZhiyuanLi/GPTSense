The Code of Canon Law does not specify that wine for the Eucharist must be "natural and not corrupt." However, it does state in Canon 924, "The most holy Sacrifice of the Eucharist must be celebrated in bread, and in wine to which a small amount of water is to be added." Furthermore, the General Instruction of the Roman Missal states that the wine used for the Eucharist must be "natural and made from grapes of the vine" (no. 322). The Code of Canon Law and the General Instruction require that the wine for the Eucharist be of a quality suitable for sacred use and not adulterated or otherwise corrupted.
