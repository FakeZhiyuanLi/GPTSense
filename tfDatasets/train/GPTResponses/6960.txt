The main advantage of using inert gas in a light bulb is that it increases the life of the filament. When the filament is heated, it releases electrons which collide with gas molecules, causing the filament to evaporate over time. Inert gases, such as argon and nitrogen, have large atoms that do not react easily with the filament, thus reducing the rate of evaporation and extending the life of the bulb. Additionally, inert gas can enhance the brightness and color rendering of the light produced by the bulb.
