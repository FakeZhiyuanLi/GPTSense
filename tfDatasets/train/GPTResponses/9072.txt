In suffix pairs, a suffix is added to the end of a word to modify its meaning or create a different word. The second suffix is added to the modified word to create yet another different word or to intensify the meaning of the first suffix. For example, in the suffix pair -ness and -ful, -ness is added to the end of a word to indicate a state or quality, and -ful is added to the modified word to indicate fullness or completeness of that state or quality. Examples include boldness and blissful, where boldness indicates the state of being bold, and blissful intensifies the state of bliss.
