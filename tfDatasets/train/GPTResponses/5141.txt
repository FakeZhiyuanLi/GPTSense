The cause of glacier outflow is the increase in temperature due to global warming. As temperatures rise, glaciers melt and discharge water, causing the outflow of glacier ice. This process is known as ice melt or glacier retreat. Other factors such as albedo feedback, where the melting exposes darker ground which absorbs more heat, and positive feedback loops, where melting accelerates melting, may also contribute to glacier outflows.
