The major implication of the Erie Doctrine is that federal courts must apply state law in substantive matters when hearing cases based on diversity jurisdiction. This means that the outcome of cases can vary depending on the state law applied, even if the same case is heard in different federal courts. This has significant implications for parties in a lawsuit, as they must carefully consider the state law that will be applied and the potential impact on their case. Additionally, it reinforces the importance of state law in our federal system of government.
