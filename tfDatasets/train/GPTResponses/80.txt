During World War I, European chemists developed various poisonous gases, such as chlorine gas, phosgene gas, and mustard gas, that were used as chemical weapons on the battlefield. These gases caused severe respiratory problems, blindness, and even death. In World War II, German chemists developed nerve agents, such as tabun, sarin, and VX, that were also used as chemical weapons. These agents affect the nervous system and can cause convulsions, paralysis, and even death.
