are known as Protestant churches. They are characterized by their emphasis on individual faith, the Bible as the ultimate authority, and baptism as a symbol of one's commitment to Christ. They are called Baptist because of their emphasis on the practice of adult baptism by immersion, as opposed to infant baptism. Baptist churches also typically adhere to congregational governance, meaning that decisions are made by the congregation as a whole rather than a hierarchical structure.
