Most escort carriers were built from existing merchant ship hulls, such as cargo ships or oil tankers, that were then converted into aircraft carriers. This was because it was more cost-effective and faster to build compared to starting construction from scratch. The conversion process involved adding a flight deck, hangar deck, and elevators, as well as installing necessary equipment and modifications to accommodate aircraft and their operations. Some escort carriers were also built from scratch using modified destroyer or cruiser hulls.
