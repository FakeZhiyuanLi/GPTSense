In countries like Canada with a very low incidence of tuberculosis infection, the BCG vaccine is typically not given routinely to the general population. However, it may be offered in certain situations, such as to healthcare workers who may be at increased risk of exposure to tuberculosis or to individuals traveling to areas with a high prevalence of tuberculosis. Additionally, some indigenous communities in Canada with a higher incidence of tuberculosis may also receive the BCG vaccine.
