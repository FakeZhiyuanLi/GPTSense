The Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949 allow a bill to be presented for Royal Assent even if the House of Lords has refused to pass it. These Acts give the House of Commons the power to overrule the House of Lords if they block a bill that the Commons have passed. The Acts state that if the House of Lords has rejected a bill twice, with an interval of at least one year between the first and second reading, then the bill can be presented for Royal Assent without the consent of the House of Lords.
