Gene products are biochemical molecules synthesized by a gene using the genetic information coded in DNA. Some examples of gene products include:1. Proteins: these are the most common and diverse gene products, with functions such as catalysis, signaling, transportation, and structural support.2. Enzymes: proteins that catalyze specific chemical reactions and play a key role in cellular metabolism.3. Hormones: signaling molecules secreted by endocrine glands to regulate various physiological processes.4. Antibodies: proteins produced by immune cells to identify and neutralize foreign antigens.5. RNA molecules: transcribed from DNA, which serve as templates for protein synthesis (messenger RNA, mRNA) or perform other regulatory functions (such as microRNAs).6. Lipids: including fatty acids, phospholipids, and cholesterol, which play important structural and signaling roles in cellular membranes.7. Carbohydrates: including sugars and polysaccharides, which can serve as structural components or energy stores within cells.
