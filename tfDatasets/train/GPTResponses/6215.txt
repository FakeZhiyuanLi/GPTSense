One of the violations of Napoleon's policies by Russia that led to tensions between Russia and France was the Continental System, which was designed to isolate Britain economically by creating a European-wide embargo on British goods. Russia agreed to join the Continental System but failed to enforce it strictly, allowing British goods to continue to flow into the country. Additionally, Russia's refusal to participate in the French-led war against Great Britain in 1808 was seen as a betrayal by Napoleon and further strained their relationship. Finally, Russia's invasion of Ottoman-controlled territory in the Balkans in 1806 and subsequent annexation of a large portion of Ottoman territory in 1812 were viewed by Napoleon as a challenge to his own expansionist ambitions.
