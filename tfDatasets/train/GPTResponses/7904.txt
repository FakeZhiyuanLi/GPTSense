There are several factors that can prevent AA (Arachidonic acid) from being released from membranes:1. The presence of phospholipase A2 inhibitors: Phospholipase A2 is the enzyme responsible for releasing AA from phospholipids in the cell membrane. Certain compounds can inhibit the activity of phospholipase A2, thereby preventing the release of AA.2. Low levels of intracellular calcium: Calcium ions are required for the activation of phospholipase A2. If the intracellular calcium levels are low, the enzyme cannot be activated, and AA release is prevented.3. The activity of membrane-bound acyl-coenzyme A synthetase: This enzyme converts AA into AA-CoA, which makes it less available for release. If the activity of acyl-coenzyme A synthetase is high, AA is more likely to be converted to AA-CoA and remains trapped in the membrane.4. Membrane stiffness: The rigidity of the cell membrane can also prevent AA release. A more fluid membrane will make it easier for phospholipase A2 to access the fatty acids in the membrane and release AA. On the other hand, a more rigid membrane will make it difficult for the enzyme to access and release AA.
