Alternative methods have little to no impact on the environment.3. Cost-effective: Using alternative pest control methods can be cheaper in the long run as they do not require repeated applications of chemicals or equipment.4. Improved efficacy: Traditional pest control methods can often result in pests developing resistance to pesticides, making them less effective over time. Alternative methods, particularly biological control, can be more effective and longer-lasting.5. Consumer and market demand: Consumers are increasingly demanding environmentally friendly and sustainable products and services. This demand is driving the growth of alternative pest control methods.
