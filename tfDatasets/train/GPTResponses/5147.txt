Krill are incredibly important to the Antarctic area because they are at the base of the food chain and a vital food source for many marine species. They are eaten by several species of whales, seals, penguins, and other birds. Krill are also a critical source of food for Antarctic fish, such as the Antarctic silverfish. Without krill, many of these species would struggle to find enough food, which could have far-reaching impacts on the entire Antarctic marine ecosystem. Additionally, krill are a crucial link for the transfer of energy from smaller organisms to larger ones, making them essential in the overall functioning of the Antarctic food web.
