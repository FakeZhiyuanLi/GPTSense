The defeat of the Emishi is a complex historical process that took place over several centuries, starting from around the 8th century and continuing until the early 10th century. However, the most significant defeat of the Emishi occurred in the year 802 when the Emperor Kammu of Japan sent a large military expedition led by the famous general Sakanoue no Tamuramaro to subjugate the Emishi tribes in the northeast of Japan. This military campaign was successful, and it resulted in the establishment of a new province called Mutsu and the gradual assimilation of the Emishi into Japanese culture.
