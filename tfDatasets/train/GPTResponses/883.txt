The Portuguese Africa territories' borders were formally established through a series of agreements known as the Portuguese Scramble, which occurred between 1884 and 1885. These agreements were part of the wider Scramble for Africa, a period of rapid colonization and division of the continent by European powers. The Portuguese government sought to secure their claims to the African territories they had colonized by negotiating borders with other European colonial powers, such as Germany, France, and Britain, to avoid conflicts and to protect their economic interests in the region. The borders were mainly drawn based on the colonial powers' interests, and not on the existing ethnic, linguistic or cultural boundaries of the African peoples living in the territories.
