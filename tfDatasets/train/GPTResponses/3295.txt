Various scholars and musicians have argued that the commercialization of classical music could have negative implications for the music industry. Some notable examples include:1. Charles Rosen: Charles Rosen was a renowned pianist, music critic, and author who wrote extensively on classical music. In his book "The Classical Style," Rosen argues that the commodification of classical music can stifle creativity and individuality. He suggests that the pressure to please audiences and sell records can lead to a focus on popular, crowd-pleasing works, rather than on innovative or challenging compositions.2. Theodor Adorno: Adorno was a German philosopher and musicologist who was deeply critical of the commercialization of music. In his book "The Culture Industry," Adorno argues that the music industry is part of a larger capitalist system that prioritizes profit over artistic integrity. He suggests that the standardization and mass production of music leads to a decline in quality and an erosion of the unique cultural and historical contexts that underpin classical music.3. Glenn Gould: Glenn Gould was a celebrated Canadian pianist and recording artist who was known for his non-traditional interpretations of classical works. Gould was critical of the classical music industry for its focus on spectacle and performance over substance and artistry. He argued that the commodification of classical music had led to a homogenization of musical expression and a loss of the individuality and spontaneity that made classical music so compelling.4. John Cage: John Cage was an experimental composer who challenged many traditional notions of classical music. Cage was critical of the music industry for its focus on commercial success and its stifling of creative freedom. He suggested that musicians and composers should be free to explore new sounds and ideas, without the pressure to conform to established conventions or commercial expectations.
