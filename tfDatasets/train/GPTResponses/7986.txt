Minerals should be in their ionic or elemental form to be absorbed easier. This means that they should be in a form that is easily soluble in water and dissociated into individual ions, which are then able to be absorbed by the body. Examples of minerals in their ionic form include sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium. These minerals can be found in a variety of foods, including fruits, vegetables, dairy products, meats, and grains.
