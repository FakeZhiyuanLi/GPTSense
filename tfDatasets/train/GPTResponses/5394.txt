The teachings of Nestorius, the Patriarch of Constantinople, were addressed at the third ecumenical council, held in Ephesus in 431 AD. Nestorius' teachings about the nature of Christ were deemed heretical by the council, as they separated the human and divine natures of Christ too starkly, denying the unity of his personhood. The council affirmed the teachings of Cyril of Alexandria and declared that Christ is one person and not two, and that his humanity and divinity are inseparable.
