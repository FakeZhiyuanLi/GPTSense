The Phillips Curve claimed that inflation and economic growth were linked. It suggested that there was a trade-off between inflation and unemployment,meaning that as inflation increased, unemployment would decrease and vice versa. This theory was developed by economist A.W. Phillips in the 1950s based on his analysis of data from the United Kingdom. The Phillips Curve was widely accepted by economists until the 1970s, when stagflation (a combination of high inflation and high unemployment) occurred and challenged the theory. Today, there is still debate among economists about the relationship between inflation and economic growth.
