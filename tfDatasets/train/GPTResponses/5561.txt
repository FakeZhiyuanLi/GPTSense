The idea that Ashkenazi Jews may have descended from Khazar stock emerged in the late 19th and early 20th century. Arthur Koestler popularized the theory in his 1976 book, "The Thirteenth Tribe." However, the theory has been widely disputed and is not supported by extensive genetic evidence. The actual origin of the Ashkenazi Jews is still a topic of scientific and historical debate.
