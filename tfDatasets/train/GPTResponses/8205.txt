Johannes Kepler's model suggested that the planets orbit the Sun in ellipses, rather than perfect circles as previously thought. He also discovered that the speed of planets varies depending on their distance from the Sun, with planets moving faster when they are closer to the Sun and slower when they are farther away. Kepler's model eventually led to the development of modern astronomy and our understanding of the mechanics of our solar system.
