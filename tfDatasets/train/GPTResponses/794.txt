is called comprehensive schools. Comprehensive schools are non-selective schools that cater to students of all abilities and backgrounds. They offer a wider range of subjects and opportunities than grammar schools, and students are not selected based on academic ability. The aim of comprehensive schools is to provide equal opportunities for all students and to ensure that education is not limited by social class, income or other factors.
