There is no single piece of evidence that definitively indicates that the C-group spoke Afroasiatic languages of the Berber branches. However, researchers have made several arguments based on linguistic, archaeological, and genetic evidence:- Linguistic evidence: Scholars have noted similarities between the names of C-group sites and modern Berber languages, such as the C-group site of Abkanet being similar to the Berber word "aben," meaning "water." They have also analyzed the vocabulary of the C-group language, which has a significant percentage of Afroasiatic words.- Archaeological evidence: Material culture from C-group sites is similar to that found at contemporary Berber sites, such as the use of stone mortars and the production of ceramics with unique shapes and decoration. This suggests that there was cultural continuity between the two groups.- Genetic evidence: Studies of modern populations have found genetic links between the C-group and modern Berber populations, and genetic analyses of ancient DNA from C-group burials have found similarities with modern Berber DNA.Taken together, these lines of evidence suggest that the C-group did indeed speak an Afroasiatic language of the Berber branches. However, more research is needed to fully understand the language and culture of this ancient group.
