This question is difficult to answer definitively without more context or information about the theory in question. However, one possible answer is that the use of pointed arches to bring transverse vaults to the same height as diagonal ones goes against the traditional theory of Romanesque architecture, which typically featured round arches and barrel vaults. The pointed arch, on the other hand, is a hallmark of Gothic architecture, which emerged later and represented a departure from the earlier Romanesque style. Therefore, it could be argued that the use of pointed arches in this way represents a rejection or subversion of Romanesque architectural theory.
