Gynecomastia can occur due to changes in hormones, medications, certain medical conditions, or lifestyle factors. Some causes include:1. Hormonal Imbalance: Hormonal changes that alter the balance between estrogen (female reproductive hormone) and testosterone (male reproductive hormone) levels can lead to breast tissue enlargement. This can occur during puberty, aging, or due to medical conditions such as hypogonadism (low testosterone levels).2. Medications: Certain medications can cause gynecomastia by disrupting the body’s hormone balance. These medications include some anti-anxiety drugs, anti-depressants, anti-androgens, and steroids.3. Obesity: Being overweight or obese can lead to an excess of fat tissue in the chest area, which can make the breast tissue appear swollen.4. Medical Conditions: Certain medical conditions such as liver disease, kidney failure, and hyperthyroidism can lead to gynecomastia.5. Illegal Drug Use: Anabolic steroids, marijuana, and heroin can alter the body’s hormonal balance, leading to gynecomastia.6. Tumors: In rare cases, tumors in the pituitary gland or testes can cause hormonal imbalances that lead to gynecomastia.
