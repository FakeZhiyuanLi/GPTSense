The proliferation of secret treaties occurred mainly in the 19th and early 20th centuries, leading to the inclusion of an obligation to register treaties in the United Nations Charter in 1945. Secret treaties were common during this period, often used as a means of maintaining alliances or securing territorial gains without revealing their true intentions to other nations. Many of these treaties ultimately contributed to the outbreak of World War I and contributed to global instability. As a result, the United Nations Charter sought to promote greater transparency and accountability among nations by requiring countries to register their treaties with the UN.
