Fort Nathan Hale was renamed in honor of Nathan Hale, a Revolutionary War hero who was executed by the British in 1776. Hale was a former captain in the Continental Army who volunteered to go behind enemy lines to gather intelligence on British troop movements. He was captured by the British and sentenced to death. Hale's famous last words were, "I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country." The renaming of the fort in Hale's honor was a way to pay tribute to his bravery and sacrifice for his country.
