Zia-ul-Haq was accused of using Islamization to legitimize his authoritarian rule and suppress opposition and dissent in Pakistan. This included implementing Islamic laws and practices in the legal system, education system, and other areas of society, promoting Islamic values and symbolism in public life, and cracking down on those who opposed his regime or violated Islamic laws. Many critics argued that Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization policies were a means of consolidating his power rather than promoting genuine religious values or principles.
