The goal of protecting national parks from damage is to preserve the natural beauty and cultural significance of these areas for present and future generations. By protecting the parks, we are also protecting the ecosystems and biodiversity within them, and ensuring that these natural resources are available for scientific study, education, and recreation. Additionally, protecting national parks can benefit local communities by stimulating tourism and providing economic opportunities through outdoor recreation and conservation jobs.
