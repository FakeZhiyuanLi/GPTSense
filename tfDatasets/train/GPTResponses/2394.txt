Areas with high latitudes, such as the polar regions, experience significant changes in the length of day through the seasons. During the summer months, these areas may have daylight for 24 hours or close to it (known as the midnight sun), while during the winter months, these areas may experience long periods of darkness, with little to no daylight at all (known as polar night). This is due to the tilt of the Earth's axis and its rotation around the Sun, which causes the amount and angle of sunlight to vary in different parts of the world throughout the year. In contrast, areas with lower latitudes generally experience more consistent day lengths year-round.
