The packages that Darwin received from Wallace contained Wallace's own scientific papers and an essay titled "On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely from the Original Type," which outlined a theory of evolution through natural selection that closely resembled Darwin's own ideas. This essay prompted Darwin to finally publish his own work on the subject, leading to the co-presentation of their theories to the Linnean Society in 1858.
