Transmitting four bits that represent the packet type twice in a single PID byte using complemented form provides a way to detect errors and ensure data integrity. When the PID byte is sent, it is sent once in its original form and once in its complemented form (i.e., with all the bits flipped). The receiver then checks that the two versions of the PID byte match, which ensures that the transmission was successful and errors did not occur during transmission. If the two versions of the PID byte do not match, an error has occurred and corrective measures can be taken. Additionally, transmitting the packet type twice helps to reduce the likelihood of errors because the receiver has two opportunities to correctly interpret the packet type.
