Enlightenment was believed to be accessible to anyone who followed the Eightfold Path and studied the teachings of the Buddha. This included laypeople as well as monks and nuns. The key was to develop a strong understanding of the Dharma and to practice mindfulness and meditation consistently. In essence, Tendai Buddhism emphasized that anyone who was sincerely committed to the path could achieve enlightenment.
