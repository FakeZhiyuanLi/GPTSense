The change is controlled by the operating system of the laptop. It automatically detects the time zone settings and adjusts the clock accordingly. The operating system uses either the NTP (Network Time Protocol) or the Windows Time service to synchronize the clock with the internet time servers. This way, the clock updates automatically to reflect the changes for DST (Daylight Saving Time) or any other time zone changes without the need for manual intervention from the user.
