Discolorations, damages, alterations, and layers in the underlying paint structure of an artwork are visible in reflectograms. This helps in the analysis and understanding of an artwork's history and authenticity. Defects such as overpainting, retouching, and hidden drawings or writing may also be detected through reflectography.
