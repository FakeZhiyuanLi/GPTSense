The prime distribution among positive integers less than a given number x is approximately characterized by the function x/log(x), known as the logarithmic integral function. This means that the probability of a randomly chosen integer between 1 and x being prime is roughly proportional to 1/log(x). As x gets larger, the fluctuations in the actual distribution become smaller and smaller relative to the overall trend given by the logarithmic integral function. This is known as the prime number theorem.
