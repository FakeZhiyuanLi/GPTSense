Both males and females can develop physical signs of maturity before they are capable of reproduction. However, the specific timing and extent of physical changes can vary widely between individuals and can depend on various factors such as genetics, nutrition, and overall health. Generally, females will begin to experience puberty slightly earlier than males, but both sexes can begin to develop physical signs of maturity around the age of 10-12 years old.
