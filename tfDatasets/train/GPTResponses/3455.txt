Recognition from a language regulating body, such as a language academy or a government agency responsible for language standardization, may help a dialect to become standardized. These bodies often establish official rules and guidelines for grammar, spelling, pronunciation, and vocabulary, which dialects can conform to in order to be recognized as a standard form of the language. The recognition and acceptance of a dialect as a standardized form of the language by these bodies also increase its prestige and credibility in educational, business, and cultural contexts, leading to a wider adoption of the standardized form.
