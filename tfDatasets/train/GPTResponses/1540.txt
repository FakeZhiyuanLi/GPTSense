Scientific ringing was pioneered by John Ray, an English naturalist, in the 17th century. However, the modern practice of scientific ringing, also known as bird banding, was further developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by individuals such as Hans Christian Cornelius Mortensen, Constantine Walter Benson, and Arthur Augustus Allen.
