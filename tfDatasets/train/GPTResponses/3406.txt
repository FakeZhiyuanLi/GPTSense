Saxophones were first introduced into orchestral scores in the mid-19th century, with Hector Berlioz being one of the earliest composers to use the saxophone in his Symphonie Fantastique in 1830. However, it was not until the late 19th and early 20th centuries that the saxophone became a regular instrument in orchestral works, particularly in the works of composers such as Maurice Ravel, Igor Stravinsky, and George Gershwin.
