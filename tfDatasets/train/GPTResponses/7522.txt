Plant cells generally have larger vacuoles than animal cells. In some plant cells, the vacuole can occupy up to 90% of the cell's volume. In contrast, animal cells typically have smaller vacuoles that play a more limited function in the cell compared to the multiple functions of plant cell vacuoles, such as storage of nutrients, waste removal, and maintaining turgor pressure.
