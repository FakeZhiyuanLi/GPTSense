Fatty acids are a type of lipid that the human body cannot produce on its own, making them an essential component in the diet. This is because they play a critical role in various physiological processes such as energy production, providing insulation for vital organs, and cell signaling. Fatty acids are also important in the synthesis of hormones and the maintenance of healthy skin and hair. Without a sufficient intake of fatty acids, various health issues can arise, including deficiencies in growth and development, inflammation, and cognitive impairment.
