Ignaz Semmelweis reduced puerperal fever by implementing hand hygiene practices in maternity wards. He observed that doctors who performed autopsies and then immediately examined pregnant women had a higher incidence of puerperal fever than midwives who did not perform autopsies.Semmelweis hypothesized that doctors were bringing a cadaverous particles or "cadaveric matter" from the autopsies they performed to the women they were examining. He therefore implemented a policy of hand washing with a chlorinated solution between patient contacts, and especially after handling the cadavers.After the implementation of hand hygiene practices, the incidence of puerperal fever dropped drastically. This discovery was a turning point in the history of medicine, as it demonstrated the importance of hand hygiene and infection control in preventing the spread of diseases.
