The Greek Orthodox Church traces its origins back to the apostles, particularly the apostle Andrew who is said to have preached in what is now Greece in the 1st century AD. However, the formal organization and establishment of the Greek Orthodox Church as a distinct entity from the wider Eastern Orthodox Church occurred in the 19th century, following the Greek War of Independence in 1821.
