Yes, the Burmese people have shown reservations about the ruling government bodies over the years. The military has been in power in Burma for most of the last six decades, and their rule has been characterized by authoritarianism, human rights abuses, and suppression of free speech and democratic reforms.There have been numerous protests and demonstrations against the government in Burma, most notably the 8888 Uprising in 1988 and the 2007 Saffron Revolution. These protests were met with brutal crackdowns by the military, resulting in many deaths and the arrest and imprisonment of thousands of activists and opposition leaders.Despite this, the Burmese people have shown resilience and continued to demand democratic reforms and an end to military rule. The 2015 election of Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy and her subsequent imprisonment by the military in 2021 are further evidence of the ongoing struggle for democracy in Burma.
