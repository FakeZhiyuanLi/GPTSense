There is no specific type of Theravada that rejects the intermediate state idea, as it is not a universally accepted concept within Theravada Buddhism. Some Theravada Buddhist interpretations acknowledge an intermediate state (antarabhava) between death and rebirth, while others do not. It is ultimately up to individual interpretation and belief within the Theravada tradition.
