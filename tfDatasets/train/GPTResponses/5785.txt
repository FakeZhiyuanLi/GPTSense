The accession of Valens benefited the Eastern Roman Empire, as Valens was appointed as the emperor of the Eastern half of the Roman Empire in 364 AD. This marked the beginning of the reign of the Valentinian Dynasty, which ruled in the Eastern Roman Empire for nearly a century. Valens was seen as a capable ruler who strengthened the empire's borders against external threats, and promoted Christianity in the Eastern Roman Empire.
