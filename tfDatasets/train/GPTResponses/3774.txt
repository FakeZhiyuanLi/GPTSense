Adding two characters at the end of a line can be problematic because it can cause line breaks or wrapping issues when the document is opened on different devices or programs. This can result in awkward formatting and readability issues. Additionally, some formatting styles and programs may require a specific number of characters per line, so adding extra characters can disrupt the formatting and potentially cause errors.
