The resistance of the filament is determined by its material, length, cross-sectional area, and temperature. The resistance of a material depends on its resistivity, which is a property of the material. The length and cross-sectional area of the filament also affect its resistance, as longer and thinner filaments have greater resistance than shorter and thicker ones. Finally, the temperature of the filament affects its resistance because the resistivity of most materials increases with temperature. As the temperature of the filament increases, the resistance also increases, which can lead to the filament burning out if it gets too hot.
