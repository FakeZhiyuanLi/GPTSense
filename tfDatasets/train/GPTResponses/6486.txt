North American Masonic lodges began recognizing members of the Prince Hall Lodge in the mid-20th century. The first recognition came in 1947 when the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts recognized the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Massachusetts. Slowly, other Grand Lodges began to follow suit and recognize Prince Hall Masonry. However, there are still a few Grand Lodges that do not recognize Prince Hall Masonry.
