The appearance of the Mycenaean culture appears in Linear B. Linear B is a writing system used by the Mycenaean Greeks during the Bronze Age. The script was discovered on clay tablets in the ruins of the Mycenaean palaces, providing valuable insights into the culture, language, and society of the Mycenaeans. The tablets were written in a syllabic script, with each symbol representing a syllable, and were used for record-keeping, administrative purposes, and religious ceremonies. The decipherment of Linear B in the 1950s was a significant breakthrough in the study of ancient Mediterranean civilizations.
