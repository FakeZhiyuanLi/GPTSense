The definition of a microbrewery varies by country and region. In the United States, a microbrewery is typically defined as a brewery that produces less than 15,000 barrels (465,000 gallons) of beer per year. In Canada, the definition is less than 400,000 hectoliters (10.6 million gallons) per year. In Europe, the definition is often based on the size of the brewery and number of employees rather than the amount of beer produced.
