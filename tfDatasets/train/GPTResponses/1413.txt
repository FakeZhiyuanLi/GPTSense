The Aboriginal Protection Boards were government bodies in Australia that were established in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They were responsible for controlling and regulating the lives of Aboriginal people, including:1. Reserves: They established reserves or missions to control and restrict the movement of Aboriginal people.2. Education: They controlled the education of Aboriginal children and forced them to attend government-run schools that aimed to assimilate them into white society.3. Employment: They controlled the employment prospects of Aboriginal people by issuing permits that dictated where and how they could work.4. Healthcare: They controlled access to healthcare for Aboriginal people.5. Family: They had the power to remove Aboriginal children from their families and place them in institutions, known as the Stolen Generations.Overall, the Aboriginal Protection Boards were a tool of assimilation and control over the lives of Aboriginal people.
