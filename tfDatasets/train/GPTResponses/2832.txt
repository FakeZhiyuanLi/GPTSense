There are several factors that might help migrating birds navigate:1. Magnetic fields: Birds may use Earth's magnetic fields to navigate. The Earth's magnetic field creates a map that birds may use to orient themselves as they migrate.2. Celestial navigation: Birds may use the position of the sun, stars, and moon to navigate. This method is used only during clear weather conditions.3. Visual landmarks: Birds may use visual landmarks such as mountain ranges, rivers, and coastlines to navigate.4. Smell: Certain birds may use their sense of smell to navigate, particularly seabirds.5. Memory: Some birds may rely on their memory to navigate back to their breeding and feeding grounds.6. Avian GPS: Recent research has shown that birds may also have an internal "GPS" that uses the sun and magnetic fields to navigate.
