The Danakil Depression in Eritrea is believed to have played a major part in human evolution. It is one of the hottest and most inhospitable places on Earth and contains some of the earliest known human fossils. The fossils from the site have provided important information about the evolution of early humans, including the hominid species Australopithecus afarensis, which is believed to be a direct ancestor of modern humans.
