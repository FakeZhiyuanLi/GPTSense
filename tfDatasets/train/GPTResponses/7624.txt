Capacitors used in high energy capacitor banks can experience various failures due to the high voltage, current, and temperature they are subject to. Some of the common failures are:1. Dielectric breakdown: This occurs when the insulating material between the plates of the capacitor breaks down and allows current to flow through the capacitor. This can cause a short circuit and can damage other components in the system.2. Overheating: Due to the high current and voltage, capacitors can generate a significant amount of heat. If the heat is not dissipated adequately, the capacitor may fail due to excessive temperature.3. Voltage breakdown: When the voltage across the capacitor exceeds its rated value, the dielectric material can break down, causing a short circuit and failure.4. Capacitive discharge: Capacitors in high energy capacitor banks can store a large amount of charge, which can discharge suddenly, causing a surge of current that can damage other components in the system.To prevent these failures, capacitors used in high energy capacitor banks are designed with special materials, construction, and safety features. They are also tested rigorously before being used in any high energy application.
