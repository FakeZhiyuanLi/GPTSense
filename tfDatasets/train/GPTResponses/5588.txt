Ataraxia is a Greek term referring to a state of tranquility or peacefulness. It is often interpreted as a sense of inner calm and freedom from emotional turmoil or anxiety. In philosophical contexts, ataraxia can be seen as a desirable state of mind or a goal of certain philosophical schools, such as Epicureanism or Stoicism.
