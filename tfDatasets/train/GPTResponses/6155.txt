Seattle was the main port of supply for Alaska during the Klondike Gold Rush in the late 1800s and early 1900s. The city's location on the west coast of the United States made it a convenient starting point for those heading north to Alaska in search of gold. Seattle became a hub for mining equipment, food, and other supplies needed by prospectors and settlers in Alaska.
