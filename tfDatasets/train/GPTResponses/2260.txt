Some researchers believe that Somalis originated in the Horn of Africa, specifically in the area that is now Somalia, based on the presence of the M78 subclade. This subclade is common among Somali males and is believed to have arisen in the region about 4,000-5,000 years ago. Other genetic studies have also supported the theory that Somalis have a high degree of genetic homogeneity and share a common ancestry that can be traced back to the region.
