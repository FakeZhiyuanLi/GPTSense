?Stain-resistant fabrics are coated with chemicals to reduce the absorption of stains and to make the fabric more resistant to permanent discoloration or damage. This coating prevents the fabric from soaking up spills and stains, making it easier to clean and maintain. Additionally, these chemicals help increase the durability and lifespan of the fabric, making it more resistant to wear and tear.
