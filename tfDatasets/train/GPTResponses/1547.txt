The most common tools that neurophysiologists use include:1. EEG (electroencephalography) - records electrical activity in the brain using electrodes attached to the scalp.2. MEG (magnetoencephalography) - records the magnetic fields generated by the brain using sensors placed on the scalp.3. fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) - measures changes in blood flow to different areas of the brain, indicating neural activity.4. Single-unit recording - records the electrical activity of individual neurons using microelectrodes implanted in the brain.5. Patch clamp recording - measures the electrical activity of individual ion channels on the surface of neurons.6. Optogenetics - uses light to stimulate or inhibit specific neurons or neural circuits.7. In vivo imaging - captures the activity of neurons or neural circuits in real-time using microscopy and fluorescent indicators.8. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) - uses magnetic fields to stimulate specific regions of the brain, modulating neural activity.
