The first live war report is often credited to Edward R. Murrow, a radio journalist who reported on the German bombing of London during World War II. He broadcasted a series of live, on-location reports from the city during the Blitz in 1940, which marked the first time that live war reporting was done. Murrow's reporting helped to galvanize American support for Great Britain and the war effort.
