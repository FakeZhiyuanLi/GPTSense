Hardwood species are generally more uniform in structure compared to softwood species. This is due to the fact that hardwood trees have a slower growth rate and a more complex internal structure, resulting in a tighter and more consistent grain pattern. Softwood species have a faster growth rate and a simpler internal structure, making them more prone to variations in grain pattern and density. However, both hardwood and softwood species can exhibit variations in structure depending on the specific species and growing conditions.
