In order for an obligation to arise in international law, a state must traditionally undertake the following actions:1. Consent: The state must voluntarily give its consent to be bound by the obligation, either by signing and ratifying a treaty or by making a formal declaration.2. Capacity: The state must be capable of entering into international obligations. This means that the state must have a functioning government that can make decisions on behalf of the state and that the government must have the authority to enter into international obligations.3. Legality: The obligation must be consistent with international law and not violate any peremptory norms.4. Specificity: The obligation must be clear and specific enough to be enforceable.5. Performance: The state must then carry out the obligations it has undertaken in good faith. Failure to do so may result in a breach of international law and potential legal consequences.
