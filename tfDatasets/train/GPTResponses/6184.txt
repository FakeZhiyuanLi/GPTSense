There is no record of any major battle between Hindus of India and the Umayyad Empire. The Umayyad Caliphate (661-750 CE) extended its territory to include parts of the Indian subcontinent, but there is no evidence of any significant military engagement between the two forces. Moreover, the Umayyad Caliphate did not expand deep into India, and its presence was limited to the coastal areas of Sindh and Balochistan. However, there were occasional skirmishes between Muslim and Hindu rulers in the region during the Umayyad period.
