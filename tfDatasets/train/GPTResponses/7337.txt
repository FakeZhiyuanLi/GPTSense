The activity that led to Greece having some of the earliest stone age settlements was the movement of early humans out of Africa and across the Mediterranean region, around 60,000-50,000 BCE. These early humans were hunter-gatherers who relied on the resources available in their environment to survive, and they established settlements near sources of water and food. As Greece was a particularly fertile region with abundant natural resources, it became an attractive location for early human settlement. Over time, these settlements developed into more complex societies with agriculture, trade, and cultural exchange, laying the foundations for the many achievements of classical Greek civilization.
