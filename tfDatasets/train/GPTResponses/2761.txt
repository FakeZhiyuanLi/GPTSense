Genes encode multiple proteins through a process called alternative splicing. DNA is transcribed into pre-mRNA, which contains both exons (coding regions) and introns (non-coding regions). During the splicing process, introns are removed and exons are joined together to form mature mRNA. However, different exons can be spliced together in different combinations, resulting in multiple mRNA transcripts (isoforms) that encode different proteins. This allows for a single gene to produce multiple protein products with different functions or properties. Additionally, there are other mechanisms such as transcription initiation, alternative promoters and alternative polyadenylation sites that can also generate different protein isoforms from a single gene.
