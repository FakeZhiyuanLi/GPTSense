1. Cytoplasm: It is the jelly-like substance that fills the cell and contains organelles, enzymes, and other proteins.2. Nucleus: It is a membrane-bound organelle that houses the genetic material of the cell in the form of DNA.3. Mitochondria: They are organelles responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP for the cell.4. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER): It is a network of membranes that is involved in the synthesis, modification, and transport of proteins and lipids.5. Golgi apparatus: It is responsible for modifying, sorting, and packaging proteins and lipids for secretion or for transport to other organelles.6. Cytoskeleton: It is a network of proteins that provides structure and support to the cell.7. Ribosomes: They are responsible for synthesizing proteins.8. Lysosomes: They are membrane-bound organelles that contain hydrolytic enzymes and are responsible for breaking down macromolecules and cellular waste.9. Vacuoles: They are membrane-bound structures that store water, ions, and nutrients.10. Peroxisomes: They are small membrane-bound organelles that are involved in breaking down fatty acids and detoxifying harmful substances in the cell.
