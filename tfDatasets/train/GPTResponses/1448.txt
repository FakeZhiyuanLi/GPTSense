Cellular immunology is the study of immune responses at the cellular level. According to the theory of cellular immunology, immune responses are caused by specialized cells called T cells and B cells. T cells recognize and attack foreign antigens (proteins or other molecules that are foreign to the body), while B cells produce specific antibodies that bind to and neutralize the antigens. These cells work together to eliminate invading pathogens and provide immunity against future infections.
