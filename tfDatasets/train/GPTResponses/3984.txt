Pitch can be a close proxy for several things depending on the context, but it is most commonly used as a proxy for frequency. In music, pitch refers to the highness or lowness of a sound, which is determined by its frequency â€“ the number of sound wave cycles per second. In speech, pitch can convey meaning and emotion, and is often used as an indicator of the speaker's attitude or intention. In finance, pitch can refer to a sales presentation or proposal made by a company to potential investors, which contains information about the company's business model, financial projections, and growth strategies.
