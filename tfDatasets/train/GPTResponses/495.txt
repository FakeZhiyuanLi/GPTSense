Solar cookers are used for cooking food using the energy of the sun. They are commonly used in areas where firewood or other fuels are scarce or expensive. Solar cookers can be used to cook a variety of foods, including rice, vegetables, meat, and bread. They are also used for sterilizing water and drying fruits and vegetables. Solar cookers are often used in disaster-prone areas as they do not produce smoke or flames, which can pose a risk for fires. They are also used in areas where cooking on an open fire is prohibited due to environmental concerns. Solar cookers are a sustainable solution for cooking as they utilize renewable energy and do not emit greenhouse gases.
