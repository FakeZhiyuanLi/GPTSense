Marion Crawford (also known as Crawfie) was the governess of Princess Elizabeth (the future Queen Elizabeth II) and Princess Margaret from 1933 to 1948. She was responsible for their education and upbringing during their childhood years. She was a trusted confidant and friend to the princesses, but was ultimately dismissed from her position due to the publication of her memoirs, which the royal family deemed to be a breach of confidentiality.
