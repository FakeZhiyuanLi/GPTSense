The 3:2 pulldown technique is used in film-to-video transfer to convert the 24 frames per second (fps) film format to the 30 fps video format. By duplicating some film frames and combining them with others, the technique produces two video frames for every five film frames. This results in a total time of 1/12 of a second for two frames.The achievement of this technique is that it allows a smooth playback of film on television screens without any stuttering or lag. It also helps in preserving the original film content and maintaining its quality, as it avoids any loss of information during the conversion process.Overall, the 3:2 pulldown technique is an effective way of converting film to video, and it has been widely used in the film and television industry for many years.
