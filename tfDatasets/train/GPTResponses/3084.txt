light, water, and space. Trees in a forest often grow close together, and must compete for sunlight. The taller trees will have an advantage because they can reach more sunlight, so smaller trees will need to find ways to grow taller, or find gaps in the canopy to reach the sunlight. They also compete for water and nutrients in the soil. The roots of trees can extend far into the ground, but if there are too many trees in a small area, they may not have access to enough water or nutrients to grow properly. Finally, trees also compete for space to grow. If there are too many trees in a small area, they may end up growing very close together and competing for space to spread out their branches and roots.
