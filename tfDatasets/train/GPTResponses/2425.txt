Song forms typically include verses, choruses, bridges, and sometimes an intro and outro. The verses are where the story or message of the song is mostly conveyed, the chorus is the catchy and memorable part that usually repeats throughout the song, the bridge is a musical and lyrical deviation that connects the verses and chorus, and the intro and outro provide a musical introduction and conclusion to the song. Additionally, there may be instrumental breaks or solos within the song form.
