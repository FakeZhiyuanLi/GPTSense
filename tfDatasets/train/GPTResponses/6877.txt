The properties of graphite that improved the filament are:1. Conductivity: Graphite is highly conductive, meaning it can carry a large amount of electrical current without overheating. This made it ideal for use in filaments because it allowed the bulb to light up brightly without burning out.2. High melting point: Graphite has a very high melting point, which allowed it to withstand the high temperatures inside a light bulb without melting or breaking.3. Hardness: Graphite is an extremely hard material, which made it durable and resistant to breakage.4. Low coefficient of thermal expansion: Graphite has a very low coefficient of thermal expansion, which means it does not expand or contract much when exposed to heat or cold. This made it ideal for use in filaments because it helped to maintain the shape and stability of the filament even when subjected to high temperatures.
