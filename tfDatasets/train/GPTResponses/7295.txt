No, apomixis can also occur in offspring. Apomixis is a type of asexual reproduction where a plant can produce seeds without fertilization. The resulting offspring will be genetically identical to the parent plant. This can happen if the ovules or embryos develop from cells in the plant's ovary without undergoing meiosis or fertilization. Therefore, the offspring produced through apomixis will also exhibit the same characteristics and genetic makeup as the parent plant.
