were the specific targets for developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions?The Kyoto Protocol, adopted in 1997, required developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by an average of 5.2% below their 1990 levels during the period from 2008 to 2012. Individual targets varied depending on the country's level of development and their historical greenhouse gas emissions. The protocol also established a system of carbon credits, allowing countries to trade emissions reductions with each other to meet their targets.
