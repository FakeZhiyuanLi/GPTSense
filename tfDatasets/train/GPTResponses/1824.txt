Birds have evolved several mechanisms to conserve energy, such as:1. Reducing activity: Birds conserve energy by being inactive when the external conditions are unfavorable or non-conducive to their daily activities. They often roost or perch during the hottest hours of the day, or when it is dark and cold.2. Tucking in their wings: Birds often tuck their wings in closely to their bodies when they are not flying. This minimizes the surface area exposed to the air, reducing heat loss and saving energy.3. Selecting optimal flight conditions: Birds maximize their use of wind currents to minimize the amount of energy they need to expend during flight. For example, they fly high in the sky where there are fewer obstacles, or they fly in flocks to save energy.4. Selecting optimal diets: Birds choose nutrient-rich foods that require less energy to digest, such as fruits, seeds or insects. They also tend to select the most nutritious foods present in their environment.5. Adjusting metabolism: Birds adjust their metabolic rate depending on the food and environmental conditions they encounter. They may enter a mode of 'torpor', where their metabolism slows down, reducing their energy expenditure without affecting their overall health.
