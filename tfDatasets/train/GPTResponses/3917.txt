One thinker who believed that emotions were necessary for virtue was Aristotle. He believed that emotions such as anger, fear, and desire were natural and necessary for human beings to lead a virtuous life. Aristotle argued that emotions could help guide our actions towards moral behavior and that a virtuous person was one who had learned to control their emotions in order to act in accordance with moral principles.
