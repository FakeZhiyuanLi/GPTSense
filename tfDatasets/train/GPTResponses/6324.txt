Freemasons are typically invited to join a lodge by a current member or members of the lodge. This invitation may be extended through personal connections or through attending public events held by the lodge. In some cases, individuals may also express interest in joining a lodge and seek out information on how to do so. Once the invitation is extended, the potential member is typically required to meet certain qualifications and undergo an application and screening process before being accepted into the lodge.
