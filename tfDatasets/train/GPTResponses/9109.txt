In Europe, federalism refers to a political system where power is divided between a central government (at the EU level) and individual member states. It involves a sharing of powers and responsibilities between these two levels of government, with each having its own set of authorities and duties. This is seen in the EU, where there are certain areas of policymaking that are reserved for the member states and others that are dealt with by the central European institutions. Overall, the aim of European federalism is to promote greater cooperation and integration among member states while still maintaining respect for national sovereignty and autonomy.
