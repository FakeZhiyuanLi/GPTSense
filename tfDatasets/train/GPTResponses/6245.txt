The earliest Sanskrit inscriptions are found in the Brahmi script, which was used in ancient India from the 3rd century BCE to the 3rd century CE. Some of the earliest inscriptions in this script are found on the Edicts of Ashoka, a series of proclamations issued by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century BCE. These edicts were written in Prakrit language, but included some Sanskrit words and phrases. The Brahmi script was also used for writing Sanskrit inscriptions on coins, pillars, and rock-cut caves during this period.
