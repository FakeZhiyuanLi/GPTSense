There are several reasons why aircraft carriers have increased in size since World War II:1. More advanced aircraft: As aircraft technology has advanced, they have become larger and heavier, requiring larger carrier decks and hangar facilities to accommodate them.2. Increased demand for carry capacity: During World War II, carriers primarily carried fighter and reconnaissance planes. Today's carriers are tasked with carrying a larger variety of aircraft, including heavy attack planes, helicopters, and electronic warfare planes, which require larger decks and more storage space.3. Need for better defenses: Modern aircraft carriers are equipped with advanced electronic warfare systems, radar, and missile defense systems. These larger carriers can accommodate these advanced systems and still have enough space to carry a range of aircraft.4. Ability to project power: Bigger carriers are seen as a symbol of strength and power, and can carry more aircraft and weapons, giving the country that owns them a more potent military capability.5. Enhanced survivability: Larger carriers are more survivable in modern warfare, as they can take more direct hits and still carry out their missions.
