There is no general type of aircraft that has no need to decelerate. All aircraft need to decelerate at some point during their flight, whether it be during landing or a gradual decrease in speed during descent. However, some military aircraft, such as fighter jets, may have the capability to land at higher speeds than commercial planes, and may have a higher tolerance for quick deceleration due to their advanced braking systems and maneuverability.
