One thing that can be used to pull pests is a pheromone trap. Pheromones are chemicals secreted by pests that attract others of their kind, and pheromone traps use synthetic versions of these chemicals to lure pests into a sticky or trap-like device. This can be helpful in monitoring or controlling pest populations in a targeted way, without the use of harmful chemicals or broad-spectrum pesticides.
