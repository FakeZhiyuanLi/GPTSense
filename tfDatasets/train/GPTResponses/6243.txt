Islamic anti-masonics link freemasonry to a number of negative or undesirable traits, such as atheism, paganism, materialism, and Jewish conspiracies. They may allege that freemasonry seeks to undermine or destroy traditional Islamic values, and that its secretive rituals and symbols suggest it is a form of occultism or satanism. They also criticize freemasonry's emphasis on individualism and its purported association with globalist agendas and Western imperialism. Additionally, some Islamic anti-masonic groups view freemasonry as a tool of Western powers seeking to infiltrate and subvert Islamic societies.
