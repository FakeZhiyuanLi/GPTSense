Light bulb manufacturers did establish a cartel to limit bulb life in the 1920s. The Phoebus cartel was formed in 1924 and included major light bulb manufacturers such as Philips, Osram, and General Electric. The cartel aimed to coordinate production and fix prices, but one of their main objectives was to reduce the lifespan of light bulbs in order to increase sales and profits. They agreed to limit the lifespan of bulbs to 1,000 hours, which was significantly shorter than the lifespan of bulbs at the time. The cartel was eventually dissolved in the 1930s due to antitrust regulations and increasing competition.
