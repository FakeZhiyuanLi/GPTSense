Cognitive autonomy refers to an individual's ability to think and make decisions independently, based on their own reasoning and judgment. It involves having the freedom to explore and express one's thoughts, beliefs, and opinions without undue influence or coercion. This includes the ability to critically evaluate information, assess its relevance and reliability, and arrive at informed conclusions that are consistent with one's personal values and goals. Cognitive autonomy is an essential component of personal and intellectual growth, and it is often associated with creativity, innovation, and leadership.
