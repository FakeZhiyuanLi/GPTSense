Stare decisis is a limited form of lawmaking because it is based on the principle of following precedents established by previous cases rather than creating new laws. While stare decisis can shape and constrain future legal decisions, it cannot create new laws or alter existing ones. In addition, stare decisis is limited by the fact that it only has authority within the jurisdiction where the precedent was established and can be overruled by a higher court or by legislative action.
