Thomas Henry Huxley, also known as "Darwin's Bulldog," was a prominent advocate for Darwin's theory of evolution and attempted to secularize science during the debate over Darwin's book "On the Origin of Species." Huxley believed that science should operate independently from any religious influence and that evolution should be taught in schools as a scientific fact rather than a religious belief.
