Newline normalization in macOS is accomplished through the use of the operating system's built-in text processing libraries, which automatically convert different newline characters to the standard macOS newline character (LF) when reading or writing text files. This allows text files created and accessed on macOS to have consistent and predictable line endings, regardless of their origin or previous handling. Additionally, many macOS text editing and word processing applications also include features that allow users to explicitly control or convert newline characters, further ensuring that their text files are compatible with other systems and applications.
