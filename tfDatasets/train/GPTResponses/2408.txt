The method used by composers to prescribe to the performer the pitches, tempo, meter, and rhythms for a piece of music is called musical notation. This is a system of writing music down on paper that uses standardized symbols and markings to indicate how the music is to be performed. Musical notation includes information about the pitch (the specific note that is to be played), rhythm (the timing and duration of notes), tempo (the speed at which the music is to be played), and meter (the organization of beats and rhythms into regular patterns). By reading the musical notation, performers can accurately play the piece of music as the composer intended.
