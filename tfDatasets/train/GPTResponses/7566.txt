When an inductive circuit is opened, the current stops flowing abruptly. This causes a rapid change in the magnetic field surrounding the inductor, which induces a very high voltage across the inductor. This high voltage can potentially damage the inductor or any other components in the circuit, and can result in a spark across the switch or break in the circuit.This phenomenon is known as Inductive kick or Back-EMF (electromotive force) and can be seen in many applications where inductors are used, such as in motors, transformers, and solenoids. To prevent damage from the back-EMF, a diode can be placed in parallel with the inductor to provide a path for the reverse current flow. This is known as a freewheeling diode or snubber diode, and it protects the circuit from voltage spikes that could potentially damage the circuit's components.
