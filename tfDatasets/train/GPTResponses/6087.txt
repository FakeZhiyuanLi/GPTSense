It is difficult to say which specific major religions hold the same beliefs on Freemasonry as the Orthodox Church of Greece. However, some conservative and traditionalist branches of Christianity and Islam also hold negative views of Freemasonry. For example, the Russian Orthodox Church and some conservative Protestant groups view Freemasonry as incompatible with Christian faith and see it as promoting secularism and moral relativism. Similarly, some conservative Muslim groups view Freemasonry as promoting unbelief and undermining Islamic values.
