A protocol is a treaty that supplements a previous treaty in international law. A protocol serves as an additional agreement to an existing treaty and may add new provisions, clarify existing ones, or modify certain aspects of the original treaty. Protocols are often used to update or modernize treaties, and they require the same formalities as the original treaty, such as ratification or accession by states.
