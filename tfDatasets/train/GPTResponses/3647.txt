The southern part of Lancashire underwent significant industrialization during the 19th and 20th centuries, becoming a center of textile production, particularly for cotton. The region saw the development of many large factories and mills, and also became a hub for rail and canal transportation. However, in the latter half of the 20th century, many of the traditional industries declined and the area went through a period of economic restructuring. Today, the southern part of Lancashire is known for its diverse economy and bustling cities, including Manchester and Liverpool.
