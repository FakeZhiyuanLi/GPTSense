The Bärengraben, also known as the Bear Pit, is a famous tourist attraction located in Bern, Switzerland. During its early years, it was mainly known for the live animals, particularly brown bears that were kept in the pit. However, animal welfare activism led to the bears being relocated to a more suitable location. Today, the Bärengraben is home to three large enclosures containing natural habitats, waterfalls, and vegetation, where visitors can observe the bears' daily activities. Other animals kept in the pit, in the past, included wolves, foxes, and a variety of birds. But now, only brown bears are kept in the Bärengraben.
