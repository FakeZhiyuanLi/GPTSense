Traditional Malay language has borrowed words from various languages such as Arabic, Sanskrit, Portuguese, Dutch, and English. The majority of these loanwords come from Arabic, which was introduced during the spread of Islam in the region. Many of the Arabic loanwords are related to religious terms, such as "Islam" and "quran", but also everyday words like "salam" (peace) and "maaf" (apology). Sanskrit loanwords are also common in Malay, particularly in terms of culture and religion, such as "puasa" (fasting) and "wayang" (shadow puppetry). Portuguese and Dutch loanwords were introduced during the colonial period, and English loanwords continue to enter the language through globalization and modern technology.
