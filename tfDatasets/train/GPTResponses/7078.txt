A pesticide is a general term for any substance that is designed to kill or control pests, including insects, weeds, fungi, and other organisms that are harmful to plants or animals. A plant protection product, on the other hand, is a more specific term that refers to substances or products that are used to protect crops from pests and diseases, while also promoting plant growth and health. Plant protection products can include pesticides, as well as other substances such as fertilizers, plant growth regulators, and soil amendments. The main difference between the two is that a pesticide is only designed to kill or control pests, while a plant protection product can also enhance the growth and health of plants.
