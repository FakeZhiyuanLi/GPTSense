The Government of Ireland Act of 1920 gave the monarch limited authority in Ireland. The act created two separate self-governing territories in Ireland: Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland. The monarch was to be represented in each territory by a Governor-General who had limited powers such as being able to appoint certain officials and sign bills into law. However, the actual governance of each territory was to be carried out by separate parliaments and cabinets. This act was an attempt by the British government to address the ongoing tensions and conflicts between Irish nationalists and unionists over the issue of Home Rule.
