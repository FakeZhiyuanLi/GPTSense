The American Psychological Association defines sexual orientation as an enduring pattern of emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attractions to men, women, both genders, or neither gender. It is a fundamental aspect of a person's identity and can be experienced as fluid or stable over time. The APA emphasizes that sexual orientation is not a choice, and that attempts to change a person's sexual orientation through therapy or other means can be harmful and are not supported by empirical evidence.
