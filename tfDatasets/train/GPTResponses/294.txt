The Four Sights in Buddhism are:1. An old man: Siddhartha Gautama saw an old man who was weak and feeble. He realized that old age is inevitable for all and that everyone will grow old someday.2. A sick person: He saw a man who was very sick and in agony. He realized that all human beings are subject to illness and suffering.3. A dead body: He saw a dead body being taken for cremation. This made him realize that death comes to everyone, irrespective of their social status or wealth.4. A mendicant monk: This sighting of an ascetic monk made him realize that pursuing a spiritual path can lead to peace and happiness, instead of worldly pleasures.These Four Sights prompted Siddhartha Gautama to leave his royal life behind and seek the path to enlightenment, becoming the Buddha.
