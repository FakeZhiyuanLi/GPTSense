Humans are responsible for both intentionally and unintentionally moving species around. Intentional movement occurs when humans intentionally transport or introduce species to new environments for various purposes, such as food, agriculture, pets, or ornamental plants. Unintentional movement happens when species are accidentally transported by humans through global shipping, tourism, and transportation activities. Examples include the introduction of rabbits in Australia, zebra mussels in North America, and brown tree snakes in Guam.
