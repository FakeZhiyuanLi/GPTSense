RNA-coding genes must still go through transcription and translation to produce functional proteins.In transcription, DNA serves as a template for RNA synthesis. RNA polymerase reads the DNA sequence, creates a complementary RNA strand, and adds nucleotides to form a pre-mRNA molecule. This pre-mRNA molecule undergoes further processing, including splicing and polyadenylation, to form mature mRNA.In translation, mature mRNA is read by ribosomes, which use the genetic code to assemble amino acids into protein chains. tRNA molecules act as the adaptor molecules that carry specific amino acids to the ribosome according to the codon sequence on the mRNA. The completed protein is then folded into its final 3D structure and can carry out its specific biological function.
