The consequence in the value chain refers to the impact or effect that any change or decision within the value chain has on the overall process, cost, quality, or customer satisfaction. For example, if a company decides to change its supplier, the consequence in the value chain could be an increased or decreased cost, a change in lead times, and possibly a change in the quality or reliability of the product. Therefore, understanding the consequence in the value chain is important for businesses to make effective decisions and optimize their operations.
