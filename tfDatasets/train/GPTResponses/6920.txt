Plants are classified based on several factors such as their evolutionary history, physical traits, reproductive structures, and genetic makeup. The most commonly used classification system is the one proposed by Carl Linnaeus which groups plants into two main categories: vascular and non-vascular. Vascular plants are further divided into seed-bearing and non-seed-bearing plants. Seed-bearing plants are classified into angiosperms and gymnosperms based on the presence or absence of flowers and fruit. Non-vascular plants, also known as Bryophytes, include mosses, liverworts, and hornworts. Other factors that influence the classification of plants may include their habitat, ecological niche, and life cycle.
