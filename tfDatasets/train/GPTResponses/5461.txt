Montevideo experienced political instability and violence during the period between 1843 and 1851. This was due to a series of civil wars known as the Guerra Grande (Great War) and the conflict between the Blancos and Colorados political parties, which resulted in frequent changes of government and violent clashes in the city. The economy also suffered due to the disruption caused by the war, with trade and commerce significantly impacted. Additionally, Montevideo was under siege for several years, leading to food shortages and suffering among the population.
