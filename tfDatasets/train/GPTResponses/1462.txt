Russian-speaking populations already existed, such as Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, and the Baltic republics. In these countries, Russian-speaking communities were often viewed as a legacy of Soviet control and were subject to discrimination or persecution in the post-Soviet era. Many of these people chose to migrate to Russia as a means of improving their economic and social situation, as well as seeking protection and stability in a new political environment.Additionally, Russia has also attracted migrants from other regions, particularly Central Asia and the Caucasus. These migrants often work in low-skilled jobs and endure challenging living conditions, but they are attracted to Russia's higher wages and better economic opportunities than in their home countries.Overall, Russia continues to be a destination for migration from various regions, although the government has implemented stricter immigration policies in recent years. Despite the challenges faced by migrants, they continue to be drawn to Russia for economic, cultural, and political reasons.
