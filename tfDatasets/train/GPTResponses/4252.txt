The NIBRS (National Incident-Based Reporting System) system typically has more detailed data than the UCR (Uniform Crime Reporting) system. The NIBRS system collects data on each individual crime occurrence, including information such as the location of the crime, the victim and offender demographics, and the specific details of the crime. In contrast, the UCR system only collects summary data on certain types of crimes, such as the number of homicides, robberies, and burglaries, without providing information on each individual occurrence.
