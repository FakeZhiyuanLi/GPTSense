The book that became popular with monks in France and had an effect on how light was used in cathedrals is called "De Radiis Stellarum" (On the Rays of the Stars) by Robert Grosseteste. In this book, Grosseteste discussed the nature of light and the principles of optics, which influenced the way light was used to enhance the beauty and symbolism of Gothic cathedrals.
