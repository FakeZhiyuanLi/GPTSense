Humboldtian science aimed to explore the interconnectedness of nature and to understand the laws that govern the natural world through a combination of empirical observation, scientific experimentation, and holistic analysis. This approach emphasized the importance of interdisciplinary research and sought to break down traditional disciplinary boundaries to produce a more comprehensive understanding of nature. Additionally, Humboldtian science advocated for a greater appreciation of the natural world and the need for conservation and preservation of ecological systems.
