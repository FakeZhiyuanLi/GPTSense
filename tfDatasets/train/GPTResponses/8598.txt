Vegetation that provided a reliable source of food, such as grains, wild fruits, and vegetables, helped populations expand. This allowed people to settle in one place, rather than constantly moving in search of food. Some examples of vegetation that played a role in human population expansion include wheat, rice, corn, potatoes, and yams. In addition, vegetation that provided medicinal properties may have also helped populations expand by improving health and reducing mortality rates.
