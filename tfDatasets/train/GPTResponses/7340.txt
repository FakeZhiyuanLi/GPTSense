There are several factors that may slow pesticide movement, including:1. Soil characteristics: The type, texture, and structure of the soil can affect the speed at which pesticides move through it.2. Organic matter content: Pesticides tend to adsorb to organic matter in soil, which can slow their movement as they are immobilized.3. Water content: The amount of water in the soil can affect how quickly pesticides move through it. Too little water can cause the soil to become dry and compact, while too much water can cause the soil to become saturated and impede movement.4. Temperature: High temperatures can cause the soil to become dry and hard, which can slow pesticide movement.5. Soil pH: Some pesticides are more mobile in soils with a low pH, while others are more mobile in soils with a high pH.6. Soil compaction: Compacted soil can reduce the pore space in the soil, limiting the movement of pesticides.7. The chemistry of the pesticide: The chemical properties of the pesticide can affect how it moves in the soil. Some pesticides are more mobile than others.
