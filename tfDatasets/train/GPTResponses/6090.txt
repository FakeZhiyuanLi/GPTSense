Imam Hasan, the eldest grandson of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), made peace with Muawiyah I, the governor of Syria and a prominent member of the Umayyad dynasty, in the year 661 CE. This treaty is known as the Treaty of Hasan or Sulh-e-Hasan in Arabic. The treaty ensured that Muawiyah would become the caliph of the Muslim empire after Imam Hasan's death. However, the terms of the treaty were violated by Muawiyah's son, Yazid, which led to the events of Karbala and the martyrdom of Imam Hussain, the younger grandson of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh).
