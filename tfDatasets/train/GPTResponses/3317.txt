Am√≠lcar Cabral, a revolutionary and nationalist leader, encouraged peanut production in Guinea-Bissau during the country's struggle for independence from Portugal in the 1960s and 1970s. Cabral saw agriculture, particularly peanut production, as a way to develop the country's economy and provide food security for its people. He organized farmers into cooperatives and provided them with training, tools, and resources to increase their productivity and profits. Today, peanuts remain a significant crop in Guinea-Bissau, although the country faces many economic and political challenges.
