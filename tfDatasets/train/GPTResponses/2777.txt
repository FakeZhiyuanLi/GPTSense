Juan Atkins is considered one of the originators of techno music. He was instrumental in developing the sound of techno in the early 1980s in Detroit, alongside other pioneers such as Derrick May and Kevin Saunderson. Atkins is credited with creating the first techno track, "Alleys of Your Mind," released in 1981 under the name Cybotron. His work with Cybotron and later as Model 500 helped to define the sound of techno and establish it as a genre of electronic dance music.
