The case that determined that some implementation of affirmative action was unconstitutional is Regents of the University of California v. Bakke (1978). In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that the use of strict racial quotas in college admissions was unconstitutional, but affirmative action programs that took race into account as one of several factors were permissible.
