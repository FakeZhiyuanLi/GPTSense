The Romans used a variety of objects as money in the 6th through 3rd centuries BC, including bronze bars, bronze ingots, and bronze objects such as knives, spits, and rings. These objects were known as aes signatum or "signed bronze," and they were stamped with images and symbols to indicate their value. Later in the 3rd century BC, the Romans began to mint coins made of silver, known as denarii, that became the standard currency of the Roman Empire.
