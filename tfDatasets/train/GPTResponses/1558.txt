Broad-winged birds generally avoid geographical barriers because they prefer to migrate along routes that have open skies and favorable wind currents. Geographical barriers such as mountain ranges, large bodies of water, and dense forests can be challenging for these birds to cross and may require more energy and time during the migration. Instead, these birds tend to follow routes that have fewer barriers and provide more opportunities for rest and feeding along the way.
