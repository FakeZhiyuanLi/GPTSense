Ethiopia was able to mitigate the impact of European colonization through various means, such as:1. Maintaining its sovereignty: Ethiopia was one of the few African countries that successfully maintained its sovereignty and avoided colonization through its strong and effective political system. Its leaders were also able to resist foreign influence, particularly from European powers.2. Strategic alliances: Ethiopia formed strategic alliances with other African nations that were facing similar challenges, such as South Africa and Egypt. This helped strengthen its position and influence in the international community.3. Modernization and education: Ethiopia, under the leadership of Emperor Menelik II and subsequent rulers, focused on modernizing the country through education, infrastructure development, and military training. This helped the country become more self-sufficient and better equipped to deal with external threats.4. Diplomatic efforts: Ethiopia also engaged in diplomatic efforts with European powers to negotiate its independence and sovereignty. For example, in 1906, Ethiopia signed the Treaty of Wuchale with Italy, which defined the boundaries of Ethiopian territory and recognized its sovereignty.Overall, Ethiopia's ability to resist European colonization can be attributed to a combination of factors, including its strong and effective political system, strategic alliances with other African nations, focus on modernization and education, and diplomatic efforts to negotiate its sovereignty.
