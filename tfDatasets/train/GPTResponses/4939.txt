A unitised scheme is an investment scheme that divides the total fund into a fixed number of units. The value of each unit is determined by the current value of the underlying assets in the scheme. Investors can buy and sell these units at any time, and the price of these units varies according to the performance of the scheme's underlying assets. The aim of a unitised scheme is to provide a diversified investment option for investors who want to spread their risk across a range of assets. Examples of unitised schemes include unit trusts, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
