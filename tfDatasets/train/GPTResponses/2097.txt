If a party's consent to a treaty has been given by an agent without the power under the state's domestic law to do so, it may be considered as invalid or ineffective. The principle of international law known as the principle of "agency by ratification" may not apply to such a situation. This principle provides that a state may be bound by a treaty even if its agent lacked the authority to sign the treaty, as long as the state subsequently ratifies the treaty. However, if the agent did not have the authority to act on behalf of the state in the first place, then the state's consent cannot be considered as valid. In such cases, the state may argue that the agent acted ultra vires, or outside the scope of his or her authority, and that it did not intend to be bound by the treaty. Ultimately, the validity and effectiveness of the treaty will depend on the specific facts and circumstances of the case, as well as the laws and practices of the state involved.
