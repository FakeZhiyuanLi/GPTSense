Asthma is the result of inflammation and narrowing of the airways in the lungs, which makes it difficult for a person to breathe properly. This inflammation can be triggered by a variety of environmental factors, including allergens, pollutants, and irritants. Asthma can also be the result of genetic factors that make a person more susceptible to the condition. Additionally, underlying medical conditions, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or sinusitis, can contribute to the development of asthma.
