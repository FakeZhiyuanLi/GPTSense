Paul VI did not specifically tell anyone "not to be afraid" when the Church released its statement on birth control. However, he did address the issue in his encyclical letter Humanae Vitae (1968) in which he wrote:"It is to be anticipated that perhaps not everyone will easily accept this particular teaching. There is too much clamorous outcry against the voice of the Church, and this is intensified by modern means of communication...But it comes as no surprise to the Church that she, no less than her divine Founder, is destined to be a 'sign of contradiction.' She does not, because of this, evade the duty imposed on her of proclaiming humbly but firmly the entire moral law, both natural and evangelical."While he acknowledged that not everyone would immediately accept the Church's teaching on birth control, he encouraged Catholics to have faith and trust in the Church's teachings.
