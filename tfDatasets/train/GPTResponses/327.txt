There is not a definitive answer to this question, as "politecnici" can refer to different things in different contexts. However, in Italy, the term "Politecnico" (the singular form) usually refers to a university-level institution that specializes in engineering, architecture, and other technical disciplines. There are currently five Politecnici in Italy:1. Politecnico di Milano2. Politecnico di Torino3. Politecnico di Bari4. Politecnico di Bologna5. Politecnico di MarcheIt is worth noting that the institution now known as Politecnico di Milano was the first Politecnico to be established in Italy, in 1863, and it served as a model for the other universities that adopted the name.
