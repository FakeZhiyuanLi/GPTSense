The process of producing a biologically functional molecule of either RNA or protein is called gene expression. It involves two main steps:1. Transcription: The DNA sequence within a gene is first transcribed into an RNA molecule by RNA polymerase. This process involves the unwinding of the DNA double helix and joining of ribonucleotide triphosphates (rNTPs) to synthesize a complementary RNA strand. This RNA molecule is called a messenger RNA (mRNA).2. Translation: The mRNA molecule is then translated into a protein by ribosomes. This process involves the decoding of the mRNA sequence by transfer RNAs (tRNAs) carrying specific amino acids. The ribosome catalyzes the formation of peptide bonds between the amino acids, resulting in a polypeptide chain. The polypeptide chain folds into a three-dimensional structure to form a functional protein.Overall, gene expression is a highly regulated process that is essential for the proper functioning of cells and organisms. It is influenced by a variety of factors, including environmental cues and cellular signals.
