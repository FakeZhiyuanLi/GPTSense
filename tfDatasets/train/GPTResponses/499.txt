There are several types of equipment that can improve system performance, including:1. Solid State Drives (SSDs): They can significantly improve read and write speeds, resulting in faster boot-up times and application launches.2. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs): Used for graphic-intensive tasks such as gaming, video editing, or 3D modelling. A dedicated GPU can significantly improve system performance when performing these tasks.3. Random Access Memory (RAM): Increasing the amount of RAM can improve system performance by allowing multiple applications to run simultaneously without affecting the overall speed.4. Central Processing Units (CPUs): Upgrading to a faster and more efficient CPU can significantly improve the overall performance of the system.5. Cooling Systems: Adding a cooling system such as a liquid cooler or high-performance air cooler can improve system performance by reducing the temperature of the CPU and GPU, allowing them to operate at higher clock speeds.6. Network Adapters: Upgrading to a high-speed network adapter can improve internet speeds and reduce latency, resulting in a smoother browsing experience.
