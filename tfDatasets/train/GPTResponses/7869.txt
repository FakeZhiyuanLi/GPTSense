Monounsaturated fat is generally considered to be the healthiest kind of fat. It is found in foods such as olive oil, avocados, nuts, and seeds. Studies have shown that a diet high in monounsaturated fats can improve cholesterol levels, reduce inflammation, and lower the risk of heart disease and stroke.
