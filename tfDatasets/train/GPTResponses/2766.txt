he or she wants. The formal treaty process involves negotiating and signing a treaty with a foreign government, which then requires ratification by the US Senate. This process gives the president the opportunity to negotiate with foreign leaders and gain their support for a particular policy or agreement, while also requiring the backing of the US legislative branch.The president might prefer this process for matters that require congressional approval because it ensures that the policy or agreement has the necessary legal and political support to be implemented. Additionally, the treaty process provides a formal framework for negotiations and ensures that the agreement is binding and enforceable.However, the treaty process can be time-consuming and politically challenging. It requires the support of a two-thirds majority of the Senate, which can be difficult to obtain. Additionally, the treaty process can be subject to political maneuvering and opposition from interest groups and other countries.In some cases, the president might choose to use other means of achieving their policy goals, such as executive orders or informal agreements. These methods do not require congressional approval but are often less binding and more susceptible to legal challenges.Overall, the president's preference for the formal treaty process on matters that require congressional approval will depend on a variety of factors, including the nature of the issue, the political climate, and the president's personal negotiating skills.
