Alsace lost its prosperity during the devastating Thirty Years' War (1618-1648), which brought widespread destruction and economic disruption to the region. The war ruined many of Alsace's towns and villages, destroyed its agriculture and industries, and led to a decline in population. Despite several attempts to revive the region's economy in subsequent centuries, Alsace remained comparatively poor until the mid-20th century. It was only after World War II that Alsace regained its prosperity, owing in large part to its strategic location as a crossroads of Europe combined with its highly skilled and entrepreneurial workforce.
