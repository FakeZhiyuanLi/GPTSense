It is difficult to determine a specific time when rituals became similar between different Masonic lodges because ritualistic practices have evolved over centuries and vary between different Masonic traditions and jurisdictions. However, the standardization of rituals began to take shape in the 18th and 19th centuries, when Grand Lodges were established and began to provide guidelines and rules for Masonic lodges under their jurisdiction. This led to the development of rituals that were specific to each Grand Lodge and eventually led to the creation of international bodies such as the United Grand Lodge of England and the Grand Lodge of Scotland, which standardized rituals and practices across different regions. Today, while there are still variations in rituals between different Masonic lodges, they generally adhere to a standardized set of practices and symbols.
