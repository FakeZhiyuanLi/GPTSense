The captain of the ship spends most of his time on the bridge, which is the command center of the ship. According to maritime protocols, the captain and the officers on duty must be on the bridge at all times while the ship is underway. Other places where the captain may spend time includes his cabin, the dining room, the communication room, and during inspections or tours of the ship.
