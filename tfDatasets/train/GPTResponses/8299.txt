During the scientific revolution, geology underwent a significant transformation, as scientists and thinkers began to apply new scientific practices and methodologies to the study of the earth. Prior to this period, the study of geology was largely based on speculation and folklore, with little empirical or factual evidence to support theories about the earth's composition and geological history.One of the major figures in the development of modern geology during this period was James Hutton, a Scottish scientist who is considered the founder of modern geology. Hutton developed the theory of uniformitarianism, which suggested that geological processes had been acting upon the earth for millions of years, and that the forces at work were still the same today as they had been in the past.This new approach to geology led to the identification of new geological formations, the development of new techniques for studying the earth's interior, and a greater understanding of the processes that shape the earth's surface. These discoveries helped to lay the groundwork for the development of modern geology as a scientific field, and contributed to the broader understanding of the natural world that emerged during the scientific revolution.
