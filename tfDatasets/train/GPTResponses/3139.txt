In domestic law, the equivalent of a treaty in international law is a binding agreement or contract between two or more parties. Such agreements can be between states, between states and private entities, or between private entities themselves. Like treaties, domestic agreements are legally binding and can involve various types of obligations, such as contractual obligations, regulatory requirements, or mutual commitments to take certain actions. The terms of such agreements are typically outlined in a written document and are subject to interpretation and enforcement by domestic courts or arbitration tribunals.
