In the early part of the 20th century, Atlantic City experienced a period of growth and prosperity as a popular seaside resort destination. It became a center for entertainment, with numerous theaters, amusement parks, and casinos. The city also thrived as a manufacturing and transportation hub, with access to rail and water transportation.However, in the mid-20th century, Atlantic City began to decline due to changing economic conditions and competition from other vacation destinations. The rise of automobile travel allowed for more flexibility in vacation destinations, and the availability of air travel made it easier for people to travel to other parts of the world. In addition, the city's once-thriving manufacturing industry began to decline, leading to high unemployment rates and poverty.During the 1960s and 70s, the city attempted to revitalize itself with the opening of new casinos and the redevelopment of the boardwalk area. However, by the 1980s, many of the casinos and businesses had closed, leaving large portions of the city abandoned and deteriorating.Today, Atlantic City continues to struggle with economic challenges and has not fully recovered from its decline in the 20th century. However, efforts are being made to revitalize the city, with new developments in the works and improvements to the tourism industry.
