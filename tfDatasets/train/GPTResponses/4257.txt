Placozoans are simplest multicellular animals, also known as "flat animals". They are differentiated from ctenophores and cnidarians in the following ways:1. Body organization: Placozoans have a simple flattened symmetrical body, while ctenophores and cnidarians possess a more complex radial symmetry.2. Movement: Placozoans move by ciliary action, while ctenophores move using rows of cilia and cnidarians move via tentacle contraction.3. Digestive system: Placozoans have a simple, sac-like digestive system, whereas ctenophores and cnidarians have a gastrovascular cavity with a single opening.4. Nervous system: Placozoans have no nervous system, while ctenophores have a simple nerve net and cnidarians have a more complex nerve net and a rudimentary brain.5. Reproduction: Placozoans reproduce both sexually and asexually, while cnidarians and ctenophores reproduce mostly sexually.
