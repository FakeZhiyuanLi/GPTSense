Darwin's ideas about evolution were initially met with a lot of controversy and opposition. Many people, particularly those with religious beliefs, found his theory of natural selection difficult to accept, as it challenged traditional beliefs about the origins of life and the role of a divine being in creating humans.Despite this initial resistance, however, Darwin's ideas gradually gained acceptance and have since become widely recognized as the foundation of modern evolutionary theory. Today, the concept of evolution is central to many areas of science, including genetics, ecology, and paleontology, and it continues to be a subject of ongoing research and study.
