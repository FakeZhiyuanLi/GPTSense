One idea from Karl Marx that was used to combat the problems with structural integration is the concept of class consciousness. Marx argued that workers should develop a sense of belonging and solidarity with others in their class, rather than being divided by race or other social factors. This idea led to the formation of labor unions and other organizations that brought together workers of different ethnic and racial backgrounds to fight for common goals, such as better wages, hours, and working conditions. By focusing on shared interests and experiences, these groups were able to overcome some of the barriers to integration that had previously existed.
