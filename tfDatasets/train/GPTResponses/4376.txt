In 1837, Houston used the system of general incorporation to create new businesses in Texas. This system allowed for the creation of a corporation by simply filing articles of incorporation with the government and paying a fee, without requiring a special act of the legislature for each new corporation. This system helped encourage economic growth and development in Texas.
