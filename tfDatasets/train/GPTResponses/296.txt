After Gautama Buddha reached enlightenment, he spent the rest of his life traveling around India and other nearby countries, teaching his philosophy and spreading his knowledge to as many people as possible. He established a community of monks and nuns who followed his teachings and continued to spread his philosophy long after his death. He also emphasized the importance of meditation and mindfulness as a means of transcending suffering and achieving enlightenment. Gautama Buddha died at the age of 80 after years of spreading his teachings and inspiring millions of people around the world.
