Atlantic City held a monopoly on casino gambling in the United States from 1978, when the first casino, Resorts Atlantic City, opened its doors, until 2018 when the Supreme Court ruled that states had the right to legalize sports betting. However, Las Vegas remained the top gambling destination in the country throughout this time period.
