The modification of an organism's genome through biotechnology is known as genetic engineering, genetic modification, or gene editing. This involves the manipulation of an organism's DNA in order to introduce, remove or modify specific genes, creating new variants with desirable traits. Biotechnology techniques like CRISPR-Cas9, recombinant DNA, and transgenesis are widely used for genetic engineering.
