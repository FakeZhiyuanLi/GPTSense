The first carrier-launched airstrike occurred on February 1, 1917, during World War I, when British pilot Lieutenant Commander Edwin Dunning landed a Sopwith Pup biplane on the deck of the HMS Furious and took off again, followed by six more planes. The aircraft attacked German zeppelin sheds in Tondern, Germany, with bombs and machine guns. This was the first time that an aircraft carrier was used as a floating airfield for a military operation.
