The industry source that produced Seattle's first financial vigor was the logging industry. During the late 1800s and early 1900s, Seattle's economy was built around logging, which provided the city with significant wealth and financial stability. The industry was supported by the shipping and transportation infrastructure, which allowed for the export of logs to other parts of the country and the world. In the early 1900s, other industries such as fishing, canning, and aerospace also contributed to Seattle's financial growth.
