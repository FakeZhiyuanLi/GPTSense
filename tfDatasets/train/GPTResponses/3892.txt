Mechanical digestion is the physical breakdown of food into smaller pieces by the teeth, tongue, and muscles in the digestive system, such as the stomach and intestines. This process increases the surface area of the food, making it easier for enzymes to break down the food molecules chemically. Mechanical digestion also mixes food with digestive juices, which helps to further breakdown the food and aid in its absorption in the small intestine.
