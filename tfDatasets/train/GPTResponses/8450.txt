Darwin stated that artificial selection by animal breeders often causes changes in domesticated species that would not be favorable in the wild, such as exaggerated physical characteristics or reduced fitness for survival. These changes are due to the breeder's preference for specific traits, rather than environmental pressures. Moreover, these selected traits may lead to health problems or decreased genetic diversity within a population.
