Copper salts are used to test for the presence of various substances, including:1. Proteins: Copper salts react with proteins to form a purple color.2. Halides: Copper salts react with halides (chloride, bromide or iodide ions) to form colored precipitates or complexes.3. Sugars: Copper salts react with sugars to form a red precipitate.4. Phosphates: Copper salts react with phosphates to form a green-colored precipitate.5. Sulfides: Copper salts react with sulfides to form a black-colored precipitate.6. Carbonates: Copper salts react with carbonates to form a blue-green precipitate.7. Amines: Copper salts react with amines to form a blue-green complex.8. Alkaloids: Copper salts react with alkaloids to form a greenish-blue color.9. Fatty acids: Copper salts react with fatty acids to form a blue-green precipitate.
