Non-Muslim groups under the Umayyads were called "dhimmis." These were people who lived under Muslim rule but were not required to convert to Islam. The most significant groups of dhimmis during the Umayyad period were Christians and Jews. Dhimmis were required to pay a special tax (jizya) and were subject to certain restrictions, such as not being allowed to build new places of worship or display their religious symbols in public. However, they were generally allowed to practice their religion and maintain their own cultural traditions.
