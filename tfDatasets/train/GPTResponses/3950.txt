Telecommuting refers to a work arrangement in which employees work from remote locations, such as their homes or co-working spaces, instead of commuting to a central workplace. The telecommunications technology, such as video conferencing, email, and messaging apps, allows them to communicate with colleagues and managers efficiently. Telecommuting offers flexibility and work-life balance, which can increase job satisfaction and productivity.
