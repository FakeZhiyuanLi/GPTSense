Zhejiang was part of the Wu kingdom during the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted from 220 to 280 AD. Wu was one of the three major states, alongside Wei and Shu, that emerged after the fall of the Han dynasty in 220 AD. The Wu kingdom was founded by Sun Quan and its territory included parts of modern-day Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Fujian provinces in China.
