There have been several floods that have impacted the Meuse river over the years. One of the more significant floods occurred in January 1995, when heavy rain and melting snow caused the Meuse to overflow its banks and flood many areas in Belgium, the Netherlands, and France. The flood caused widespread damage and affected thousands of people. Another significant flood occurred in November 2010, when heavy rainfall caused the Meuse to rise and flood many areas in Belgium and the Netherlands. This flood affected thousands of people and caused widespread damage to homes and infrastructure.
