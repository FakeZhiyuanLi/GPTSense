A reserving party to a treaty may include a statement that attempts to limit or modify its legal obligations or their effects, typically to avoid any potential conflicts or inconsistencies with their domestic laws or policies. Such reservations may also be made to clarify a particular interpretation or understanding of certain provisions in the treaty. However, reservations that are contradictory to the object and purpose of the treaty or are in violation of peremptory norms of international law (i.e. human rights, humanitarian law, etc.) may be deemed invalid or inadmissible.
