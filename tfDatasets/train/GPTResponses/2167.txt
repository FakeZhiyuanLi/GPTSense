The first writer to date the Middle Ages from 476 is usually considered to be the historian Flavio Biondo, who wrote his work "Roma Triumphans" in 1446. This marked a significant shift in historical periodization, as it separated the ancient world from the medieval period, beginning with the fall of the Western Roman Empire.
