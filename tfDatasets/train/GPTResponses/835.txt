Housing boom: There was a housing boom during this time that encouraged people to take out mortgages and borrow against their homes. The rise in housing prices also provided people with more collateral to borrow against.3. Consumer confidence: The economy was stable during this time, and consumer confidence was high, which encouraged people to take on more debt.4. Increased access to credit: Banks and other lenders were offering more credit to consumers during this time, which made it easier for people to borrow.5.
