There are many paintings that can be considered as epitomizing the female nude, but one of the most famous and influential is "The Birth of Venus" by Sandro Botticelli. This painting, completed in the mid-1480s, depicts the goddess Venus rising from the sea, fully nude and surrounded by other mythological figures. The painting is notable for its idealized, classical portrayal of the female form, its use of delicate colors and graceful lines, and its enduring popularity and influence on subsequent artists.
