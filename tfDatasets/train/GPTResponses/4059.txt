The olfactory lobes of mammals are generally larger and more complex than those of reptiles. This is because mammals rely more heavily on their sense of smell for communication, finding food, and detecting predators. Additionally, many mammals have a much larger portion of their brain dedicated to processing olfactory information compared to reptiles. However, this can vary depending on the species and the specific adaptations they have evolved.
