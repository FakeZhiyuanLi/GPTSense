of enlightenment?According to Buddhist tradition, Gautama (also known as Siddhartha Gautama) was almost killed by severe asceticism and self-mortification that he practiced in his pursuit of enlightenment. He believed that extreme self-denial could help him achieve spiritual liberation, and for several years he lived on very little food and water and subjected himself to physical austerities such as standing on one foot for days, sleeping on thorns, and exposing himself to extreme heat and cold. However, these extreme practices nearly killed him, and he ultimately realized that he needed to adopt a middle way between indulgence and asceticism. It was after this realization that he achieved enlightenment and became known as the Buddha.
