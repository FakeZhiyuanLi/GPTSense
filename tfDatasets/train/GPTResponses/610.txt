Approximately 30% of the solar radiation that reaches Earth is reflected back into space by various surfaces and atmospheric components, such as clouds, ice, snow, and aerosols. This reflected radiation is known as albedo. The remaining 70% is absorbed by the Earth's surface and atmosphere, leading to warming and temperature increase, which drive climate patterns and weather conditions.
