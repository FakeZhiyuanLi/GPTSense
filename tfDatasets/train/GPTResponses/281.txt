is known as being "underwater" or "upside-down". This means that the homeowner owes more on their mortgage than the current market value of their property. If the homeowner is unable to make their mortgage payments and defaults on their loan, the lender may foreclose on the property and the homeowner would lose their investment without any equity to show for it. This type of default risk is particularly relevant during times of economic hardship or housing market decline when home prices may drop significantly.
