One of the most popular methods in the 1960s regarding science studies was the "paradigm shift" model proposed by philosopher Thomas Kuhn in his book "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions." This model suggested that scientific discoveries do not occur gradually, but rather through sudden, revolutionary changes in accepted scientific theories and practices. Kuhn argued that scientists work within a particular "paradigm" or set of assumptions and ways of thinking about the world. When anomalies or contradictions arise that cannot be explained by the existing paradigm, scientists may experience a crisis and eventually shift to a new paradigm. This model was influential in shaping the way researchers in fields such as sociology, anthropology, and history of science studied scientific knowledge and practices.
