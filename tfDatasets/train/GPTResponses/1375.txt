The first half of the 20th century in Russia and the Soviet Union was marked by significant political, social, and economic changes.In 1917, Russia underwent two revolutions that led to the overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the world's first communist state. The Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, established a government that aimed to transform Russia into a socialist society through collectivization and industrialization.Under Lenin's leadership, the Soviet Union (formerly Russia) began nationalizing industries and redistributing land to peasants. However, Lenin's death in 1924 led to a power struggle, which was eventually won by Joseph Stalin.Stalin's reign is marked by brutal repression, including the Great Purge in the 1930s, where thousands of perceived opponents were executed, imprisoned, or exiled. Stalin also introduced the Five-Year Plan to rapidly industrialize the country, which led to significant economic growth but also widespread shortages and famine.During World War II, the Soviet Union emerged as a superpower, playing a crucial role in defeating Nazi Germany. However, the war also resulted in widespread devastation, including the loss of nearly 27 million lives.Overall, the first half of the 20th century in Russia and the Soviet Union was characterized by political instability, rapid industrialization, and significant violence and repression under communist rule.
