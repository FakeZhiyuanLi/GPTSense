Inhaler medication, such as a short-acting bronchodilator, is a key component of controlling and preventing asthma attacks. Other important components include avoiding triggers, taking long-term controller medications as prescribed, monitoring symptoms, and having a written asthma action plan in place. Maintaining overall good health, such as staying active and managing stress, can also help prevent asthma attacks.
