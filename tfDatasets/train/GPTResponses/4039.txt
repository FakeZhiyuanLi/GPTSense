Functional neuroimaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have allowed researchers to study the earlier-evolved parts of the brain. These techniques can track changes in blood flow and metabolic activity in the brain, allowing researchers to assess which regions of the brain are active during different cognitive and emotional states, and thus providing insights into the functioning of the more primitive parts of the brain.
