There is no one specific proposal to divide and split up land among families of color. There have been various movements and campaigns advocating for the redistribution of land to address historical injustices such as slavery and colonialism. Some examples include the Black Panther Party's Ten-Point Program in 1966 which called for the redistribution of land, and the South African government's land reform program which seeks to correct the effects of apartheid-era land policies.
