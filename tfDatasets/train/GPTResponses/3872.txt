The digestion of some fats starts in the mouth. Salivary glands in the mouth produce an enzyme called lipase, which begins to break down triglyceride fats into smaller fatty acids and glycerol molecules. However, the majority of fat digestion occurs in the small intestine, where pancreatic lipase and bile from the gallbladder help break down the fats into smaller molecules that can be absorbed into the bloodstream.
