As temperature increases, the amount of radiation an object emits also increases. This is because higher temperatures cause the particles in the object to move faster and collide more frequently, releasing more energy in the form of radiation. This increase in radiation is known as the blackbody radiation, and it tends to follow the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the amount of radiation emitted by an object is proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature. Therefore, hotter objects emit more radiation than cooler objects of the same size and composition.
