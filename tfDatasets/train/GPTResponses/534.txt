In Buddhism, karma refers to the actions or volitional activities of body, speech, and mind, and the consequences that result from those actions. These actions can be positive, negative, or neutral and are believed to shape the trajectory of an individual's life and determine their future rebirths. Good karma leads to positive outcomes, such as happiness and success, while bad karma leads to negative outcomes, such as suffering and misfortune. The ultimate goal of Buddhism is to achieve liberation from the cycle of rebirths by purifying one's karma through ethical conduct, meditation, and wisdom.
