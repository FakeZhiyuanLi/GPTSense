Congress gives generalized powers to federal agencies to allow them to carry out their specific tasks and responsibilities effectively. This helps in ensuring that the agencies have the necessary authority and flexibility to respond to changing circumstances and handle complex issues that require specialized knowledge and expertise. Generalized powers also allow federal agencies to respond quickly to emerging issues and make necessary decisions without the need for constant legislative approval. This ensures that the government can function efficiently and effectively in carrying out its obligations to the public.
