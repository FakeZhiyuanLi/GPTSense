According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Indigenous peoples in Australia and Inuit peoples in Canada have a much higher risk of TB infection than other residents. Factors such as poverty, overcrowding, and limited access to healthcare contribute to the higher rates of TB among these groups. In addition, historical and ongoing injustices and discrimination have created social and economic disparities that further increase their susceptibility to TB. Efforts to address these inequities and improve access to quality healthcare are necessary to reduce the burden of TB among these marginalized populations.
