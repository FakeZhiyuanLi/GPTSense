psychologists call self-concept, which is an individual's overall perception of themselves. Self-image refers to how an individual sees themselves physically and how they believe others see them. Self-esteem refers to an individual's overall opinion of themselves, including their self-worth and confidence. Individuality refers to an individual's unique characteristics, preferences, and beliefs that make them distinct from others. All of these concepts are important in shaping an individual's self-concept and overall mental health.
