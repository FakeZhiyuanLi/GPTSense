Plants use various internal processes for their growth, development, and reproduction. These processes rely on various molecules, minerals, and nutrients that plants obtain from the soil, air, and water. Some of the essential components that plants use for internal processes include:1. Water - Plants need water for transportation of nutrients, photosynthesis, and to support their structure.2. Carbon dioxide - Plants use carbon dioxide during photosynthesis to convert it into glucose and oxygen.3. Minerals - Plants use minerals such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium to support their growth and development.4. Sugars - Plants use sugars produced during photosynthesis for energy and for building structures.5. Hormones - Plants produce and use hormones such as auxin, cytokinin, and gibberellin for controlling their growth and development.Overall, plants use a complex network of internal processes and components to support their survival, growth, and reproduction.
