The written law, also known as the Torah, was transmitted through the Hebrew Bible and other Jewish sacred texts. The oral law, also known as the Talmud, was transmitted through a combination of teaching, memorization, and written records passed down from generation to generation. Specifically, the Mishnah (the first part of the Talmud) was compiled and written down in the early 3rd century CE, while the Gemara (the second part of the Talmud) was written down and compiled in the 5th century CE.
