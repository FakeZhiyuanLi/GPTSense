In the United Kingdom, royal assent is generally granted by the monarch signing a bill that has been passed by both Houses of Parliament. This is usually done in public, with the monarch sitting on the throne in the House of Lords and the Speaker of the House of Commons presenting the bill for royal assent. In other Commonwealth realms, such as Canada and Australia, the governor-general or governor generally grants royal assent on behalf of the monarch.
