Interlingua was derived from the concept of international vocabulary or international scientific vocabulary, which is a system of words and word roots developed to facilitate communication between speakers of different languages in the fields of science, technology, and other specialized areas. This concept was first proposed in the 19th century by linguists and educators who recognized the need for a common language or language system that would allow people of different linguistic backgrounds to communicate more effectively. The goal was to create a simplified and standardized version of language that would be easy to learn and understand, while still retaining enough flexibility and richness to convey complex ideas and knowledge. Interlingua was developed based on this concept by a group of linguists and scientists in the early 20th century, who sought to create a universal language that could be easily learned and used by people from different language backgrounds.
