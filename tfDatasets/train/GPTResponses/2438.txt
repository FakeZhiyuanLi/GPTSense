DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) consists of nucleotides, which are made up of a sugar molecule called deoxyribose, a phosphate group, and one of four nitrogenous bases: adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). The sequence of these bases determines the genetic information that is stored in the DNA molecule.
