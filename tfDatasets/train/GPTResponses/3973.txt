The first phase in preparation for digestion in mammals is the intake of food, also known as ingestion. During ingestion, food is taken into the mouth and broken down into smaller pieces by the teeth and mixed with saliva, which contains enzymes that begin the process of chemical digestion. This phase prepares the food for the next stages of digestion, which involves further breakdown of food molecules to smaller units for absorption and assimilation.
