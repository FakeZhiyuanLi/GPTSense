The feature that enables an MCU to allow for multiple parties to be seen on screen at the same time is called multipoint control unit (MCU) cascading. This technology enables multiple MCUs to be linked together to support a larger number of participants on a video conference call. With MCU cascading, all participants can be seen on the same screen, making it easier to engage in a group discussion.
