The Football Association (FA) was founded by a group of twelve soccer clubs in England in 1863. The founding clubs included the Barnes Club, Blackheath Rugby Club, Civil Service Football Club, Crystal Palace Football Club, Kensington School, Perceval House Football Club, Richmond Football Club, St. John’s Football Club, and the War Office. The FA was established to create a standard set of rules for soccer, which had previously been played with varying rules and regulations depending on the location and organizing body. The FA’s first Secretary was Ebenezer Morley, who helped to draft the initial Laws of the Game that were adopted by the organization.
