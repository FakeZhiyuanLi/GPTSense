The victory for Napoleon that secured his political power and increased his popularity in France occurred at the Battle of Austerlitz, which took place on December 2, 1805, in what is now the Czech Republic. The battle was fought between the French army, commanded by Napoleon, and the combined armies of Russia and Austria. Napoleon's decisive victory at Austerlitz is considered one of his greatest military feats and led to the signing of the Treaty of Pressburg, which effectively ended the War of the Third Coalition and solidified his position as the dominant power in Europe.
