Sanskrit was traditionally spoken by Brahmins, who were the highest social class in ancient India. However, over time, Sanskrit became a language of scholars and priests, and was no longer spoken as a common language. Today, Sanskrit is mainly used as a liturgical language in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, and is studied by scholars and enthusiasts around the world.
