During World War II, many people working for the BBC ended up serving in the Armed Forces, particularly in the Royal Air Force (RAF) or the Royal Navy. In fact, the BBC had a dedicated unit called the BBC War Correspondents Unit that was attached to the RAF and sent journalists and technicians to report on bombing raids and other military operations. Additionally, the BBC had its own Home Guard units made up of staff members who were not eligible for active military service due to age or medical conditions.
