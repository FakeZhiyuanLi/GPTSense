The AG2R La Mondiale cycling race is a road race, so the vehicles that participate are limited to support vehicles for the participating cycling teams. These support vehicles typically include team cars, medical cars, broom wagons, and neutral service vehicles. There are no vehicles that actually race in the AG2R La Mondiale event.
