The appointments to the Order of the British Empire are made by the monarch on the advice of the Prime Minister, who receives recommendations from various government departments and the public. The majority of the appointments are awarded twice each year in the Queen's Birthday Honours List and the New Year Honours List. The recommendations are assessed by committees made up of civil servants and independent experts who consider the nominee's achievements and contribution to society. The final decisions are made by the Queen, who typically awards the honour during an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace or another royal residence.
