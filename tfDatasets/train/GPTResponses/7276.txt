There are several reasons why most pesticide-related deaths occur in underdeveloped countries:1. Lack of safety regulations: Many underdeveloped countries do not have strict safety regulations in place for the use of pesticides. This means that pesticides are often used improperly and can lead to accidents and deaths.2. Lack of protective equipment: Agricultural workers in underdeveloped countries often do not have access to proper protective equipment like gloves, masks, and goggles. This means that they are exposed to harmful pesticides without any form of protection.3. Lack of education: Many farmers in underdeveloped countries are not properly educated on the safe use of pesticides. They may not be aware of the risks associated with pesticide use or how to use them properly.4. Poverty: Poverty is a significant factor in pesticide-related deaths in underdeveloped countries. Many farmers cannot afford the necessary protective equipment and may use cheaper, more dangerous pesticides to save money.5. Increased exposure: In underdeveloped countries, pesticide use is often more intensive due to the need to maximize crop yields. This means that agricultural workers are exposed to higher levels of pesticides, increasing their risk of illness and death.
