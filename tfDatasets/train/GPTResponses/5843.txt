The fifteenth century shows evidence of the emergence of Freemasonry as a distinct organization with its own customs, rituals, and symbols. It was during this time that the operative masons (those who built cathedrals and castles) began to organize themselves into lodges. These lodges were places for the masons to meet, exchange ideas, and educate their apprentices. The fifteenth century also saw the beginning of the transition of Freemasonry from an operative craft to a speculative one. This transition involved a shift from building tangible structures to building moral and spiritual ones. This is evidenced by the use of allegories and symbols in Masonic ritual and the emphasis on moral and ethical teachings in Masonic education.
