Hysteresis synchronous motors resemble like an induction motor at startup, where the stator produces a rotating magnetic field that induces an electric current in the rotor. However, once the rotor starts rotating, the hysteresis effect takes place, which causes the rotor to tend to maintain its direction of rotation, unlike an induction motor where the rotor keeps on accelerating to the speed of the stator field. This ability of the hysteresis motor to maintain its direction of rotation is due to the presence of a hysteresis ring inside the rotor, which causes a lag between the magnetic field and the rotor and creates a phase shift, leading to torque production.
