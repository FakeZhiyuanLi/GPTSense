It depends on the specific competition and circumstance. In some cases, multiple cup winners may continue to compete and try to win additional cups in the future. They may also be recognized and celebrated for their achievements, potentially being inducted into the competition's Hall of Fame. In other cases, there may be rules or regulations in place that limit the number of times a team or individual can win a specific cup or require them to retire after a certain number of victories. Ultimately, the fate of multiple cup winners will depend on the competition and the organizers' decisions.
