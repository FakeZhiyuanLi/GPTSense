There are several factors that can influence water evaporation on leaves, including:1. Temperature - Warmer temperatures can increase the rate of evaporation.2. Humidity - Dry air can increase the rate of evaporation, while humid air can slow it down.3. Wind - Increased airflow around the leaves can increase the rate of evaporation.4. Light - Increased sunlight can increase the rate of evaporation.5. Surface area - The larger the surface area of the leaves, the higher the rate of evaporation.6. Water availability - When there is a lack of water in the soil, the rate of evaporation can increase, as the plant tries to conserve the water it does have.7. Cuticular and stomatal characteristics - The characteristics of cuticle and stomata on the leaves, such as thickness and density, can affect the rate of water loss.
