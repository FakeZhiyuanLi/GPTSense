The new colony of Italia Eritrea was a colony of Italy. It was established in 1890 and remained under Italian control until the end of World War II in 1941. During this time, Italy exploited the region's resources and engaged in forced labor practices that led to widespread human rights abuses. Italia Eritrea played a significant role in Italy's colonial ambitions in Africa and was also a crucial battleground during the East African campaign of World War II.
