Detractors of affirmative action claim that other minority groups, such as Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, and Native Americans, as well as women, benefit from affirmative action policies. They argue that these groups are given preferential treatment in employment, education, and other areas, even if they do not come from disadvantaged backgrounds. They also argue that affirmative action policies create reverse discrimination against white men, who may be more qualified for certain positions but are passed over in favor of less qualified candidates who fall under protected categories.
