The first records known to be existent were derived from cave paintings and carvings made by early humans that date back over 40,000 years ago. These records depict animals, hunting scenes, and religious rituals, and were found in various locations around the world, including Europe, Asia, and Africa. As writing systems developed, the first known records on paper or other writing materials appeared in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia around 3,500 BCE.
