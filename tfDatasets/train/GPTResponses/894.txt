The use of solar water heaters in the US first began in the early 20th century, with the first known solar water heater patented in 1891 by Clarence Kemp. However, it was not until the energy crisis of the 1970s that solar technology gained more widespread attention and use. In 1975, the US Department of Energy launched a solar water heater research and development program to encourage the adoption of this technology. Today, solar water heaters can be found in homes and businesses across the country as an alternative to traditional water heating methods.
