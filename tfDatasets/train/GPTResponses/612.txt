A detailed scholastic reworking of doctrinal material is called a theological synthesis or a systematic theology. This type of work aims to analyze and categorize a particular body of religious doctrine, often drawing upon diverse sources including scripture, historical texts, and philosophical works. The goal is to create a comprehensive and coherent system of belief that is consistent with the teachings of a particular religious tradition. These works often include detailed examinations of specific topics such as the nature of God, salvation, the afterlife, and the relationship between human beings and the divine. They may also address contemporary issues and debates within a religious community.
