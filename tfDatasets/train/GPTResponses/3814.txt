Internal digestion is better than external digestion because internal digestion allows for a more efficient and controlled breakdown of food. With external digestion, the organism must rely on external factors to assist in the break down of food, which can be affected by environmental conditions and the availability of enzymes. Internal digestion also allows for the absorption of nutrients to occur more efficiently as it is in direct contact with the digestive system. Additionally, internal digestion also allows for the body to remove waste products more efficiently than external digestion, as waste can be directly eliminated from the body through excretion.
