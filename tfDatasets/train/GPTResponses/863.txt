The institutions that comprise the shadow banking system include hedge funds, money market funds, special purpose vehicles (SPVs), structured investment vehicles (SIVs), investment banks, and other non-bank financial institutions. These institutions are not subject to the same regulations and oversight as traditional banks but offer similar services and can pose systemic risks to the financial system.
