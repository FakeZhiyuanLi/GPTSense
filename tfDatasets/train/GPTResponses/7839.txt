There are several cursive scripts that can give expression to spoken words, but one that stands out is shorthand. Shorthand is a system of rapid handwriting that is used to transcribe spoken language. It is characterized by a combination of symbols and abbreviations that represent words or phrases. Shorthand was widely used in the pre-digital era by journalists, secretaries, and court reporters for note-taking purposes. Today, shorthand has largely been replaced by digital audio recording and transcription software, but it remains a useful skill for those who need to take notes quickly and efficiently.
