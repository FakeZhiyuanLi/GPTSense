In plants, different DNA markers can be visualized using techniques such as gel electrophoresis, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification followed by analysis using specialized software or genetic databases. These techniques allow researchers to identify and analyze differences in DNA sequences and genetic variants, which can provide information about the genetic diversity, relatedness, and evolutionary history of plant species. Different DNA markers may also be used to identify specific plant traits or genes of interest, which can be useful for plant breeding or genetic engineering.
