The Feast of the Dormition (or Assumption) of Mary is the event on the Orthodox calendar that is related to Mary and icon veneration. It is celebrated on August 15th and commemorates the falling asleep (or death) of Mary, the mother of Jesus, and her bodily assumption into heaven. This event is significant for Orthodox Christians because Mary is venerated as the most important and holy of all the saints, and Orthodox tradition holds that she continues to intercede for believers before the throne of God. The Feast of the Dormition is also connected to the veneration of icons, as Orthodox Christians believe that Mary's image and presence are embodied in icons and that these images serve as a means of connecting worshippers to Mary and the divine.
