English mystics tended to focus on direct experiences of God or a higher power, spiritual contemplation, meditation, and the pursuit of mystical knowledge and wisdom. Some notable English mystics include Julian of Norwich, Richard Rolle, and Walter Hilton. They believed in the importance of personal and experiential encounters with God or divine truth, rather than relying solely on external religious teachings or traditions. They also emphasized the importance of love, humility, and compassion in the pursuit of spiritual growth and enlightenment.
