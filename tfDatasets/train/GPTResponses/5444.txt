event?Gil Atzmon suggests that Ashkenazim branched off from other Jews around the time of the 1st century CE. Specifically, he proposes that the Ashkenazi population emerged from a group of Jews in the Middle East who migrated to Italy and then to the Rhineland area of Germany around this time. This migration is believed to have been driven by economic and political factors, as well as the spread of Christianity in the region. Over time, this group became genetically distinct from other Jewish populations and developed their own cultural practices and traditions.
