It depends on the type of filament. Some common types of filaments used in 3D printing include:1. PLA (polylactic acid) - made from renewable resources such as cornstarch, sugarcane, or tapioca roots.2. ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) - a petroleum-based thermoplastic.3. PET (polyethylene terephthalate) - a type of plastic used in water bottles and food packaging.4. Nylon - a strong and flexible synthetic polymer.5. TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane) - a flexible, rubber-like material.6. PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) - a water-soluble material often used as support structures in 3D printing.So, the filament is made of different materials depending on the type of filament you are using.
