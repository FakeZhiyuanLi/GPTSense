It depends on which war you are referring to. Here are a few:- World War I: The Treaty of Versailles- World War II: Several treaties were signed, including the Treaty of Paris, the Treaty of San Francisco, and the Potsdam Agreement, which together ended the war in Europe and the Pacific theater.- Korean War: The Armistice Agreement, signed in 1953, effectively ended the fighting (although a peace treaty was never signed).- Vietnam War: The Paris Peace Accords, signed in 1973, officially ended U.S. involvement in the war.- Gulf War: The Gulf War ceasefire was declared on April 11, 1991, but no formal peace treaty was signed.
