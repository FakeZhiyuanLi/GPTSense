we now consider harmony, using multiple independent melodic lines that harmonize together. In polyphonic music, each melody is given equal importance, creating a texture that can be rich and dense. This contrasts with monophonic music, where there is only one melody at a time. Polyphonic music was especially popular in the Renaissance and Baroque eras, and composers such as Johann Sebastian Bach and Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina are known for their mastery of polyphonic composition.
