Improvisation in classical music performance was common during the Baroque era (1600-1750) and the Classical era (1750-1825). In particular, improvisation was important in keyboard music, where performers were expected to improvise embellishments and variations on a given theme. However, the practice of improvisation gradually declined during the Romantic era (1825-1900) as composers began to write more complex and highly structured works that left little room for improvisation.
