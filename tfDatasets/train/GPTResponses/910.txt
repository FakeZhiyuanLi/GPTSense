Anthropology is the scientific study of human societies and cultures, including their behaviors, beliefs, traditions, and customs. It focuses on understanding the diversity of human experiences and how these experiences shape individuals and groups' identities and interactions. Anthropologists aim to explain why and how human societies differ in terms of their social, economic, and political systems, as well as their religious and artistic expressions. The field covers various sub-disciplines, such as cultural anthropology, linguistic anthropology, biological anthropology, and archaeology.
