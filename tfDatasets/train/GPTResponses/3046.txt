The treaty might have gone into effect on different dates depending on the specific provisions outlined in the agreement. For example, certain provisions of the treaty may require further actions or approvals by the parties involved before they become binding or applicable. Additionally, the implementation of the treaty may also depend on external factors such as the legislative process of the participating countries or the ongoing negotiations with other parties. Therefore, even if signed and ratified at the same time, the practical effects of the treaty may be realized at different times.
