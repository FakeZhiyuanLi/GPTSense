Sedimentary rocks: Uranium can be found with phosphate rocks, sandstones, and black shales.3. Metamorphic rocks: Uranium can be found in gneisses, schists, and other metamorphic rocks.However, not all rocks containing uranium are economically viable to mine and extract uranium from. The concentration of uranium in rocks varies widely, and it requires specialized techniques to extract the uranium for commercial use.
