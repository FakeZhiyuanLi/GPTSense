The average concentration of copper in ores varies widely, depending on the type of ore and the location of the deposit. Copper ores can range from very low-grade (less than 1% copper) to very high-grade (over 30% copper), with the average global concentration being around 0.6%. However, some of the largest and most productive copper mines in the world have ore grades of over 1%, and there are some deposits with ore grades approaching 5%. It is also worth noting that the concentration of copper in the ore is not the same as the copper content of the final product, as there are losses and efficiencies in the mining and processing stages.
