Early geographers did not have an accurate understanding of the size of Antarctica, as the continent was not officially discovered until the 1820s. Some early explorers and cartographers believed that Antarctica may have been a vast, continuous landmass that extended all the way to the South Pole, while others thought it might be a group of smaller islands or a polar peninsula. It was not until the 20th century that modern technology and expeditions allowed for more accurate mapping and measurement of the size and shape of Antarctica.
