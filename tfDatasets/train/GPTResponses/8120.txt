The NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, which is now known as the NASCAR Cup Series, typically has around 36 points-paying races per season, including the Daytona 500. However, the number of exhibition events or non-points races that take place in any given year can vary. In recent years, the Cup Series has had one exhibition race, the All-Star Race, which is held annually at Charlotte Motor Speedway.
