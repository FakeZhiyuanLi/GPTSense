If a plant remains totipotent, it means that all its differentiated cells are capable of dedifferentiating back into meristematic cells, giving rise to new tissues and organs. This property is useful in plant tissue culture, where cells and tissues are used to generate new plants asexually. However, it can also lead to uncontrolled growth and the formation of abnormal tissues or tumors, which is a concern in agriculture and biotechnology. Overall, the totipotent nature of plant cells allows for their regeneration and propagation, making them a valuable resource in plant breeding and conservation efforts.
