An example of secular northern brick gothic architecture from the 14th century is the town hall of Tholen, located in the Netherlands. It was built in 1375 and features a distinctive facade that combines traditional Gothic elements with the use of glazed brick, a common feature of northern European architecture. The town hall also features a tall tower and large windows that allow natural light to flood the interior, creating a sense of grandeur and openness.
