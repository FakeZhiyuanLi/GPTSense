Before Napoleon, Europe last saw a similar level of political consolidation during the reign of Charlemagne in the late 8th and early 9th centuries. Charlemagne's rule over the Carolingian Empire brought together several Western European regions under one centralized authority, and his efforts to establish a common legal system, currency, and administrative structure helped to create a sense of unity across the continent that endured for some time after his death. However, Charlemagne's empire gradually fragmented over the centuries that followed, and it was not until the rise of Napoleon in the early 19th century that Europe once again saw a comparable consolidation of political power.
