There is no conclusive evidence linking any current Native American tribes to the Casas Grandes culture. However, possible descendants may include the Tarahumara people of northern Mexico, who share some cultural similarities with the Casas Grandes, such as cliff dwellings and ceramic pottery. Other potential descendants include the Pueblos of the American Southwest, such as the Zuni and Hopi, who also have some similarities in their architecture and ceramics. However, these connections are speculative and not fully understood.
