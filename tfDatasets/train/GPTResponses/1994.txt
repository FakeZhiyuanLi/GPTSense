Observing daylight saving time would have a small effect on how light it is during the workday in areas at high latitudes. This is because these areas already experience long daylight hours during the summer months and short daylight hours during the winter months due to their location relative to the Earth's axis. While daylight saving time could potentially shift the timing of sunrise and sunset, it would not significantly change the overall amount of daylight received in these regions.
