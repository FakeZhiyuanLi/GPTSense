The term "Near and Middle East" originated in the 20th century, primarily during the period of European colonialism and imperialism in the region. It has been used to describe the countries of southwestern Asia and northeastern Africa, including the Gulf states, Iran, Iraq, and the Levant. The term has fallen out of favor in recent years, with many preferring more specific regional designations, such as the "MENA" region (Middle East and North Africa).
