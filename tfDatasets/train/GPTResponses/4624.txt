Aircraft carriers serve as mobile and versatile airbases for aircraft. They allow aircraft to project power and operate in areas where land-based airfields are not available or easily accessible. They also provide a platform for aircraft to conduct various types of missions, such as reconnaissance, surveillance, air defense, and strike missions. Additionally, aircraft carriers can operate in groups with other naval vessels, allowing for coordinated military operations and strategic maneuvering on a global scale.
