The cracking and breaking of ice can be caused by a variety of factors including changes in temperature, pressure, and wind. As ice freezes, it expands, and when the temperature rises or falls suddenly, the ice can crack and break as it contracts or expands. Additionally, wind can cause stresses on the ice, making it more likely to crack and break. Pressure on the ice from nearby objects, such as boats or other ice formations, can also cause cracks and breaks in the ice.
