The action of pinning the clothes of a Muslim woman, which led to her being violated or assaulted, allegedly violated the Constitution of Medina as it prohibits any form of harm, injury, or injustice against Muslims, specifically women. The Constitution of Medina was a social contract established by Prophet Muhammad between the Muslims and the non-Muslim tribes of Medina, emphasizing the rights and responsibilities of all parties and ensuring justice and equality for all.
