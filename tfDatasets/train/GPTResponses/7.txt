During the last ice age, a vast sheet of ice known as the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) covered a large part of central Europe. This ice sheet, which was also present in North America and parts of Asia, was more than three kilometers thick at its center and covered an area that included much of present-day Poland, Germany, Austria, and the Czech Republic. It stretched from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Alps in the south, and from the British Isles in the west to Russia in the east. This ice sheet altered the landscape, shaping river valleys and carving out deep depressions that would later become lakes.
