The second of the four noble truths in Buddhism explains the cause of suffering, which is craving and attachment. It states that the root of suffering is the desire for things to be different from how they actually are, and the attachment to pleasure and the fear of pain. These desires and attachments lead to negative emotions like greed, anger, and ignorance, which cause suffering in oneself and others. To transcend suffering, one must recognize and let go of these desires and attachments.
