The Jura Mountains were formed about 150 million years ago during the Jurassic period when the African and European tectonic plates collided. The collision caused the land to buckle and fold, resulting in the gradual uplift of the Jura Mountains. Additionally, the movement of glaciers during the last ice age also played a role in shaping the landscape of the Jura Mountains. The erosion caused by the glaciers created deep valleys and ridges, further sculpting the mountain range.
