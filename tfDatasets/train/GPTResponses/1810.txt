A supremacy clause in a federal constitution is relevant to the discussion on the relation between treaties and federal legislation. The supremacy clause establishes that federal law, including treaties, is the supreme law of the land and overrides any conflicting state laws or regulations. This means that if a treaty conflicts with federal legislation, the treaty takes precedence and must be enforced. The supremacy clause ensures that the US complies with its treaty obligations and does not violate international law. It also ensures consistency and uniformity in the application of federal law throughout the country.
