Cognitive science investigates a wide range of mental processes and phenomena, including perception, attention, memory, reasoning, decision making, language, problem-solving, creativity, and consciousness. It explores how the brain processes information and how mental representations and structures are formed, stored, and manipulated. Cognitive science draws on multiple disciplines, including psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, computer science, philosophy, and anthropology, to provide a comprehensive and interdisciplinary understanding of the human mind and cognition.
