The text that is written and sent to the Senate if the House approves of a law is the enrolled bill. This is a final version of the bill that has passed the House and the Senate, and has been signed by the Speaker of the House and the Vice President (as the President of the Senate). The enrolled bill is then sent to the President for signature or veto.
