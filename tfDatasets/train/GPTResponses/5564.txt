New construction began to re-emerge in Melbourne after the early 1890s depression in the late 1890s, around 1897-1898. This was due to the economic recovery that occurred after the adoption of protective tariffs and the expansion of the manufacturing sector. The construction of new buildings and infrastructure projects resumed, including the construction of Flinders Street Station and the development of the Melbourne CBD.
