Aryabhata, an ancient Indian mathematician and astronomer, is credited with discovering the following trigonometric functions:1. Sine function (jya) - defined as the ratio of the side opposite to an angle and the hypotenuse in a right-angled triangle.2. Cosine function (kojya) - defined as the ratio of the adjacent side and the hypotenuse in a right-angled triangle.3. Tangent function (oopa jya) - defined as the ratio of the side opposite to an angle and the adjacent side in a right-angled triangle.4. Secant function (ogdo jya) - defined as the reciprocal of cosine, i.e., hypotenuse divided by adjacent.5. Cosecant function (otka jya) - defined as the reciprocal of sine, i.e., hypotenuse divided by opposite.6. Cotangent function (varga jya) - defined as the reciprocal of tangent, i.e., adjacent divided by opposite.Aryabhata's contributions to the development of trigonometry were significant and paved the way for further advancements in this field.
