Ivan Pavlov was known for his research in classical conditioning, which he conducted on dogs. He discovered that animals (and humans) could be trained to associate a certain stimulus with a specific response, such as the sound of a bell with the anticipation of food. This pioneered the field of behavioral psychology, which has since been applied to diverse areas ranging from animal training to addiction therapy. Pavlov was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1904 for his groundbreaking research.
