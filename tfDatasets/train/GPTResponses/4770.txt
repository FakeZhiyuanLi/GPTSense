A notable recent development in terahertz (T-ray) imaging is the use of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to enhance the quality of T-ray images. AI algorithms can analyze T-ray images and detect subtle differences in the signals reflected back from different materials, revealing hidden details that would otherwise be difficult to discern. This has potential applications in fields such as medical imaging and security screening, where T-rays are already being used. Additionally, a new type of T-ray camera has been developed that can capture images in just a few milliseconds, greatly improving the speed and accuracy of T-ray imaging.
