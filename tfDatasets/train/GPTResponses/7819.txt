Glucose is able to stimulate the release of insulin from the pancreas, which is required in the human body for the regulation of blood sugar levels. Insulin helps to transport glucose from the bloodstream into cells, where it can be used for energy or stored for later use. Glucose is also important for the functioning of the brain, as it is the main source of fuel for the brain's cells.
