If Olympic sports participants showed a Tibetan flag at events, they could face disciplinary action or sanctions from both the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and their national governing body. This is because the IOC maintains strict rules regarding political demonstrations, slogans, and propaganda during Olympic events. All participating athletes and officials are prohibited from making any political, religious, or racial propaganda at Olympic venues. If an athlete violates this rule, they could face disqualification, fines, or even suspension from future Olympic events.
