The United States and its coalition partners officially occupied Iraq from 2003 to 2011, a total of 8 years. However, the presence of US troops in Iraq continued beyond 2011 in an advisory and training capacity. In 2014, the US led a military coalition to fight against the Islamic State (IS) group in Iraq, which further extended the presence of US troops in the country. As of 2021, there are still around 2,500 US troops stationed in Iraq.
