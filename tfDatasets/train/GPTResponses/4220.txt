The FBI's main tool against organized crime is the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. This law allows the FBI to prosecute individuals or groups who engage in a pattern of criminal activities, such as money laundering, bribery, extortion, and fraud, as part of a larger organized crime syndicate. This allows for the criminal organizations to be dismantled and their assets seized. The use of RICO has been instrumental in disrupting and dismantling some of the most notorious organized crime groups in the United States.
