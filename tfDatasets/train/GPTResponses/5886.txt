One example of something that can be deployed in fixed launchers but re-deployed at will is a rocket or missile. Once launched, the rocket or missile can be directed to its target and then redirected and re-targeted as needed. The launcher remains fixed in place, but the rocket or missile it launches can be redirected and re-deployed as needed. Another example is a drone or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The drone can be launched from a fixed launcher and then flown to a specific location, and then retrieved and re-deployed for another mission.
