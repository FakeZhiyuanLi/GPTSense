This belief is attributed to the sociologist and economist Thorstein Veblen, who developed the theory of institutional economics. Veblen argued that social institutions and cultural practices influenced economic behavior and that the pursuit of profit was a societal illness that perpetuated inequality and inhibited progress. He believed that a redistribution of wealth and resources was necessary to create a more just society in which everyone had an equal opportunity to succeed. Veblen's work has had a significant impact on modern economics and continues to influence discussions about inequality and social justice.
