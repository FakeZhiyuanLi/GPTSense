Dialect use is often associated with a lower socio-economic status or less education and is stigmatized because of a belief that it reflects a speaker's lack of intelligence or inferiority. Dialects that are stigmatized include African American English, Southern American English, British regional accents, and many others. However, it is important to recognize that dialects are part of a speaker's identity and cultural heritage and should not be seen as a marker of lesser value.
