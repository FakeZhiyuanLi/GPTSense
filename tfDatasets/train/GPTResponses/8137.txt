The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 marked the start of discrimination against Asians in the United States. This law prohibited the immigration of Chinese laborers to the United States and made it extremely difficult for Chinese immigrants already in the country to bring their families over to join them. The law was eventually repealed in 1943.
