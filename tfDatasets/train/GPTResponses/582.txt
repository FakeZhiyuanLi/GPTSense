The first large solar distillation plant was created in 1872 by Charles Wilson, an American inventor, in Las Salinas, Chile, to extract salt from seawater using solar energy. However, the first large-scale plant for the production of drinkable water from seawater was built in 1969 in Al Khafji, Saudi Arabia, by the US company, Solar Distillation Corporation.
