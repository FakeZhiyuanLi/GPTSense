The Fed began raising the fed funds rate significantly in late 2015, with the first increase since the financial crisis occurring in December of that year. They continued to gradually raise the rate over the next few years, with the last increase occurring in December 2018, bringing the rate to 2.25-2.50%. However, in 2019, the Fed began cutting the rate in response to slowing economic growth and trade tensions with China.
