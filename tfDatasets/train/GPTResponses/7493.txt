The leader of the Greek revolt in 1821 was a bishop named Germanos of Patras, who raised the Greek flag at the Monastery of Agia Lavra and called for the uprising against the Ottoman Empire. However, the most prominent leader of the Greek revolt was Alexandros Ypsilantis, who was responsible for coordinating the rebellion across multiple regions of Greece.
