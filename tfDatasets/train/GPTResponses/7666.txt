The practice of dividing foods into categories can be traced back to ancient civilizations. In ancient Greece, Hippocrates, the father of modern medicine, classified foods into four categories: dry foods, moist foods, fatty foods, and sweet foods. In ancient China, food was divided into five categories based on taste and appearance: salty, sour, bitter, spicy, and sweet. Similar categorizations of food were also found in ancient Indian Ayurvedic texts. However, it is difficult to attribute the origin of food categorization to a single individual or culture, as this practice has been prevalent throughout human history.
