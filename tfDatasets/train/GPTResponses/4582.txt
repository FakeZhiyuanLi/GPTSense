The concept of race in the United States Census is defined by the United States Census Bureau, which is a government agency responsible for conducting the national census every ten years. However, the way race has been defined and categorized has evolved over time and has been influenced by societal and political changes. The Census Bureau's current race categories include White, Black or African American, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, American Indian or Alaska Native, and Some Other Race.
