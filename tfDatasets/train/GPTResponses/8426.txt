When a human is suffering from hyponatremia, the main cause of damage that may occur is cerebral edema or swelling of the brain due to the low levels of sodium in the blood. This can lead to symptoms such as seizures, confusion, headaches, nausea, and in severe cases, coma or even death. The brain cells may swell due to osmotic imbalances, and the reduced levels of sodium may also disrupt the normal functioning of other organs such as the kidneys, leading to further complications. Therefore, prompt medical attention and treatment are crucial in managing hyponatremia and preventing potential damage to the body.
