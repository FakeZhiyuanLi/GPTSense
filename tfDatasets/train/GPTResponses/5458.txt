It is not accurate to say that the Ashkenazi population shifted in a particular direction in the late Middle Ages. The Ashkenazi Jewish population has a complex history of migration and settlement over centuries, so any analysis of population shifts needs to take into account different time periods and locations. However, some scholars suggest that during the 13th century, the Ashkenazi population shifted from Germany to Poland and other Eastern European regions due to economic and social factors, as well as persecution in Germany. This led to the development of strong Jewish communities in Poland and the surrounding regions, which continued to thrive and influence Jewish culture and religion.
