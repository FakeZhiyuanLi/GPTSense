The historical school that claims that sentiments and meta-emotions can be learned is the behaviorist school of psychology. Behaviorists believe that all behavior, including emotions, can be learned through conditioning and reinforcement. They emphasize the importance of observation and experimentation in understanding human behavior and suggest that emotions can be shaped and modified through experience and feedback.
