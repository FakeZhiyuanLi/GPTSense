The invention of the ball bearing solved the problem of continuous rotation. Ball bearings consist of small metal balls that are placed between two rotating surfaces, allowing for smooth and continuous motion. They are commonly used in machinery, vehicles, and other mechanical systems to reduce friction and wear. The invention of the ball bearing is credited to Leonardo da Vinci, although it was not widely used until the 19th century.
