The invention that allowed horses rather than oxen to be used to plow is the horse collar. The horse collar was a harness that fit around the horse's neck and shoulders, allowing the horse to pull heavy loads with greater efficiency and comfort. Before the invention of the horse collar, oxen were the preferred animal for plowing because their wide, strong shoulders were better suited to the yoke-style harnesses. With the introduction of the horse collar, horses could be used for plowing, which was a significant agricultural advancement as horses are faster and easier to manage than oxen.
