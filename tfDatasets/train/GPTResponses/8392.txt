After the state passed the top 10% rule, minority enrollment in select universities in Texas increased significantly. This was because the rule mandated that students who rank in the top 10% of their high school class must be granted automatic admission to any Texas public university. As a result, many high-achieving minority students who may not have been previously considered for admission to elite universities were given an opportunity to attend. The rule helped to increase diversity on college campuses by expanding access to students of all backgrounds.
