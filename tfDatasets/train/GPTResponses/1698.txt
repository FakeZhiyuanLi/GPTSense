When investigating gene expression, typically "housekeeping genes" or "reference genes" are used as controls for experiments. These are genes that are commonly expressed in most tissues and cell types, and their expression levels are relatively stable and unaffected by experimental treatments or conditions. The most commonly used reference genes include GAPDH, beta-actin, and beta-2 microglobulin.
