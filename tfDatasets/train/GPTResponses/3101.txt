Hodgson suggests that the ancestral people who spread the Afro-Asiatic languages were a group of nomadic pastoralists who migrated from the Sahara region into the Horn of Africa, around 10,000 years ago. They eventually spread across the continent, with different groups adapting to different environments and developing distinct linguistic and cultural traits.
