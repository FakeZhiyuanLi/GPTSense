Group law and topology can integrate well if the group operation satisfies certain conditions in relation to the topology. Specifically, the group operation must be continuous and the topology must be compatible with the group operation.A continuous group operation means that the mappings from the group to itself are continuous functions. This ensures that moving from one element of the group to another element produces a continuous change in the group structure. This condition ensures that the group law is well-behaved with respect to the topology.Compatibility between the group law and topology requires that the topology is generated by a set of open sets that are invariant under the group action. This means that any open set transformed by a group action will result in another open set. This condition ensures that the group action preserves the topology and the group elements behave well with respect to the open sets of the topology.In summary, the group operation must be continuous and the topology must be compatible with the group operation for group law and topology to integrate well.
