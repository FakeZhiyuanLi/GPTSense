is called "off" or not active, while a "1" represents when the circuit is "on" or active. This means that when a signal or input is in the form of a "0", it indicates a low voltage or absence of voltage, while a signal or input in the form of a "1" indicates a high voltage or presence of voltage. In other words, positive logic representation defines the "on" state as the logical high or true state, and the "off" state as the logical low or false state.
