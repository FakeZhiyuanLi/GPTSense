A genotype is the genetic make-up of an individual organism, consisting of its inheritable genetic information encoded in its DNA. It includes all the inherited traits, genes, and genetic variants that an individual possesses, which determine its physical and biological characteristics, such as eye color, height, susceptibility to diseases, and behavior. The genotype of an individual is determined by the combination of genes received from its parents during reproduction.
