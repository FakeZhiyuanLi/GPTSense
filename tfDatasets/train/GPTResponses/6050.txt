There are typically three phases of human trials that are conducted after IND (Investigational New Drug) approval. However, in some cases, a fourth phase, known as Phase 4, may also be conducted after the drug has been approved by regulatory authorities for commercial use. This phase involves ongoing monitoring and data collection to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the drug over an extended period of time.
