Snakes, especially pythons and boas, have been a part of wrestling for a long time. The most famous example is wrestler Jake "The Snake" Roberts, who would enter the ring with his pet python, Damien. However, using animals in wrestling is now banned in most countries due to concerns over animal welfare.
