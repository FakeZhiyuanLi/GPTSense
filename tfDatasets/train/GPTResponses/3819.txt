There are several elements that can transfer to plant cells, including:1. Carbon – used in photosynthesis by plants to produce energy2. Nitrogen – important for the growth and development of plants3. Phosphorus – essential for plant growth and development, particularly in the formation of roots and seeds4. Potassium – helps regulate plant water balance, and is important in the process of photosynthesis5. Calcium – important for cell wall structure and plant growth and development6. Magnesium – necessary for photosynthesis and other metabolic processes in plants7. Iron – essential for the formation of chlorophyll, which is necessary for photosynthesis8. Zinc – important in plant growth and development, particularly in the formation of seeds and the regulation of plant growth hormones
