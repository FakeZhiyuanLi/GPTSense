Ethernet standards require:1. Physical layer standards - Defines the physical characteristics of the cable, such as thickness, length, and signal strength.2. Data link layer standards - Defines how data is formatted into packets and how devices communicate with each other.3. Network layer standards - Defines how devices communicate with each other across networks.4. Ethernet frame format - Specifies the format of Ethernet data packets, including the destination and source addresses, type of data, and checksum.5. Transmission medium standards - Defines the types of cables and connections that can be used in Ethernet networks.6. Speed and distance standards - Specifies the maximum speeds and distances that Ethernet networks can support.
