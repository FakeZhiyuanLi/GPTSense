The terminals of high voltage capacitors are typically stored in two ways:1. Disconnected from the capacitor: If the capacitor is not in use or has been removed from a circuit, the terminals are often disconnected from the capacitor and stored separately. This prevents accidental discharge and ensures that the terminals remain clean and dry.2. Connected to a discharge resistor: In some cases, high voltage capacitors are stored with the terminals connected to a discharge resistor. This allows any residual charge on the capacitor to dissipate slowly over time, which reduces the risk of electrical shock or damage to the capacitor itself. The discharge resistor also provides a path for any current that may be present, preventing arcing or other electrical problems.
