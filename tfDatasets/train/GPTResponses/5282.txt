There is no record of the prime ministers of Britain and France discussing the idea of France joining the Commonwealth. It is unlikely that such discussions have ever taken place as the Commonwealth is a voluntary association of independent sovereign states, predominantly former territories of the British Empire, that share historical ties, values, and institutions. France is neither a former British colony nor a territory with historical links to Britain.
