"democratic and open"India refused China's request that the Tibetan exile community be avoided because they said India is a "democratic and open" country. India has historically supported the Tibetan cause and allowed the Dalai Lama to establish the Tibetan government-in-exile in Dharamshala, a town in the northern state of Himachal Pradesh. India has also given refuge to thousands of Tibetans who have fled their homeland due to persecution and human rights violations. The Indian government has maintained that it would not compromise on its principles of democracy and freedom of expression, even at the risk of displeasing its larger neighbor, China.
