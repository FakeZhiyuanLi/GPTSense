There is no evidence of a large population of Algonquian people in Bermuda. The island was uninhabited when it was first discovered by the Spanish in the early 16th century, and was later settled by the English in the early 17th century. The indigenous people of the region were likely Lucayans, a branch of the Ta√≠no people, who were largely displaced or exterminated by European colonizers and disease.
