There are numerous things that could decline under competition, depending on the context. Below are a few examples:1. Market share: If a company faces strong competition from rivals, its market share could decline as customers switch to competitors' products or services.2. Profit margin: In a highly competitive market, companies may need to lower their prices in order to remain competitive. This can lead to a decline in profit margins.3. Quality: If companies are solely focused on beating their competition, they may make sacrifices in the quality of their products or services. This can result in a decline in overall quality and customer satisfaction.4. Innovation: When companies are competing fiercely, they may be hesitant to take risks and invest in new products or technologies. This can stifle innovation and limit progress in the industry.5. Employee morale: Intense competition can put pressure on employees to perform at a high level, which can lead to burnout and lower morale.
