The essentialist approach takes the sense of self and belonging as a fixed thing. This approach views identity as an inherent, unchanging characteristic that is determined by biological, cultural, or psychological factors. It assumes that group membership is determined by these inherent qualities, rather than by social or cultural factors. This approach is often criticized for ignoring the complex ways in which identity is shaped by social and historical contexts, and for perpetuating stereotypes and prejudice.
