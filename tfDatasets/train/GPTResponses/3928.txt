Firewalls are considered a security measure that helps protect a network or system from unauthorized access and other types of cyber attacks. When properly configured, a firewall can monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic, block suspicious connections and unauthorized access attempts, and enforce security policies.Exit procedures are a set of policies, processes, and protocols that govern how employees or other authorized users leave an organization or a particular role. These procedures help minimize the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, theft, or other types of security incidents when someone no longer requires access to sensitive information or resources. Exit procedures typically include steps such as disabling accounts, collecting physical assets, returning equipment, and conducting exit interviews to gather feedback and address any concerns.
