One of Alexander Archipenko's pieces that was similar to other cubist sculptures of that time was "Walking Woman" (1912). This sculpture features sharp angles and fragmented planes, typical of the cubist style, and depicts a woman walking in an abstracted form. Its emphasis on geometric shapes and rejection of traditional realistic forms was common among other cubist sculptors such as Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque.
