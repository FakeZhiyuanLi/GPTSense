One example of a passive solar technique is using large south-facing windows to allow sunlight to heat a room during the day, while insulating the walls and windows at night to prevent heat loss. Another example is designing a building with a sloped roof to maximize solar gain and using thermal mass materials, such as concrete or brick, to absorb and store heat during the day and release it slowly at night.
