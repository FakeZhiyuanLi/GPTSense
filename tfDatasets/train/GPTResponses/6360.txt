There are several possible causes of Napoleon's death that were supported by studies published in 2007 and 2008, including:1. Arsenic poisoning: Analysis of samples of Napoleon's hair showed high levels of arsenic, suggesting that he may have been poisoned with the substance. Arsenic was commonly used in the 19th century as a treatment for various ailments, but it can also be lethal in high doses.2. Stomach cancer: Napoleon suffered from chronic stomach problems throughout his life, and it is possible that he developed stomach cancer as a result. A study published in the journal Nature Clinical Practice Gastroenterology & Hepatology in 2007 suggested that Napoleon's symptoms were consistent with those of stomach cancer.3. Peptic ulcer disease: Another possible cause of Napoleon's stomach problems was peptic ulcer disease, which was common among people in his era. A study published in the journal Gut in 2008 found evidence of peptic ulcer disease in Napoleon's stomach tissue samples.4. Poisoning with other substances: There are also theories that Napoleon may have been poisoned with other substances, such as mercury or lead, which were commonly used in medicine and industry at the time. However, there is limited evidence to support these theories.
