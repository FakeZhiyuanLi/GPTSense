According to Fermat's Little Theorem, for any prime number p that is not 2 or 5, the decimal expansion of 1/p will repeat with a period of p-1. In other words, if you divide 1 by a prime number p that is not 2 or 5, and write out the resulting decimal expansion, the digits after the decimal point will repeat after p-1 digits.For example, if we take p=7, then 1/7 = 0.142857 142857 142857 ...Notice that the digits 1, 4, 2, 8, 5, and 7 appear in a repeating cycle of length 6, which is equal to 7-1. This is true for any prime number p that is not 2 or 5, so the period of the decimal expansion of 1/p is always p-1.
