The Battle of Dannoura in 1185 resulted in the destruction of the Fujiwara clan. This battle was fought between the forces of the Minamoto clan and the Taira clan, who were in a struggle for control over Japan during the late 12th century. The Taira clan, which was supported by the Fujiwara clan, was defeated and the Fujiwara were subsequently weakened and lost their political influence.
