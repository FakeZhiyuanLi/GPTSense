Bern was able to grow bigger than the peninsula due to the construction of the Nydegg Bridge in the 19th century, which connected the city to the east bank of the Aare River and opened up new areas for development. Additionally, the construction of railways and other transportation infrastructure helped to connect Bern with surrounding towns and cities, further promoting growth and development.
