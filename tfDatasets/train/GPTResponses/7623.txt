There have been several individuals who have declared themselves ruler of an independent Tibet at different points in history. The most well-known and recent example is probably the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, who led the Tibetan government-in-exile after fleeing Tibet following the Chinese invasion in 1959. However, he has always advocated for a non-violent approach and sought to negotiate with the Chinese government rather than declaring an outright independence.
