Modern day currency started getting the faces of important people in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. In the United States, the first coins to feature portraits of people were the half-dime and dime, which were minted in 1796 and 1798 respectively. The first paper currency to feature a portrait was the $1 bill, which featured George Washington and was introduced in 1862. Other countries began to follow suit and feature portraits of important figures on their currency around the same time period.
