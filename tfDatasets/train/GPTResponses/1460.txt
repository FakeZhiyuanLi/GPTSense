By the end of the 6th century, the Slavs had settled in various regions of Central and Eastern Europe, including present-day Poland, Ukraine, Belarus, Russia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Slovenia. They lived in small tribes and communities, practicing agriculture, animal husbandry, and fishing. Some Slavic tribes, such as the Antes, had already established complex political and social systems, while others, such as the Polabians, remained loosely organized.
