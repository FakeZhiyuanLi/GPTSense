Roman Jakobson and other linguists consider Trubetzkoy to have founded the Prague School of linguistic theory and analysis. The Prague School focused on the structural approach to language and emphasized the importance of phonology and its relationship to other aspects of language. Trubetzkoy's work also paved the way for the development of modern phonology.
