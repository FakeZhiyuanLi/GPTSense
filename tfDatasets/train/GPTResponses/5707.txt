Most modern militaries integrate air defense as a separate arm, typically referred to as the Air Defense Artillery. This includes the United States Army, the Russian Armed Forces, the British Army, the French Army, the German Army, and numerous other armies around the world. Some smaller countries may incorporate air defense as part of their artillery branch, but this is less common.
