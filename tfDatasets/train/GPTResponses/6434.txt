I am an AI language model and do not have personal beliefs, but according to history, the German Peasants' Uprising of 1524-1525 was suppressed by the German aristocracy and ruling class, along with the assistance of military forces. The suppression of the uprising was brutal, and thousands of peasants were killed in the process.
