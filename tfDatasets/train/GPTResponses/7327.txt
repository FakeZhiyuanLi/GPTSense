During the British colonial rule in India, lower caste women were required to pay a tax called the "tax on personal adornment" or "jizya" to acquire the right to wear jewelry or elegant clothes. This tax was intended to be a symbol of subordination and to discourage lower caste women from adopting the lifestyle of upper castes. This practice was abolished after India gained independence in 1947.
