Blastula is a hollow ball of cells that is formed during the embryonic development of sponges. In sponges, the blastula is transformed into a larva that undergoes metamorphosis and settles on a solid surface to grow into a new sponge. The metamorphosis process involves the reorganization of the blastula, which forms a small oval-shaped larva with a flagellum. The larva then swims freely until it finds a suitable surface, where it undergoes further development and grows into a juvenile sponge. The juvenile sponge gradually develops into an adult sponge through the continuation of cell division and differentiation, and the growth and maturation of different cell types. During this process, the sponge forms a complex network of canals and chambers that filter and circulate seawater, allowing it to feed and exchange gases.
