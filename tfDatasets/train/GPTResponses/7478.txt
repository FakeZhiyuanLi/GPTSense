The Treaty of Versailles (1919) included the establishment of the International Labour Organization (ILO), which aimed to set standards for worker safety and rights. Over the years, the ILO has adopted a number of international labor conventions that address issues such as workplace safety, child labor, forced labor, and discrimination in employment. One of the most widely ratified conventions is the ILO Occupational Safety and Health Convention, which sets out a framework for ensuring safe and healthy working conditions for all workers.
