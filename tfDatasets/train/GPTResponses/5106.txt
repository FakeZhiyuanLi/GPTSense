There is no known map maker who used the name "Antarctica" in his or her map of the 2nd century A.D. The name Antarctica was first coined in the 2nd century A.D. by the Greek philosopher and mathematician Ptolemy, but it was not until the 19th century that the continent was fully discovered and mapped.
