The joining of the Indus Valley and Indo-Aryan cultures produced a mixed culture and society that laid the foundation for modern-day Indian culture. It resulted in the emergence of a new language, a new religion, new practices, customs, and beliefs. This hybrid culture incorporated the agricultural practices, town planning, and social organization of the Indus Valley civilization with the pastoral traditions, religion, and language of the Indo-Aryans. It led to the development of Hinduism, which is a synthesis of the Vedic religion of the Indo-Aryans and the mystical beliefs of the Indus Valley civilization. The joining of these two cultures also led to the emergence of the caste system, which became an integral part of Indian society. Overall, the joining of these two cultures had a profound impact on the history and culture of the Indian subcontinent.
