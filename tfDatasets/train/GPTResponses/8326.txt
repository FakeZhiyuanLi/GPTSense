The theory that addresses the phenomenon of homomorphisms being neither injective nor surjective is the theory of quotient groups. In this theory, a homomorphism that is neither injective nor surjective represents a mapping from a larger group onto a smaller group, where elements of the larger group that map to the same element in the smaller group are collapsed into a single element. The resulting quotient group captures information about the structure of the original group that is lost when the elements are collapsed.
