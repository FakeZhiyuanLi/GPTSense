All governing institutions in mainland China operate within a one-party government system, specifically the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The CCP has held a monopoly on political power since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. The government is structured hierarchically, with the CCP at the top, followed by the National People's Congress (NPC) and the State Council, which serves as the executive branch. Other institutions, such as the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, are also subordinate to the CCP's leadership.
