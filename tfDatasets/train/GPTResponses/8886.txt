During World War I, the British-French commanders attempted to disrupt Russian communications and supplies by sending Allied troops and supplies to Archangel, a port city in northern Russia, and Murmansk, a port city on the Barents Sea. The idea was to establish a Northern Front to cut Russia off from its allies and disrupt communication and supplies to the Russian army. However, the intervention was ultimately unsuccessful and was criticized for its high cost and low strategic value.
