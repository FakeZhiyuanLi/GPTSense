Chickens have a major significance to women in underdeveloped countries due to the economic and nutritional benefits they provide. Chickens are a source of protein-rich meat and eggs, which can improve the diets and health of families. Women can earn income by selling eggs and meat, which can be used for household expenses, education, and health care. Chickens are also easy to raise and require minimal resources, making them a sustainable livestock option for women in rural areas who may not have access to other forms of income generation. Additionally, chickens can provide a sense of empowerment to women by giving them a tangible asset that they can own and control, which can improve their overall well-being and social status within their communities.
