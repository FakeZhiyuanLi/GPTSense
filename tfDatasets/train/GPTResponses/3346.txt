The regional romance languages of Italy, such as Tuscan, Piedmontese, Lombard, Emilian-Romagnol, and Sardinian, all derive from Latin, the language of the ancient Romans. Over time, these regional dialects developed their own unique characteristics and evolved into distinct languages, although they still share many similarities with each other and with standard Italian.
