Organochlorine hydrocarbons can affect the balance of the nerve fibers by disrupting the function of the sodium and potassium ion channels in the nerve cell membrane. This can result in altered electrical activity and the inhibition of nerve impulses, leading to symptoms such as seizures, tremors, and convulsions. Additionally, some organochlorines have been shown to interfere with the synthesis and release of neurotransmitters, further contributing to disruptions in nerve function.
