The severity of famine is determined by a combination of natural and human factors. The availability and accessibility of food, water, and other resources are determined by environmental factors such as climate, weather, and natural disasters. However, the way societies respond to these factors also plays a significant role. Factors that can exacerbate famine include poverty, political instability, environmental degradation, conflict, and economic inequality. Adequate government policies, infrastructure, and social safety nets can help mitigate the severity of a famine.
