One of the most important atmospheric studies since the 1970s has been the research on climate change and global warming. This research has led to the understanding that the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere is causing a rise in global temperatures and a range of environmental impacts, including rising sea levels, increasing frequency and severity of natural disasters, and widespread changes in ecosystems and species ranges. This has had significant implications for global policy and has led to efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to a low-carbon economy.
