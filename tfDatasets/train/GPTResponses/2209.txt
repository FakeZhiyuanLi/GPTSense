The relevant clause of the United States Constitution is Article VI, Clause 2, also known as the Supremacy Clause. It states that "This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding." This clause establishes the supremacy of federal law, including treaties, over state law.
