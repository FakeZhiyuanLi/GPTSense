Thomas Malthus' book "An Essay on the Principle of Population" theorized that if human populations were unrestrained, they would eventually exceed the available resources necessary to sustain them. He argued that population growth would lead to a "struggle for existence" where people would compete for resources, leading to poverty, famine, and disease. Malthus believed that such conditions would eventually result in a population reduction through natural disasters and diseases, bringing the population back in line with available resources.
