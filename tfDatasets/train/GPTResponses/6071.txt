Yes, geese are an important part of the poultry industry, especially in some cultures where goose meat is a traditional dish. They are also used for their eggs, feathers, and down. However, the demand for goose meat and products is much lower than that of chickens, ducks, and turkeys. In addition, geese require more space and care than other poultry, making them less convenient to raise on a large scale.
