The German flag that was similar to the rot-un-wiss was replaced by the current flag of Germany, which is black, red, and gold. This new flag was introduced in 1949, after the end of World War II and the establishment of the Federal Republic of Germany. It was chosen to represent the new democratic and unified Germany, and was designed to contrast with the previous flag used by the Nazi regime.
