Baptists typically recognize two ministerial offices:1. Pastor or Minister: This individual is responsible for leading the congregation, preaching and teaching the Bible, administering the sacraments (baptism and communion), and providing pastoral care to the members of the congregation.2. Deacon: This individual is responsible for serving the needs of the congregation and assisting the Pastor or Minister in various tasks. Deacons may be involved in outreach ministries, financial stewardship, and providing practical support to members of the congregation.Note: Some Baptist churches may also recognize additional ministerial roles, such as youth pastor, worship leader, or evangelist.
