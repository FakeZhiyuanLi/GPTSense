1. Non-coding DNA: This type of non-repetitive DNA does not encode for proteins and is not transcribed into RNA. It includes regulatory elements, such as enhancers and silencers, that control gene expression, as well as structural elements, such as telomeres and centromeres.2. Single-copy DNA: This type of non-repetitive DNA exists as single copies in the genome and includes genes that encode for proteins, as well as functional RNA molecules, such as transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Single-copy DNA is typically conserved across species and often reflects important biological functions.
