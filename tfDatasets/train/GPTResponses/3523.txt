There is no definitive answer to the question of how many Japanese emigrated to the Marshall Islands during the time when it was under Japanese colonial rule. However, it is estimated that several hundred Japanese nationals lived on the islands during this period, primarily working in industries such as fishing, agriculture, and construction. The exact number is difficult to determine due to limited records and the fact that many Japanese settlers may not have been officially registered with colonial authorities.
