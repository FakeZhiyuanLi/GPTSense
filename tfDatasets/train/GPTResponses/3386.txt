Mandarin and Cantonese are often not considered dialects because they are mutually unintelligible, meaning that speakers of one language cannot understand or communicate with speakers of the other language. Dialects, on the other hand, are typically variations or regional forms of the same language and are mutually intelligible to some extent. Additionally, Mandarin and Cantonese have distinct differences in their grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation, making them more akin to separate languages rather than dialects of the same language. Lastly, Mandarin and Cantonese have their own writing systems, further emphasizing their distinct linguistic identities.
