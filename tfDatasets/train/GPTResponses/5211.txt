The Legend of Zelda required various weapons and tools to kill enemies in certain instances, such as bombs to blow up obstacles or enemies, arrows to defeat flying enemies or hit switches from a distance, the boomerang to stun enemies and collect items from afar, and the hookshot to reach distant areas and grab enemies or items. Each dungeon would often introduce a new tool or weapon and require the player to use it in creative ways to solve puzzles and defeat bosses.
