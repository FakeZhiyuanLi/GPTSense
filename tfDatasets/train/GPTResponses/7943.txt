There is no set amount of water that should be taken in for each calorie of food that is consumed. However, a general guideline is to consume at least 8-ounce glasses of water per day, which is equivalent to 64 fluid ounces or 1.9 liters. Additionally, the amount of water needed may vary based on individual factors such as age, gender, physical activity level, and climate. It is important to listen to your body's thirst cues and consume enough water to stay hydrated.
