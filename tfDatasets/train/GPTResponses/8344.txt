Another argument against affirmative action is that it may result in reverse discrimination against members of non-minority groups who may be equally qualified for the position or opportunity but were not selected due to their race, ethnicity or gender. This can lead to resentment and a decreased sense of fairness among non-minority individuals. Additionally, some argue that affirmative action programs can create a culture of entitlement and dependency, where individuals from minority groups may come to expect special treatment or lowered standards, rather than striving for excellence on their own merit.
