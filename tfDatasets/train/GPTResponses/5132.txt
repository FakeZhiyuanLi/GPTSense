The usual condition of precipitation in the Antarctic is snow. The continent is covered in a thick ice sheet formed by gradual accumulation and compaction of snow over thousands of years. The snowfall is generally light, averaging around 2 inches per year in some areas, and some parts have received no measurable precipitation for decades. However, the coastal regions of the continent receive slightly higher amounts of snowfall compared to the interior. The extreme cold and dry climate in the Antarctic means that precipitation rarely falls as rain, and any liquid precipitation freezes instantly upon impact with the ground.
