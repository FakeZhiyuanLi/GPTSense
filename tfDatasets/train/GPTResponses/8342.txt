The geological theory that was applied to the Paris Basin is the theory of sedimentary formation. The Paris Basin is a sedimentary basin that was formed during the Paleogene period, about 60 million years ago. It was formed by the deposition of sediment layers on top of each other, which accumulated over time to create the basin. This process of sedimentation was caused by the erosion of land in the surrounding areas, which washed sediment into the basin. As the sediment layers built up, they compacted and hardened into rock, forming the various layers of sedimentary rock that make up the basin today.
