The color created when copper and aluminum are combined depends on the proportion of the two metals and the surface treatment. Generally, the alloys of copper and aluminum have a golden-yellow or brownish color, similar to brass or bronze. However, the color may also vary depending on the other elements and impurities present in the mixture, as well as the finishing processes like polishing, anodizing, or plating.
