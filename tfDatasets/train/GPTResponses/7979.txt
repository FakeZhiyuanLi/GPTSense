The term "mineral" was originally meant to describe any substance that was obtained from mines, whether it was a naturally occurring substance found in the Earth's crust or a man-made product. However, over time, the meaning of the term has evolved to refer specifically to naturally occurring inorganic substances with a defined chemical formula and crystalline structure.
