The United States has been phasing out traditional incandescent light bulbs since 2012. This is due to energy efficiency regulations that aim to reduce energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions. New federal energy efficiency standards, which began to take effect in 2012, essentially banned the sale of incandescent bulbs that fail to meet certain efficiency standards. This has led to a shift towards energy-efficient lighting options such as LED and CFL bulbs, which use significantly less energy than traditional incandescent bulbs.
