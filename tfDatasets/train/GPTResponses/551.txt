Noticing and documenting genocide is a commitment to the field of forensic anthropology. Forensic anthropologists use their knowledge of human anatomy and biology to identify human remains and provide evidence to support legal investigations, including cases of genocide. This work is crucial in ensuring that genocide is recognized and punished, and that the victims of such atrocities are given proper recognition and justice.
