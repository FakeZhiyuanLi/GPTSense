The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 limited the number and size of battleships, cruisers, and aircraft carriers that the United States, Great Britain, Japan, France, and Italy could possess. It also established a ratio of tonnage for each country's Navy. Additionally, the treaty prohibited the construction of new naval bases or the fortification of existing ones in the Pacific, except for the US and Japan, which were allowed to maintain their existing bases. The aim of the treaty was to prevent an arms race among the major naval powers and to promote peaceful relations among nations.
