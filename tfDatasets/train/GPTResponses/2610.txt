people use to work together towards achieving common goals. When corruption occurs and public offices become tools for private gain, people lose faith in the government's ability to act in their best interest. This leads to a breakdown in communication, trust, and collaboration, which in turn hinders the government's capacity to effectively deliver essential services and address societal problems. Corruption also diverts resources from important public services and infrastructure projects, and thus further undermines government capacity. Ultimately, corruption weakens the state's ability to function as a legitimate institution, and this has serious implications for democracy and the rule of law.
