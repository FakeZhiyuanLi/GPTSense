During the War of 1812, the Russian army used a scorched earth tactic, which involved burning and destroying everything in their path as they retreated. This made it difficult for the French army to find food, as they were marching through areas where all the crops and supplies had been destroyed. Additionally, the Russian army also employed guerrilla warfare tactics, ambushing and attacking the French supply lines, further restricting their access to food and resources.
