The bits and bytes are transmitted through various communication channels such as copper wires, fiber optic cables, wireless signals, and satellite transmissions. The bits are transmitted in a sequential order as electrical signals or optical pulses. These signals are then received and processed by various electronic devices such as computers, routers, and modems. The transmission of bits and bytes can either be synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the communication protocol that is being used. Overall, the transmission of bits and bytes is essential for the transfer of digital information over networks and the internet.
