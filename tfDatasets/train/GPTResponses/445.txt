Athletes wearing any kind of political flag at any Olympic venue faced the possibility of expulsion from the Olympics. This is because the Olympic Games are meant to be apolitical, and the display of any political symbols or messages is prohibited. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) strictly enforces this rule, and any athlete who violates it can be penalized or even banned from participating in the Games.
