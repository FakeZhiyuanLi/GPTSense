Affirmative action also focuses on promoting diversity and equal opportunity in education institutions, government agencies, and other areas of public life. This involves taking measures to ensure that people from diverse backgrounds and underrepresented groups have access to opportunities and resources that have historically been denied to them. This can include initiatives such as outreach programs, scholarships, and quotas to increase the representation of minority groups in various settings.
