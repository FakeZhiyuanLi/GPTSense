In response to the Elixir Sulfanilamide incident, Congress passed the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) of 1938, which established the modern system of drug regulation in the United States. This law required that new drugs be tested for safety before they could be marketed and also required that drug manufacturers provide evidence of their efficacy. It also required drug labels to provide accurate information about the contents, dosage, and potential side effects of a drug. This law remains the foundation of the U.S. drug regulation system.
