Gorbachev was not trying to separate anything. He is known for his efforts to reform the Soviet Union and improve its economy and political system through policies of glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring). However, his reforms inadvertently led to the separation of some Soviet republics and the eventual dissolution of the Soviet Union.
