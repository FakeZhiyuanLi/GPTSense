The sailors were introduced to citrus fruits such as lemons and limes on a molecular level which prevented them from contracting scurvy. These fruits contain high levels of vitamin C which is necessary for the production of collagen, a protein that is crucial for the health of connective tissues in the body. The lack of vitamin C in the diet leads to the breakdown of collagen and the development of scurvy. The introduction of citrus fruits provided the sailors with an adequate amount of vitamin C, which prevented the onset of scurvy.
