If the Senate approves a law after receiving it from the House of Representatives, the final version of the bill is written and sent to the President for signing or veto. This final version will contain any amendments or changes made during the Senate's review and approval process. Once the President signs the bill, it becomes law and is published as such in the Federal Register.
