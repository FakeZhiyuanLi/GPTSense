The river Ill in Strasbourg is connected to the River Rhine through a series of canals known as the Canal de la Marne au Rhin and the Canal du Rhone au Rhine. These canals allow boats to travel from the river Ill to the River Rhine, and vice versa, without having to navigate through the city center.
