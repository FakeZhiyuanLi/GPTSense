Reverse migration is the phenomenon of people returning to their place of origin or ancestral home country from their current country of residence. It is the opposite of regular migration, which involves moving from one country to another. Reverse migration may occur for various reasons, such as economic, social, or political factors, and can have significant impacts on both the origin and destination countries.
