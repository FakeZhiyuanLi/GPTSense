Mauretania existed during the ancient period, from approximately 300 BC to the 7th century AD. The region referred to as Mauretania included parts of modern-day Morocco, Algeria, and western Sahara. The kingdom of Mauretania was ruled by indigenous Berber tribes before being conquered by the Romans in 33 BC. It later became a Roman province before being invaded by Arab Muslims in the 7th century AD.
