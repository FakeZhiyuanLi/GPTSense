There are several types of regulations that can make corruption worse for public spending:1. Lack of transparency: When there is no clear and open system of reporting and oversight for government spending, it becomes easier for officials to engage in corrupt practices like embezzlement or kickbacks.2. Weak accountability mechanisms: If there are no strong and independent institutions responsible for enforcing anti-corruption measures, officials may feel emboldened to engage in corrupt activities without fear of punishment or consequences.3. Complex and burdensome regulations: Overly complicated or unclear regulations can create opportunities for officials to misuse government resources or award contracts to favored individuals or companies.4. Limited public participation: When the public is excluded from decision-making processes around government spending, it becomes easier for officials to engage in corruption behind closed doors.Overall, any regulation that creates opportunities for secrecy, lack of accountability, or unclear processes can contribute to corruption in public spending.
