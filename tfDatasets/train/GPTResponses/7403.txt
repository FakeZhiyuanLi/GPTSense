DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) is a persistent organic pollutant that accumulates in the fatty tissues of living organisms, a phenomenon known as bioaccumulation. The quality that causes DDT to build up in various organisms is its lipophilicity, meaning it has an affinity for fat, oil, and other lipid-based substances. DDT is also very stable and does not easily break down into harmless substances. As a result, DDT accumulates in the bodies of organisms as they ingest food and water containing the chemical. This process can result in high levels of DDT in the tissues of top predators at the apex of food chains, such as eagles and other birds of prey, which can have harmful effects on their health and survival.
