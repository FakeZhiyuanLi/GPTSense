Prior to 2003, mortgage originators were policed by various regulatory agencies such as the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Federal Reserve System (FRS), and state banking regulators. These agencies were responsible for maintaining relatively high standards for mortgage origination and ensuring compliance with federal and state laws and regulations. Additionally, mortgage lenders and banks were required to follow guidelines established by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two government-sponsored enterprises that securitized a large portion of the mortgages originated in the United States.
