The new African American identity was defined through a process of cultural, social, and political changes that occurred during the 20th century Civil Rights Movement. This new identity was characterized by a rejection of racial stereotypes, advocacy for equal rights and opportunities, and a celebration of African American culture and heritage. It was also shaped by the influence of prominent figures such as Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, and other civil rights leaders who fought for racial equality and justice. The new African American identity represented a significant shift in the way African Americans saw themselves and their place in American society. It reflected a sense of pride and resilience in the face of discrimination and oppression, as well as a desire for full and equal participation in American democracy.
