Systems with no MCU would typically use a peer-to-peer approach to perform multipoint conferencing. In this approach, individual endpoints would directly communicate with one another, without the need for a centralized control unit like an MCU. This approach can work for smaller conferences with a limited number of participants, but it becomes increasingly complex and difficult to manage as the number of participants grows. As a result, MCU-based systems are more commonly used for larger-scale multipoint conferencing.
