There is no recorded invitation from any Mexican official or government representative to Canadian citizens during the Mexican Revolution to resettle in Mexico. However, some Canadian individuals and organizations, such as the Mennonite Central Committee and the Mormon Church, independently established colonies in Mexico during the 1920s and 1930s. These groups sought to escape poverty, religious persecution, or conscription during World War I.
