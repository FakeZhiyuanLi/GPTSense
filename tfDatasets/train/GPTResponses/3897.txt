The three digestion phases are:1) The cephalic phase, which initiates digestion through the sensory inputs such as sight, smell, taste, and chewing. This also triggers the release of digestive enzymes and hormones.2) The gastric phase, which occurs in the stomach and involves the release of gastric juices, acids, and enzymes to break down food further.3) The intestinal phase, which occurs in the small intestine where food is further broken down and nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream. Hormones are also released to regulate digestion and absorption.
