are known as synagogue temples. These temples served as places of worship, study, and community gatherings for the Jewish population. They were often beautifully decorated and featured intricate designs and artwork that reflected the cultural and religious identities of the local Jewish communities. These synagogues played a vital role in Jewish life in the region, providing a space for those of the same faith to gather, socialize, and support one another. Today, many of these historic synagogues still stand, serving as a testament to the rich and diverse history of the Jewish community in Pannonia.
