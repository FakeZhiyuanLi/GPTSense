Until 1987, the Muslim Brotherhood in Palestine, also known as Hamas, took a hostile stance towards Israel and supported armed resistance against Israeli occupation. The group's founding charter in 1988 explicitly called for the destruction of Israel and the establishment of a Palestinian state in its place.
