A secondary sex characteristic change is a physical trait that develops during puberty as a result of hormonal changes, which distinguishes males from females. These changes include the growth of breasts in females, a deepening of the voice and increased muscle mass in males, growth of pubic and underarm hair, and the onset of menstruation in females. These changes are not directly involved in reproduction but help to define the physical appearance and functioning of males and females.
