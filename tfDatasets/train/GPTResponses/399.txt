Unglazed transpired collectors are a type of solar collector that is designed to absorb and transfer heat from sunlight without the need for any type of glazing or sealed enclosure. These collectors typically consist of a series of perforated metal panels that are mounted onto a building's exterior walls or roof. As sunlight passes through the perforations in the panels, it heats up the air flowing behind them. This warm air is then drawn into the building's ventilation system, where it can be used to supplement the heating and cooling needs of the interior space. Unglazed transpired collectors are a relatively low-cost and low-maintenance way to harness solar energy and can contribute to significant energy savings over time.
