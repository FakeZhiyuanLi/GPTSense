This is called the "one-drop rule" or "hypodescent." It is a historical practice in the United States in which individuals with any amount of African ancestry were classified as "black" or "Negro" regardless of their appearance or self-identification. This practice was used during segregation to enforce racial discrimination and control the population of African descendants. It was also linked to the concept of white supremacy and the notion of purity of race.
