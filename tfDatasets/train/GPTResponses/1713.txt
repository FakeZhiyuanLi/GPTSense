The main component of the Marshall Islands' economy is government assistance, primarily in the form of grants and subsidies from the United States government. Additionally, the fishing industry plays a significant role in the economy, with tuna being the primary export. Tourism and agriculture also contribute to the economy, but to a lesser extent.
