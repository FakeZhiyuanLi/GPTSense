High energy magnets are typically made of rare earth elements such as neodymium, samarium, and dysprosium. These elements have strong magnetic properties due to their electron configuration and allow for powerful and efficient magnets to be produced. The magnets are often coated with materials such as nickel or zinc to protect the surface and prevent corrosion.
