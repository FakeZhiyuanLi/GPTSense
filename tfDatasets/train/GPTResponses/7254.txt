Yes, several elections have been held in Burma (also known as Myanmar) since the military coup in 1988. However, these elections have been highly controversial, with accusations of fraud and manipulation by the military, and have not been recognized by all political parties and international observers as free and fair. The most recent election was held in November 2020, which resulted in a victory for the National League for Democracy (NLD) led by Aung San Suu Kyi. However, on February 1, 2021, the military staged another coup and declared a state of emergency, leading to the arrest of Suu Kyi and other NLD officials.
