There are varying accounts of how much distance separated the wings of the Grande Armée at Donauwörth, but most sources estimate that it was around 40-50 kilometers. This wide separation between the wings of the army made it difficult for them to coordinate and communicate effectively, which ultimately contributed to their defeat at the Battle of Austerlitz.
