RNA-mediated epigenetic inheritance has been observed in various organisms, including:1. Fungi: RNA molecules called prions can act as epigenetic factors and transmit traits between generations. For example, the yeast prion called [PSI+] is responsible for heritable changes in translational fidelity.2. Plants: RNA molecules known as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) can act as heritable epigenetic factors that regulate gene expression. In some cases, siRNAs can be transmitted between generations via the germline.3. Insects: RNA interference (RNAi) can also be involved in epigenetic inheritance in insects. For example, RNAi can silence genes in a heritable manner in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.4. Mammals: Recently, evidence has emerged that RNA molecules can also act as epigenetic factors in mammals. Small noncoding RNAs called piRNAs are involved in regulating transposable elements and maintaining genome stability, and they may be involved in epigenetic inheritance. Additionally, RNA molecules can also regulate gene expression through the process of RNA editing or through the action of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs).
