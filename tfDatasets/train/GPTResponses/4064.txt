The model that describes the opposite of approach as unmoving but with resistance and strength is the "immovable object" model. This describes an object or situation that remains steadfast and unyielding, even in the face of external forces. It represents the idea of strength and resistance without aggression or movement towards an opposing force, in contrast to the "unstoppable force" model which represents forward motion and relentless progress.
