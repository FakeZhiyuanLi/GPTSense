One example of an emotion that is not the same from one case to another under psychological construction theory is fear. Fear can be constructed differently based on an individual's past experiences, cultural and environmental factors, and other personal factors. For example, someone who has had a traumatic experience with dogs may have a different construction of fear towards them compared to someone who has had positive experiences with dogs. Additionally, cultural factors such as beliefs and norms can also impact how fear is constructed for individuals. Therefore, fear may differ in intensity, trigger, and duration among different individuals due to their unique psychological construction.
