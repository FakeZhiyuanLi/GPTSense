A bolt can prevent an aircraft from flying safely if it is a critical component of the aircraft structure or engine. It can also cause damage to other components or systems if it becomes loose or dislodged during flight. If a bolt fails or is missing, it can cause vibrations, loss of control, or even catastrophic failure. Therefore, it is crucial to regularly inspect and maintain bolts and fasteners on an aircraft, following the manufacturer's recommendations and industry standards.
