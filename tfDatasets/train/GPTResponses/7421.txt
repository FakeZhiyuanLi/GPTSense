A stepper system achieves stability by using a closed-loop control system. The system has an encoder that measures the position of the motor's rotor and sends signals to the controller to adjust the motor's movement. The controller determines the required voltage and current required to produce the desired movement and sends it to the motor. The system constantly monitors and adjusts the motor's movement to ensure that it follows the desired path without any deviations. This closed-loop control system maintains a stable and accurate movement of the motor, ensuring that it performs its intended function precisely without any fluctuations. Overall, the stepper system's stability comes from sophisticated control algorithms that keep the motor moving precisely to meet the desired output requirements.
