The feature of written text that influenced the use of scripts is its ability to preserve information and ideas over time. With the development of writing, people realized that they could create permanent records of their thoughts and experiences. This led to the evolution of scripts, which allowed people to document not only their own language but also those of other cultures. Scripts also enabled the dissemination of information and ideas across vast distances, making communication easier and more efficient. As a result, scripts played a crucial role in the development of human civilization, facilitating education, trade, and cultural exchange.
