There are several indications that Athanasius was familiar with ancient Greek philosophers:1. In his work, "Contra Gentiles," Athanasius frequently references the ideas of Plato, Aristotle, and other Greek philosophers.2. In his "Letter to Marcellinus," Athanasius suggests that the knowledge and wisdom of the Greek philosophers were ultimately incomplete without the revelation of God in Christ.3. Athanasius discusses the nature of God and the relationship between God and humanity in a way that shows an understanding of the philosophical debates of his time, which were greatly influenced by ancient Greek philosophy.4. Athanasius also makes use of philosophical terminology and concepts, such as "essence" and "substance," which were central to the philosophical discussions of his day.Overall, these indications suggest that Athanasius not only had a passing familiarity with ancient Greek philosophy but also engaged with it in a significant way in his theological and philosophical writings.
