The invention that led to an increase in efficiency in the farming of heavy soils is the moldboard plow. This plow was designed to turn over heavy soils, which would break up large clumps of soil and bring fresh, nutrient-rich soil to the surface. The moldboard plow helped farmers increase crop yields by improving seedbed preparation and reducing soil erosion.
