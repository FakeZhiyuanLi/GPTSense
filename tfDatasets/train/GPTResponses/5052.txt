There are known oil and gas deposits near Antarctica, but they are located in areas that have not yet been fully explored and are subject to strict environmental regulations. The most promising areas for oil and gas exploration are in the Southern Ocean and the Weddell Sea, but there are also potential reserves in the Ross Sea and the Antarctic Peninsula region. However, due to the fragile and unique environment of Antarctica, any extraction activities would require careful consideration of the potential impact on the ecosystem and wildlife.
