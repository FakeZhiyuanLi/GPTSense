American military involvement in Vietnam ramped up in the early 1960s, with the deployment of military advisors and the increase of military aid to South Vietnam. The first large-scale deployment of U.S. combat troops occurred in 1965, after the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution was passed by Congress, which gave President Lyndon B. Johnson broad authority to use military force in Vietnam.
