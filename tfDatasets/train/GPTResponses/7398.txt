1. Voltage: Servo motor performance is directly proportional to the voltage supplied to it. As the voltage is the primary driving factor, if the voltage is lower than the required voltage, the servo motors will not be able to deliver its maximum performance.2. Heat: Excessive heat generated during the operation can lead to low performance or even damage in servo motors. Thus, servo motors should not operate continuously for long durations at higher loads.3. Load Capacity: The performance of a servo motor is dependent on the load capacity it can handle. If an overloaded load is attached, the servo motor will show poor performance.4. Environmental factors: Extreme temperature or humidity can also limit the performance of a servo motor. For example, if the motor is being used in a very hot or humid environment, it may overheat or malfunction.5. Mechanical failure: Any mechanical damage or malfunction, such as a damaged bearing or corroded shaft, can compromise the performance of the servo motor.6. Control signal: The performance of a servo motor can also be limited due to a weak or poor quality control signal, which can lead to poor accuracy and stability of the motor.
