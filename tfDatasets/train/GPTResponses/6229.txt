The chromosome responsible for producing male differentiation in cases of female developmental defects is the Y chromosome. The Y chromosome carries the SRY (sex-determining region Y) gene, which triggers the development of male gonads (testes) during embryonic development. Without the presence of the SRY gene, the default pathway for gonadal development in humans is the female pathway, resulting in the development of ovaries.
