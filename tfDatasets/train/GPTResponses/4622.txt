Yes, there were campaigns to encourage minorities to accurately report their race data in the 2010 census. These campaigns were aimed at ensuring that historically undercounted minority communities were properly represented and received their fair share of government funding and resources. Organizations like the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO) and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) ran outreach efforts and educational campaigns to encourage participation in the census and accurate reporting of race and ethnicity data.
