There are various technologies used to harness solar energy from the sun. Some of these technologies include:1. Photovoltaic (PV) cells: These are the most common technology used for converting sunlight into electricity. PV cells are made from semiconducting materials such as silicon and can be found in solar panels.2. Concentrated solar power (CSP): This technology uses mirrors or lenses to focus the sun's rays onto a small area, where it heats up a fluid, which is then used to generate electricity.3. Solar thermal collectors: These are used to capture solar heat and convert it into thermal energy that can be used for heating water or space.4. Passive solar design: This involves designing buildings to capture and use solar energy for heating, cooling and lighting.5. Solar cookers: These are simple devices that use solar energy to cook food.6. Solar water heaters: Solar water heaters use the sun's energy to heat water for domestic use.7. Solar pumps: These are used in agriculture and for providing water in remote areas, harnessing the power of the sun to pump water.8. Solar-powered cars: These use solar panels to convert sunlight into electricity that powers the car.
