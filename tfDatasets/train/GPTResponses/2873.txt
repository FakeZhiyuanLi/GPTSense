Prosody: the patterns of stress, rhythm, intonation, and pitch that structure speech3. Morphophonology: the interaction between morphemes (the smallest units of meaning in a language) and their phonological representation4. Allophones: the variations in the pronunciation of a phoneme that occur due to contextual factors such as neighboring sounds or stress patterns5. Phonological processes: the systematic patterns of sound changes that occur in a language over time, such as assimilation, deletion, or metathesis.
