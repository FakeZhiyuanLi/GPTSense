Portugal never became a part of the Umayyad Caliphate's empire. The Umayyad Caliphate ruled over parts of present-day Spain from 711 AD to 756 AD, but they did not conquer Portugal. The first Muslim presence in Portugal dates back to the 8th century, but it was not until 711 AD that Muslim forces began to occupy the Iberian Peninsula. Portugal remained under Christian rule during the Umayyad Caliphate's empire.
