If other parties fail to explicitly disavow a party's initially unilateral interpretation of a treaty, it may imply that they implicitly accept or agree with that interpretation. This can lead to a shift in the balance of power and can create tensions or conflicts between the parties involved. It is essential for all parties to clarify their position and interpretations to avoid miscommunication and to ensure that the treaty is being upheld correctly.
