In ancient times, expenses during travels or the royal courts would be paid for by the monarch, the ruler, or the royal treasury. The traveling party, including attendants and officials, would be provided with food, shelter, and other necessary items by the host kingdom or the king or queen. In modern times, expenses are usually paid from state or government funds, or by the monarch or the royal family themselves. In some cases, such as official state visits, the host country may also bear some of the costs.
