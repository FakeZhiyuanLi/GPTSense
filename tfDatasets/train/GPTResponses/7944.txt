It is not specified in the prompt which executive order is being referred to, so I cannot provide a specific answer. However, in general, individuals or organizations who are affected by an executive order may file complaints quickly after it is implemented if they believe it is unconstitutional, violates their rights, or has other negative consequences. This could include civil rights groups, immigration advocacy organizations, affected individuals or families, and others.
