Hellenistic poets wished to court the favor of the rulers and wealthy patrons of their time, as well as the wider public audience. They often wrote about the lives and lifestyles of the elite, and used their poetry as a means of social and political commentary. Additionally, they sometimes borrowed from earlier Greek literature, adapting it to their own purposes, and sought to engage in literary rivalries with one another to gain fame and recognition.
