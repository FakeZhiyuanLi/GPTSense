The ancient border between Lancashire and Yorkshire is not clearly defined as it has changed many times over the centuries. However, it is generally considered to follow the Pennine Hills, which means that areas like Manchester and Liverpool are considered to be in Lancashire, while Wakefield and Sheffield are in Yorkshire.
