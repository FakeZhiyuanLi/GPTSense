Corruption raises the cost of business in various sectors such as government contracts, procurement, licensing, permits, and regulations. It can also affect the private sector by inflating the cost of goods and services, leading to unfair competition, and decreasing the quality of products and services. Additionally, corruption can increase the costs of legal and financial services, increase the cost of advertising, and hinder the growth of small and medium enterprises.
