The Ottoman Empire lost most of its territory after World War I and the Treaty of SÃ¨vres in 1920. However, after the Turkish War of Independence, the Treaty of Lausanne was signed in 1923, recognizing the modern Republic of Turkey and defining its borders. Constantinople (now Istanbul) and Eastern Thrace were the only territories retained by Turkey from the former Ottoman Empire.
