Genetic recombination, which is the exchange of genetic material by crossing over between homologous chromosomes during meiosis, leads to the formation of new combinations of alleles on the chromatids. If the alleles on the chromatids are different, genetic recombination can increase genetic diversity and variability within a population. This can lead to the formation of new traits and adaptations, which can confer a selective advantage to individuals in changing environments. Therefore, genetic recombination plays a crucial role in evolution by increasing the genetic diversity of populations, which provides the raw material for natural selection to act upon.
