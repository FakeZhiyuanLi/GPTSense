One indirect benefit of DST that might cause some areas to observe it even though they don't get any direct benefits like cost or energy savings is the social aspect. Since many regions observe DST, it can create a sense of unity and conformity. People from these areas may feel connected to others who observe DST, even if they don't directly benefit from it. Additionally, DST can create a sense of anticipation and excitement for the summer months, leading to increased outdoor activities and social events. Therefore, even if there are no direct cost or energy savings, some areas may choose to observe DST for the social and cultural benefits it provides.
