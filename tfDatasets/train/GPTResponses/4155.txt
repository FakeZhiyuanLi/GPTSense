The Church of Alexandria used the Alexandrian computus, a mathematical system based on the Metonic cycle, to calculate the date of Easter. This system involved using a 19-year lunar cycle and a 28-year solar cycle to determine the date of the full moon after the Spring Equinox, which in turn was used to set the date for Easter. The Alexandrian computus was widely adopted throughout the Eastern Orthodox Church as well as among some Christian communities in the West.
