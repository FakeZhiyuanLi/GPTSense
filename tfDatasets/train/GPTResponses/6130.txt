Exclusive jurisdiction refers to a situation in which a court or other legal authority has sole authority over a particular case or legal matter. This means that no other court or legal authority has the power to hear or decide the case, and that the court or authority with exclusive jurisdiction has complete control over the proceedings. This can occur for a variety of reasons, such as when a particular court has been designated as the only one with the necessary expertise to handle a specific type of case, or when a certain legal issue can only be addressed by a particular court or authority.
