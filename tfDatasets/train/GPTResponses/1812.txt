The early settlers of the Marshall Islands used canoes called outrigger canoes for their travels. These canoes were made from tree trunks and had small platforms attached to them for stability. The outrigger, which is a long stick attached to the side of the canoe, provided extra balance and allowed the canoe to travel farther distances out at sea. The Marshall Islanders were skilled navigators and used the stars, currents, and wave patterns to guide them on their journeys.
