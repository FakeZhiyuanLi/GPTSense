There were numerous things that were measured in the early 20th century, including:1. Time: The measurement of time continued to evolve in the early 20th century with the development of more accurate and reliable clocks and watches.2. Distance: The early 20th century saw the advancement of transportation technology, which led to more precise measurements of distances traveled by means of automobiles, planes, and trains.3. Temperature: The measurement of temperature was another area that saw significant advances in the early 20th century with the invention of mercury and alcohol thermometers and the introduction of the Kelvin and Celsius temperature scales.4. Electric current: The early 20th century saw the development of more precise instruments for measuring electric current, such as the galvanometer and ammeter.5. Radioactivity: The discovery of radioactivity in the late 19th century continued to be an area of interest for scientists in the early 20th century, leading to the invention of the Geiger counter and other radiation measuring devices.6. Sound: The early 20th century saw the development of new technologies for measuring sound, including the oscilloscope and the electro-acoustic impedance meter.7. Blood pressure: The measurement of blood pressure continued to be an important area of medical research in the early 20th century, leading to the development of the sphygmomanometer.8. Atomic and molecular structure: The early 20th century saw great strides in the field of atomic and molecular structure, with the development of spectroscopy and other methods of measuring molecular interactions.
