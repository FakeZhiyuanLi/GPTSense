St. Dominic gave his followers the spirit of dedication to the Church, love for preaching and teaching, poverty, simplicity, and community living. They were encouraged to live a life of self-discipline, prayer, and study, and to share the Gospel with all people. The Dominicans were known for their intellectual prowess, and were instrumental in countering the heresy of the time through their preaching and writing.
