Linguistic anthropology brings linguistic methods to bear on a range of problems related to language and communication in human societies. These problems may include:1. Language variation and change: Linguistic anthropologists study how language varies within and across different societies, how it changes over time, and how it is influenced by factors such as social class, gender, and ethnicity.2. Language and identity: Linguistic anthropologists examine how language use reflects and shapes individual and group identities, and how language may be used to express or challenge social norms and power relations.3. Language and social inequality: Linguistic anthropologists investigate how language is implicated in social inequality, including issues of language policy and language education, social stigma and discrimination, and language rights.4. Language and cultural transmission: Linguistic anthropologists study how linguistic and cultural knowledge is transmitted across generations, and how this process is influenced by social and cultural factors.5. Language and cognition: Linguistic anthropologists examine how language use shapes cognitive processes, such as perception, memory, and reasoning, and how these processes are related to cultural practices and beliefs.6. Language and technology: Linguistic anthropologists investigate the role of language and communication technologies, such as social media and mobile phones, in shaping social interactions, relationships, and cultural practices.
