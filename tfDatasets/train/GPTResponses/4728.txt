The Chinese PLA Navy needed 4-5 years for the Liaoning aircraft carrier to reach full capacity because it was a refurbished Soviet-era carrier, and the PLA lacked experience in operating such complex systems. Additionally, the PLA had to develop new technologies, such as advanced aircraft and weapons systems, to be deployed on the carrier. The process also involved extensive training and testing of the carrier's crew and aviation personnel. It takes time to develop the necessary infrastructure, logistics, and support facilities to operate such a large warship, including training facilities, maintenance teams, and repair workshops. Overall, it was a complex process that required significant investment, expertise, and time.
