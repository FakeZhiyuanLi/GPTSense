Cultural transitions into adulthood can vary significantly across different societies and cultures. Different cultures have different expectations and norms regarding what it means to be an adult, what milestones individuals typically achieve as they transition into adulthood, and what responsibilities and privileges come with adulthood. For example, in some cultures, individuals are expected to leave home and become financially independent by a certain age, while in others, it is common for multiple generations to live together and support each other. Similarly, in some cultures, marriage and parenthood are seen as central to entering adulthood, while in others, completing education or achieving certain professional goals may be more important. Therefore, cultural transitions into adulthood are not the same across all societies and cultures.
