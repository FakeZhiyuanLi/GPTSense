The measure of pesticides determined in EPA studies is typically the concentration or amount of the pesticide present in environmental samples such as air, water, soil, or food. This is often reported in units such as parts per billion (ppb) or parts per million (ppm). The EPA may also measure the toxicity of pesticides through laboratory studies or field experiments to assess potential risks to human health and the environment.
