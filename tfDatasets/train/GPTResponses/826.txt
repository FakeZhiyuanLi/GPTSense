Buddha himself. This is particularly true for the Lotus Sutra, which is seen as the ultimate teaching of the Buddha and contains the essential teachings of Mahayana Buddhism. The Lotus Sutra is believed to be a direct revelation of the Buddha's enlightenment and is commonly referred to as the "Seed of Buddhahood". Thus, for Mahayana Buddhists, the teachings of the Lotus Sutra are a manifestation of the Buddha himself, and are therefore considered to be of the utmost importance for achieving enlightenment.
