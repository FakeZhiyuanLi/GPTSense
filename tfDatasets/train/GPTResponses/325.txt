A passive solar technique is a method of utilizing the sun's energy to heat and cool a building without the use of mechanical or electrical devices. This method involves designing a building in such a way that it can naturally absorb, store, and distribute the sun's energy. It typically involves the placement and orientation of windows, walls, and roofs to maximize the collection of sunlight in winter and to minimize it in summer. This technique can reduce energy consumption and costs by relying on natural means to regulate the temperature inside a building.
