Edward abdicated the throne on December 11, 1936, following his proposal to Wallis Simpson, a twice-divorced American socialite. The British government and the Church of England were strongly against the marriage and it was considered socially and politically unacceptable for a British monarch to marry a divorcee. Consequently, Edward chose to abdicate in order to marry Simpson. He was succeeded on the throne by his younger brother, George VI.
