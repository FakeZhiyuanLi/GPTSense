English freemasonry arrived in France in the early 18th century. The first recorded lodge in France was established in Dunkirk in 1721 by English traders who were stationed there. Freemasonry quickly spread to other parts of France, including Paris, where the first Grand Lodge was founded in 1733. However, the French Masonic tradition also developed its own unique character and practices over time.
