Humans have been impacting the delta since ancient times through activities such as fishing, agriculture, and settlement. However, significant and rapid changes began with the Industrial Revolution in the 1800s and intensified in the 20th century with the increase in industrialization, urbanization, and population growth. Dams, levees, and other engineering projects have also had a significant impact on the delta and its natural processes. These actions have altered the flow and distribution of water, increased erosion and sedimentation, and disrupted the natural balance of the ecosystem.
