The purpose of the Three Gorges Dam is to provide hydroelectric power and flood control for the Yangtze River in China. The dam is the world's largest hydroelectric power station, with a capacity of over 22,000 megawatts. It also helps to control flooding in the downstream areas of the river, which have historically been prone to devastating floods. Additionally, the Three Gorges Dam aids in water transportation and improves navigation along the Yangtze River.
