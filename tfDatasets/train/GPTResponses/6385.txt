Masons do not swear at each degree. They take oaths of secrecy and loyalty to the fraternity, as well as oaths to uphold certain ethical principles and virtues, but these oaths are not accompanied by swearing or cursing. The language used in Masonic rituals is formal and respectful, and members are expected to treat each other with the utmost respect and dignity.
