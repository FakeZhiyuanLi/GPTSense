There are likely many individuals who left Guinea-Bissau after it gained independence, as people may have had various reasons for leaving, such as seeking better economic opportunities or political instability. Some notable individuals who left the country after independence include former President Luís Cabral, who went into exile in Cuba following a military coup in 1980, and Amílcar Cabral, a revolutionary leader and founder of the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC), who was assassinated in 1973 before independence was achieved.
