The Ferranti Mark 1, also known as the Manchester Electronic Computer (MEC), was developed by Ferranti Ltd. in Manchester, England. It was not sent anywhere after its development, as it was installed and used at the University of Manchester where it became the world's first commercially available general-purpose computer.
