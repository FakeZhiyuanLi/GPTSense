The timing of council elections varies depending on the jurisdiction. In some countries, such as the United States, council elections may be held in different months within the same year depending on the state, county, or municipality. In other countries, such as Australia and the United Kingdom, council elections are typically held on a fixed date every few years, with different jurisdictions often holding their elections on different dates. It's best to check the election schedule for your specific location to determine when council elections are held.
