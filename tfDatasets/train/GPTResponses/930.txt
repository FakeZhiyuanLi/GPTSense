The property that is important to manufacturers who use "second-growth" hardwood is its strength and durability. Second-growth hardwood is typically younger and smaller than old-growth hardwood, which means it may be less dense and have more imperfections. However, if properly harvested and managed, second-growth hardwood can still provide a strong and durable material for use in manufacturing. This is especially important for manufacturers who want to use sustainable and environmentally responsible materials in their products.
