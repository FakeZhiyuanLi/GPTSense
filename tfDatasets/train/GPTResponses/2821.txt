expands upon or modifies specific provisions of the treaty. A protocol is considered a binding agreement under international law and is usually negotiated and adopted by countries that are parties to the original treaty. Protocols can be used to address new issues or situations that were not originally covered by the treaty, or to update or clarify existing provisions. The process of adding a protocol to a treaty usually involves negotiation and ratification by the parties to the treaty.
