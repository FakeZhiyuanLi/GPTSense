During the Bosnian War, there were several types of assault, including armed attacks on civilian populations, mass killings, rape, forced displacement, and concentration camps. The conflict began in 1992 and ended in 1995, resulting in the deaths of around 100,000 people and the displacement of millions. The war was marked by widespread human rights abuses, particularly towards the Bosniak (Bosnian Muslim) population.
