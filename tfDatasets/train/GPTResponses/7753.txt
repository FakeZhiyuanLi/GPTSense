Sleep-and-charge USB ports are designed to charge devices even when the computer is in sleep mode or turned off. They can be used to charge devices such as smartphones, tablets, cameras, and other USB-powered devices. They can also be used to transfer data between devices. Some sleep-and-charge USB ports may have higher power output than other regular USB ports, which means they can charge devices faster.
