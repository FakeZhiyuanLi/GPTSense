Jewish law, also known as Halakha, has its origins in the Torah, the five books of Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy). The Torah contains the commandments and teachings that God gave to the Israelites at Mount Sinai.Over time, Jewish sages and rabbis continued to interpret and develop the law, adding their own insights and rulings. This led to the creation of the Talmud, a vast collection of Jewish teachings and commentary.Jewish law continues to evolve today through the work of modern rabbinic authorities, who interpret and apply the law to contemporary situations.
