There are several ideas and events that have contributed to politics covering a larger spectrum. Here are a few:1. Globalization: The increasing interconnectedness of the world has led to an expansion of political issues beyond national borders. Issues like international trade, climate change, and human rights now have global significance and require international cooperation to address.2. Identity politics: The rise of identity politics has brought new voices to the political landscape, with marginalized groups advocating for their rights and representation. This has broadened the political spectrum to include issues such as gender, race, sexual orientation, and religion.3. Social media and technology: The widespread use of social media has enabled people to connect and organize around shared political beliefs and causes. This has created new movements and organizations that are not beholden to traditional political parties or ideologies, and has expanded the political spectrum to include new voices and perspectives.4. Populism: Populist movements have emerged around the world, challenging the traditional political establishment and advocating for policies that appeal to a broader swath of the population. These movements often cut across traditional party lines and ideologies, creating a more diverse and complex political spectrum.
