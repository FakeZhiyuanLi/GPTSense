of transformation?Rotation matrix groups are utilized in computer graphics with the concept of transformation. They are used to represent and perform rotational transformations of objects in 2D and 3D space. By multiplying a vector representing an object by a rotation matrix, the object can be rotated around a fixed point or axis. This is an important concept in computer graphics for animating objects, creating realistic rendering, and creating special effects.
