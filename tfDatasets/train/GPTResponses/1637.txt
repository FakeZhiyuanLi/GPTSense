The level of corruption can vary in richer democracies in regards to the ethics and moral standards of those officials making decisions. It is possible for officials in rich democracies to engage in corrupt practices such as bribery, embezzlement, and favoritism, even though the country has strong governance institutions and laws in place to prevent corruption. However, corrupt practices are often more subtle and may involve exploiting legal loopholes, engaging in conflicts of interest, and using insider influence to benefit certain individuals or groups. The level of transparency and accountability in these countries can also impact the level of corruption, as more transparency and accountability measures can help to prevent and expose corrupt practices. Ultimately, the level of corruption in richer democracies is influenced by a variety of factors, including the moral and ethical values of officials, the strength of governance institutions and laws, and the level of transparency and accountability in the country.
