There were various forms of public transportation that preceded the current New Haven Division Bus Routes, such as:1. Horse-drawn streetcars: In the late 1800s and early 1900s, horse-drawn streetcars were a common mode of public transportation in New Haven. These small, open-air cars were pulled by horses and operated on rails embedded in the street.2. Electric streetcars: By the early 1900s, most of the horse-drawn streetcars had been replaced by electric streetcars. These cars were powered by electricity and operated on rails similar to the horse-drawn streetcars.3. Trolleybuses: In the 1930s, trolleybuses were introduced as a form of public transportation in New Haven. These buses were powered by overhead electric wires, similar to streetcars, but were more maneuverable and could operate on different routes.4. Gasoline-powered buses: The first gasoline-powered buses in New Haven were introduced in the 1920s, but it was not until the 1940s and 1950s that they became the dominant form of public transportation. These buses replaced the trolleybuses and were able to operate on more flexible routes.5. Commuter trains: In addition to buses and streetcars, commuter trains have been a staple of public transportation in New Haven for many years. The Metro-North Railroad, which operates commuter trains in and around New Haven, was established in the 1980s.
