The situated perspective was most strongly influenced by the cognitive school of thought in psychology. Specifically, this perspective emphasizes the importance of context and environment in shaping human cognition and behavior. This view contrasts with more traditional approaches that focus on internal mental processes or individual differences in personality or ability. The situated perspective suggests that behaviors and actions must be evaluated within their specific social and environmental context in order to be fully understood.
