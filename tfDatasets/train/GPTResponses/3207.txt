No, the tenants of the wealthier gentry did not lose their nobility. Nobility is a hereditary status that is passed down through generations and is not dependent on wealth or social status. The tenants of the wealthier gentry could have been of noble birth themselves or could have been granted titles of nobility by the monarch for their service or accomplishments. It is important to note that while wealth and social status could provide privileges and advantages, nobility was a separate and distinct status in the feudal system.
