The oldest definitive evidence of tuberculosis (TB) in the United States was found in the state of Utah. In 2014, scientists discovered TB DNA in the bones of a Native American woman who lived in the Four Corners region of Utah about 1,000 years ago. This discovery pushed back the timeline for TB in the Americas and provides insight into the origins and spread of the disease.
