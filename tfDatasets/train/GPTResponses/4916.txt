The Chief Commissioner's Province of Himachal Pradesh came into being in 1948 after the partition of India. It was created as a separate administrative unit to manage theterritories comprising of the hill areas of Punjab Province (undivided) which were geographically distinct from the plains of Punjab. This new province was created to provide better governance and administration to the people living in these hill areas. The state was later upgraded to a Union Territory in 1956 and then to a full-fledged state in 1971.
