The specificity of base pairing is caused by the complementary hydrogen bonding patterns between the nitrogenous bases of DNA. Adenine (A) always pairs with thymine (T), and cytosine (C) always pairs with guanine (G) due to their ability to form hydrogen bonds in specific patterns. A forms two hydrogen bonds with T, while C forms three hydrogen bonds with G. The specific chemical and physical properties of each base dictate the formation of these hydrogen bonds and ultimately determine the specificity of base pairing.
