The Dalai Lama was not restored as a ruler by anyone. The current Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, has been living in exile in India since 1959, when China invaded Tibet and he fled to escape persecution. While he remains the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism, he has not held any political power in Tibet since the Chinese occupation.
