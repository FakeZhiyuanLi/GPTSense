There are a few possible reasons why some populations of waxwing bombycilla may not migrate:1. Abundance of food: In some areas, waxwings may choose to stay year-round if there is enough food available. Waxwings primarily eat fruit, and if they can find enough fruit sources during the winter months, they may not need to migrate.2. Climate: Some populations of waxwings may have adapted to the local climate and have developed strategies to survive the winter. For example, some waxwings may roost together to conserve warmth in colder temperatures.3. Evolutionary history: Some populations of waxwings may have evolved to be sedentary and not migrate. This could be due to factors such as isolation on an island or a lack of predators in the area.4. Habitat availability: Waxwings may not migrate because they are able to find suitable habitat year-round. If they have access to the right resources and nesting sites, they may be able to stay in one area without needing to migrate.
