Wood can be broken down into chips and fibers through various methods, including mechanical and chemical processes.Mechanical methods involve using machines such as chippers, grinders, and shredders to break down the wood into smaller pieces. In the case of chips, logs are fed into a chipper, which has rotating blades that chop the wood into uniform pieces. Fibers are created by grinding the wood using a machine that has rotating disks or hammers that shred the wood into small pieces.Chemical methods involve using chemicals such as sodium hydroxide and sulfite to break down the wood fibers. This process, known as pulping, involves boiling the wood chips in a chemical solution until the fibers separate from the lignin and other impurities. The fibers are then washed and processed to create paper products.In both mechanical and chemical methods, the size and shape of the chips and fibers can be adjusted to meet specific needs and applications.
