The "one-drop" rule was a social and legal principle in the United States that stated that any person with even one ancestor of African ancestry was considered "black" or "colored." This rule was used to justify racial segregation and to enforce racial discrimination in areas such as education, housing, employment, and marriage. The rule was implemented to reinforce the notion of racial purity and to maintain the dominant white power structure in the United States. The rule was finally abolished by the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
