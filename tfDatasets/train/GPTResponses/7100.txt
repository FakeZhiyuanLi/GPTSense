A copy of an original idea infringes on the intellectual property rights of the original creator if it is too similar or identical to the original idea. This is because the creator of the original idea has exclusive rights to use, distribute, and profit from their work. When someone copies their idea without permission or compensation, it can harm the market value of the original idea and the creator's ability to profit from it. Infringement can include copying text, images, videos, music, software, or other forms of creative work without permission.
