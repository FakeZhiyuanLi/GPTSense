A treaty that involves changes to domestic law or requires legislative action cannot be acted on without the proper change in domestic law. Such treaties are referred to as self-executing treaties, which means that they do not automatically become a part of domestic law and require implementation through domestic legislation. Examples of such treaties include human rights treaties and environmental treaties that require changes to domestic laws to fulfill the obligations under the treaties.
