Many of the ideas that make up western classical music took shape during the Baroque period, which began in the 17th century and lasted until the mid-18th century. This period saw the development of many musical forms and structures that are still used today, such as sonatas, concertos, and fugues, as well as the establishment of the major and minor modes and the practice of harmony and counterpoint. The Baroque period also saw the emergence of important composers such as Bach, Handel, Vivaldi, and Purcell, whose works continue to be studied and performed today.
