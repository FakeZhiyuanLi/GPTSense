The European Union (EU) has had the power to enact measures since 1993 through its various institutions, such as the European Commission, the European Parliament, and the Council of the European Union. These measures can take the form of regulations, directives, and decisions and can impact a wide range of areas, including trade, environment, health, and consumer protection. The EU's power to enact measures has been strengthened over time through various treaties, such as the Lisbon Treaty in 2007.
