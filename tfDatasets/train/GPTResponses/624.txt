The use of solar balloons is typically limited to the toy market because they have limited lifting capacity and can only carry small loads. Additionally, they are not very maneuverable and are susceptible to changes in wind conditions. Solar balloons also require a lot of sunlight and can only be flown during daylight hours, further limiting their practical applications. Therefore, they are mostly used as a fun and educational way to explore solar energy and the principles of buoyancy.
