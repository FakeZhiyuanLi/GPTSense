The field winding in a washing machine is responsible for creating a magnetic field that interacts with the armature, producing rotational motion in the motor. When the field winding is switched, the direction of the magnetic field changes, causing the armature to rotate in the opposite direction. This rotation is then transferred to the drum of the washing machine through a mechanical linkage, causing it to agitate. In simple terms, the switching of the field winding changes the direction of the magnetic field, which in turn causes the drum to move back and forth, thus agitating the clothes.
