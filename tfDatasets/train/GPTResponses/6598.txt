Archbishop Ramsey did not open a center in Rome, but he did establish the Anglican Centre in Rome in 1966. The purpose of the center was to improve relationships between the Anglican Communion and the Roman Catholic Church. The center provides a space for theological dialogue, ecumenical events, and pilgrimage groups. It is also a place of hospitality for Anglican visitors to Rome.
