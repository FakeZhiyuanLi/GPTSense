The Peruvian carnival incorporates elements of both Incan and Spanish colonial traditions. It often involves colorful costumes, music, dance, food, and drink. Traditional dances such as the Diablada (Dance of the Devils), the Negritos (Black People), and the Huayno (Andean music and dance) are performed during the carnival. It also includes rituals and ceremonies honoring spiritual entities and mythical figures significant to Andean culture. Additionally, Christian elements such as parades, processions, and masquerades are also incorporated into the celebrations.
