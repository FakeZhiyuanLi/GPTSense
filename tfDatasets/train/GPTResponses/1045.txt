Nanjing became the Chinese national capital multiple times throughout history. It was first declared as the capital of the Ming dynasty in 1368, and then served as the capital of the Republic of China from 1912 to 1927. It was again briefly declared as the capital during the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, but was later moved to Chongqing. Since the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Beijing has been the national capital.
