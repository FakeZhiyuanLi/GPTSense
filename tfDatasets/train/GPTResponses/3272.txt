is referred to as "ultra vires" authority. Ultra vires means that the agent or body has exceeded its legal authority, and therefore any actions taken by it are null and void. In the context of treaty-making, this means that if a government official signs a treaty without having been authorized to do so by the appropriate government bodies or legal framework, then the treaty may be considered invalid. Similarly, if a treaty is signed by a representative of a non-state entity, such as a rebel group or a corporation, without having the legal standing to act on behalf of that entity, then the treaty may also be invalid.
