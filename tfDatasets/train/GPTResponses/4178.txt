The roots of Orthodox Judaism can be traced back to ancient Judaism and the texts of the Torah and Talmud. However, the modern form of Orthodox Judaism emerged in the 18th and 19th centuries, in response to the Enlightenment and the rise of Reform Judaism. The movement was led by prominent rabbis such as Moses Mendelssohn and Samson Raphael Hirsch, who sought to maintain traditional Jewish practices and beliefs in the face of modernization and assimilation.
