A multi-point control unit (MCU) is a device used to manage and control multiple video conference endpoints within a video conferencing system. The MCU enables participants at different locations to communicate with each other through video and audio transmission, allowing remote collaboration and virtual meetings. It acts as a bridge between different endpoints and can also provide other features such as recording, content sharing, and participant management. The MCU can be hardware-based, software-based, or cloud-based, and is an essential component of large-scale video conferencing solutions used in businesses, education, healthcare, and government settings.
