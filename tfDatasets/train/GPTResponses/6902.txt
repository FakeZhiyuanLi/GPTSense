There are several materials that are commonly combined with tungsten to create different alloys with unique properties. Some of these materials include:1. Carbon: Tungsten carbide is one of the most common tungsten alloys, made by combining tungsten with carbon. It is extremely hard and is often used in cutting tools, mining equipment, and aerospace applications.2. Nickel: Tungsten-nickel alloys are used in electrical contacts, high-temperature furnace parts, and radiation shielding applications.3. Copper: Tungsten-copper alloys have high electrical and thermal conductivity, making them useful in electrical contacts and heat sinks.4. Iron: Tungsten-iron alloys are used in the production of magnetic materials, including electrical transformers and motors.5. Molybdenum: Tungsten-molybdenum alloys have high temperature and corrosion resistance, making them useful in aerospace and defense applications.6. Cobalt: Tungsten-cobalt alloys are used in cutting tools, wear-resistant coatings, and magnetic materials.7. Titanium: Tungsten-titanium alloys are used in the production of superconducting wires and high-temperature furnace components.
