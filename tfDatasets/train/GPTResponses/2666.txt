Lossless formats provide high-quality digital audio or video that maintains the original quality of the recording. The data compression algorithms used in lossless formats do not remove any data or alter the original signal during the encoding process. Therefore, the resulting file is an exact copy of the original, with no loss of quality. This is especially important for professional applications and high-fidelity systems, where even small changes in data can cause significant loss of sound quality. Additionally, because lossless formats retain the full dynamic range of the original recording, they are ideal for archiving and editing purposes.
