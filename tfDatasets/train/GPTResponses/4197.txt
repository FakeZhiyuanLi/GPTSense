Orthodox Jewish groups typically characterize non-Orthodox forms of Judaism as being less authentic or legitimate because they do not strictly adhere to the traditional religious practices and beliefs that have been passed down for generations. They often view non-Orthodox Jews as not following halakha, or Jewish law, as stringently as they should and may view their practices and beliefs as being influenced by secular or modern values rather than solely by religious teachings. Some Orthodox Jews may also view non-Orthodox forms of Judaism as being more lenient with regard to interfaith marriages or accepting converts, which they view as compromising the integrity of Jewish traditions.
