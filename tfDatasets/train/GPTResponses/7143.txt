One downside of stiff brush springs is that they can cause excessive wear and tear on the motor's armature and brushes, leading to premature failure. Additionally, stiff brush springs can increase the motor's overall power consumption and generate more heat, which can lead to decreased efficiency and potentially shorten the lifespan of the motor. Finally, stiff brush springs can also make the motor more difficult to control, leading to inconsistent or jerky performance.
