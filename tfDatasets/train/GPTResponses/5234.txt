In 1957, Lord Altrincham criticized Queen Elizabeth II's speeches, stating that they resembled "prayers from the throne" and were too formal and distant from the common people. He suggested that the speeches should be made in a more conversational tone and that the Queen should speak more about the realities of everyday life. His critique sparked controversy but also led to some changes in the way the Queen delivered her speeches.
