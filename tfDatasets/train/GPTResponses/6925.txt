Carnival is not officially celebrated in any specific borough of New York City. However, there are various cultural and carnival-themed events held throughout the city, particularly in Brooklyn and Queens. The West Indian American Day Carnival, which takes place annually on Labor Day in Brooklyn, is one of the largest and most well-known Caribbean carnivals outside of the Caribbean itself.
