that he believed in non-harming of all living beings, including animals. He criticized those who engaged in animal sacrifice and hunting, believing that it was cruel and against the principle of ahimsa (non-violence). The Buddha also taught his followers to avoid using animals for amusement or entertainment, such as making them fight or race for human enjoyment. He encouraged people to practice compassion and kindness towards animals, emphasizing that all living beings are interconnected and interdependent.
