Phloem sieve tubes are formed from cells called sieve elements. These cells have specialized structures called sieve plates which allow for the movement of nutrients and other substances between cells in the phloem. Unlike xylem cells, which are dead at maturity and form a continuous network for water transport, phloem cells remain alive and can differentiate into other cell types.The cessation of phloem sieve tube formation can occur for several reasons. For instance, it may be due to the plant being in a dormant state, such as during the winter months or during drought conditions when it is conserving resources. Additionally, the cells that differentiate into phloem cells may be needed for other functions in the plant, such as growth or defense against pests and diseases. Finally, some plants have a limited capacity to form new phloem cells due to genetic or developmental constraints.
