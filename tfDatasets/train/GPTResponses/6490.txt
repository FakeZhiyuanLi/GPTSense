Researchers believe that several factors must be taken into account for women in these studies, including hormonal fluctuations throughout the menstrual cycle, pregnancy and lactation status, menopause status, and genetic and environmental differences that may affect health outcomes differently in women compared to men. Additionally, researchers must ensure that women are adequately represented in the study population, as historically women have been underrepresented in clinical trials. The inclusion of women in research studies can lead to a better understanding of how treatments and interventions work in women and guide personalized approaches to healthcare for women.
