Islamic political philosophy is rooted in several sources, including:1. The Qur'an: As the primary source of Islamic teachings, the Qur'an contains many passages that address issues related to politics and governance. Islamic scholars have interpreted these teachings to develop a political philosophy that is consistent with the principles and values of Islam.2. The Sunnah: The Sunnah refers to the actions and sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, which were recorded by his companions and later compiled into a collection of Hadith. These Hadith provide guidance on matters related to governance, justice, and social welfare.3. The works of Islamic philosophers: Islamic philosophers such as Al-Farabi, Ibn Rushd (Averroes), and Ibn Khaldun wrote extensively on the principles of politics and governance. They drew on Greek philosophical traditions as well as Islamic teachings to develop a comprehensive political philosophy.4. Islamic legal tradition: Islamic law, or Shariah, provides a framework for governance and political institutions. Islamic scholars have developed a rich body of jurisprudence that addresses issues related to politics and governance.5. Historical examples: Islamic political philosophy has also been shaped by historical examples of Islamic governance, such as the caliphate system, which provides a model for Islamic political institutions. These historical examples have been studied and analyzed to understand how Islamic principles can be applied in contemporary political systems.
