There are several reasons why carrier-launched aircraft were more effective than naval guns:1. Range: Carrier-launched aircraft had a significantly longer range than naval guns, which made them more effective in engaging enemy targets at greater distances.2. Mobility: Carriers are highly mobile and can move around quickly, which gave the aircraft the ability to strike targets from unexpected directions and angles.3. Precision: Carrier-launched aircraft were equipped with advanced technology that enabled them to deliver highly accurate and precise strikes on enemy targets, including guided missiles and laser-guided bombs.4. Flexibility: Aircraft can be re-tasked quickly and used to perform a wide range of missions, including reconnaissance, air superiority, and ground support. This versatility made them a more effective tool than naval guns, which were limited to shore bombardment.5. Protection: Carriers provide a protective umbrella for aircraft, allowing them to operate with relative safety and minimizing the risk of loss or damage due to enemy fire. This was not the case with naval guns, which were more vulnerable to enemy counter-fire.
