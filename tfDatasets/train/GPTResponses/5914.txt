There are several technologies that can potentially detect stealth aircraft, such as:1. Radar: While stealth aircraft are designed to evade radar detection, improved radar technologies have been developed to detect stealth aircraft.2. Infrared sensors: Infrared sensors can detect the heat of an aircraft, which cannot be hidden by stealth technologies.3. Acoustic sensors: Acoustic sensors can detect sound waves produced by the aircraft's engines and movements.4. Laser detection systems: These systems use lasers to detect stealth aircraft by detecting the reflected light.5. Electro-optical sensors: These can detect exhaust plumes and engine heat in addition to other optical signatures.6. Radio frequency (RF) detection: RF technologies can detect the aircraft's communication signals or other electromagnetic emissions.However, it should be noted that the effectiveness of these detection technologies can vary depending on the stealth technology used by the aircraft, the range and accuracy of the detection system, and various other factors.
