There are several growth stages of insects that bore holes into trees. Some common examples include:1. Larval stage: Many wood-boring insects, such as beetle larvae and moth larvae, burrow into trees during their larval stage. They feed on wood and create tunnels that can weaken and damage the tree.2. Pupal stage: Some wood-boring insects, such as emerald ash borers, bore into trees during their pupal stage. They create exit holes when they emerge as adult beetles.3. Adult stage: Certain wood-boring insects, such as carpenter ants and termites, create entry and exit holes in wood as they tunnel and nest.Overall, the growth stage of the insect that bores into trees depends on the species and life cycle of the insect.
