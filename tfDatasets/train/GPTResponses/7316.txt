One way to make a synchronous motor more like an induction motor is by using damper windings. Damper windings are additional windings installed on the rotor of the synchronous motor that create a magnetic field that interacts with the stator field to produce torque. This interaction allows the synchronous motor to start and run like an induction motor.Another way is by using a variable frequency drive (VFD). A VFD can be used to vary the frequency of the electrical supply to the synchronous motor, allowing it to operate more like an induction motor. The VFD can also control the speed and torque of the synchronous motor, which is typically not possible without such a drive.Finally, external resistors can be used to reduce the excitation current in the synchronous motor. This decreases the strength of the magnetic field produced by the rotor, making it more like an induction motor. However, this method can lead to decreased efficiency and increased overheating of the motor.
