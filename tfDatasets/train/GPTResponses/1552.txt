The word "nigger" has been considered a derogatory term for Black people for more than a century. Its origins can be traced back to the transatlantic slave trade and the dehumanization of enslaved Africans. However, the use of the word as a slur became more widespread during the era of American slavery in the 18th and 19th centuries. During this time, white people began using the word as a means of reinforcing the subjugation and inferiority of Black people. Unfortunately, the word continues to be a hurtful and offensive term, even in modern times.
