Nasser closely controlled the military in Egypt to prevent sedition. He believed that a strong and united military was necessary to maintain stability and safeguard the country from outside threats. Nasser appointed his loyalists to high-ranking positions in the military, and anyone suspected of disloyalty or opposition to his regime was purged. This led to the dominance of the military in Egyptian politics, a legacy that continues to this day.
