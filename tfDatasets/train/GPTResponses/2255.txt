The United Nations did not give Italy trusteeship of Italian Somaliland. After World War II, Italy was forced to relinquish its colonial holdings, including Italian Somaliland. The territory was placed under a United Nations trusteeship, with Italy playing a limited administrative role until 1960 when Italian Somaliland gained independence and became the Somali Republic.
