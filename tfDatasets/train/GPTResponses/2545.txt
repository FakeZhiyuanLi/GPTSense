Studying a language phonologically involves examining the speaker data related to the sounds and sound patterns of the language. This includes analyzing different aspects such as the sound inventory of the language, the phonotactics or rules governing how sounds can be combined, the prosody or patterns of stress, intonation and rhythm, and the phonological processes that change the sounds in certain contexts. Speaker data may involve collecting and analyzing recordings of spoken language, and using tools such as spectrograms and phonetic transcriptions to examine the individual sounds and how they are produced by native speakers of the language. Analysis of speaker data is an important aspect of phonological study as it allows linguists to gain insight into the underlying structures and rules that govern the sound system of the language.
