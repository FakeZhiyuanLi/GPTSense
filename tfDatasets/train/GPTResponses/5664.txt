The Greek physician, Herophilus, is considered to be one of the first to provide accurate descriptions of the nervous system in the 3rd century BCE. He was regarded as a pioneer in the field of anatomy and was known for his detailed dissections of the human body, including the nervous system. He is credited with identifying various parts of the brain and describing the optic nerve and spinal cord. His work paved the way for further studies in neuroscience.
