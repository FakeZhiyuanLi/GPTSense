The southern and southeastern parts of Oklahoma rarely see below-zero temperatures. This is because they are located in the warmer, more humid regions of the state, which are influenced by air masses from the Gulf of Mexico. The temperature in these areas typically stays above freezing, even during the winter months. However, it is important to note that extreme weather conditions can occur in any part of Oklahoma, so it is always advisable to be prepared for all types of weather.
