Films with high sensitivity to light are considered fast films. These films have a low ISO rating, typically between 800-3200. Some examples of fast films include Kodak Tri-X, Ilford Delta 3200, and Fujifilm Neopan 1600. These films are ideal for low light conditions or for capturing fast-moving subjects, such as sports or action photography. However, they tend to have more noticeable grain and may have limited dynamic range compared to slower films.
