There are several chemicals that may mediate emotions:1. Serotonin: Plays a role in regulating mood, appetite, and sleep.2. Dopamine: Associated with pleasure and reward-seeking behavior, as well as motivation and attention.3. Oxytocin: Involved in social bonding and trust, as well as maternal attachment and sexual behavior.4. Cortisol: Released in response to stress, and can have both positive and negative effects on mood and behavior.5. Norepinephrine (noradrenaline): Involved in the body’s “fight or flight” response and can increase heart rate and blood pressure in response to stress.6. Endorphins: Associated with pain relief and feelings of pleasure.7. GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid): A neurotransmitter that helps to regulate anxiety and promote relaxation.8. Glutamate: Can affect modulation of motivation and behavior, as well as anxiety and mood.It is important to note that these chemicals do not act in isolation and interact with each other and various other factors to influence emotions and behavior.
