is known as electroreceptive animals. They include a variety of species such as sharks, rays, and some types of fish, amphibians, and mammals. These animals have specialized organs called ampullae of Lorenzini that allow them to detect even weak electric fields in their environment. Electroreception can be used for a range of purposes such as finding prey, avoiding predators, orienting and navigating in the environment, and even communicating with each other through electric fields.
