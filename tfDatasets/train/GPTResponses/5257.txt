Streptococci are caused by a group of bacteria called Streptococcus. These bacteria can infect humans, animals, and the environment. There are many different types of Streptococcus, and they can cause a range of illnesses, from minor skin infections to more serious conditions such as strep throat, pneumonia, and meningitis. The bacteria are spread through contact with infected individuals or surfaces, such as sneezing or coughing, and can also be transmitted sexually or through contaminated food or water. Poor hygiene and a weakened immune system can also increase the risk of infection.
