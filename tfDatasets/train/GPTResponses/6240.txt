Scientists have begun to test the effects of different levels of androgens (male sex hormones) on the development of sexual characteristics in both males and females, as well as the role of other hormones and genetic factors in this process. They have also studied the potential impact of androgens on behavior, cognition, and other aspects of development. Furthermore, scientists have studied the effects of various drugs that alter androgens levels, as well as the long-term effects of exposure to environmental factors that may interfere with hormone regulation.
