The non-Muslim religion that produced notable theological works under the Umayyads was Christianity. Christian scholars who lived under Umayyad rule wrote works on theology, philosophy, and other topics, and some of these works were influential in shaping the development of Christian doctrine. Notable Christian theologians who lived during this period include John of Damascus and Theodore Abu Qurrah.
