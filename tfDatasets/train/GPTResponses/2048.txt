Conifers are the softwoods that often have significant differences in their earlywood and latewood. The earlywood (or springwood) is usually lighter in color and has larger, thinner-walled cells that grow faster during the growing season. The latewood (or summerwood) is usually darker in color and has smaller, thicker-walled cells that grow slower towards the end of the growing season. This differentiation between earlywood and latewood creates the distinct growth rings visible in cross-sections of the wood.
