One approach that can be used to classify small groups is to look for specific patterns or structures within the groups. For example, one can look for groups that are abelian, cyclic, or have a specific number of elements. Another approach is to study certain families of groups, such as the dihedral groups or the symmetric groups, and see how they relate to each other. Computer algorithms can also be used to generate and analyze groups of small order to gain insights into their properties and relationships. However, as the size of the groups increases, it becomes increasingly difficult to classify them completely or find a general classification scheme.
