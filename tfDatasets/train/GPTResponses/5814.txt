Italian Eritrea was significantly enlarged in 1936 when Italy conquered and annexed Ethiopia, which included territories formerly belonging to Eritrea, such as the Ogaden region. This expansion increased Eritreaâ€™s land area by more than double, from 68,000 square kilometers (26,800 square miles) to approximately 182,000 square kilometers (70,300 square miles).
