If the load is increased, the motor will need to work harder to maintain the same speed and power output. This can cause the motor to slow down, heat up, and draw more current from the power supply. In some cases, the motor may not be able to handle the increased load and will stall or shut down. If the load increase is sustained, it can also cause damage to the motor and other components in the system.
