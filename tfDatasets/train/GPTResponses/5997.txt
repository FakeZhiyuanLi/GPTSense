Sanskrit was once thought to be a divider because it was considered a language superior to other Indian languages and was used predominantly by the Brahmin class in ancient India. This led to a hierarchical society where Sanskrit knowledge and mastery was considered a mark of privilege and education, while other languages were often marginalized. Additionally, Sanskrit was also used as a tool for colonialism and cultural domination by British colonizers in India, which further alienated it from other languages and communities. However, in modern times, efforts have been made to promote linguistic diversity and inclusivity, and Sanskrit is now seen as an important cultural and historical language that holds value for all.
