People in stigmatized jobs are often forced to create a false identity or disguise their true profession in order to avoid being judged or discriminated against. They may also create coping mechanisms to deal with the stress and stigma associated with their job, such as developing a thick skin, isolating themselves from others, or engaging in risky behavior as a way to cope. Additionally, they may develop resilience and a sense of pride in their work despite societal prejudices, and strive to educate others about the importance and value of their job.
