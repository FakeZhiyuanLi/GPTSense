The danger to humans from avian flu is that it can cause severe respiratory illness, leading to pneumonia and even death. This is because the virus has different properties in avian species compared to mammals, including humans. In some cases, the virus can mutate and become easily spread from human to human, leading to a potential pandemic. Additionally, there may be a lack of immunity and effective treatments available to protect humans from this rapidly spreading virus.
