The modern concept of cryptography was created from many fields of mathematics, including number theory, algebra, probability theory, and information theory. Cryptography involves the use of mathematical algorithms and techniques to secure communication and protect information from unauthorized access or disclosure. It is used in various applications, such as secure online transactions, password protection, and secure messaging systems.
