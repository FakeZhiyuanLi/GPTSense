Soft adult contemporary music is typically marketed towards adults aged 25 to 55 who enjoy listening to easy-listening music, often referred to as "lite" or "soft" music. This demographic includes individuals who are typically well-educated, have a higher income, and are primarily interested in pop and adult contemporary music. These listeners are often more focused on relaxing and creating a soothing environment for themselves rather than actively seeking out new music or seeking out music that is particularly edgy or challenging.
