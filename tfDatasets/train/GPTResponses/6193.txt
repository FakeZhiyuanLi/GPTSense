The origins of Melbourne's tram network dates back to the 1880s when horse-drawn trams were first introduced. In 1884, the Melbourne Tramway and Omnibus Company (MTOC) established a network of horse-drawn trams running through the central business district. The network quickly proved popular and expanded throughout the city.In 1906, the MTOC began to introduce electric trams to replace the horse-drawn trams. The first electric tram ran on Bourke Street in February 1906, and by the end of the year, the company had converted all of its lines to electric trams.By the 1920s, Melbourne's tram network was one of the largest in the world, with over 500km of track and more than 1,000 trams. The system continued to expand throughout the 20th century, and today, the Melbourne tram network is still one of the largest in the world, with over 250km of track and more than 400 trams.
