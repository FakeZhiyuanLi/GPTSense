The Council of the Church questioned Athanasius about his teachings on the nature of Jesus Christ. Specifically, they questioned his belief in the equal divinity of Jesus Christ with God the Father, as opposed to the belief held by some that Jesus was a created being of lesser divinity. This issue became known as the Arian controversy, and Athanasius played a key role in defending the orthodox view of the nature of Christ.
