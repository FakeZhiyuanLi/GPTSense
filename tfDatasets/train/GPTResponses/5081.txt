There are no explicit rules that state only women can compete in rhythmic gymnastics. However, the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) has historically defined rhythmic gymnastics as a sport for women. The FIG states that "rhythmic gymnastics is a sport that combines elements of ballet, gymnastics, dance, and apparatus manipulation. The athletes, mainly women, perform various routines with one or more apparatuses including ribbons, hoops, clubs, and balls." While men can participate in rhythmic gymnastics, there are no separate competitions for men, so the sport is still considered predominantly a women's sport.
