Trans fats have a longer shelf life than other types of fats, and they can withstand high temperatures without breaking down. This makes them useful in food processing as they can improve the texture and taste of certain foods and increase their shelf life. Additionally, trans fats are cheaper to produce than other types of fats, further contributing to their popularity in the food industry.
