There were various places where former slaves went for work once freed. Many went to cities in search of labor or found work on farms or plantations, often working as sharecroppers. Some also joined the military, became entrepreneurs, or moved to the western frontier in search of land and opportunity. Others worked as domestic servants or in factories. However, discrimination and racism made it difficult for many freed slaves to find stable work and provide for themselves and their families.
