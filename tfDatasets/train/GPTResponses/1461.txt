Simpson's unity is based on the principle that the total area under a curve represents unity or 100% of the value being measured. This principle is used in numerical integration to approximate the area under a curve by dividing it into smaller segments and using various formulas to estimate the value of each segment. By summing up the values of all segments, the total area under the curve can be estimated with a high degree of accuracy. Simpson's rule is a widely used numerical integration method that uses parabolic segments to approximate the area under a curve.
