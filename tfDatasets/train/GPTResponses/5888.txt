The Council of Milan, held in 313 AD, was a meeting between the Emperor Constantine I and the bishops of the Christian Church. The council's main purpose was to settle a dispute between the bishop of Alexandria, Arius, and the bishop of Rome, against the belief that Jesus Christ was a mere mortal.The outcome of the council was the adoption of the Nicene Creed, which defined the orthodoxy of Christianity and affirmed Christ's divinity. This document was later refined and expanded at the Council of Constantinople in 381 AD, which solidified the doctrine of the Holy Trinity as central to the Christian faith.Overall, the Council of Milan played a significant role in solidifying Christian theology and orthodoxy, and it was a pivotal moment in the history of the Church.
