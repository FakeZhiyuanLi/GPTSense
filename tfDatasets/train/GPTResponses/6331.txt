One crime in the eighteenth century that could cause severe punishment but was mostly ignored was witchcraft. While officially recognized as a crime, in many areas, witchcraft accusations were often unfounded and based on superstition or personal vendettas. Punishments for being convicted of witchcraft could include imprisonment, torture, and even execution. However, in many cases, authorities would turn a blind eye if the accused was a well-respected member of the community or if there was insufficient evidence to support the accusations.
