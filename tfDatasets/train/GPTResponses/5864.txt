Arius died in 336 AD, just a few years after the Council of Nicaea. His teachings were condemned as heretical by the council, and his followers, known as Arians, were persecuted and gradually lost their influence. Eventually, Arianism was completely suppressed, and the Nicene Creed became the standard of Christian belief.
