Some Muslims criticized the Umayyads for their preference of worldly power and wealth over religious teachings and principles, and for their perceived deviation from the ideal Islamic leadership model of humility and service to the community. Some also criticized them for their harsh treatment and suppression of the early supporters of Ali, whom they believed deserved the right to leadership of the Muslim community.
