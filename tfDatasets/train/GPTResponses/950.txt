The process by which a mature mRNA molecule is used as a template for synthesizing a new protein is called translation. This process occurs in the ribosomes, which are located in the cytoplasm of the cell. During translation, the ribosome reads the sequence of codons on the mRNA molecule and matches them with the appropriate amino acid. As the ribosome reads each codon, a transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule carrying the corresponding amino acid binds to the ribosome. The ribosome then catalyzes the formation of a peptide bond between the amino acids, creating a growing chain of amino acids called a polypeptide. This process continues until the ribosome encounters a stop codon on the mRNA, which signals the end of the protein sequence. The completed polypeptide is then released from the ribosome and undergoes folding and post-translational modifications to form a functional protein.
