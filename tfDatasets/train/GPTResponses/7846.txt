The Indus Valley Civilization was the first to have traces of urban planning, as seen in the layout of the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro. They also had impressive hydraulic engineering, including a sophisticated system of drainage and sewerage, indicating a high level of sanitation and public health practices. They also had a written script that has yet to be fully deciphered.
