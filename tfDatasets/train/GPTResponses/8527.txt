In the 1970s, monetarism continued to be a popular economic theory that emphasized the importance of controlling the money supply to stabilize economic growth and reduce inflation. However, it also became associated with neoclassical economics, which emphasized free markets and emphasized the role of the private sector in determining economic outcomes. Some critics of monetarism argued that it was too focused on short-term economic goals and ignored broader social and political issues. Additionally, some economists began to question the assumptions of neoclassical economics, which they argued did not accurately reflect the complexities and uncertainties of the real world.
