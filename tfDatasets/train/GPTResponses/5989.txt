The Orphan Drug Act applies to rare diseases, which are defined as conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. However, the act may also apply to drugs that are intended to treat conditions that affect more than 200,000 people in cases where there is no viable treatment available. The act provides incentives for pharmaceutical companies to develop drugs for rare diseases, which often have few treatment options.
