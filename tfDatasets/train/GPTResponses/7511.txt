There have been numerous attacks on Greek islands by Turks and Egyptians throughout history, so it is difficult to provide a specific answer without more context. Some notable conflicts include:- The Greek War of Independence (1821–1832), during which the Ottoman Empire fought against Greek rebels seeking to establish an independent state. This conflict included numerous battles on Greek islands, particularly in the Aegean Sea.- The Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922, which was fought between Greece and the newly-formed Republic of Turkey. The conflict included several naval battles around the Aegean islands, as well as the catastrophic Great Fire of Smyrna (modern-day İzmir), which saw Turkish forces attack and burn the city, killing tens of thousands of Greeks and other minorities.- The Sinai and Palestine Campaign of World War I (1915–1918), during which British and Egyptian forces fought against the Ottoman Empire in what is now Israel, the Palestinian territories, and Sinai. This campaign also saw some fighting on Greek islands in the eastern Mediterranean.- The Mamluk Sultanate's invasion of the Aegean islands in 1304, during which forces from Egypt's Mamluk Empire launched an unsuccessful attack on the island of Rhodes. This conflict was part of a wider power struggle between the Mamluks and the Byzantine Empire.
