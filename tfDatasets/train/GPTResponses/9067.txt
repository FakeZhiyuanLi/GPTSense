The Indian independence movement, led by figures such as Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, and Sardar Patel, led to the founding of the Republic of India in 1950. This movement called for the end of British colonial rule and the establishment of a sovereign and democratic nation. After years of protests, civil disobedience, and negotiations with the British government, India finally gained its independence on August 15, 1947. The Constitution of India was then adopted on January 26, 1950, marking the official founding of the Republic of India.
