Greek-speaking elites across the Hellenistic world, who continued to patronize and participate in cultural activities such as philosophy, art, and literature.3. The Roman Empire, which inherited and continued many aspects of Hellenistic culture, including language, philosophy, and art, and helped to spread it throughout the Mediterranean world.4. Christian monastic communities, which preserved and copied many ancient Greek texts during the Middle Ages.Overall, the preservation of Hellenistic culture was the result of a complex and multifaceted process involving many different actors and historical contexts.
