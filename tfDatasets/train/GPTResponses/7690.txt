Motions attempted to limit the power of the King and increase the power of Parliament. This included moves to restrict the use of royal prerogative (the right of the monarch to exercise power), impeach royal ministers, and introduce more accountability to royal finances. These reforms were seen as a threat to Charles I's authority and he dissolved Parliament in 1629 in order to retain his power.
