Tito used propaganda and the promise of national freedom and liberation to unite people in a battle against the occupation in 1941. He also formed the Yugoslav Partisans, a guerrilla army that fought against the Axis powers and their collaborators. Tito emphasized the importance of ethnic and religious tolerance in forming a united front against the occupiers.
