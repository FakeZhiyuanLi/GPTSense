The earliest passwords and rituals of Freemasonry date back to the 18th century. The first Grand Lodge was established in London in 1717, and this marked the beginning of Freemasonry as a formal organization. The earliest known Masonic ritual texts include the "Charges of a Freemason" and the "Regius Manuscript," which were written in the late 14th and early 15th centuries, but these texts do not contain any specific passwords or rituals. Freemasonry as it exists today is a product of the 18th century, so the passwords and rituals used by the organization would have developed during this time.
