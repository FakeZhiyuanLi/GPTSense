Mathematicians of the time wanted to use a lunar calendar to set the date of Easter. In particular, they wanted to use the Metonic cycle, which is a pattern of 19 years in which the phases of the moon repeat on the same dates. This cycle would allow for a predictable pattern of when Easter would fall each year. However, this posed a challenge as it conflicted with the solar calendar, which was used for most other purposes.
