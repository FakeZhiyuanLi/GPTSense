The major event that preceded the growth of the divide in education between white and black Americans was the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954. This case declared segregation in public schools to be unconstitutional, but its implementation was slow and often resisted, leading to further disparities in education opportunities for black Americans. Additionally, ongoing institutional and systemic racism, including discriminatory housing policies and unequal distribution of resources, has contributed to the continued divide in education outcomes between white and black Americans.
