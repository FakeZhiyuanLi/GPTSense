It is difficult to estimate the exact amount of copper that exists on Earth as it is continuously being used and recycled. However, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), known copper reserves worldwide are estimated to be around 830 million metric tons, and total copper resources, including undiscovered deposits, are estimated to be around 5.6 billion metric tons.
