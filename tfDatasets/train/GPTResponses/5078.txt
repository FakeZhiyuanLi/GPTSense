The Antarctic Treaty is the primary international agreement that regulates Antarctica's status. It was signed in 1959 and has been ratified by 54 countries. The treaty defines Antarctica as a continent for scientific purposes, bans military activities and sets aside disputes over territorial claims. The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (also known as the Madrid Protocol) was adopted in 1991 and further regulates activities in Antarctica by prohibiting mining and setting strict environmental standards.
