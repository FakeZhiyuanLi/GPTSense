Computers with high-performance graphics cards (GPUs) and specialized hardware such as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are capable of breaking encryption algorithms quickly. These types of computers are often used by organizations such as governments and corporations for tasks that require heavy-duty processing power, including data encryption and decryption. Additionally, supercomputers and quantum computers are also believed to have the potential to break encryption algorithms quickly due to their massive computational power and ability to perform complex calculations simultaneously.
