The first cathedral to make use of pointed arches in high vaults is widely considered to be the Gothic cathedral of Saint Denis in France, built in the 12th century. Its architect, Abbot Suger, is credited with developing the Gothic style that utilized pointed arches and ribbed vaults to create greater height and lightness in church architecture.
