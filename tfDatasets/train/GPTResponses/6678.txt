The length of time a wrestler has to get themselves free of a hold in a wrestling match depends on the type of hold and the rules of the specific wrestling organization. In some cases, there may be a time limit specified by the referee, while in others, there may be no time limit but the wrestler must make continuous effort to escape the hold. Ultimately, the wrestler must work to break the hold as quickly as possible to avoid being pinned or submitting to the opponent.
