There is no specific group or individual who makes people of color feel "not black enough." This feeling often arises from societal pressures and stereotypes that dictate how someone is supposed to behave or look based on their race or ethnicity. It can also come from within the community when some members may perpetuate this notion of what it means to be "black enough." It is important to recognize and challenge these harmful ideas and celebrate the diversity within communities of color.
