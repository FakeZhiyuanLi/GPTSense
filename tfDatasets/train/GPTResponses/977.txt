In other socialist states in Eastern Europe, those who were purged or persecuted were often referred to as "enemies of the state" or "counter-revolutionaries." The specific names used varied by country and time period. For example, in the Soviet Union, they were often referred to as "enemies of the people" or "spies." In East Germany, they were termed "enemies of the socialist order." In Romania, the regime led by Nicolae Ceau»ôescu referred to them as "anti-socialist elements."
