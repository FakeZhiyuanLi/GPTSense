Whitehead considered himself a philosopher of organism or process philosophy, which emphasizes the interconnection and interdependence of all things in the world. He believed that reality is not composed of isolated, static entities but rather of constantly changing, related events or processes. He also stressed the importance of both empirical observation and speculative imagination in constructing a comprehensive understanding of the world. Whitehead saw his philosophy as a synthesis of various Western and Eastern philosophical traditions, including pragmatism, idealism, and Confucianism.
