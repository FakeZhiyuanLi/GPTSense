There are several types of telescopes that completely avoid water vapor in Earth's atmosphere:1. Space telescopes: These are telescopes that are located in space, outside the Earth's atmosphere. Examples of space telescopes are Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope, Chandra X-ray Observatory, etc.2. High-altitude telescopes: These are telescopes that are located on high-altitude mountains or planes, where the atmospheric water vapor is much lower. Examples of high-altitude telescopes are Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile, Mauna Kea Observatories in Hawaii, etc.3. Submillimeter telescopes: These are telescopes that operate at submillimeter wavelengths, where the water vapor absorption is much less. Examples of submillimeter telescopes are Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) in Chile, Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA) in California, etc.4. Infrared telescopes: These are telescopes that operate at infrared wavelengths, where the water vapor absorption is less. Examples of infrared telescopes are Subaru Telescope in Hawaii, Spitzer Space Telescope, etc.
