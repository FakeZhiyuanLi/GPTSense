Saltationism is the theory that new species or adaptations arise suddenly through a single, large mutation rather than gradually evolving through small, incremental changes. It suggests that evolution occurs in large jumps or leaps rather than through a gradual process of natural selection. This idea was popularized in the late 19th century by scientists such as Richard Goldschmidt but has since been largely dismissed by the scientific community in favor of gradualism.
