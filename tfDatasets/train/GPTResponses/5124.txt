One important astronomical study for Antarctica is the observation of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) which is the oldest radiation in the universe. Antarctica provides a unique location for the study of CMB due to its cold and dry atmosphere, and its distance from human settlements which reduces interference from radio signals. The CMB observations can provide important insights into the early universe, the formation of galaxies, and the nature of dark energy and dark matter.
