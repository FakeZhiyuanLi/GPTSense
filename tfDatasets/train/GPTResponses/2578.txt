The answer is the heartwood. The heartwood is the central, supporting pillar of a tree and it is composed of old, hardened cells that no longer carry water or nutrients. The heartwood is usually darker in color and denser than the outer sapwood and can withstand years of wear and tear, making it one of the most durable parts of a tree. It is often the remaining part of a tree after many years of decay, and is what gives many ancient trees their characteristic shape and strength.
