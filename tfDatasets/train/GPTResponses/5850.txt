One cause for Melbourne's fluctuating weather patterns is its location along the coast, which is subject to changing air masses from both the land and sea. Additionally, the city's location within a temperate climate zone means that it experiences a range of temperatures throughout the year, with occasional extreme weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, or storms. Climate change may also be contributing to more variability in Melbourne's weather patterns.
