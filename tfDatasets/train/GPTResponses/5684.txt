is referred to as integrated air defence systems (IADS), which combine multiple sensors, weapons, and command-and-control systems to detect, track, and engage incoming threats. These systems typically include radar, optical sensors, electronic warfare equipment, and missile launchers, all tied together through a network that allows for rapid communication and decision-making. The goal of these systems is to provide layered, redundant defences that can detect and engage targets at long ranges and altitudes, giving operators time to respond and counter the threat. The most advanced air defence systems also incorporate advanced features such as stealth detection and hypersonic missile interceptors to deal with emerging threats.
