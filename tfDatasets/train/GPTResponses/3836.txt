Scarantino and Griffiths believed that the situated perspective could also help to explain human emotion, including the influence of social, cultural, and environmental factors on emotional experiences and expression. This approach recognizes that emotions are not just internal states, but they are also shaped by the context and situation in which they occur. For example, the same event or situation may elicit different emotions in different individuals or cultural groups, or the same individual may experience different emotions in different contexts. The situated perspective highlights the importance of examining the dynamic interactions between individuals and their environment in understanding emotional processes and outcomes.
