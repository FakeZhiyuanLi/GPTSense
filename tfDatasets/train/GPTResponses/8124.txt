William Paley was a prominent theologian and philosopher who believed that adaptation in nature was evidence of God's design. In his famous work "Natural Theology" (1802), Paley argued that the complex and intricate adaptations in living organisms could not have arisen by chance but were instead the result of intelligent design by a creator. He used examples such as the eye and the watch to demonstrate the principle of design in nature. His ideas influenced many scientists and theologians in the 19th century and are still discussed today in debates about creationism and intelligent design.
