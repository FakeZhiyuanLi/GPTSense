they are designed and manufactured. The process of developing and producing microchips involves various stages where potentially harmful defects or vulnerabilities can be introduced, such as:1. Design flaws: Microchips can have inherent flaws or weaknesses in their design, which can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access or control.2. Malware or viruses: Microchips can be infected with malware or viruses during the manufacturing process or by attackers who tamper with the devices.3. Supply chain attacks: Microchips can be compromised when they are being transported, as well as at various stages in the manufacturing and distribution process.4. Hardware vulnerabilities: Some microchips have hardware vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to bypass security measures and access sensitive data.Overall, microchip vulnerabilities are introduced at various stages of the production and distribution process, highlighting the importance of ensuring strong security measures at every step of the way.
