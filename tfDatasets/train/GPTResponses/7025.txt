The festivals in Peru are held at different times throughout the year to honor various religious events, historical events, and agricultural cycles. Many festivals are held to celebrate the blending of indigenous traditions and Catholic practices. For example, the Inti Raymi festival, celebrated in June, honors the Incan sun god and marks the winter solstice. The Virgin of Candelaria festival, celebrated in February, combines Catholic and Andean traditions to honor the patron saint of Puno. The festivals also serve as a way to unite communities and promote cultural identity.
