The major limitation of traditional character encodings is that they are limited in the number of characters they can represent. Most traditional encodings are limited to representing only a few hundred characters, which is not enough to represent all the characters used in all languages. This means that users of different languages and scripts may not be able to properly communicate and share information, since their chosen characters may not be supported by the encoding used. Additionally, troubleshooting encoding issues can be complex and difficult.
