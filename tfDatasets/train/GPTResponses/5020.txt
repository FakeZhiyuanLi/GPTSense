The name Terra Australis was originally coined by the ancient Greeks and Romans to refer to a hypothetical southern continent that they believed must exist to balance out the landmasses of the northern hemisphere. However, the first European explorer to actually discover and name the continent of Australia was the Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon in 1606, who charted a portion of the western coast of Cape York Peninsula in Queensland. The name "Australia" was later popularized by the British explorer Matthew Flinders, who circumnavigated the continent between 1801 and 1803 and published a detailed account of his journey called A Voyage to Terra Australis.
