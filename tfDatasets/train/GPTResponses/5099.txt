Antarctica is a largely flat and ice-covered continent that is surrounded by oceans. It is also home to the highest peak in Antarctica, Vinson Massif, which is 16,050 feet (4,892 meters) tall. The continent also features glaciers, ice sheets, and ice shelves that cover much of the land surface. Additionally, the Antarctic Peninsula has steep, rugged mountains and fjords that contrast with the overall flatness of the continent.
