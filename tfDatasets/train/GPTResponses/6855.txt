Influential figures of the 19th century also preferred to use Victorian Gothic for residential and commercial architecture. The style was popular for grand mansions, townhouses, and hotels, as well as for public buildings such as libraries, museums, and universities. The Gothic Revival style was seen as a way to convey wealth and status, while also evoking a sense of romanticism and nostalgia for a bygone era.
