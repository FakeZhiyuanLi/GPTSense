Testosterone is primarily produced by the testicles in men and in smaller amounts by the ovaries in women. In both males and females, the pituitary gland in the brain releases luteinizing hormone (LH), which stimulates the testicles or ovaries to produce testosterone. During puberty, testosterone production increases significantly in males and begins to decline in older age. Other factors that can affect testosterone production include stress, exercise, sleep, and diet. Certain medications, health conditions, and lifestyle factors such as smoking and excessive alcohol consumption can also have an impact on testosterone levels.
