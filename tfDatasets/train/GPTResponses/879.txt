The idea of "looking across the tracks" refers to the shift in anthropology towards studying local communities and marginalized groups within one's own society. This shift began in the late 1960s and 1970s, as anthropologists began to recognize the importance of studying social inequalities and power relations within their own societies, rather than solely focusing on distant and exotic "other" cultures. This approach is known as "applied anthropology" or "public anthropology" and is still widely practiced today.
