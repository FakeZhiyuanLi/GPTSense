Drug discovery is the process of identifying and developing new medications to treat diseases. It involves comprehensive research, from the identification of a target disease to the development of a final drug product. This process usually takes several years and involves multiple stages, including target identification, lead identification and optimization, preclinical development, clinical development, regulatory approval, and market access. The goal of drug discovery is to identify new compounds that can effectively treat a particular disease with minimal side effects.
