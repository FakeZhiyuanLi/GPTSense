Shipbuilding was a central industry for Southampton in the Middle Ages. The town's location on the south coast of England made it an ideal location for shipbuilding, and it became an important center for the construction of naval vessels and merchant ships. The port of Southampton also played a key role in the shipment of goods, and the town's skilled craftsmen and tradespeople were in high demand.
