One example of a German encirclement battle is the Battle of Stalingrad in 1942-43, where German forces led by General Friedrich Paulus attempted to encircle and capture the Soviet city of Stalingrad. However, the Soviet Red Army was able to encircle and trap the Germans, leading to a brutal and bloody six-month battle that resulted in the defeat of the German Sixth Army and marked a turning point in the Eastern Front of World War II.
