Besides recognition, two grand lodges must establish mutual trust, respect, and communication protocols. They should agree to follow the same fundamental principles of Freemasonry, such as promoting moral and ethical values and abstaining from political and religious discussions. They should also have compatible organizational structures and procedures for admitting and raising their members. Furthermore, they should exchange information and visit each other's lodges to foster understanding and fraternity.
