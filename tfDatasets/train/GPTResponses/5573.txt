Following the Crimean War, Britain's closest ally was France. The two countries had fought together against Russia during the war, and this led to a strengthening of their diplomatic and military ties. This alliance was formalized in 1904 with the signing of the Entente Cordiale, which pledged Britain and France to work together on future foreign policy issues.
