If a state's representative ignored restrictions imposed by their sovereign, then the state's consent to a treaty might be considered to be invalid or questionable. This is because the representative does not have the authority to act outside of their given limitations, and therefore their actions may not reflect the true intentions or interests of the state. As a result, the treaty may not truly reflect the state's consent and may be viewed as illegitimate.
