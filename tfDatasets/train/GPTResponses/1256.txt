Slavic-speaking tribes were part of the East Slavic cultural and linguistic group prior to becoming known to the Roman world. They lived in the areas that are now Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, and Poland. Before the emergence of this group, Slavs had been living in various regions of Eastern Europe for thousands of years. They developed their unique cultural and linguistic identity over time and were able to maintain their distinctiveness despite their close proximity to other ethnic groups. The East Slavic people were not recognized as an independent cultural and linguistic group until the 9th century when they began to interact with the Byzantine Empire and were first mentioned in historical records.
