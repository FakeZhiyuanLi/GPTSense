John Smyth, an English separatist, established a Baptist congregation in Amsterdam in 1609. He believed in the separation of church and state, the baptism of believers by immersion, and the autonomy of the local congregation. This congregation, known as the General Baptists, was later joined by a group of Particular Baptists in London in the 1630s. The Particular Baptists believed in predestination and limited atonement, while the General Baptists were Arminian in theology. These two groups eventually merged in the late 17th century to form the Baptist denomination that we know today.
