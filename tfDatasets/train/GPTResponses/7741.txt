The Dominican Brothers are members of the Dominican Order, a religious order within the Catholic Church that was founded by Saint Dominic in the 13th century. They are called brothers because all members of the order take religious vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, but not all are ordained as priests. The Dominican Brothers are known for their preaching, education, and mission work. They are active in various countries around the world, including the United States, where they operate schools, universities, and retreat centers.
