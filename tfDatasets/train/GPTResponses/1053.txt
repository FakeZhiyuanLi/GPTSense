People in high villages may build their homes according to the local weather patterns and environmental conditions. For example, in cold mountainous regions, people may build homes with thick walls to insulate against the cold, small windows to reduce heat loss, and roofs angled to prevent snow buildup. In hot, dry regions, homes may be built with thick walls to keep the interior cool and shaded outdoor areas for relief from the sun. The building materials may also be chosen based on availability and durability, such as mud bricks, stone, or timber. Cultural and traditional practices may also influence the design and construction of homes in high villages.
