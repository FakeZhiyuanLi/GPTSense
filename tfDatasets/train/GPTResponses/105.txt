It is difficult to identify a specific date for when Britain had an imperialist policy, as it was a gradual and evolving process. However, some historians point to the early 17th century as a time when Britain began to establish its overseas empire, with notable efforts in North America and the Caribbean. The establishment of the East India Company in 1600 also marked Britain's entry into the imperialist age, as it opened up opportunities for trade and colonization in India and other parts of Asia.
