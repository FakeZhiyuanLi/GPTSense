Jewish law is derived from several sources, including the Torah (the first five books of the Bible), the Talmud (a collection of Jewish teachings and commentaries on the Torah), and various codes of Jewish law compiled over the centuries. It is difficult to count the exact number of rules in Jewish law, as many are open to interpretation and there is ongoing debate among Jewish scholars about the application of these rules. However, some estimates suggest that Jewish law contains thousands of individual laws and commandments.
