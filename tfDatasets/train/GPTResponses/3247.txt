The representative must then present their credentials to the other party (or parties) to the treaty. This typically involves presenting a letter from their government or other formal documentation proving their authority to act on behalf of their party.3. If the other party is satisfied with the representative's credentials, negotiations may proceed and a treaty may be drafted and signed.The process for finding the full powers of a party's representatives may vary depending on the specific treaty and the parties involved, but it typically involves these general steps to ensure that the representatives have proper authority to enter into the agreement.
