The Supreme Court ruled in the case of Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc. that infringement does not necessarily equal "piracy." The court found that the sale of video cassette recorders (VCRs), which could potentially be used to copy copyrighted material, was not illegal, as long as the manufacturer did not actively induce such copying. This ruling established the legal concept of "time-shifting," which allows consumers to record and watch television programs at a later time for personal use.
