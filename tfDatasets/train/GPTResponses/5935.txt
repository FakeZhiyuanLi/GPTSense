A culturally specific support network would be a group or organization that provides services and support to a specific cultural or ethnic community. For example, a support group specifically for Korean Americans who are dealing with mental health issues or a language-learning program offered exclusively to immigrants from a particular country. Another example could be a community center that provides resources and assistance to refugees from specific regions, such as Arabic-speaking refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. These support networks are designed to meet the unique needs and challenges of individuals from specific cultural backgrounds.
