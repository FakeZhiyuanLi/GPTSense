EAL4, or Evaluation Assurance Level 4, is a standard defined in the Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation. It is the second highest level of assurance that a product or system can achieve, and it requires rigorous testing and evaluation of the security functions and features of the product or system. EAL4 evaluates the security requirements of the product or system, the design and implementation of that security, and the testing and verification of the security features. EAL4 provides a high level of confidence in the security of a product or system and is typically required for high-risk applications such as military or government systems.
