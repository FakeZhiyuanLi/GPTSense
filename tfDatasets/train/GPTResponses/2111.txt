Typically, the genetic modification of an organism is performed at the cellular level or at the level of the whole organism, depending on the desired outcome. In most cases, genetically altered organisms are created using recombinant DNA technology, which involves the insertion or deletion of specific genes or genetic material into the organism's DNA. This modification process can occur in various parts of the organism, depending on the type of modification being made. For example, genetic modification of plants often occurs in the seeds or embryos, while modification of animals generally occurs in the cells of the reproductive system.
