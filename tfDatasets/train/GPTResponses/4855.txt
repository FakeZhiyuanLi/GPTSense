is known as adolescence or teenage years. During this period, individuals experience physical, cognitive, and emotional changes as they progress into independence and maturity. Adolescence is typically characterized by hormonal changes that lead to the development of secondary sexual characteristics, brain development that promotes reasoning, problem-solving, and risk-taking, and the need for individuals to establish their identity and place in society. This transition can be challenging for many, but it is an essential and natural process that leads to greater self-awareness, decision-making, and personal growth.
