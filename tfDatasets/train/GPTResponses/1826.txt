Ötzi the Iceman, also known as Ötzi or the Tyrolean Iceman, is a mummified human body that was found in the Ötztal Alps on the border of modern-day Austria and Italy in 1991. He is believed to have lived around 3,300 BCE during the Copper Age. Ötzi's well-preserved body and belongings have provided valuable insights into the life and culture of early humans in Europe. His remains and possessions are displayed at the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology in Bolzano, Italy.
