The fall of the Robespierres was brought about by the Thermidorian Reaction, which occurred on 9 Thermidor Year II (27 July 1794) during the French Revolution. Maximilien Robespierre and his radical faction known as the Committee of Public Safety had been gaining power and executing thousands of individuals under the guise of protecting the Revolution. However, their extremism had alienated many others in the government and led to their downfall. The National Convention, the ruling body of France, turned against Robespierre and his followers and had them arrested and executed without trial. This event marked the end of the Reign of Terror and the radical Jacobin government in France.
