A glass light bulb is typically manufactured using a glass-blowing machine. This process involves heating glass in a furnace and then blowing it into the desired shape using a hollow tube. The glass is then cooled and finished by adding metal wires and a filament. There are specific machines used for different stages of the manufacturing process, including forming, annealing, and cutting.
