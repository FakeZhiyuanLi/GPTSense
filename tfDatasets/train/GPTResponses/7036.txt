The main band members involved in the restoration of Queen's prior projects were Brian May and Roger Taylor. They oversaw and participated in the remastering of the band's entire back catalog, including their albums, singles, and music videos. They also collaborated on the release of several box sets and compilations, featuring previously unreleased material and rare recordings. John Deacon, the former bassist of Queen, has largely retired from the music industry and did not participate in these restoration projects.
