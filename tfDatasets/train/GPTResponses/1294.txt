The new phase of matter that can be considered with a focus on elementary particles is the quark-gluon plasma. It is a state of matter that exists at extremely high temperatures and densities, where quarks and gluons are no longer confined inside individual particles, but instead interact freely with one another. This state of matter is thought to have existed in the early universe, just moments after the Big Bang, before cooling and condensing into the particles we see today. Quark-gluon plasma is currently being studied in particle colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider, to better understand the properties of matter at extreme conditions.
