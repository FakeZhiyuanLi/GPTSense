The distinction between a language and dialect can sometimes lead to social and cultural tensions. The classification of a particular variety of speech as a language or dialect can have implications for how its speakers are perceived and treated by others. For example, a language may be seen as more prestigious or valuable than a dialect, and this can lead to discrimination against speakers of the dialect. Additionally, the classification can also have practical implications, such as determining which variety of speech is used in education, government, and media. In some cases, the decision to classify a variety of speech as a separate language or dialect may be driven more by political or economic factors than linguistic ones.
