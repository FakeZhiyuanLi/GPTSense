A ladder match is typically contested with a championship title or a contract for a future championship opportunity suspended above the ring. To win the ladder match, a wrestler must climb the ladder and retrieve the object suspended above the ring. The winner of the ladder match is the first wrestler to retrieve the object and successfully bring it down to the mat without being interrupted or prevented by the other wrestlers in the match. Once the object is retrieved, the winner is declared and the ladder match is over.
