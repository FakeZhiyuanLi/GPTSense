According to Buddhism, Karma is the law of cause and effect. It refers to the idea that one's actions, both good and bad, have consequences that will affect them in this life and in future lives. The actions one commits in this life will shape their future and determine their fate in the next life. Karma is a central concept in Buddhism as it teaches that one's thoughts, words, and deeds determine their happiness or suffering. In essence, one reaps what they sow, and the effects of oneâ€™s actions can either be positive or negative depending on their intentions and motivations.
