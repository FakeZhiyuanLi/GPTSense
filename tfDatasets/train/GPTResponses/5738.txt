Melbourne's hydraulic facilities helped create a reliable and efficient water supply system that allowed for increased population growth and commercial development. This spurred high-rise development, as the availability of water and sewage services made it more feasible to build tall buildings with large numbers of occupants. The hydraulic facilities also enabled the city to create public parks and gardens, which further helped to attract people to the area and support urban growth. Additionally, the hydraulic facilities allowed for the development of infrastructure such as underground car parks and basements, which facilitated high-rise developments.
