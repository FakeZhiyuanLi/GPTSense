The genome of HIV is a single-stranded RNA molecule. Before its proteins can be synthesized, this RNA molecule must be reverse-transcribed into a double-stranded DNA molecule by the viral enzyme reverse transcriptase. This process is known as reverse transcription and is a key step in the replication of HIV. The resulting DNA molecule is integrated into the host cell's genome and serves as a template for the production of viral proteins by the host cell's protein synthesis machinery.
