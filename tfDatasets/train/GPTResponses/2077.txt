If one party materially violates or breaches its obligations in a treaty, the other parties may choose to take several actions, including:1. Diplomatic Protests - The other parties may lodge a diplomatic protest against the violating party, expressing their concerns and demanding corrective action.2. Economic Sanctions - The other parties can impose economic sanctions on the violating party, such as trade embargoes or freezing its assets.3. Legal Action - The other parties can pursue legal action against the violating party through international courts, such as the International Court of Justice.4. Military Intervention - The other parties may resort to military intervention if the violating party poses a threat to their national security.5. Suspension of Cooperation - The other parties may suspend or terminate their cooperation with the violating party in other related fields.Ultimately, the options available to the other parties will depend on the nature and severity of the violation or breach, as well as the political will of the parties involved.
