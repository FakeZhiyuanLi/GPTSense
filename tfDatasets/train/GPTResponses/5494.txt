It is difficult to provide a definitive answer to this question as there is no way to accurately track the ancestry of all Jews worldwide. However, with the dispersion of Jews throughout the world and increased intermarriage, it is likely that mixed Jewish ancestry is becoming more common. An article in the Jewish Telegraphic Agency states that intermarriage rates among Jews in the United States are at an all-time high, with approximately half of Jews marrying outside the faith. This suggests that a growing number of Jews may have mixed ancestry.
