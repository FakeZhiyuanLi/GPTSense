The third mark of existence in Buddhism is Anatta or Anatman, which translates to "non-self" or "no-soul." It refers to the idea that there is no permanent, unchanging self or individual essence in any living being. Rather, everything is in a state of constant change and interdependence, and all phenomena arise and pass away due to conditions and causes. This concept is central to Buddhist teachings and is seen as crucial in understanding the nature of suffering and the path to enlightenment.
