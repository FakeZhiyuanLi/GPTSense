Darwin considered that different regions could have such different species when they are close together due to the process of natural selection. He believed that small variations in traits could accumulate over time in populations living in different environments, leading to the development of distinct adaptations and ultimately species. Additionally, he recognized that geographical barriers, like mountains or rivers, could limit the movement of organisms and result in the development of unique species in isolated regions.
