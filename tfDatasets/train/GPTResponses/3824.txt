EAL6 (Evaluation Assurance Level 6) is a security standard defined by the Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation. It is one of the highest levels of assurance defined by the Common Criteria, and it requires the most rigorous testing and evaluation procedures.The EAL6 assurance level requires the development and implementation of several security features and mechanisms, including formal methods, separation of duties, and error-checking procedures. It also requires that all security features be evaluated and tested by an independent third-party organization to ensure their effectiveness and reliability.The EAL6 standard is typically used for high-security applications, such as military and government systems, where the consequences of a security breach are severe.
