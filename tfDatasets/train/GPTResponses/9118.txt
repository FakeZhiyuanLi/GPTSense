On January 1st, 1901, the Federation of Australia was officially formed, bringing together the six separate colonies that had existed before into a single unified nation. This day marked the birth of the Commonwealth of Australia, which became a self-governing dominion within the British Empire, although it would not gain full independence until several decades later. The occasion was celebrated with fireworks, parties and parades in cities and towns across the country.
