Populations evolve according to Charles Darwin's theory through the process of natural selection. This means that individuals with favorable traits or adaptations that help them survive and reproduce in their environment are more likely to pass those traits on to their offspring. Over time, these advantageous traits become more common in the population, while less advantageous traits become less common or disappear altogether. This process of survival of the fittest, where individuals with the best adaptations succeed in their environment, is the driving force behind evolution according to Darwin's theory.
