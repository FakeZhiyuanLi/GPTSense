The objective outcome of a ceremonial occasion which acknowledges the defined relationships of its parties can be the reinforcement of those relationships. This can be achieved through the public declaration of those relationships, such as through formalizing a marriage or business partnership, or through the exchange of gifts or symbolic actions that represent the commitment between the parties. The occasion can also serve as a reminder of the duties and responsibilities that come with the defined relationships and can create a sense of unity, respect and loyalty between the parties. Ultimately, the objective outcome is the strengthening of the relationship and the establishment of a shared sense of purpose and connection.
