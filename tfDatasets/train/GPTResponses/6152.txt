Fitna is an Arabic term that can refer to a state of confusion or chaos resulting from a crisis or conflict within a community or society. It can also refer to temptation or sedition, particularly in a religious or moral context. In Islamic theology, it is often associated with the idea of a time of tribulation preceding the end of the world, and can be seen as a test of faith for believers.
