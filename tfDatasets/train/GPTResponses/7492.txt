Humans have used various materials for clothing since prehistoric times, such as animal hides, furs, plant fibers, and woven fabrics. They utilized these materials to create garments that protected them from the elements, helped them adapt to different environments, and provided social and cultural significance. For example, in colder regions, people used animal furs and hides to create warm coats, boots, and hats, while in warmer regions, they used plant fibers such as cotton, linen, and silk to create lighter garments.
