The International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration (IAST) was first proposed by the Sanskrit scholar Sir William Jones in the late 18th century. However, it was not widely adopted as the standard system until the 20th century. Today, IAST is the most commonly used system for transliterating Sanskrit across the academic world.
