The solar radiation that is not reflected back to space is primarily absorbed by the Earth's surface and atmosphere. The atmosphere absorbs some of the radiation, including ultraviolet (UV) radiation, before it reaches the ground. However, much of the solar radiation that reaches the ground is absorbed by land, water, and vegetation. This absorption of solar radiation is what drives many Earth processes, including the water cycle and photosynthesis.
