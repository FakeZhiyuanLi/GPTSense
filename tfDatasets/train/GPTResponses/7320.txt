Film speeds of black-and-white negative film, measured in ISO, have evolved over time. In the early days of film photography, film speeds were much lower, typically around ISO 25-100. However, as technology improved, faster films were developed, with ISO 400 being a popular choice for many years.Today, black-and-white negative film is available in a range of speeds, from low ISO 50 films for high-quality, fine-grain images, to fast ISO 3200 films for low-light or action photography. However, with the rise of digital photography, film photography has become less popular and the range of film speeds available has shrunk.
