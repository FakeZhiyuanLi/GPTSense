There are several factors that could have allowed Victoria freedom from living with her mother, including:1. Age: Victoria may have reached the legal age of majority in her country or state, which would allow her to make her own decisions about where she lives.2. Financial independence: Victoria may have become financially independent through a job, inheritance, or other means, and thus able to support herself without relying on her mother.3. Education: Victoria may have pursued higher education or vocational training, which would require her to live elsewhere for the purpose of attending school.4. Marriage or other partnership: Victoria may have entered into a romantic partnership with someone and chosen to live with them instead of her mother.5. Legal action: Victoria may have sought legal emancipation or filed for guardianship over herself, allowing her to live independently of her mother's control.6. Child protection services: If Victoria was living in an unhealthy or unsafe environment with her mother, child protection services may have intervened and placed her in a different living situation.
