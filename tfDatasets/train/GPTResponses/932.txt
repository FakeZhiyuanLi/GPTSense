It is uncertain where some Slavs migrated with the Vandals, as there is limited historical information on their movements. However, it is known that the Vandals originated in Central Europe and eventually settled in North Africa in the 5th century AD. It is possible that some Slavs joined the Vandals during their migration to North Africa, but this is speculation.
