The United States declared neutrality in the conflict between France and England, and decided not to take sides in the war. President George Washington issued a proclamation of neutrality in April 1793, which stated that the United States would not provide military assistance or weapons to either side. The policy of neutrality was maintained throughout the war, even as tensions rose between the United States and both France and England, and ultimately helped the young nation avoid being pulled into the conflict.
