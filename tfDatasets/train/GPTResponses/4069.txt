Research on trait impulsivity resulted in support for the action tendency model. Impulsivity refers to a tendency to act on impulse rather than thinking through potential consequences. The action tendency model suggests that behavior is guided by automatic action tendencies, which are triggered by situational cues. Impulsive individuals are more likely to act on these automatic action tendencies, providing support for the model.
