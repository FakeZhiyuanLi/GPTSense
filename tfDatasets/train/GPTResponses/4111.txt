Houston's economy had problems in the late 1980s mainly due to the collapse of the oil industry. As Texas' major city for oil and gas production, Houston experienced a significant decline in the demand for oil and a subsequent drop in its prices. This led to the closure of several oil drilling sites and caused job losses, which put a strain on the local economy. Additionally, the real estate market also experienced a downturn, with many commercial properties going bankrupt, leading to a further slump in the economy. The combination of these factors led to a recession in Houston, leaving many businesses and individuals struggling.
