The British colonists typically recorded more complete identities of West Africans than other colonists, as they were more involved in the slave trade and had a more extensive system for documenting enslaved peoples' identities. Additionally, the British slave trade was more focused on the importation of enslaved peoples, rather than the exploitation of those already living in the Americas, which may have contributed to their more detailed record-keeping.
