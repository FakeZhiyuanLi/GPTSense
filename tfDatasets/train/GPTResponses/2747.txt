The Nizari Ismaili community has a set protocol in place in case the Imam fails to leave a successor. It is believed that the Imam would appoint a council of high-ranking members to guide the community until a new Imam is appointed. The council would collect divine guidance and work to choose a new Imam from the descendants of the Prophet Muhammad, as has been the tradition of the Nizari Ismaili community for centuries. The process for selecting a new Imam can be lengthy and intricate, and the community would continue to be led by the appointed council until a new Imam is chosen.
