Films were banned by Victorian politicians in 1912 due to concerns about their content and impact on society. There were fears that films were promoting inappropriate behavior, glorifying crime, and glorifying immoral behaviors, such as drinking and smoking. Additionally, some politicians felt that films were a new form of entertainment that was not adequately regulated, and that they could be used to spread propaganda or incite violence. As a result, the government passed the Cinematograph Act in 1912, which established a system of censorship and regulation for films. This act required all films to be submitted for review by a government-appointed board, and prohibited the exhibition of films deemed to be offensive or harmful to society.
