If a treaty was designed to terminate under certain conditions and those conditions are actually met, then the treaty will terminate as specified in the treaty itself. The treaty will no longer be in force, and both parties will be released from their obligations under the treaty. The termination of the treaty is usually effective immediately or after a stipulated period of time, as specified in the treaty. The provisions of the treaty will no longer be binding, and the parties may negotiate a new treaty or enter into a new agreement that addresses the changed circumstances.
