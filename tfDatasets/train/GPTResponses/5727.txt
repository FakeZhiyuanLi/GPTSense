These objects revealed the high level of craftsmanship achieved by Hellenistic artists and showcased their ability to blend traditional classical style with influences from the East. The discovery also shed new light on ancient Macedonian history and promoted a re-evaluation of Hellenistic art as a unique and innovative period in ancient Greek art.
