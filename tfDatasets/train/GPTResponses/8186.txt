Romanticism did not have a specific end, but it gradually gave way to new forms of artistic expression and cultural movements in the mid-19th century. The rise of Realism and Naturalism as literary and artistic movements in the 1850s and 1860s marked a shift away from the subjective and idealized vision of Romanticism towards a more objective and realistic representation of the world. Additionally, the political and social turmoil of the 19th century, such as the revolutions of 1848 and the rise of industrialization, also contributed to a changing cultural landscape that was less conducive to the romantic ideals of individualism and nostalgia.
