It is difficult to determine which specific indicator will be present as it depends on the country and the ranking being referred to. However, typically, a decrease in a country's ranking is indicative of a decline in its performance in one or more indicators or criteria being used to assess the ranking. Some of the indicators commonly used for country rankings include economic performance, health outcomes, education attainment, environmental sustainability, political stability, and human rights, among others. Therefore, the specific indicator or indicators that contributed to the decrease in ranking will be evident in the ranking report or scorecard.
