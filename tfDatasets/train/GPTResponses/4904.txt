One model that implies that changes in diversity are guided by a first-order positive feedback is the "Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis" (IDH) model. The IDH suggests that moderate levels of disturbance promote high levels of species diversity through a positive feedback loop. In this model, disturbance creates gaps in ecological niches, allowing new species to colonize and coexist with existing ones. As diversity increases, competition for resources intensifies, increasing the likelihood of further disturbances. This positive feedback loop leads to an increase in diversity until saturation is reached, after which diversity stabilizes. Overall, the IDH model implies that moderate disturbances increase diversity through a first-order positive feedback.
