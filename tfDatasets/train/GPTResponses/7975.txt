During the Heian period, the Japanese believed that one's calligraphy could reflect their soul. They viewed calligraphy as an art form and believed that the skill and style of one's writing could reveal a person's character, creativity, and innermost thoughts and feelings. Writing was also an important social skill, as handwritten letters and documents were the primary form of communication in that era. As such, calligraphy became an essential part of education and culture in Heian Japan.
