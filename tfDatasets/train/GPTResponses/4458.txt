Copper bondings are weaker than other metals for several reasons:1. Copper has only one valence electron, making it easier to lose or share this electron.2. Copper has a relatively low electronegativity, meaning it has less of a tendency to attract electrons.3. Copper atoms are relatively large, which makes it difficult for them to pack together tightly and form strong metallic bonds.4. Copper has a partially filled d-orbital, which makes it more susceptible to forming weaker metallic bonds.Overall, these factors make copper weaker than other metals when it comes to forming metallic bonds.
