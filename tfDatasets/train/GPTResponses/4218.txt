One problem that hurt the Nintendo Wii console was the lack of third-party support. While Nintendo had a lot of strong first-party titles, the console struggled to attract major third-party developers like EA and Activision. This resulted in a limited selection of games compared to its competitors, and many of the games that were available on other platforms were inferior on the Wii due to its technical limitations. Additionally, the Wii's motion controls, while innovative at the time, were criticized for being imprecise and for limiting the types of games that could be played on the console.
