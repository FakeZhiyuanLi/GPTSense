The selection of nobility in the Polish kingdom was based on birthright and ancestry. Membership in the nobility was usually passed down from generation to generation, and only those born into noble families were considered members of the Polish nobility. However, in some cases, individuals could be granted noble titles by the king for their service to the country. Overall, the selection of nobility in Poland was not based on individual merit or achievement, but rather on a family's social status and wealth.
