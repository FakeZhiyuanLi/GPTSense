The earliest records of human migration were not recorded but were hypothesized and studied through various fields such as archaeology, genetics, linguistics, and anthropology. These studies reveal that human migration began as early as 1.8 million years ago, when Homo erectus migrated out of Africa into Eurasia. However, the oldest recorded account of migration comes from the Bible's story of Adam and Eve being expelled from the Garden of Eden. The Mesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh also describes the travels of its eponymous hero to various lands.
