The building on George IV Bridge that was used by the Scottish Parliament, known as the Old Assembly Rooms, was eventually returned to its previous use as a venue for cultural events and exhibitions. It was also leased to various organizations and businesses, including a restaurant and a recording studio. The building underwent extensive renovations in the early 2000s to restore it to its original grandeur.
