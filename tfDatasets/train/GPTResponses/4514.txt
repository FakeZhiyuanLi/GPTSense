There are several theorists whose ideas concerning stages of development have been supported by evidence. Here are a few examples:1. Jean Piaget - Piaget's theory of cognitive development suggests that children progress through four stages of thinking: the sensorimotor stage, the preoperational stage, the concrete operational stage, and the formal operational stage. There is support for Piaget's theory, with evidence showing that children do indeed go through these stages in a predictable sequence.2. Erik Erikson - Erikson's theory of psychosocial development proposes that individuals progress through eight stages of psychosocial development, with each stage characterized by a unique crisis or conflict that must be resolved. There is some supporting evidence for Erikson's theory, although some critics argue that the theory is too broad and that it does not fully account for individual differences.3. Lawrence Kohlberg - Kohlberg's theory of moral development proposes that individuals progress through six stages of moral reasoning, with each stage characterized by a different level of moral reasoning. There is some supporting evidence for Kohlberg's theory, although some critics argue that the theory is too focused on Western values and may not fully apply to individuals from other cultural backgrounds.4. Sigmund Freud - Freud's theory of psychosexual development suggests that individuals progress through five stages of psychosexual development, with each stage characterized by a different focus on erogenous zones. While there is some evidence to support Freud's theory, many critics argue that it is outdated and not fully supported by modern research.
