Harper Lee uses the narrative technique of a first-person point of view through the eyes of Scout, the child protagonist, to combine the adult's perspective, which is presented through Scout's reflections and musings. Scout's observations and innocence are balanced with the wisdom and experience of her older self, who narrates the story, creating a unique blend of past and present perspectives that provide a multifaceted view of the events and characters. Thus, the combination of the child's perspectives and adult's reflections in the narration helps to add depth and complexity to the story's themes and characters.
