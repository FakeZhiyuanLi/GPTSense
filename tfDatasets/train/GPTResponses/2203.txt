According to Tabari and Ibn Hisham, 600-900 members of the Banu Qurayza were beheaded after surrendering to Muhammad and his followers. However, some other sources suggest a lower number of executions, with estimates ranging from 100 to 300. The exact number remains a topic of debate among historians.
