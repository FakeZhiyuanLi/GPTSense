General Gaafar al-Nimeiry invited members of the Sudanese Communist Party (SCP) to serve in his government in 1977. This move was part of his efforts to improve relations with the leftist opposition in Sudan and to consolidate his grip on power. However, the SCP withdrew its support from al-Nimeiry's regime in 1979, and the government launched a campaign of repression against the party and its supporters.
