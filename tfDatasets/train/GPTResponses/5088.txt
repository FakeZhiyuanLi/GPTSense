Many animals are sensitive to the reduction in habitat area, but some of the most vulnerable include:1. Large mammals such as elephants, tigers, and rhinoceroses2. Primates like chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans3. Birds like forest-dependent species such as parrots and toucans4. Amphibians such as frogs and salamanders5. Reptiles like turtles and snakes6. Insects such as bees, butterflies, and beetles7. Fish like salmon and trout8. Mollusks such as clams and musselsThese animals are more sensitive to habitat reduction because they require large areas of undisturbed forest, rainforest, wetland, or grassland to survive. As their habitat shrinks, their populations become more isolated and fragmented, making it harder for them to find food, shelter, and mates. Additionally, habitat reduction increases the likelihood of human-wildlife conflict, disease outbreaks, and poaching, which further threaten their survival.
