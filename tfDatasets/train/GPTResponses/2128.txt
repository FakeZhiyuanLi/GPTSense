One component of wood that scientists are still trying to learn about its degradation by bacteria is lignin. Lignin is a complex and highly resistant molecule that gives wood its strength and durability. It is difficult to break down and decompose, and only a few bacterial species have been found to be able to degrade it. Understanding how bacteria are able to break down lignin could have important implications for developing new biotechnological processes for converting lignocellulosic biomass into useful products.
