During World War II, the Allied powers, including Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, raided German territories regularly. These raids targeted military installations, factories, transportation systems, and other strategic locations. The Allied powers hoped to weaken the German war effort and disrupt their ability to produce military equipment and supplies. The raids were carried out by air, land, and sea, and caused significant damage and casualties. The most well-known and devastating raids were the bombing raids on German cities like Dresden, Hamburg, and Berlin.
