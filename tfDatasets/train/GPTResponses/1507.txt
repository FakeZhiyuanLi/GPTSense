The Slavs that assimilated into the Magyar or Romanian population remained in Hungary and Romania, respectively. They adopted the customs, language, and culture of the dominant ethnic group and became part of the larger society. Today, there are still pockets of Slavic communities in these countries, but they have largely assimilated into the broader society.
