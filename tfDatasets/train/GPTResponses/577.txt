The land under the Tibetan Empire was from the 7th century AD to the 9th century AD. The territory under Chinese control has varied throughout history, with some periods of control over Tibet dating back to the Tang dynasty (618-907 AD), but most notably in the 20th century following the Chinese invasion of Tibet in 1950.
