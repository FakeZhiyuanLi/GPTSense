The closest known living relatives of animals are thought to be the choanoflagellates, which are single-celled organisms that live in aquatic environments. They are a type of protist and are known for their unique morphology, with a central flagellum surrounded by a collar of microvilli. Choanoflagellates are thought to be similar to the ancestral organisms that gave rise to animals, and they share many characteristics with animals, including the use of collagen and the presence of similar genes involved in cell signaling and adhesion.
