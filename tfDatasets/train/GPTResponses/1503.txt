The compilation of Isidore of Seville's work is called the Etymologiae (also known as the Etymologies or Originum). It is an encyclopedia that covers a broad range of subject matter, including grammar, theology, philosophy, natural sciences, and many other topics. It is one of the most influential works of the Middle Ages and was widely used as a textbook in universities and schools until the end of the Renaissance.
