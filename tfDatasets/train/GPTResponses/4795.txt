This can vary greatly based on personal preferences, cultural norms, and individual social experiences. In some cases, children may be more likely to associate with friends of the same sex, especially during early childhood years when gender-role stereotypes are typically reinforced. However, as children enter into adolescence and begin to explore romantic and sexual relationships, they may become more likely to form close friendships with individuals of the opposite sex. Ultimately, the extent to which children and adolescents associate with friends of the opposite sex depends on a variety of social, cultural, and individual factors that can vary from person to person.
