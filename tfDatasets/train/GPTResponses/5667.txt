There are several possible scenarios that could occur when a closeted homosexual is in a heterosexual relationship:1. The person may experience internal conflict about their sexual orientation, and may struggle to reconcile their feelings with their partner's expectations.2. The person may engage in behaviors that suppress or deny their same-sex attraction, such as avoiding certain topics or activities that might reveal their true feelings.3. The person may experience feelings of isolation and fear, as they keep their sexuality a secret from their partner and those around them.4. The person may feel pressured to conform to societal norms and expectations, and may feel guilty or ashamed about their sexuality.5. Over time, the strain of hiding one's sexuality can cause emotional stress and strain on the relationship, leading to feelings of resentment, anger, and distance between partners.Ultimately, the scenario will depend on the individual circumstances of the relationship, and how each person chooses to approach and cope with their feelings.
