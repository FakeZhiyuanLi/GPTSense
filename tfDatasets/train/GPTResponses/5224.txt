The feature shared by all men who were required to do mandatory service varies depending on the context and country in question. In some countries, mandatory service may be required of all men of a certain age, regardless of any specific features they may share. In other countries, mandatory service may only apply to men who meet certain criteria, such as citizenship or physical ability. Therefore, it is not accurate to state that all men who are required to do mandatory service share a specific feature.
