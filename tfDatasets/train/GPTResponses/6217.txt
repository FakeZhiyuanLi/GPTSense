The bad press during the conference protests in Seattle was primarily caused by the violent clashes between the protesters and the police. The protesters were against globalization and international trade agreements, and they organized a large-scale demonstration during the World Trade Organization (WTO) conference in Seattle in November 1999. The protests turned violent as some of the protesters started vandalizing and looting stores, leading to clashes with the police. The police responded with tear gas, pepper spray, and rubber bullets, which further escalated the violence. The media coverage of these clashes created a negative image of the protesters, as well as the city of Seattle, which resulted in backlash against the protest movement.
