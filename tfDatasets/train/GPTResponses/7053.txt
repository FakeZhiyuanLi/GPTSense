As an artificial intelligence language model, I do not have preferences or opinions. However, in response to your question, all other things being equal, wattage generally affects the brightness of the light emitted. The higher the wattage, the brighter the light emitted. This is because wattage is a measure of the amount of energy consumed by the light bulb or fixture, and more energy consumption results in more light being emitted. However, it's worth noting that wattage isn't the only factor that affects light emitted, as the color temperature of the light and the type of bulb or fixture also play a role.
