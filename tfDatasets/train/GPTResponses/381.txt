One example of a prime minister who reiterated the principles of cabinet solidarity is Justin Trudeau, the current Prime Minister of Canada. In 2019, he emphasized the importance of cabinet solidarity when former Cabinet minister Jody Wilson-Raybould accused him and his inner circle of pressuring her to interfere in a criminal case involving a major Canadian company. Despite the controversy and the calls for her removal from the Liberal Party, Trudeau stood by Wilson-Raybould and the principle of cabinet solidarity.
