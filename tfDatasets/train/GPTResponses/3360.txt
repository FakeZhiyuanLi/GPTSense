In Beethoven's sixth symphony, the piccolo and trombones provide the illusion of storm and thunder. They are used in the fourth movement, which is called "Thunderstorm." The piccolo plays rapid, high-pitched notes to simulate raindrops, while the trombones play low, rumbling notes to imitate thunder. This creates a vivid depiction of a storm, adding to the overall programmatic nature of the piece.
