The culture of Myanmar, also known as Burma, has grown over thousands of years, with ancient kingdoms such as the Pyu, Mon, and Bagan influencing art, religion, and language. However, the most significant development of Myanmar's culture occurred during the 9th to 13th centuries when the Bagan Kingdom flourished, leaving behind impressive architecture, art, and literature that continue to influence modern-day Myanmar.
