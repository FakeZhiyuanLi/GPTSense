The Vietnam War was part of the larger US policy of containment, which aimed to prevent the spread of communism during the Cold War. The United States saw communist expansion as a threat to global security and sought to stop it by providing aid to friendly governments, supporting anticommunist forces, and engaging in military action. In Vietnam, the US government supported the South Vietnamese government in its fight against North Vietnam, which was backed by communist allies such as China and the Soviet Union. The US believed that losing Vietnam to communism would have a domino effect, leading to other countries in the region falling under communist control.
