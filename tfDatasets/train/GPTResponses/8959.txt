In Czech, the verb form encodes information about the subject's person, number, and gender. Czech verbs are inflected based on the subject's grammatical category, which includes whether the subject is singular or plural, masculine or feminine, and first, second, or third person. Additionally, the verb form may indicate the mood and tense of the sentence. Therefore, the verb form in Czech provides substantial information about the subject, and it is an essential tool for understanding the grammar of the language.
