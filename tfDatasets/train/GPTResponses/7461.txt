?Users of pesticides can make the choice to follow label instructions carefully, including wearing protective clothing, applying the pesticide only in recommended amounts and methods, and avoiding applying the pesticide in areas where it could contaminate water sources, food crops, or non-target plants or animals. Choosing less toxic or non-toxic alternatives, such as natural or biological pesticides, can also lower risks. Proper handling, storage, and disposal of pesticide containers and waste can also reduce the risk of exposure and environmental contamination.
