The United States Constitution and its amendments restrict the federal government's enforcement powers, as they outline the government's limited powers and protect individual rights. Additionally, Congress, the courts, and the executive branch have played a role in further defining and limiting federal enforcement powers through legislation, judicial decisions, and executive orders.
