Modern genetic engineering techniques can create various types of DNA repair mechanisms. One common technique is site-directed mutagenesis, which introduces specific mutations in the DNA sequence of a gene to alter its functions. Another technique is gene editing, where specific genes are targeted and modified using molecular tools such as CRISPR-Cas9. This technique can also be used to repair genetic mutations by cutting out defective parts of the DNA and replacing them with healthy ones. Another approach is the use of DNA repair enzymes such as nucleases and polymerases, which can repair DNA damage caused by environmental factors such as UV radiation and chemical exposure. Overall, modern genetic engineering techniques enable the creation of targeted and precise DNA repair mechanisms to improve genetic functions and eliminate genetic disorders.
