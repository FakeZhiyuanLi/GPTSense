Interagency Agreements (IAAs) are formal agreements between agencies of the federal government, outlining how they will work together to achieve common goals or objectives. IAAs facilitate collaboration, coordination, and cooperation between agencies, while providing a framework for the exchange of information, resources, and expertise. IAAs can cover a wide range of activities, including joint research and development efforts, shared use of equipment or facilities, and the provision of technical assistance or support services.
