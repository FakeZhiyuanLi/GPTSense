Accepting other cultures in their own terms moderates the potential for misunderstanding, conflicts, and ignorance between different cultures. It leads to a more inclusive and diverse society where people are able to appreciate and celebrate cultural differences, rather than fear or reject them. Additionally, it allows for better communication and cooperation between different cultures, facilitating greater social harmony and mutual respect.
