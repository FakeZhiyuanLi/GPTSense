The term "parthenos" is a Greek word that means "virgin" or "young unmarried woman." It is often used in reference to the virginity of the Greek goddess Athena, who was known as "Athena Parthenos." It can also be used in a broader sense to refer to any young woman who has not yet been married or had sexual intercourse.
