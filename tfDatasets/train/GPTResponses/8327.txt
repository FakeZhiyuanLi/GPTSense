This is a highly debated and complex issue with varying perspectives. Some argue that the government or institutions that have historically discriminated against black individuals (such as banks, housing authorities, and universities) should be responsible for providing compensation. Others believe that individual taxpayers or society as a whole should bear the burden of reparations. Ultimately, there is no clear consensus on who should bear the responsibility for rectifying past injustices.
