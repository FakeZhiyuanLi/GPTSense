Sharia law is being used in some Nigerian states that have predominantly Muslim populations. These states include Zamfara, Sokoto, Kano, Katsina, Bauchi, Niger, Kaduna and Yobe. Sharia law is a set of Islamic principles and guidelines that regulate the social, economic, and political aspects of life. In these Nigerian states, Sharia law is applied to matters such as marriage, divorce, inheritance, and criminal justice. However, Sharia law is not universally applied in Nigeria, as many states with predominantly Christian populations do not use it.
