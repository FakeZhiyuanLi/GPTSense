is known as a layered defense system, which consists of multiple defensive measures designed to protect the carrier and its accompanying ships from various threats such as enemy aircraft, missiles, and submarines.The first layer of the defense system is typically the carrier's own air wing, consisting of fighter jets and other aircraft that can intercept and engage incoming threats. The carrier's radar systems also provide early warning of incoming attacks.The second layer of defense is provided by escort ships, such as destroyers, that are equipped with air defense systems, such as missile launchers and anti-aircraft guns. These ships can engage incoming threats before they reach the carrier.The third layer of defense is provided by land-based air defense systems, such as Patriot missile batteries, that are deployed on nearby islands or on the carrier itself. These systems can intercept incoming threats that have bypassed the carrier's air wing and escort ships.Finally, the carrier group may also have specialized anti-submarine warfare assets, such as helicopters or submarines, that can detect and neutralize enemy submarines that may be operating in the vicinity of the carrier.Overall, the goal of the layered defense system is to provide multiple opportunities to detect, track, and engage incoming threats, thereby reducing the risk of damage or destruction to the carrier group.
