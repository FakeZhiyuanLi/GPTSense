In the late 6th century, religious instruction was commonly received through the practice of monasticism. Monks and nuns lived in monasteries or convents, where they devoted their lives to prayer, worship, and study of the scriptures. Monks and nuns would often spend many hours a day reading and copying religious texts, such as the Bible, and would also engage in meditation, contemplation, and spiritual exercises.In addition to monasticism, religious instruction was also provided through the teachings of priests and bishops, who delivered sermons and led congregations in worship. Churches and religious sites, such as cathedrals, were also important centers of learning and instruction, providing spaces for prayer, education, and community gathering.Outside of formal religious settings, storytelling and folk traditions were another way in which religious instruction was conveyed to the general population. Folktales, legends, and myths often had religious themes and moral messages, and could be used as a way of transmitting religious values and beliefs to a wider audience.
