The attempt to establish a devolved Scottish Assembly in 1979 was not successful. A referendum was held in Scotland in which the majority voted in favor of the proposal, but 40% of the total electorate was not reached, which was a requirement for the referendum to be valid. As a result, the proposal did not become law. This was seen as a significant setback for Scottish devolution, and it took another 18 years before a Scottish Parliament was established in 1997.
