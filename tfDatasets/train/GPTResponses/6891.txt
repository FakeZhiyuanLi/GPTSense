Extensive pretrial discovery is a part of the legal process in civil and criminal cases where both parties exchange information and evidence relevant to the case before the trial. This helps each party to prepare their case and avoid surprises during the trial. Pretrial discovery may include depositions, interrogatories, requests for production of documents, and requests for admissions. The goal of extensive pretrial discovery is to promote fairness, efficiency, and accuracy in the judicial process.
