Vitamin D is synthesized in the skin when it is exposed to UVB rays from the sun. The UVB rays interact with a type of cholesterol present in the skin, called 7-dehydrocholesterol, to eventually produce Vitamin D3. Additionally, dietary sources of Vitamin D include fatty fish, egg yolks, and fortified foods such as milk and cereals.
