The process of converting sunlight into energy is called photosynthesis.Photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells and involves a series of chemical reactions. These reactions involve the absorption of light energy by chlorophyll molecules, which are found in specialized structures called thylakoids.The absorbed light energy is used to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen ions and electrons are used to produce ATP (energy) and NADPH (a molecule used in other chemical reactions).The ATP and NADPH are then used to power the second stage of photosynthesis, called the Calvin cycle. In this stage, carbon dioxide is fixed into glucose, a process that requires energy. The glucose is then used by the plant for energy and to build other molecules like cellulose, which makes up the cell walls of plants.Overall, photosynthesis is a complex process that involves a series of chemical reactions that convert sunlight into chemical energy that is stored in glucose molecules.
