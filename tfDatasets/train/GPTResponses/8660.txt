Alexander von Humboldt himself is considered the model for Humboldtian science. He believed that scientific research should be interdisciplinary, based on detailed empirical observations, and guided by a holistic understanding of the natural world. Humboldt's approach to science emphasized the importance of understanding the relationships between different aspects of the natural world, such as geology, botany, and climate. His ideas influenced many other scientists and led to the development of modern scientific disciplines such as ecology and biogeography.
