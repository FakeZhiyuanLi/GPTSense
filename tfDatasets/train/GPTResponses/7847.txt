Following the development of feudalism in medieval Europe, the aristocracy's primary occupation became that of landownership and management. They controlled vast estates and worked as landlords, overseeing the cultivation of crops and the management of tenants and serfs. Many members of the aristocracy also held positions of power within the political and military structures, serving as advisors to monarchs and leading armies in times of war. Over time, the aristocracy also developed significant cultural and social influence, becoming patrons of the arts and setting standards for manners, education, and social behavior.
