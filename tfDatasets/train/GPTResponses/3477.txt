Alpine crystals have been studied and collected for hundreds of years, dating back to the early days of mineralogy in the 18th and 19th centuries. The mountainous regions of Europe, particularly the Alps, were some of the first places where mineral specimens were systematically collected and studied. Today, alpine crystals continue to be a popular subject of study among mineralogists and collectors.
