The Gupta dynasty was derived from the Varman dynasty, which ruled in the eastern region of India around the 3rd century AD. The founder of the Gupta dynasty, Chandragupta I, married a Lichchhavi princess, which helped him gain control over the Magadha region. Over time, the Gupta dynasty expanded its rule and became one of the greatest empires in ancient India.
