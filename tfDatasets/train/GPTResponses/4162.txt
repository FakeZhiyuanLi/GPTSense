During the Vietnam War, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was primarily concerned with activities related to domestic dissent and anti-war movements. This included monitoring and investigating civil rights and anti-war activists, student groups, and organizations opposed to the war, such as the Black Panthers and Students for a Democratic Society (SDS).The FBI also closely monitored draft resistance and protest activities, including monitoring the distribution of anti-war literature and organizing efforts, and working with local law enforcement to disrupt anti-war rallies and demonstrations.In addition, the FBI was involved in tracking and disrupting efforts by foreign governments to influence American policy on the war, particularly those from communist countries such as the Soviet Union and China. This included monitoring their diplomatic missions, intelligence-gathering activities, and propaganda campaigns, and working with other government agencies to prevent or counteract their efforts.Overall, the FBI's primary focus during the Vietnam War was on domestic surveillance and counterintelligence activities aimed at maintaining national security and law and order during a time of significant societal turmoil and dissent.
