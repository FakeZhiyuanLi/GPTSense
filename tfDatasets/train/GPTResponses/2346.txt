DVB (Digital Video Broadcasting) is a set of international standards for digital television broadcasting. These standards specify various aspects of digital broadcasting, including the transmission technology, compression techniques, and encryption standards. DVB standards are used across Europe, Asia, and other parts of the world for the transmission of digital TV signals. This technology allows for higher quality video and audio signals, greater program selection, and other interactive features such as electronic program guides and video on demand.
