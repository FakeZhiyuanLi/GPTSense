There are several historians and scholars who argue that Napoleon's triumphs at Austerlitz and Jena increased his self-grandiosity. Some of these include:1. Andrew Roberts - In his book "Napoleon: A Life," Roberts argues that Napoleon's military success in these battles contributed to his belief in his own greatness and invincibility.2. Robert Asprey - In his book "The Rise of Napoleon Bonaparte," Asprey suggests that Napoleon's victories at Austerlitz and Jena led him to become increasingly autocratic and to view himself as a kind of demigod.3. Steven Englund - In his book "Napoleon: A Political Life," Englund argues that Napoleon's success in these battles was a significant factor in his decision to declare himself emperor and to pursue conquests that ultimately led to his downfall.
