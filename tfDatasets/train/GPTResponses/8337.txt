Geological maps are created using a combination of field observations, geological surveys, satellite imagery, topographic maps, geophysical data, and computer software. Geologists and researchers in the field collect data and create geologic maps that identify and describe geological formations, rock types, soil types, and other geological features. These maps are then used by professionals in a variety of fields, including mining, oil and gas exploration, environmental assessment, and geology research. Computer software such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS) allows this data to be compiled and analyzed for use in decision-making and planning.
