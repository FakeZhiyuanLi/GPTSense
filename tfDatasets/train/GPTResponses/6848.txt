The exclusionary rule provided for the suppression of evidence obtained illegally by law enforcement officials. It prevented evidence obtained through police misconduct or violations of the Fourth Amendment from being used against a defendant in court. The purpose of this rule was to discourage law enforcement officials from engaging in unconstitutional practices and to protect the privacy rights of citizens.
