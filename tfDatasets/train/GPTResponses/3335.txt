The Marshall Islanders were skilled navigators and used a variety of traditional navigation aids, including the stars, currents, wind, waves, clouds, and bird behavior. They also used stick charts, which were made of coconut fiber and depicted the ocean currents and island locations. The stick charts allowed them to navigate between the islands even when they were out of sight. In addition, they used lighthouses made of coral and stones to navigate at night. The Marshall Islands were also known for their canoe-building skills, which were crucial to their ability to navigate and travel long distances across the ocean. Overall, the navigation techniques of the Marshall Islanders were developed over centuries of seafaring and represent a remarkable achievement in the history of navigation.
