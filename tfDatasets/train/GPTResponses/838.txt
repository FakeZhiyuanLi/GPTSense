The credit crunch was deepened when demand and employment fell because it created a chain reaction that affected different sectors of the economy. When demand for goods and services fell, businesses had to reduce their production and lay off workers. This led to a decrease in consumer spending, which further reduced demand and employment. As more people lost their jobs, they became unable to repay their debts and defaulted on their loans. This caused banks and other financial institutions to suffer losses, which in turn led to a tightening of credit conditions. Banks became hesitant to lend money, as they feared losing more money if borrowers could not repay their loans. This lack of liquidity in the credit market made it difficult for businesses to secure funding, which further worsened the economic downturn. In short, the credit crunch was deepened by the interconnectedness of the various sectors of the economy, and the decline in demand and employment was a major contributing factor.
