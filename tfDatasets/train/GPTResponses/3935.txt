The Plan de Guadalupe, issued in 1913, refused to recognize Porfirio Díaz as the president of Mexico. Instead, it supported the rebel leader Venustiano Carranza as the rightful leader of the country. The plan was instrumental in initiating the Mexican Revolution, which ultimately led to the overthrow of the Díaz regime and the establishment of a new government.
