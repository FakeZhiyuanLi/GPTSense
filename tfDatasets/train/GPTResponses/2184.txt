Alleles assort independently during meiosis, specifically during the process of gene segregation. This means that each allele of a gene has an equal chance of being passed on to the offspring. Independent assortment occurs because the chromosomes that carry different genes are randomly aligned during meiosis I. This allows for the independent segregation of alleles on different chromosomes, leading to new combinations of alleles in the offspring.
