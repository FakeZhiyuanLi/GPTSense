One health issue that is becoming increasingly common in developing countries is non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. These diseases are often the result of lifestyle factors such as poor diet, lack of exercise, and exposure to environmental pollutants. As developing countries continue to experience rapid economic growth and urbanization, these lifestyle factors are becoming more prevalent, leading to a rising incidence of non-communicable diseases. This trend is especially concerning because these diseases can be difficult and expensive to treat, placing a significant burden on the healthcare systems of these countries.
