It depends on the specific type of triploblastic worm being referred to. Different types of worms can vary greatly in size. Some triploblastic worms are small enough to be microscopic, while others can grow to several meters in length, such as the giant tube worm (Riftia pachyptila) found near hydrothermal vents.
