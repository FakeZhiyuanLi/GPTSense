The Federalist Party supported the ratification of the U.S Constitution and a strong central government with expanded powers over the individual states. They favored a system of checks and balances and believed in the importance of a standing army and a national bank. The party was founded by Alexander Hamilton, John Adams, and other prominent Federalists who sought to establish a stable government and economy after the American Revolution.
