To form passive voice in Czech, the subject of the sentence becomes the object and the object becomes the subject. The verb is then conjugated in passive voice with the appropriate declension. Additionally, the auxiliary verb "být" (to be) is used in the appropriate tense to indicate the passive voice. For example:Active voice: Peter pije víno. (Peter drinks wine.)Passive voice: Víno je pijeno Petrem. (Wine is drunk by Peter.)In this example, "Peter" becomes the object (Petrem) and "víno" becomes the subject (víno je). The verb "pije" (drinks) is conjugated as "je pijeno" in passive voice, and the auxiliary verb "být" is used to indicate the passive voice.
