The presence of infrared absorbers, such as greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and water vapor, contribute to the warming effect on Earth's atmosphere. These gases absorb and trap outgoing infrared radiation, preventing it from escaping into space and trapping it within the atmosphere. This causes an increase in temperature, which is commonly known as the greenhouse effect. Without these greenhouse gases, Earth's average temperature would be much colder, making it difficult to support life as we know it. However, the excessive emission of greenhouse gases due to human activities has led to an accelerated warming of the planet, which can have harmful effects on the environment and human societies.
