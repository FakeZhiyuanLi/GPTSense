Yes, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has established a single standard for HDTV color support known as ITU-R BT.709. This standard specifies the chromaticity coordinates and luminance levels for the red, green, and blue primaries used in HDTV systems. It also defines the gamma correction curve and the color space used for encoding and decoding HDTV signals. This standard is widely adopted and supported by HDTV manufacturers and broadcasters worldwide.
