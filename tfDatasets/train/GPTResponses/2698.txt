In the late Middle Ages, infantry was used with increasing frequency alongside light cavalry. Infantry was often composed of peasant levies and mercenaries armed with polearms or bows. They were employed to provide a stable base upon which the cavalry could maneuver, and to protect the flanks and rear of the army. The increasing use of firearms also contributed to the rise of infantry in late medieval warfare.
