The main cause of a beer belly is believed to be excess consumption of calories, particularly from carbohydrates and sugar, as well as a lack of physical activity. This can lead to excess fat accumulation in the abdominal area, even in individuals who are not necessarily overweight or obese overall. Additionally, alcohol consumption can contribute to inflammation and fluid retention in the stomach area, which can exacerbate the appearance of a beer belly.
