One factor that hurt Bermuda's merchant shipping was the increase in piracy in the Caribbean during the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Pirates often targeted ships carrying valuable cargo, causing significant losses for Bermuda's merchants. Additionally, the loss of British privileges such as the Navigation Acts in the late 18th century and the decline of the British West Indies trade after abolition hurt Bermuda's economy and merchant shipping industry.
