Thermal mass refers to the ability of a material to absorb and store heat energy. Materials with high thermal mass, such as concrete or brick, have the ability to absorb and retain heat, which can help regulate temperature and reduce energy use in buildings. This is often used in passive solar design, where thermal mass is strategically placed to absorb and store heat from the sun during the day and release it at night when temperatures cool.
