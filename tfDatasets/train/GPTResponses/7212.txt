Plants depend on various factors in their environment, such as:1. Sunlight: Plants need sunlight to carry out photosynthesis and produce food.2. Water: Plants absorb water through their roots and use it for various functions like transporting nutrients, maintaining tissue rigidity, and photosynthesis.3. Soil: Soil is where plants take root and grow. It provides a medium for the roots to absorb nutrients and water, and also provides support for the plant.4. Nutrients: Plants require various nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium for their growth and development.5. Temperature: Plants have specific temperature requirements to grow and thrive.6. Air: Plants breathe in carbon dioxide and release oxygen into the environment. They also rely on air movement for pollination and dispersal of seeds.7. Humidity: Plants require adequate humidity for their growth and development.8. Climate: Plants thrive in specific climates and are adapted to survive in their natural habitats.
