There are several world events that have contributed to the increased need for petrochemicals, but one major event was the Industrial Revolution that began in the 18th century. This period saw a rapid development in manufacturing, transportation, and infrastructure, which required the use of petroleum-based fuels like gasoline and diesel. This, in turn, led to an increase in the production of petrochemicals such as plastics, synthetic fibers, and rubber, which are all derived from crude oil. Additionally, the growth of the global population and the expansion of urban areas have also contributed to the increased demand for petrochemicals, as these materials are used in a wide range of applications, from construction to consumer goods.
