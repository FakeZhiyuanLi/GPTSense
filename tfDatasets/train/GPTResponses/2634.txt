A chromosome consists of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) wrapped tightly around proteins called histones. The DNA contains the genetic code that determines an organism's traits, while the histones provide structural support and help to regulate gene expression. In humans, each chromosome typically contains several hundred to several thousand genes. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, for a total of 46 chromosomes.
