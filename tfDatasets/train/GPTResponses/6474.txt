Bitumen, also known as asphalt or tar, was used in early civilizations for various purposes such as waterproofing, construction, and pavement. The earliest known use of bitumen dates back to the ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley, where it was used to seal water storage vessels, coat boats and to waterproof roofs. It was also used in ancient Egypt for embalming mummies and in Greece for waterproofing the ships. In the 19th century, bitumen was used in colonial-era pavement constructions such as the macadam roads. Today, it is commonly used in road construction, roofing, waterproofing, and as a binding agent in asphalt concrete.
