According to Darwin's theory of evolution through natural selection, species change and evolve gradually over time through the process of "descent with modification." Darwin believed that small variations in traits within a population could be inherited and passed on to future generations. Over time, favorable traits would become more common within the population, while unfavorable traits would become less common or even disappear entirely. As a result, over many generations, the characteristics of the population would gradually change, leading to the evolution of new species. Darwin's theory also emphasized the importance of competition for resources, as well as the role of environmental factors in shaping evolutionary outcomes.
