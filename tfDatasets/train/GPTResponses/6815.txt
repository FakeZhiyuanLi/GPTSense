There are several possible interpretations of this question, so here are a few answers:- If you're asking which states are not legally bound by certain laws or regulations, that would depend on the specific law or regulation in question. Generally, laws and regulations apply to all states that fall under the jurisdiction of the governing body that enforces them (e.g. federal laws apply to all 50 U.S. states). However, some states may have their own laws or exemptions that alter how the law is enforced within their borders.- If you're asking which states are not bound by physical or geographical constraints, then the answer would be none. All states are subject to the laws of physics, and none of them are infinitely large or completely unconnected from other regions.- If you're asking which states are not bound by political or economic alliances, then that would depend on which alliances you're referring to. For example, North Korea is often considered an isolated state because it does not have strong ties with many other countries, while the United States has many allies through organizations like NATO or trade agreements like NAFTA.
