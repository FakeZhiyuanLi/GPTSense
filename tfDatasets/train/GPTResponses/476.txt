Land availability has an effect on solar energy because the amount of land available determines the sizes and locations of solar power plants. Solar power plants require a large amount of land to install photovoltaic panels or solar thermal collectors to generate electricity. If there is limited land available, the capacity for solar energy production will be limited as well. Additionally, if the land is located far from the demand centers, the cost of transporting electricity will be higher, making solar energy less economically viable. Adequate land availability is, therefore, necessary for the efficient and cost-effective deployment of solar energy systems.
