Barcelona did not change their name after Franco's dictatorship ended. They remained FC Barcelona, also known simply as Barça. However, during the dictatorship era, the use of the Catalan language and symbols was suppressed, and FC Barcelona was viewed as a symbol of Catalan identity and resistance. After Franco's death and the transition to democracy, Barça became a symbol of Catalan culture and identity once again, and the use of the Catalan language and symbols was fully embraced.
