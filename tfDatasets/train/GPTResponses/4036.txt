is known as the place code or tonotopy. In the auditory system, different frequencies of sound are processed by different regions along the basilar membrane in the cochlea. This creates a spatial map of pitch, where low frequencies are processed at the apex of the cochlea and high frequencies at the base.At higher levels of processing, neurons receive inputs from multiple regions along the basilar membrane and integrate this information to represent more complex sounds, such as speech or music. The temporal structure of neural activity provides additional information about the pitch of these sounds. For example, a neuron that fires at a high rate during the onset of a sound and then slows down over time may signal a rising pitch contour, while a neuron with a constant firing rate may represent a steady pitch.In this way, the temporal structure of neural activity helps to refine the place code information and allows higher-level neural representations of pitch to be more precise and nuanced.
