There were several reasons for the continued decline of the Aboriginal population, including:1. Disease: When Europeans first arrived in Australia, they brought with them diseases to which the Aboriginal people had no immunity. This led to widespread illness and death among the Aboriginal population.2. Violence and displacement: Europeans often used violence to displace Aboriginal people from their land. This included forced removals, massacres, and the destruction of cultural sites. This violence led to significant trauma and loss of life.3. Loss of traditional lifestyles: European settlement disrupted Aboriginal traditional lifestyles by disrupting hunting and gathering practices and introducing new foods and animals. This disrupted cultural practices and led to food shortages and malnutrition.4. Forced assimilation: The Australian government implemented policies of forced assimilation, which sought to remove Aboriginal people from their families and communities and assimilate them into mainstream Australian society. This led to the loss of cultural practices and the breakdown of Aboriginal families and communities.Overall, these factors contributed to the continued decline of the Aboriginal population in Australia.
