Political radicals such as Ernst Haeckel were interested in "On the Origin of Species" because it provided a scientific basis for their beliefs about the natural world and human society. The theory of evolution presented in the book challenged traditional religious and social hierarchies, suggesting that all life on earth was interconnected and that human beings were not inherently superior to other species. This resonated with the political beliefs of many radicals, who sought to challenge the established power structures and create more egalitarian societies. Additionally, Haeckel was particularly interested in the book's implications for the study of human origins and race, using Darwin's theory to promote his own controversial ideas about the superiority of the "Aryan race."
