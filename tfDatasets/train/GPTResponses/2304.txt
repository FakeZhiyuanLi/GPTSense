Codons are sequences of three nucleotides (letters) in DNA or RNA that code for a specific amino acid or stop signal during protein synthesis. There are 64 possible codon combinations, which code for the 20 amino acids found in proteins, as well as three stop codons that signal the end of protein synthesis. The sequence of codons within a gene determines the sequence of amino acids that make up a specific protein.
