One artist who helped inspire Kanye's fourth album, "808s & Heartbreak," was Kid Cudi. Kanye has cited Cudi as a major influence on the album, and Cudi contributed vocals to several tracks. Additionally, Kanye has mentioned how the emotional and vulnerable sound of the album was partly influenced by the death of his mother and his breakup with his fianc√©e at the time.
