A bill cannot be submitted to the Supreme Court of Scotland. The Supreme Court is mainly responsible for hearing appeals on points of law from lower courts and tribunals in Scotland. However, if there is a question regarding the legality or constitutionality of a proposed law, it may be referred to the court by the Scottish Parliament for a ruling. Additionally, if there is a dispute between the devolved governments and the UK government, the court may also be asked to make a ruling.
