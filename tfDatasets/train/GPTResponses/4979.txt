The rainforests didn't collapse in the Carboniferous period. In fact, the Carboniferous period is known for the development of extensive rainforests that were dominated by giant ferns and horsetails. These rainforests played a crucial role in the formation of coal deposits that we use today as a significant source of energy. However, the rainforests did decline towards the end of the Carboniferous period due to climate change and the evolution of new plant species.
