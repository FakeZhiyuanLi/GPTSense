is commonly referred to as "cybercrime." This particular example involves using a network of compromised computers, or a "botnet," to carry out a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, where a large number of requests are sent to a target server or website in order to overwhelm it and prevent it from functioning properly. This type of activity can be used to extort money from targeted organizations, disrupt critical infrastructure, or steal sensitive information.
