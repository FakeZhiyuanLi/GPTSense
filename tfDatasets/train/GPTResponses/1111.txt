Armor became increasingly prevalent in the 12th century due to a number of factors.Firstly, the development of new technologies made it easier and cheaper to produce high-quality armor. In particular, the process of quenching (rapidly cooling hot metal in water) resulted in stronger and more durable armor.Secondly, the rise of chivalry and knightly ideals meant that knights considered it important to protect themselves and others on the battlefield. This led to an increased demand for armor.Thirdly, the Crusades in the Holy Land exposed knights to new military tactics and weapons, which made armor more necessary for survival.Finally, feudalism and the rise of professional armies meant that more soldiers had access to armor, as it was no longer exclusively reserved for the nobility.
