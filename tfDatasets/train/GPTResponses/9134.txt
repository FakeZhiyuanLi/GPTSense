The first demonstrations in Armenia took place on April 13, 2018, in the capital city of Yerevan. The protests, organized by opposition groups and civil society activists, were sparked by the election of Serzh Sargsyan as Prime Minister, which many saw as an attempt to cling to power after serving two terms as President. The protests continued for weeks and ultimately led to Sargsyan's resignation.
