The Celtic cross is a symbol that represents Celtic Christian and Irish heritage. Its origins are not entirely clear, but it is believed to have emerged in Ireland during the early middle ages. The cross symbolizes the Christian cross, but is embellished with intricate knotwork, which reflects the rich tradition of Celtic art. The four arms of the cross are each equal in length, and there is often a circle, representing eternal life, around the intersection of the arms. The Celtic cross is regarded as a symbol of faith and courage, and is also associated with the continuity of life, death and rebirth.
