New York enacted the Civil Practice Law and Rules (CPLR) in 1963, which replaced traditional common law proceedings in the state. The CPLR provides a uniform set of procedures for civil litigation in New York, including rules for service of process, discovery, motions, and appeals. It is used in all New York state courts, including the Supreme Court, County Courts, City Courts, and District Courts. The CPLR has been amended several times since its enactment, and remains the primary source of procedural law in New York.
