The major proponent of American sociology was considered to be Talcott Parsons, who was a prominent sociologist during the mid-20th century. He was known for his structural-functionalism theory, which emphasized the ways in which social institutions worked together to maintain social order. Other notable figures in American sociology include Max Weber, W.E.B. Du Bois, and Robert Merton.
