As an advocate for uniformitarianism, Charles Lyell believed that organisms were exposed to gradual and slow changes in their environment that they had to adapt to in order to survive. He rejected the idea of sudden catastrophic events causing mass extinctions or sudden changes in the environment that would lead to evolutionary adaptation. Rather, he believed that the environment was constantly changing over long periods of time, and that organisms evolved slowly and gradually in response to these changes. He argued that this was supported by the geological record, which showed evidence of slow and continuous change over millions of years. Ultimately, Lyell believed that organisms faced a constant struggle for survival in a world that was constantly changing, and that only those that were able to adapt and evolve would survive.
