A locus (plural: loci) contains a specific genetic sequence or gene that codes for a particular trait or characteristic. Each locus represents a specific location on a chromosome and contains a unique combination of DNA bases that determine the characteristics of an organism. Each individual has two alleles (variants of a gene), one inherited from each parent, located at a specific locus. These alleles may be dominant or recessive, and their expression can determine an organism's physical, behavioral or biochemical traits.
