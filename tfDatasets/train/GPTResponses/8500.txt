The area of classification that leads to troublesome arithmetic is when there are overlapping categories or if a particular item could fit into multiple categories. This creates ambiguity and makes it difficult to accurately count or calculate the frequency of certain items or categories. It can also lead to confusion when trying to compare different categories or draw meaningful conclusions from the data.
