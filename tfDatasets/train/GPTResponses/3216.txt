The most similar standards to ID3v1 are ID3v2 and APEv2 tags. ID3v2 is a newer and more widely used version of the ID3 tag format, which supports a wider range of metadata and can hold more information than ID3v1. APEv2 is another tag format that is similar to ID3v2, but it is designed to be used with lossless audio formats such as FLAC and Monkey's Audio.
