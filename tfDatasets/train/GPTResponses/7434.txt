Locke believed that an absolute ruler, as proposed by Hobbes, is a threat to individual liberties and contrary to the principles of natural law. Locke argued that the purpose of government is to protect individual rights and liberty, and that the power of government must be limited and subject to the consent of the governed. He believed in the idea of a social contract between the people and the government, in which the people agree to give up certain rights in exchange for protection of their remaining rights. This contract must be based on mutual consent and cannot be imposed by force or coercion.
