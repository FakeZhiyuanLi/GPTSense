Herodotus (484-425 BC) was a Greek historian who wrote about the Jews in his famous work, "Histories." He referred to the Jewish people as "Palestinians" and mentioned their customs and traditions. Another Greek historian, Thucydides, also mentioned the Jews in his work "History of the Peloponnesian War," but did not provide as much information about them as Herodotus did.
