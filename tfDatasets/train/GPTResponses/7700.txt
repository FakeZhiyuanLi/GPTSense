One notable individual who worked with the natives to help solve their dietary issues was Frances Densmore. Densmore was an American ethnographer who studied and documented the traditional music, culture, and ways of life of various Native American tribes. She also became interested in their dietary practices and worked with them to help improve their nutritional intake. Densmore documented many traditional Native American recipes and published several books on the subject, including "How Indians Use Wild Plants for Food, Medicine & Crafts" and "Chippewa Customs". She also advised the US government on nutrition programs for Native American people.
