Table grapes and wine grapes belong to the same species, Vitis vinifera, but they are different cultivars selected for different purposes. Table grapes are usually larger, sweeter, and less acidic than wine grapes, and they are usually eaten fresh as a healthy snack. Wine grapes are smaller, less sweet, and more acidic than table grapes, and they are usually used for making wine due to their unique flavor profile and sugar content.
