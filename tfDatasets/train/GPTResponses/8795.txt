One common practice during the Holy Roman Empire was feudalism, where land was owned by lords who granted parts of it to vassals in return for loyalty and military service. Another common practice was the Catholic Church's influence in political and social affairs, including the appointment of bishops and the use of church courts for legal disputes. Additionally, the empire was characterized by regionalism, with many smaller kingdoms and territories ruled by independent noble families.
