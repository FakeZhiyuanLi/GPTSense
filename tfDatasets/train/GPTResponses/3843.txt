Ethology is a branch of zoology, which studies the behavior of animals in their natural habitats. It involves the scientific observation and analysis of animal behavior, including their social interactions, mating patterns, and communication methods. Ethology also examines how animals interact with their environment and how their behavior adapts to changing conditions over time.
