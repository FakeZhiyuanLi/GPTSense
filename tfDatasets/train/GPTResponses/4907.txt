The Federal Reserve can buy various types of assets to increase money supply, such as:1. Treasury securities: The Fed can buy Treasury bills, notes, and bonds issued by the U.S government. These purchases inject money into the financial system by increasing the reserves of banks and other financial institutions.2. Mortgage-backed securities: The Fed can also buy mortgage-backed securities issued by government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. This can help lower borrowing costs for consumers and support the housing market.3. Corporate bonds and other debt: The Fed can also buy corporate bonds and other types of debt issued by companies to provide liquidity to the credit markets.4. Foreign currencies: The Fed can buy foreign currencies, such as euros or yen, to increase the supply of dollars in the global financial system.These asset purchases are often referred to as quantitative easing (QE) and are used to stimulate economic growth and prevent deflation during times of economic stress.
