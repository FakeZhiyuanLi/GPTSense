There is little variation in the length of day near the equator. Places like Quito in Ecuador, Singapore, and Nairobi in Kenya all experience almost equal day and night throughout the year. This is because the equator is the line on the Earth's surface where the sun is directly overhead at noon on the equinoxes, causing the length of day to remain fairly consistent year-round.
