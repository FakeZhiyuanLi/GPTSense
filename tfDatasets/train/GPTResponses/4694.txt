Railroads offered the farmers easy access to markets and transportation for their crops, allowing them to sell their goods for a better price and expand their business. Additionally, railroads made it easier for farmers to receive essential goods and supplies, such as equipment, seed, and fertilizer. The railroads also provided employment opportunities for farmers and other local residents.
