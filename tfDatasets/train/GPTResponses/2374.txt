Nationalism in music sometimes echoed the cultural and ethnic identity of a particular nation or region. Composers would incorporate elements of their nation's folk music or traditional melodies, rhythms, or instruments into their compositions. This helped to establish a uniquely national character in the music and promote a sense of cultural pride and unity. Additionally, some nationalist music emphasized the historical struggles and triumphs of a particular nation, serving as a symbol of national resilience and endurance.
