Institutes of technology were generally part of the higher education system during the seventies, eighties, and early nineties. However, the specific system can vary based on the country and region. In the United States, institutes of technology were typically part of the public university system or sometimes formed as independent private institutions. In Europe, they were often integrated into the national university system or established as independent specialized institutions.
