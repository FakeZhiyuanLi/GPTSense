Soluble fiber slows down the digestion and absorption of carbohydrates, allowing for a slower release of glucose into the bloodstream. This helps to prevent a rapid rise in blood glucose levels after a meal. Additionally, soluble fiber can increase insulin sensitivity, which allows the body to use insulin more effectively to lower blood glucose levels.
