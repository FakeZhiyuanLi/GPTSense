Ptolemy authored a highly influential astronomy text titled "Almagest" (meaning "The Greatest"). The book, written in the 2nd century CE, described a model of the universe that placed the Earth at the center and had all other celestial bodies orbiting around it. This model became known as the geocentric model and was widely accepted and taught for centuries.
