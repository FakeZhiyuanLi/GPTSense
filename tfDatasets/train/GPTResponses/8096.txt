Enzymes in the digestive system are able to break bonds in ingested molecules. Specifically, enzymes including amylase, protease, and lipase break down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats respectively. These enzymes work by breaking the chemical bonds holding the molecules together, allowing them to be absorbed into the bloodstream and used by the body for energy and other functions.
