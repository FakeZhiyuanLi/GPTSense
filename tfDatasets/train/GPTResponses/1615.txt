In humoral immunology, the molecules that cause immune response are known as antibodies, which reside in the blood plasma or other body fluids. Antibodies are proteins that are produced by specialized immune cells called B cells, in response to the presence of foreign substances, known as antigens. The antibodies bind to the antigens and neutralize them or tag them for destruction by other immune cells.
