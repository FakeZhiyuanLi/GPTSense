The Bodhisattva Path is a spiritual path in Mahayana Buddhism that emphasizes a compassionate commitment to attainment of enlightenment for the benefit of all beings. A Bodhisattva is someone who chooses to delay their own enlightenment and instead focus on helping others attain enlightenment. The path is based on the belief that all sentient beings have the potential to become enlightened and to reach the same level of understanding as the Buddha. The main practices of the Bodhisattva Path include cultivating compassion, wisdom, and the six perfections (generosity, morality, patience, effort, concentration, and wisdom) to achieve ultimate nirvana for the benefit of all beings.
