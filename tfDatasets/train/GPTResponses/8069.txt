The Toledo School of Translators was not sponsored by a single entity or organization. It was a group of scholars, both Christian and Muslim, who worked together in Toledo, Spain, during the 12th and 13th centuries to translate and preserve various works from classical Greek and Arabic into Latin. The scholarship and patronage of various rulers, such as Alfonso X of Castile, may have supported some of their work.
