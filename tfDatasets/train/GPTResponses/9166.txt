formalist theory defines literature as a work of art that uses language to create a specific aesthetic effect. Therefore, when industry writing, such as technical manuals, instruction manuals or business reports, utilizes language in a creative way to achieve a specific effect, it can be considered literature. This may include the use of literary devices, such as metaphor, symbolism, structure and style to convey information, engage and persuade audiences, or create an emotional response. Essentially, industry writing becomes literature when it transcends its functional purpose and becomes an artistic expression.
