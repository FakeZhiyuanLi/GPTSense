The inability to compete with multinational firms often leads to job loss, wage stagnation and worsening working conditions for workers. This is because multinational firms have access to larger markets, greater economies of scale, and more capital to invest in automation and technological advancements. As a result, they can produce goods and services at lower costs and offer them at a lower price, making it difficult for domestic firms to compete. This can lead to a reduction in demand for domestic products, which in turn results in job losses and lower wages for workers. Additionally, multinational firms may have lower labor standards, resulting in poorer working conditions for workers in countries where they operate.
