The English judges in the eighteenth century primarily relied on two natural theories of law: natural law and legal positivism.Natural law is the idea that there are certain inherent moral and ethical principles that exist in the universe and are accessible to human reason. These principles are considered to be universal and eternal, and they form the basis for moral and legal reasoning. English judges during the eighteenth century often relied on natural law principles to determine the validity of laws and to interpret legal texts.Legal positivism, on the other hand, is the idea that laws are simply the product of human will and are not necessarily grounded in natural or moral principles. Under this theory, the validity of a law is determined solely by its source, such as a statute or a court decision, rather than by any external moral standards. Many English judges of the eighteenth century followed a legal positivist approach, viewing laws as the product of human-made institutions rather than as entities that exist independently of society.
