The first semi-permanent residents of the Antarctic area were whalers and sealers who lived on ships and temporary shore camps in the 19th century. However, the first scientific research station, the British Antarctic Expedition's Discovery Hut, was established in 1902 by Robert Falcon Scott, located on Ross Island in what is now known as McMurdo Sound.
