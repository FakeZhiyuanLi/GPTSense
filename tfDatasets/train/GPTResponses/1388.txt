Birds that are heavier and have shorter wingspans tend to fly less efficiently. For example, domestic chickens and turkeys have limited flight capabilities due to their heavier bodies and short wingspans compared to other bird species. Additionally, certain flightless birds, such as ostriches, emus, and kiwis, are not capable of flying at all.
