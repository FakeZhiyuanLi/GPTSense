In Canada, the practice of granting assent by writing has been in effect since 1689 when it was first recognized by the English Parliament. However, the specific bill in Canada that formally established the practice of granting assent by writing was the Royal Assent Act, which was passed in 2002. The act provided for the use of electronic or written forms of assent, in addition to traditional methods such as the use of the royal sign-manual or verbal notification from the governor general.
