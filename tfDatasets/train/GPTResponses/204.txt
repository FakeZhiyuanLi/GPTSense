The Sanskrit term "karma" translates to "action" or "deed". It refers to the actions and intentions that shape an individual's life and future outcomes. In Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, karma is the concept that a person's actions in this life will have implications for their future lives, either in this world or in the afterlife.
