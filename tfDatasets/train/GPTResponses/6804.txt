Here are a few more ways a wrestler might obtain their ring name:1. Create it themselves: Sometimes wrestlers come up with their own ring names that they feel represent their personality, gimmick, or brand that they want to convey in the ring.2. Get it from a trainer: Sometimes trainers or coaches will give wrestlers their ring names as part of their training process. This helps them tap into their personality and persona as they develop their in-ring skills.3. Be given it by a promoter: Promoters sometimes give wrestlers their ring names as a way to help them establish their brand and make a name for themselves in the wrestling world.4. Have it evolve naturally: Some wrestlers start with one ring name, but as they gain more experience and evolve their character over time, they may change their name to better reflect who they have become in the ring.5. Retain a name from previous promotions: If a wrestler is well-known in the indie wrestling scene, they may carry their ring name over to a larger promotion if they are signed to a contract with them.
