The prime minister in a semi-presidential system manages the day-to-day operations of the government, including overseeing the implementation of policies and managing the administration of government departments. They are responsible for proposing legislation to the parliament, developing the budget, and acting as the primary advisor to the president on matters of policy. Additionally, they may be responsible for appointing government officials and representing the country in international affairs. However, in a semi-presidential system, the president also plays a significant role in government, particularly in foreign affairs and national security matters.
