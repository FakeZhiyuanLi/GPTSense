There was no Byzantine leader at the Battle of Yarmouk as the battle was fought between the Byzantine Empire and the Arab forces of the Rashidun Caliphate. The Byzantine army was commanded by several generals, including Vahan, Shahrbaraz, and Theodore Trithyrius. On the other hand, the Arab forces were led by Khalid ibn al-Walid, one of the most successful military commanders in Islamic history.
