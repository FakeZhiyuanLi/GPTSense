Many Indigenous Australians prefer to be referred to by their specific tribal or community names, or simply as Indigenous or Aboriginal Australians. The term "black" has been used historically in a derogatory way to describe Indigenous Australians, and is generally considered inappropriate and offensive. However, some Indigenous Australians have reclaimed the term and use it as a way of asserting their identity and challenging stereotypes. It is important to always ask how an individual prefers to be identified and respected their choice.
