There are several products that created more complexity in the financial markets, including:1. Mortgage-backed securities (MBS) - MBS are created when banks bundle together multiple mortgages and sell them to investors. These securities became popular in the early 2000s, as banks began offering mortgages to people who couldn't afford them. The resulting housing bubble burst in 2008 and caused a severe financial crisis.2. Credit default swaps (CDS) - CDS are insurance policies on bonds or other financial assets. They were originally designed to protect investors against the possibility of a borrower defaulting on a loan, but were used to bet against companies or assets. These became popular in the early 2000s and played a role in the financial crisis.3. Collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) - Similar to MBS, CDOs are securities created by pooling together different types of debt, such as mortgages, credit card debt, or auto loans. These became popular in the mid-2000s and contributed to the financial crisis when many of the underlying loans defaulted.4. Derivatives - Derivatives include a variety of financial contracts that derive their value from an underlying asset. Examples include futures, options, and swaps. While these products can be useful for risk management and hedging, they have also been used for speculation and contributed to market instability in some cases.
