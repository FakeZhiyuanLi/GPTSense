Pregnant women should consume an additional 1.5 to 2 liters (or 8 to 10 cups) of water per day compared to an average non-pregnant woman. This is to support the increased blood volume, fetal circulation, amniotic fluid production and to prevent dehydration during pregnancy. It is best to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the specific amount of water intake needed based on individual factors such as body weight, activity level, and overall health.
