Beriberi is a nutritional deficiency disease caused by a lack of thiamine (vitamin B1) in the diet. Any group of people who have a diet deficient in thiamine can suffer from beriberi. However, historically, beriberi was particularly common among populations who relied heavily on polished rice as a dietary staple, as the polishing process removes much of the thiamine-rich bran from the grain. Therefore, groups of natives who relied on diets high in polished rice, such as some populations in Southeast Asia, were particularly vulnerable to beriberi.
