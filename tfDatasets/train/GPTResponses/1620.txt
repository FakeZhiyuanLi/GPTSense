The Ottoman Empire's struggle in the Crimean War (1853-1856) was against a coalition of Russia, France, Britain, and Sardinia. The war was fought over several issues, including the Ottoman Empire's control over the Holy Land, the rights of Christians in the Ottoman Empire, and Russia's expansionist ambitions. Despite being outnumbered and outgunned, the Ottomans managed to hold off the Russian army with the help of their allies. The war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris, which recognized the Ottoman Empire as a European power and prevented Russia from gaining territory in the Balkans.
