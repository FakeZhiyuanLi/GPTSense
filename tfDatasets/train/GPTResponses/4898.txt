of people or culture one wants to belong to or identify with. These factors are often shaped by one's upbringing, socialization, and personal values, as well as by social norms, expectations, and stereotypes associated with certain groups or identities. For example, someone may choose to dress in a certain style, use slang or jargon, or adopt certain mannerisms to fit in with a particular subculture or to express their individual identity. Similarly, people may modify their behavior or choose to occupy certain spaces based on their perceived belonging or exclusion from certain groups or communities. Ultimately, language, dress, behavior, and choice of space are all linked to how we navigate and negotiate our identities in relation to the world around us.
