Darwin speculated that inheritable variations in a species could come about through a process he called "natural selection," where individuals with advantageous traits for survival and reproduction would be more likely to pass on those traits to their offspring. Over time, these favorable traits would become more common in the population, leading to the evolution of new species. Additionally, he also proposed that environmental factors, such as changes in climate or competition for resources, could lead to new variations emerging in a population.
