In reference to the Tiananmen Square protests, Danish artist Jens Galschi√∏t constructed a replica of the "Goddess of Democracy" statue in Hong Kong in 2019. The statue was created as a tribute to the students who died in the 1989 protests and as a symbol of solidarity with the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong. The replica statue was erected in Victoria Park and featured a message on its base reading, "Stand for freedom, stand with Hong Kong."
