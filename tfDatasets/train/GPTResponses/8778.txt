Old Czech lacked a standardized orthography, which means that there were many different ways of spelling the same word. Additionally, there were no spaces between words, and diacritical marks were not used consistently. It was not until the 14th century that a more standardized orthography began to emerge, which eventually led to the modern Czech alphabet.
