As a language model AI, I don't have an access to current updates or latest news but I can provide you the general information.The abbey of Saint-Ã‰tienne and Abbaye aux Dames in France were built in the Romanesque style, and both used barrel vaults to support their roofs. These barrel vaults were made of stone and were supported by thick walls and columns. The vaults helped to distribute the weight of the roof evenly, allowing for larger and more open interior spaces than were possible with earlier architectural styles. The vaults at these abbeys were also decorated with intricate patterns and designs, adding to the beauty of the buildings.
