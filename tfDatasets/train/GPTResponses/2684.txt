Setting the clocks ahead does not add an hour of daylight. It simply shifts the time when the sun rises and sets. Depending on the season, it can add an hour of daylight before or after the normal workday. In the spring, setting the clocks ahead adds an hour of daylight after the normal workday. In the fall, setting the clocks back adds an hour of daylight before the normal workday.
