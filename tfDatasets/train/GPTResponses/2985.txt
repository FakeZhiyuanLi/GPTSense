1920x1080i and 1280x720p are resolutions defined by the video industry for high-definition television (HDTV). The numbers refer to the number of pixels on the screen. The "i" and "p" refer to the type of video signal used: interlaced (i) or progressive (p). Interlaced video displays every other line in one frame, then fills in the remaining lines in the next frame, while progressive video displays all the lines in one frame at the same time. 1920x1080i is capable of displaying 1080 lines of horizontal resolution in interlaced format, while 1280x720p is capable of displaying 720 lines in progressive format.
