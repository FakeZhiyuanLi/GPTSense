Most analysts believe that the crisis in commercial real estate took place after the crisis in residential real estate. This refers to the decline in value and sales of commercial properties, including office buildings, retail spaces, and warehouses. This crisis was partly caused by the same factors that led to the residential real estate crisis, such as easy credit and speculative investing, but also by the recession and rising unemployment, which affected the demand for commercial properties. The commercial real estate crisis was a significant factor in the overall economic downturn that began in 2008.
