Only Hindus have a caste system that is unique to their religion and culture. Other religions and cultures may have similar systems of social stratification or hierarchies, but they are not identical to the Hindu caste system. Some examples of similar systems include the social class systems in Japan, feudal Europe, and ancient Rome.
