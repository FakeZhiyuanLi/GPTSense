The advancement made to New Haven trolley lines in the mid-1890s was the electrification of the lines. Instead of using horse-drawn or steam-powered vehicles, the trolleys were powered by overhead electric wires, making them faster, more efficient and allowing for more frequent service. This advancement led to the growth of New Haven's transportation system and made it easier for people to travel within the city and surrounding areas.
