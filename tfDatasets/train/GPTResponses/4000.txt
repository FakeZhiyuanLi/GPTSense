The work of George Herbert Mead, Erving Goffman, and Randall Collins greatly influenced the development of interaction ritual theory. Mead's theory of symbolic interactionism emphasizes the role of symbols and communication in social interaction, while Goffman's work focuses on the various roles individuals play in social situations and how they use symbols to communicate with one another. Collins' theory of interaction ritual chains builds on these ideas by emphasizing the importance of emotional energy generated in social interactions and the ways in which it can lead to different outcomes.
