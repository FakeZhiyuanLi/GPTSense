The white meat of chicken is primarily used for movement and power generation, as it is made up of fast-twitch muscle fibers that allow for quick and powerful movements. These muscles are found predominantly in the breast and wing muscles of the chicken. The white meat is also used for maintaining body temperature and providing energy for the bird's daily activities.
