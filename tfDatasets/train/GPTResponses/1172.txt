Many Slavic nationalist movements throughout history have used pan-Slavism as a political tool, including the Czechs, Serbs, Croats, Bulgarians, and Russians. Some notable figures who advocated for pan-Slavism include the Russian Pan-Slavist philosopher Nikolai Danilevsky and the Croatian politician Ante Starčević. However, it should be noted that not all Slavic nations have embraced pan-Slavism as a political ideology.
