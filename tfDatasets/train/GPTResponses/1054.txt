Electric guitars are a type of instrument with a misleading name that are not always made completely out of wood. While the body of the guitar is typically made out of wood, the neck, fretboard, and pickups are often made from other materials. Additionally, some electric guitars have bodies or parts that are made from materials like carbon fiber, high-density foam, or plastic.
