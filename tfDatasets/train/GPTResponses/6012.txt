Radium paint was used on a variety of devices in the early 20th century, including watches, clock faces, airplane instruments, and even toys. The most notable use of radium paint was on the dials of watches and clocks, particularly during World War I. The paint was also used to illuminate airplane instrument panels during nighttime flights. Additionally, radium paint was used on various consumer products such as fishing lures, toothpaste, and even glow-in-the-dark paint for children's toys. However, the use of radium paint in consumer products was largely phased out by the 1950s due to health concerns.
