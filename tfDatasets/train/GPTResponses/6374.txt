Napoleon Bonaparte's admiration for Muhammad, the founder of Islam, has been a topic of debate among historians. Some argue that Bonaparte's admiration was insincere and merely a political tactic to gain favor with Muslim leaders. However, others argue that his admiration was genuine, including the French historian Alphonse de Lamartine, who believed that Bonaparte "envied the sublime and simple morals" of Islam and viewed it as a powerful force for social cohesion. In his book, "The Spirit of Islam," Lamartine wrote: "The religion of Islam enjoins upon its followers the practice of many virtues... [Napoleon] admired these virtues, and wished to introduce them into his own code of laws." Ultimately, the sincerity of Bonaparte's admiration for Muhammad remains a subject of interpretation and debate.
