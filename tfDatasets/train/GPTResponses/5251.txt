During World War II, the French Navy fell captive to Germany after the Armistice of Compi√®gne was signed on June 22, 1940. The French navy was divided into two factions, Vichy French and Free French, with the Vichy French Navy aligning with Germany and the Free French Navy joining the Allied powers. The German navy took control of French naval bases, ships, and ports, while the Vichy French navy was allowed to continue operating in the Mediterranean under German supervision.
