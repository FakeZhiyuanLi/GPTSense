The four factors that determine how the body reacts to an antigen are:1. Type of antigen: Depending on the type of antigen, the immune system may respond differently. For example, some antigens may trigger a strong immune response, while others may not elicit a response at all.2. Dosage: The amount of antigen that enters the body can influence how the body reacts. A small amount of antigen may not lead to a strong immune response, while a large amount may trigger a more severe reaction.3. Pathway of exposure: The route by which the antigen enters the body can also play a role in the immune response. For example, antigens that enter through the skin may elicit a different response compared to those that enter through the respiratory system.4. Immunological history: The bodyâ€™s previous exposure to the antigen can influence the immune response. If the immune system has been previously exposed to the antigen, it may be able to mount a quicker and stronger response upon repeat exposure.
