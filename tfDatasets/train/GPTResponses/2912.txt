Traditional societies and agricultural societies often rely on solar time and the natural changes in daylight with the seasons. For example, many indigenous communities in North America base their calendar on the timing of the solstices and equinoxes, and agricultural societies around the world adjust their planting and harvesting schedules according to the changing seasons and hours of daylight.
