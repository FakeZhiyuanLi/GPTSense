1. Cultural norms: Different cultures have their own expectations and values regarding work and leisure activities. For example, some cultures may place a higher emphasis on academic or vocational success, leading adolescents to prioritize school or job-related activities over leisure time. In other cultures, there may be more emphasis on socializing or family time, leading to more time spent on leisure activities.2. Economic circumstances: Economic factors can also impact how much time adolescents spend on work and leisure activities. For example, in cultures where poverty is prevalent, adolescents may be expected to contribute to the family income by taking on part-time or full-time jobs, leaving less time for leisure activities. In other cultures where there is more affluence, adolescents may have more opportunities for leisure activities and less pressure to work.
