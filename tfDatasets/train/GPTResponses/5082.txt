The Treaty of Antarctica, also known as the Antarctic Treaty System, set aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, devoted to peaceful activities, and to prohibit military activities, mineral mining, and nuclear explosions on the continent. It recognized the importance of scientific research in Antarctica and established a framework for international cooperation in the region. The Treaty was signed by twelve nations in 1959 and has since been ratified by 54 countries. It remains in effect today as one of the most successful international agreements in history.
