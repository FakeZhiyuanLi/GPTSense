Neurophysiologists study the structure and function of the nervous system, including the anatomy, physiology, and biochemistry of neurons and the neural circuits they form. They investigate how neurons communicate with each other and with other cells in the body, how sensory information is processed, and how the brain controls behavior, movement, sensation, and cognition. They may use a range of techniques, including electrophysiology, molecular biology, brain imaging, and computational analysis, to explore these questions at the level of individual cells and whole systems. Some neurophysiologists also study the effects of diseases, injuries, or drugs on the nervous system, or develop new diagnostic or therapeutic approaches for neurological disorders.
