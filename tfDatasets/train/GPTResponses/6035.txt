One example of a Sanskrit loanword used in Southeast Asian languages is "Buddha," which is derived from the Sanskrit word "Buddh" meaning "to awaken" or "to understand." The word has been adopted into many Southeast Asian languages, such as Thai, Burmese, and Cambodian, and is used to refer to the founder of Buddhism and his teachings.
