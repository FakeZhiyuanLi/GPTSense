One of the distinguishing visual design features of French cathedrals is their pointed arches, known as the Gothic arch. This style was introduced in the 12th century and is characterized by its tall and narrow shape, ribbed vaults, and large stained-glass windows. French cathedrals also often feature elaborate sculptures, intricate carvings, and decorative spires.
