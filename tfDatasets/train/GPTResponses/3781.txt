The somatic marker hypothesis argues that conceptual cognition is not required for emotional meaning. According to this hypothesis, emotions are a result of biological and physiological responses to stimuli, rather than conscious decision-making processes. These responses are mediated by "somatic markers," which are bodily sensations associated with different emotional states. As a result, even individuals who have limited conceptual understanding can still experience and react to emotional stimuli.
