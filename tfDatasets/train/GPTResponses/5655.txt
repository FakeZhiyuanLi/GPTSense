The Greek physician and philosopher, Galen, is often credited as the first to finalize his conclusions with dissections of cadavers. He famously utilized dissection to study the anatomy and physiology of the human body and made significant contributions to the field of medicine. His work was influential for centuries and his teachings were used as the basis for medical knowledge and practice well into the Middle Ages.
