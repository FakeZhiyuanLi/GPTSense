The heavy piece of wood would have a greater proportion of latewood. Latewood is the wood that forms later in the growing season when the tree is slowing down its growth. It tends to be denser and darker than earlywood, which forms earlier in the season when the tree is growing faster. As trees age and become larger, their wood tends to have a higher proportion of latewood due to the slowing of their growth rate. Therefore, a heavier piece of wood from a pine tree would likely have more latewood than a lighter piece of wood.
