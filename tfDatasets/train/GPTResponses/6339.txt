Some researchers argue that the concept of sexual orientation as a fixed and inherent trait may not fully capture the complexity and variability of human sexuality. They suggest that individuals may experience attraction and desire in a fluid and non-binary way over time, rather than being “locked in” to a particular sexual orientation label. Additionally, some researchers argue that the concept of sexual orientation may be socially constructed and influenced by cultural and historical factors, rather than solely determined by biological or genetic factors.
