Stepper motors were not completely abandoned in computer drive designs, but they have largely been replaced by brushless DC (BLDC) motors due to several reasons:1. Control: BLDC motors can be controlled more precisely than stepper motors, resulting in greater speed and accuracy.2. Efficiency: BLDC motors are generally more efficient than stepper motors due to their lack of friction and lower power consumption.3. Noise: Stepper motors can be quite noisy due to the nature of their operation, while BLDC motors are much quieter.4. Cost: BLDC motors have become more affordable in recent years, making them a more attractive option for computer drive designs.Overall, while stepper motors still have some applications in computer drive designs, BLDC motors have become the preferred option due to their superior performance and efficiency.
