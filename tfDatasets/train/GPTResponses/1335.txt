Pan-Slavism began to develop as a movement in the early 19th century, with the emergence of Slavic nationalism. The idea was to unify and strengthen the Slavic people, who shared a common culture and language but were divided under various empires and kingdoms. The term “Pan-Slavism” was first used in the 1820s by Czech historian František Palacký, and the movement gained momentum in the mid-19th century, particularly after the Crimean War and the Congress of Paris (1856) which redefined the map of Europe. The movement reached its peak in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, leading to the formation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia after World War I, which united several Slavic peoples under one state. However, the idea of Pan-Slavism was also used by some politicians to justify territorial expansion and aggression, which ultimately contributed to the outbreak of World War I.
