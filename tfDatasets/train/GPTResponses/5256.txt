The conflict between Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jews is attributed to their different cultural, religious, and historical backgrounds. Sephardic Jews originated from the Iberian Peninsula and their culture was heavily influenced by Arabic and North African traditions. Ashkenazi Jews, on the other hand, originated from Eastern Europe and their culture was shaped by Eastern European traditions. The differences in language, customs, and religious practices led to tensions between the two groups. Additionally, the migration of Ashkenazi Jews to the Middle East and North Africa during the 20th century resulted in further competition for resources, establishing a divide between the two groups.
