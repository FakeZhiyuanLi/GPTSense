Dionysus was the ancient Greek god of wine, fertility, ecstasy, and theater. He was said to be the son of Zeus and the mortal woman Semele, and was often associated with wild and raucous celebrations, particularly those involving wine and drunken revelry. In art and literature, he is often depicted as a handsome young man with long hair, carrying a drinking cup and a thyrsus (a staff topped with a pinecone) and accompanied by a retinue of wild women known as maenads.
