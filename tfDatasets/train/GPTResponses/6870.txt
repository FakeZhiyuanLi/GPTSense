There is no specific event that led to the carnival starting in Haiti. The carnival has been a part of Haitian culture for centuries and has evolved over time. It is believed to have originated from pre-Lenten celebrations brought to the island by French colonizers. Today, the carnival is a vibrant and colorful festival celebrated throughout Haiti, particularly in the capital city of Port-au-Prince.
