The U.S. Census considers ancestry, ethnicity, and physical features such as skin tone, hair texture, and facial features when classifying race. It also includes self-identification by respondents who can select one or more race(s) from a list of categories. Additionally, the Census Bureau uses historical data and community feedback to determine race category options.
