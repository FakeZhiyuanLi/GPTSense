Most of the water in Antarctica is in the form of ice, with very little liquid water present on the surface. The temperature in Antarctica is consistently below freezing, with an average temperature of around -49°C (-56°F) during the winter, which makes it difficult for liquid water to exist there. The majority of the water is locked up in the ice caps and glaciers, which cover around 98% of the continent.
