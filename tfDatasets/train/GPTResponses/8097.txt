The idea of parsimony has been discussed and used in various fields for centuries, so it is difficult to attribute it to a specific individual. However, in science, the principle of parsimony, also known as Occam's razor, was popularized by the 14th-century English logician and Franciscan friar William of Ockham. He stated that when confronted with competing explanations, one should select the explanation that requires the fewest assumptions and entities.
