19th-century scholars generally viewed the Hellenistic period as an age of decline and decadence following the glories of classical Greece. They saw it as a time of political instability and cultural fusion that produced a superficial cosmopolitanism rather than genuine creativity. Many scholars also criticized the Hellenistic period for being overly focused on individualistic pursuits and lacking in the idealistic values of the earlier Greek polis. However, some 19th-century thinkers, such as the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, saw the Hellenistic period as a time of important philosophical developments and a continuation of the "Greek spirit" of inquiry and individualism.
