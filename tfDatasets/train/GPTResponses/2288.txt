In its proper religious context, an imam is an Islamic religious leader who leads congregational prayers and delivers sermons in a mosque. The imam is also responsible for providing guidance to the community and for interpreting Islamic law and theology. In some cases, the imam also fulfills social and administrative roles within the community.
