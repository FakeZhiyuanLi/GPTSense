Airways can change in many ways, some of which are:1. Inflammation: Airways can become inflamed due to allergens, irritants, or infections. This can cause swelling, mucus production, and narrowing of the airways.2. Obstruction: Airways can become blocked by mucus, foreign objects, or tumors, leading to difficulty in breathing.3. Constriction: Airways can constrict due to muscle spasms, which can be triggered by various factors such as exercise, cold air, or emotional stress.4. Enlargement: Airways can become enlarged due to lung diseases like emphysema or chronic bronchitis.5. Damage: Airways can become damaged due to smoking, pollution, or other environmental factors. This can lead to scarring, narrowing, or collapse of the airways.6. Collapse: Airways can collapse due to various reasons, including tumors, infections, or neurological disorders. This can cause difficulty in breathing and may require emergency medical attention.
