Coreless motors may be used in servo applications where high speed and precision are required. Due to their low inertia, they can accelerate and decelerate rapidly, which is important in applications such as robotic arms or drones. Additionally, coreless motors tend to produce less cogging torque, which can provide smoother and more accurate motion control. Overall, coreless motors are a popular choice for servo motors in high-performance applications that require a fast and precise response.
