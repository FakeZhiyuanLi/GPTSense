Izvestiya, meaning "The News" in Russian, was a daily newspaper that was the official organ of the Soviet government from 1917 to 1991. It was one of the oldest and most widely circulated newspapers in Russia and provided news and propaganda on various domestic and international issues, as well as serving as a platform for government announcements and policy statements. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Izvestiya underwent various ownership changes and transformations, and is now a privately owned business-oriented newspaper.
