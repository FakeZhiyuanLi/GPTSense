Reservations must be included in a treaty when one or more parties to the treaty want to assert a legal exception or modification to certain provisions of the treaty, while still agreeing to be bound by the treaty in general. Reservations are usually made when a state feels that adhering to a treaty would be difficult, impractical, or contrary to domestic law, policies, or interests. However, reservations are only permitted under certain conditions, such as not being incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty, not being contrary to a fundamental principle of the treaty, and not defeating the object and purpose of a norm of customary international law. In any case, reservations must be made explicitly and communicated to all other parties in a timely manner, and may require the consent of the other parties before they can take effect.
