Glaciers are sensitive to changes in temperature and precipitation patterns. A warmer climate can cause glaciers to melt faster, resulting in decreased ice accumulation and slower ice flow. Increased precipitation can also lead to more melting, as it can create a buildup of water on top of the ice, leading to faster glacial flow. Over time, these factors can contribute to the descent of glaciers to permafrost levels in some areas. Additionally, changes in the topography of the land, such as the formation of valleys or depressions, can also impact the position and flow of glaciers.
