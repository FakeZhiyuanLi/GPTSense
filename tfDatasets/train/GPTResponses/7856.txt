To determine whether a fat can be classified as saturated or unsaturated, the chemical structure of the fat needs to be examined. Specifically, the presence or absence of double bonds between carbon atoms in the fatty acid chains determines whether a fat is saturated or unsaturated. If all carbon atoms in the fatty acid chains are bonded to hydrogen atoms (no double bonds), the fat is considered saturated. If there are one or more double bonds in the fatty acid chains, the fat is considered unsaturated. The number and position of the double bonds can also affect the properties of the fat, such as its melting point and stability.
