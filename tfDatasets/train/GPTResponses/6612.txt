The regulations from executive branch agencies in the United States can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The CFR is a compilation of the general and permanent rules and regulations adopted by executive branch agencies and published in the Federal Register. It is divided into 50 titles that cover various topics such as agriculture, commerce, energy, environment, immigration, transportation, and more. The regulations in the CFR have the force of law and are enforceable by the relevant agency.
