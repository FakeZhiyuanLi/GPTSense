The theory is called the "Biological Embedding of Early Life Adversity" (or "Developmental Origins of Health and Disease") and it suggests that experiences during sensitive developmental periods (such as adolescence) can "embed" themselves into biological processes (such as gene expression and brain development) and lead to long-term health and behavioral outcomes. This theory has been supported by a growing body of research in fields such as neuroscience and epidemiology.
