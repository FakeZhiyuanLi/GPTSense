The raids that disturbed Hamwic (now known as Southampton, England) in the 9th century were mainly carried out by Viking raiders. The Vikings would often sail up the river Test and attack the town, plundering and killing. These raids were part of the larger Viking invasions of England, which lasted from the late 8th century until the mid-11th century.
