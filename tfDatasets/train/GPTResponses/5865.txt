It is not accurate to say that Freemasonry was ever "ruled" to not be a religion. Freemasonry is a fraternity, not a religion, and therefore does not have any religious doctrine or dogma. However, Freemasonry does require that its members believe in a Supreme Being, which can lead some to perceive it as a quasi-religious organization. Ultimately, the question of whether or not Freemasonry is a religion is a matter of interpretation and opinion.
