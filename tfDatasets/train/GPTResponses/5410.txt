The evidence suggesting the increased benefits of smokeless powder rifles came from the Boer War (1899-1902) in South Africa. British soldiers used smokeless powder rifles, while the Boer soldiers mainly used rifles with black powder. The smokeless powder rifles gave the British soldiers an advantage in accuracy and range, as they were less affected by wind and had a flatter trajectory. The smokeless powder also created less smoke, allowing soldiers to remain hidden in battle. This contributed to the British victory in the war.
