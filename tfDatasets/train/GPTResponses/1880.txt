In most societies, nobility was determined by birth or inheritance. These people were born into noble families that held power and privilege based on their ancestry. In some cultures, noble status was also based on wealth or military prowess, and some societies had a system of merit-based nobility, where individuals could gain noble status through their distinguished achievements or service to the state. Ultimately, the concept of nobility has varied throughout history and across different cultures, but in general, it refers to a class of people who hold a privileged or elevated social status.
