The process by which green plants convert solar energy to stored energy is called photosynthesis. In photosynthesis, the chlorophyll in plant cells captures sunlight and uses this energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. The glucose is stored as energy in the plant's cells and is used for growth and metabolism, while the oxygen is released into the atmosphere as a byproduct. The overall equation for photosynthesis is:6CO2 + 6H2O + sunlight â†’ C6H12O6 + 6O2
