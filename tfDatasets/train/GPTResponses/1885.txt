A ribosome is responsible for synthesizing proteins by decoding the genetic information stored in messenger RNA (mRNA). It reads the sequence of codons on the mRNA and assembles amino acids into a polypeptide chain, which folds into a functional protein. Ribosomes are found in all living cells and are essential for life.
