The other two main components of a computer are:1. Memory: It is the component of the computer that stores data and instructions temporarily or permanently. The computer's memory is classified as volatile and non-volatile memory. RAM is the most commonly used volatile memory, whereas ROM and hard disk drive are examples of non-volatile memory.2. Central Processing Unit (CPU): It is the brain of the computer. The CPU is responsible for executing instructions and controlling the operations of other components in the computer. It consists of two main parts: control unit and arithmetic logic unit (ALU). The control unit fetches instructions from memory and decodes them, while the ALU executes the instructions.
