Transistors today are typically made up of silicon, a chemical element that has unique electrical properties that make it ideal for use in semiconductors. The silicon is processed into a thin wafer, which is then etched with a complex pattern of circuits using lithography techniques. Doping agents are also added to the silicon to alter its conductivity, and metal contacts are added to provide electrical connections to other parts of the circuit. The resulting transistor is a tiny electronic device that can amplify or switch electronic signals with very high speed and efficiency.
