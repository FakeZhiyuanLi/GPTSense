1. Wattage of light bulbs: The wattage of the light bulbs used will impact the electricity consumption and, therefore, the operating costs.2. Length of time that lights are used: The duration for which the lights are in operation each day, week, and month will impact the energy usage and operating costs.3. Type of lighting fixtures: Different types of light fixtures have varying energy efficiency ratings and will, therefore, have varying operating costs.4. Number of lights: The number of lights used in a space will impact energy usage and operating costs.5. Energy efficiency rating: The energy efficiency rating of the lighting will impact how much electricity it consumes and, therefore, the operating costs.6. Electricity tariffs: The cost of electricity varies depending on the tariff rates of the electricity supplier. These tariffs will impact the operating costs of lighting.7. Maintenance costs: Maintenance costs such as bulb replacements, cleaning, and repairs will add to the overall cost of operating the lighting.8. Environmental impact: Some lighting options may have a lower environmental impact but have a higher initial cost. The environmental impact of the lighting should be considered when calculating operating costs.9. Location and climate: The location and climate can impact energy consumption and operating costs. For example, a space with large windows may require less artificial lighting during the day.10. Dimming and lighting control systems: The use of dimming and lighting control systems can reduce energy consumption and, therefore, operating costs. The initial cost of these systems should be considered when calculating operating costs.
