Some sounds that now belong to separate phonemes were allophones of what used to be considered the same phoneme in English. For example, in Old English, the sounds /f/ and /v/ were allophones of the same phoneme, /f/. Similarly, the sounds /p/ and /b/ were allophones of the same phoneme, /p/. Over time, these sounds became distinct phonemes in English, with /f/ and /v/ representing different sounds and /p/ and /b/ representing different sounds as well.
