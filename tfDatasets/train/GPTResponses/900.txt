Petroleum production replaced agriculture and other natural resource-based industries as the focus of the economy in many countries. The abundance of oil reserves and the increasing demand for energy made it a lucrative industry that spurred economic growth and development. This shift towards petroleum production resulted in the development of new technologies and industries, creating jobs and driving economic growth. However, this also led to dependency on oil and its fluctuations in price, which can have significant impacts on the economy.
