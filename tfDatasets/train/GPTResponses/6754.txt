There could be multiple reasons why one judge rejects another's opinion:1. Interpretation of the Law: Different judges may have different interpretations of the law or may place more weight on certain legal precedents or doctrines than others, resulting in a difference in opinion.2. Personal Bias: Judges, like anyone else, can have personal biases that may affect their opinions. If a judge is biased towards a certain view or party, they may reject another's opinion that contradicts their own.3. Lack of Evidence or Argument: One judge may reject another's opinion if they find that the argument or evidence presented is insufficient or flawed.4. Different Approaches: Judges may have different judicial philosophy and approach towards decision-making, which can lead to differences in opinion.5. Appellate Review: Appellate judges may also reject trial court judges' opinions if they find that there was an error in law or that the trial court judge's opinion was unsupported by the evidence.
