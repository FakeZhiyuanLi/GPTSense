Literature is an art form that uses language to convey experiences, emotions, and ideas through various styles and poetic techniques. It is characterized by its use of literary devices, such as metaphor, imagery, and symbolism, which allow writers to create complex meanings and resonant themes. At its core, literature is a means of expressing the human experience, whether through fiction, poetry, drama, or non-fiction. It is a medium through which writers can convey their unique perspectives on the world, and through which readers can gain insight and understanding into the human condition.
