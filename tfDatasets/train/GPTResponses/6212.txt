The use of Sanskrit has influenced Sino-Tibetan languages primarily in the areas of vocabulary and syntax. Many Sino-Tibetan languages have borrowed Sanskrit words related to religion, culture, philosophy, and medicine. For example, in Tibetan, the Sanskrit word "Buddha" is transliterated as "Sangye." Similarly, in Chinese, Sanskrit words for Buddhist concepts such as "dharma" and "nirvana" have been borrowed and adapted.Additionally, Sanskrit has influenced the syntax of Sino-Tibetan languages. Some Tibetan sentence structures have been influenced by the Sanskrit language, which places the verb at the end of a sentence. Similarly, some Sino-Tibetan languages have adopted the use of postpositions, which is common in Sanskrit but not in Chinese.Overall, the influence of Sanskrit on Sino-Tibetan languages can be seen in the adoption of vocabulary and syntax, particularly in the domain of religion and philosophy.
