Whitehead believed in the principle of "relational ontology," which means that entities only exist in relation to other entities. He saw the world as a vast network of interconnected relationships, and argued that nothing exists independently or in isolation. According to Whitehead, every entity is inherently dependent on other entities for its existence and cannot be fully understood in isolation. This idea of relational ontology is central to Whitehead's philosophy of "process metaphysics," which emphasizes the dynamic and interconnected nature of reality.
