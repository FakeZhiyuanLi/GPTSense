One example of financial innovation that contributed to the financial crisis is mortgage-backed securities (MBS). MBS are investment products created by pooling together individual mortgages and selling them to investors. These securities are based on the cash flows from the underlying mortgages, which are then divided into different tranches or categories of risk.During the housing boom in the early 2000s, mortgage lenders started issuing subprime mortgages, which were loans offered to borrowers with poor credit histories. These subprime loans were then bundled together into MBS and sold to investors as high-yield, low-risk securities. This created a huge demand for subprime mortgages which led to many lenders offering them to people who could not afford them.As the number of defaults in subprime mortgages increased, MBS issued by these mortgages became worthless. This created a ripple effect throughout the financial system, as many financial institutions and investors had invested heavily in them. The resulting collapse of the MBS market contributed significantly to the financial crisis.
