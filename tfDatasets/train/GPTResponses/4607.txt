The hard rock style that emerged in the early 1990s was known as grunge. It originated in Seattle, Washington and was characterized by its heavy and distorted guitar sound, angst-ridden lyrics, and downplayed fashion sense. Some popular bands from this era include Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains.
