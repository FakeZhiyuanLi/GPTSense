The old masonic documents are referred to as the “Old Charges” or “Ancient Charges.” These are a collection of historical texts and manuscripts that outline the principles and practices of Freemasonry dating back to the early days of the organization. They are considered to be essential texts in the study of the history and traditions of Freemasonry. Examples of old masonic documents include the Regius Manuscript, the Cooke Manuscript, and the Grand Lodge Manuscript.
