In general, the development of European science was heavily influenced by various branches of mathematics, including:1. Algebra: The use of symbols and equations to solve complex problems was vital to the development of physics and engineering.2. Geometry: The study of shapes and spatial relationships was essential for astronomy and navigation.3. Calculus: The branch of mathematics that deals with rates of change and integration was crucial for physics, engineering, and the study of motion.4. Statistics: The use of statistical analysis in scientific experiments led to the development of modern experimental methods and helped to quantify scientific results.5. Differential equations: The study of differential equations was crucial for the development of fluid dynamics, which played a crucial role in the design of ships and other structures.Overall, mathematics played a fundamental role in the development of European science, providing methods and tools that allowed scientists to explore, explain, and quantify the natural world.
