Saline or brackish water can be made drinkable through a process called desalination. There are two main methods of desalination:1. Reverse Osmosis: A process in which water is forced through a semi-permeable membrane that removes salt and other impurities.2. Distillation: A process in which water is heated to create steam, which is then condensed into a separate container, leaving behind salt and other impurities.Both processes require specialized equipment and can be expensive, but they are effective ways to make saline or brackish water drinkable.
