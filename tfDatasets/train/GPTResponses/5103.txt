The type of life that is more metabolically diverse than multicellular life is microbial life. Microbes have a wide range of metabolic capabilities and can thrive in a variety of environments, from deep-sea vents to soil to the human gut. They can use a variety of energy sources, including sunlight, organic compounds, and inorganic compounds, and can produce a wide range of products, such as vitamins, enzymes, and antibiotics.
