During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, some political commentators attempted to attach the principle of natural selection to human races as a means of justifying various forms of racism and prejudice. They believed that some races were inherently superior to others, and that this superiority was based on factors such as intelligence, physical strength, and cultural development.In particular, social Darwinism was a popular ideology that viewed human societies as subject to the same laws of natural selection as plants and animals. This led to a belief in the existence of a "racial hierarchy," with white Europeans at the top and other races deemed inferior.However, these ideas have been thoroughly discredited by modern science. There is no scientific basis for the concept of race as a biological category, and the genetic differences between individuals within a given so-called race are often greater than the differences between different racial groups. Additionally, the idea that one race is inherently superior to another has been debunked through numerous studies and research demonstrating the innate potential of all individuals, regardless of their cultural background.
