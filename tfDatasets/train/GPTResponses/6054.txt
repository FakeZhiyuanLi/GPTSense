After completing the three phases of human trials, an application for regulatory approval is filed to obtain approval from the regulatory authorities to market and sell the drug or treatment. This is typically referred to as a New Drug Application (NDA) in the United States, or a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) in Europe. The application includes all data from the preclinical and clinical studies conducted to demonstrate the safety, efficacy, and quality of the drug or treatment.
