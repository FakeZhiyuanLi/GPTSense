There isn't one specific country that quickly changes most people working in government positions when a new government comes into power. The practice of replacing government officials upon a change in leadership is relatively common, but the extent and speed of these changes vary from country to country and depend on various factors such as the political system, the nature of the new government, and the level of corruption or politicization in the bureaucracy. Some countries that are known for large-scale turnover of government officials after elections or political transitions include Russia, Turkey, and the Philippines.
