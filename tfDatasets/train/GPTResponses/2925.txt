It is unclear without further context as to who referred to Somalia as a "nation of bards." However, historically, Somalia has been known for its rich oral tradition and poetry, and many Somalis consider themselves to be poets or storytellers. Therefore, it is possible that the individual who made this statement may have been a poet, historian, or cultural commentator.
