Galois theory is used to generalize the connection of fields and groups to infinite field extensions. Galois theory studies the symmetry properties of solutions to polynomial equations in terms of their underlying field structure. It relates field extensions to groups of automorphisms that preserve the algebraic structure of the field. This theory enables one to deduce certain properties of the field by studying the structure of the corresponding group of automorphisms. It has important applications in algebraic geometry, number theory, and other fields.
