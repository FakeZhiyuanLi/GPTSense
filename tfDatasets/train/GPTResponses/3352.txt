The Polish szlachta became more aristocratic and elitist over time, with privileges and social status being inherited rather than earned based on military or administrative service. They also became increasingly powerful in government and politics, leading to oligarchy and corruption. However, at the same time, the szlachta maintained a strong sense of pride and independence, which ultimately played a role in the fight for Polish independence in later years.
