There are a few reasons why seabirds from the southern hemisphere are more likely to migrate compared to those in the northern hemisphere:1. Seasonal changes: The southern hemisphere has more extreme seasonal changes than the northern hemisphere, which can impact food availability and weather conditions. Seabirds may need to migrate to other areas to find sufficient food or better nesting conditions.2. Longer distances: Seabirds in the southern hemisphere often have to migrate longer distances than those in the northern hemisphere due to the larger ocean expanses, which can require greater energy expenditure and more specialized navigation skills.3. Competition for resources: With limited resources, seabirds in the southern hemisphere may need to migrate further to escape competition for resources, such as breeding and feeding territories.4. Climate change: Climate change is affecting the distribution and abundance of prey for seabirds. As a result, some species may need to migrate further or more frequently to find food. In the southern hemisphere, these changes may be more extreme due to the vulnerability of Antarctic ecosystems to warming temperatures.Overall, these factors contribute to the higher likelihood of migration among seabirds in the southern hemisphere compared to those in the northern hemisphere.
