The 50 millimeter gun was gradually replaced by more accurate and advanced weapons systems such as the 75 millimeter gun and the 88 millimeter gun during World War II. In modern times, the 50 millimeter gun has been largely replaced by weapons such as the 105 millimeter gun and the 120 millimeter gun, which offer greater accuracy, range, and destructive power.
