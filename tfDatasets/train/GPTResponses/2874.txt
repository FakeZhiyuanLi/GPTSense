Bribes are used to cause individuals or organizations to act in a particular way that benefits the briber. This could include making decisions that are favorable to the briber's interests, providing preferential treatment, and turning a blind eye to unethical or illegal activities. Bribes may also be used to gain access to confidential information or to gain an advantage in business or political dealings. Ultimately, bribes are used to manipulate and control others to achieve a desired outcome.
