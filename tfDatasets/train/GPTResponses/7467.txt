The basis of plant physiology is the study of how plants function, grow and develop. It involves the investigation of various physiological processes like photosynthesis, respiration, transpiration, nutrient uptake, hormone regulation, and stress responses. This field of study also includes the study of the interactions of plants with the environment and the role of plant cells and tissues in plant development and growth. Overall, plant physiology seeks to understand the intricate mechanisms that allow plants to survive, adapt and thrive in diverse environments.
