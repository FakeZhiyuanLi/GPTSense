Criminal law is a branch of law that deals with criminal offenses committed against the government or society as a whole. It sets out the rules and procedures for prosecuting individuals who have been accused of committing crimes, and outlines the punishments that can be imposed if they are found guilty. Criminal offenses can include everything from minor offenses such as traffic violations to more serious offenses such as theft, assault, and murder. The purpose of criminal law is to maintain order and protect the safety and well-being of the general public.
