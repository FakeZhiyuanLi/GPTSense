After an initial inquiry of a candidate, the recruiter or hiring manager may schedule a phone or video interview to ask more in-depth questions about the candidate's experience, skills, and qualifications. They may also ask for references, conduct a background check or request the candidate to complete an assessment or test before making a decision on whether to invite them for a face-to-face interview. In some cases, the initial inquiry may involve sending the candidate an online application or asking them to submit their resume and cover letter for further review.
