The expected service life of the UK 1942 design light fleet carrier was around 25 years. However, many of these carriers were scrapped or sold off before reaching this age due to the advancements in naval technology and the changing role of carriers in modern naval warfare. The last carrier of this design, HMS Bulwark, was decommissioned in 1981.
