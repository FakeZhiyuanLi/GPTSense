Systematics aims to discover the evolutionary relationships between species, populations, and other taxa. It seeks to understand how different groups of organisms have diversified and evolved over time, and how they are related to one another. Through the use of different techniques such as molecular biology, morphology, and biogeography, systematics aims to construct phylogenetic trees that reflect the evolutionary history of life on Earth. These trees can be used to identify the common ancestry of different groups of organisms, and to infer patterns of evolution and divergence over time.
