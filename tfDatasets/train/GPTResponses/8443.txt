The topics that include bitwise encoding, collation, and rendering are related to programming and computer science.1. Bitwise Encoding: This is a technique used to encode data by representing each bit in a binary form. It is used in various applications such as cryptography, data compression, and network protocols.2. Collation: This refers to the sorting and arrangement of data in a specific order, based on rules for comparison. For example, collation is used to sort text data in a specific language or alphabet.3. Rendering: Refers to the process of converting digital data into a visual or audible form. It is commonly used in web design, graphic design, and gaming.These topics are all related to the manipulation of data in different ways to achieve specific results, which is essential in computer science and programming.
