The great separation that came to be from a dispute over the succession to Muhammad is the division between Sunni and Shia Muslims. After the death of the Prophet Muhammad in 632 AD, there was a disagreement among his followers about who should be his successor. Some believed that he should be succeeded by a close companion and friend, Abu Bakr. Others believed that he should be succeeded by his cousin and son-in-law, Ali, who was also married to his daughter Fatima.Over time, these two groups developed into the Sunni and Shia sects of Islam. The Sunni Muslims, who believed that Abu Bakr should succeed Muhammad, make up the majority of Muslims worldwide. The Shia Muslims, who believed that Ali should succeed Muhammad, make up a minority of Muslims worldwide but are the majority in countries such as Iran and Iraq.The division between Sunni and Shia Muslims has resulted in centuries of conflict, including wars, political instability, and sectarian violence. Despite these differences, both Sunni and Shia Muslims share many core beliefs and practices, such as the belief in one God and the importance of prayer and social justice.
