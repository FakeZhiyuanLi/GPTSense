Drug discovery typically involves multiple stages that include:1. Target identification: This involves identifying a specific molecule or biological process that is involved in a particular disease or condition.2. Lead discovery: This involves screening large libraries of compounds or molecules to identify initial leads that may have potential therapeutic effects.3. Lead optimization: The most promising leads are then optimized through chemical modifications and other evaluations to improve their efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic properties.4. Preclinical development: The developed compounds undergo rigorous testing in cellular and animal models to evaluate their safety and efficacy before proceeding to clinical trials.5. Clinical development: In this stage, the drug candidate is evaluated in human trials to determine its safety and efficacy, and to establish the therapeutic dosage.6. Regulatory approval: Upon successful completion of clinical trials, the drug candidate undergoes review and approval by regulatory agencies such as the FDA or EMA before it can be marketed to patients.7. Post-marketing surveillance: After approval, drugs are continually monitored for safety and effectiveness through post-marketing surveillance studies.
