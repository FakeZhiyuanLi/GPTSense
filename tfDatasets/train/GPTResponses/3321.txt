If possessing a language leads to a group being regarded as a separate people, the political arrangement that follows is typically some form of recognition and protection of their rights as a distinct cultural and linguistic group. This may include the creation of an autonomous region, the designation of official languages, the provision of language education and support, and representation in government and other institutions. In extreme cases, it may also lead to demands for independence or self-determination.
