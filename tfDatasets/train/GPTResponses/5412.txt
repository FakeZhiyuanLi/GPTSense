The unification of Germany under the leadership of Chancellor Otto von Bismarck in 1871 ended the balance of power in the Congress of Vienna. The Congress of Vienna was a series of diplomatic meetings held in 1815 that aimed to establish a stable balance of power among European nations after the Napoleonic Wars. The unification of Germany upset this balance of power, as it created a powerful and centralized state in the heart of Europe. This shift in power dynamics contributed to the tensions and conflicts that would lead to World War I.
