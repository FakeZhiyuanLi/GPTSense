There are several factors that contribute to less than ideal working conditions for garment workers. These include:1. Low wages: Many garment workers are paid low wages, which makes it difficult for them to make ends meet. This can lead to long hours of work and limited access to health care and education.2. Lack of regulations: Many countries lack regulations to protect workers from exploitation and to ensure that they are working in safe conditions. This means that workers may be exposed to dangerous chemicals or substances, suffer from workplace injuries, or work in poorly ventilated buildings.3. Pressure to meet production targets: To meet the demands of fast fashion, workers may be pressured to work long hours and meet high production targets. This can lead to exhaustion and injury.4. Gender discrimination: The majority of garment workers are women, who may face gender discrimination in terms of pay, promotions, and opportunities for training and advancement.5. Lack of worker representation: Many garment workers are not represented by unions or worker groups, which can make it difficult for them to advocate for their rights and demand better working conditions.
