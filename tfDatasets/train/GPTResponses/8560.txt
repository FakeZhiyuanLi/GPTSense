Charles Darwin noticed that slave-making ants raided the nests of other ant species and stole the pupae (young ants), which they then raised as their own slaves. He observed that the slave ants were forced to perform labor for their new colony, including feeding and caring for the brood and maintaining the nest. Additionally, he noted that the slave-making ants themselves were not capable of performing these tasks, and relied entirely on their slave labor to survive.
