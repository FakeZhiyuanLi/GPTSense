The United States has a complex way of acknowledging race due to its history of segregation and discrimination. The country has a long history of categorizing people based on their racial identity, and this has created a complex and often controversial system of racial classification. The government, businesses, and other institutions use various racial categorizations for different purposes, and there is ongoing debate about the most appropriate and accurate ways to define and acknowledge racial identity.
