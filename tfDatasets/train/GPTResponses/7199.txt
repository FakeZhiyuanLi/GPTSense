It is difficult to determine the exact number of species that are resistant to DDT as resistance can vary across populations and geographic regions. However, over 100 species of insects, including mosquitoes and bedbugs, have been found to be resistant to DDT. Additionally, some bird species, such as the peregrine falcon and bald eagle, were severely impacted by DDT use but have since recovered due to conservation efforts and the banning of DDT in many countries.
