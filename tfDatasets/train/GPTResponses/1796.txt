In order for a gene to encode multiple proteins, its mRNA must be alternatively spliced. Alternative splicing is a process in which different combinations of exons (coding regions) within a gene are spliced together to produce different mRNAs. These mRNAs can then be translated into different protein isoforms that have different functions or are expressed in different tissues or developmental stages. The regulation of alternative splicing is complex and involves the coordination of multiple splicing factors and regulatory sequences within the pre-mRNA.
