The federal funds rate is the interest rate at which banks and other depository institutions lend money to each other overnight on an unsecured basis. It is determined by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the Federal Reserve System and is used as a tool for controlling inflation and stabilizing the economy. Changes to the federal funds rate affect other interest rates, including those for mortgages, car loans, credit cards, and other consumer loans.
