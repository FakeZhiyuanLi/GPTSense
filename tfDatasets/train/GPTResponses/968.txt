The Y chromosome haplogroup N is primarily found in populations of northern Eurasia and Siberia. It is distinguished by several genetic mutations that have accumulated over time, resulting in a unique genetic signature. People who carry the N haplogroup are believed to have shared a common ancestor who lived approximately 18,000 to 20,000 years ago. This group is of particular interest to scientists because it is associated with the migration of early humans across the Bering Strait into the Americas. Studies of the y haplogroup N have provided insight into the genetic history and diversity of human populations.
