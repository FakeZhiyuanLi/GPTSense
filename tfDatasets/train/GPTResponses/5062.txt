Nonverbal communication refers to the use of body language, gestures, facial expressions, eye contact, intonation, and other nonverbal cues to express thoughts, emotions, and intentions. It serves as a means of conveying messages without using words, and is an important aspect of human interaction and communication. Nonverbal communication often provides more information about a person's true feelings and intentions than verbal communication alone.
