Along with the Marshall Plan, the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) was also administered by the ECA. The ECSC aimed to regulate the coal and steel industries in six European countries in order to create economic cooperation and prevent further conflict between them. The ECA provided technical assistance and financial support for the implementation of the ECSC.
