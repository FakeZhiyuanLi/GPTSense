August Weismann believed in the "germ-plasm" theory of evolution, which posited that only genetic changes in the reproductive cells (germ cells) can be passed on to the offspring, and that acquired traits cannot be inherited. This was a minority view at the time, as many scientists believed in the inheritance of acquired characteristics.
