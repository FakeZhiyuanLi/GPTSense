Radiant luminous efficacy is a measure of how efficiently a light source converts electrical power into visible light. It is the ratio of the total visible light emitted by a source to the total radiant power emitted, and is typically measured in lumens per watt (lm/W). The higher the radiant luminous efficacy, the more efficient the light source is at converting power into visible light.
