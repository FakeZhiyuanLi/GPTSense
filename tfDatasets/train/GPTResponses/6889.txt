There were several problems with manufacturing the tungsten filament for electric light bulbs. One major issue was that tungsten is a very hard and brittle metal, making it difficult to shape into a filament. Additionally, tungsten has a very high melting point, which made it difficult to work with in the manufacturing process. Finally, the manufacturing process for creating tungsten filaments required very precise conditions and equipment, which made it expensive and time-consuming to produce large numbers of light bulbs.
