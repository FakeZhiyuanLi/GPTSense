Approximately 10,000 bird species are known to be migratory, but the exact number of long-distance migrants is difficult to determine. Some estimates suggest that around 4,000 bird species engage in regular migrations, with about half of these undertaking long-distance journeys. However, these numbers may vary depending on the definition and criteria used to define long-distance migration.
