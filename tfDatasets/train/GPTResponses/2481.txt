Diurnal birds, which are birds that are active during the day, produce visual and auditory signals to communicate with other birds, attract mates, and defend their territory. They also produce vocalizations such as songs and calls.Non-migratory species that are active during the day also produce similar vocalizations and visual signals. However, migratory birds that move from one location to another often produce more complex vocalizations and may rely more heavily on visual signals such as body language and coloration to communicate with other birds. This is because they often communicate with unfamiliar individuals and need to be able to convey information quickly and efficiently.
