OAS stands for OpenAPI Specification. It is a standard used to describe RESTful APIs, which allows developers to design and document their APIs in a structured and standardized way. The OpenAPI Specification is essentially a JSON file that details the endpoints, input and output parameters, authentication requirements, and other details that are necessary for other developers or machines to understand and interact with an API.
