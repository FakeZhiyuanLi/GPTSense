It is not possible for me to accurately predict which president will have two coins with his portrait on it in the future. However, currently, Presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, and Ronald Reagan have had multiple coins featuring their portraits.
