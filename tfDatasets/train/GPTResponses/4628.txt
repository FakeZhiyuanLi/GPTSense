The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) has rules and regulations for meeting the credit needs of minority populations. The objective of the CRA is to encourage banks and other financial institutions to meet the credit needs of the communities in which they operate, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, and minority communities. CRA assesses the performance of institutions against established criteria, such as lending, investment, and service in the community. The CRA requires financial institutions to provide equal access to credit and to serve the credit needs of all members of the community, irrespective of their race, ethnicity, or other characteristic.
