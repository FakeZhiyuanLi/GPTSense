After the food is chewed and mixed with starches, it enters the stomach where it is further broken down by stomach acid and digestive enzymes. The stomach mixes the food with gastric juices, which contain hydrochloric acid and enzymes like pepsin. The acid breaks down the food into a liquid state and the enzymes start breaking down proteins. The churning action of the stomach muscles also helps to mix the food and break it down further. As the food is broken down, it forms a semi-liquid substance called chyme, which gradually moves into the small intestine for further digestion and absorption of nutrients.
