It depends on the specific sport and championship. In some sports, such as soccer, a draw in the championship match could result in extra time or penalty shootouts to determine a winner. In other sports, such as basketball, a tied game in the championship could result in overtime periods until a winner is decided. In some cases, such as in individual sports like tennis, a draw may not be possible and a winner must be determined.
