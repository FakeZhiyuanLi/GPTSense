ACE inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) are a type of medication that help to lower blood pressure and improve heart function. They work by reducing the amount of angiotensin II, a hormone that increases blood pressure by causing blood vessels to constrict, produced in the body. By blocking the action of this hormone, ACE inhibitors help to relax blood vessels, lower blood pressure, and improve blood flow. This can help to reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke, and other cardiovascular problems. Additionally, ACE inhibitors may also help to reduce the damage done to the kidneys by high blood pressure and related conditions.
