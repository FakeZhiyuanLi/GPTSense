There are several factors that led to bad investments by asset managers in over-priced credit assets:1. Lack of proper due diligence: Asset managers may not have conducted proper due diligence before investing in certain credit assets. They may have relied solely on credit ratings, which may not have accurately reflected the risk level of the asset.2. Increased competition: In a low-interest-rate environment, asset managers may have been faced with increased competition to generate returns, leading them to take on higher-risk investments.3. Overconfidence: Asset managers may have overestimated their ability to manage risk or assumed that the market would continue to rise indefinitely, leading them to take on riskier investments than they could handle.4. Lack of transparency: The opacity of financial markets can make it difficult for asset managers to identify and assess the risk of certain credit assets.5. Misaligned incentives: Some asset managers may have been incentivized to take on riskier investments due to compensation structures that reward short-term gains over long-term performance.
