They have their own legislative assemblies and autonomous governments, but they are not part of the United Kingdom or the European Union.The Isle of Man is a self-governing British Crown dependency located between Great Britain and Ireland in the Irish Sea. It has a population of around 85,000 people and its own government, though it is considered part of the British Isles.
