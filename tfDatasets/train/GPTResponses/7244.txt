Highly sensitive film, also known as high-speed film or fast film, has a greater ability to capture images in low light conditions compared to less sensitive films. This means that images taken with high-speed film may have a grainy or "noisy" appearance due to the increased size of the grain particles on the film.However, this graininess can also add a unique aesthetic quality to the images, especially if it is intentional and used creatively. Additionally, high-speed film can allow for faster shutter speeds, which can help capture subjects in motion with greater clarity.Overall, the effect of highly sensitive film on images depends on the specific context and intentions of the photographer.
