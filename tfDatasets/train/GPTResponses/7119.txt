RFI (Radio Frequency Interference) is generated by various sources of electromagnetic radiation or electromagnetic fields. Some common sources of RFI include:1. Electronic devices such as radios, televisions, computers, and mobile phones.2. Electrical equipment such as transformers, motors, and power lines.3. Natural sources such as lightning and cosmic radiation.4. Intentional sources such as radio transmitters, radar, and microwave ovens.When an electronic device or any other source of electromagnetic radiation emits an electromagnetic wave of a certain frequency, it can interfere with the functioning of other electronic devices that operate at the same frequency. For example, a microwave oven emits electromagnetic waves around 2.45 GHz, which can interfere with Wi-Fi signals that also operate at the same frequency.RFI can cause a variety of problems such as distortion of audio and video signals, degradation of data transmission speeds, and interference with wireless communication signals. To mitigate the effects of RFI, shielding, filtering, and isolation techniques are used.
