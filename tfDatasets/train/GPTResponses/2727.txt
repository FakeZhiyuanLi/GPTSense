Several new villages were built in France almost exclusively for skiing in the mid-20th century, particularly in the 1950s and 1960s. Some examples include:- Val d'Isère: Although the village of Val d'Isère dates back centuries, it was largely rebuilt in the 1950s to accommodate the growing popularity of skiing. Today, it is one of the most famous ski resorts in the world.- Les Arcs: The village of Les Arcs was designed and built in the 1960s by French architect Charlotte Perriand. The resort is known for its modernist architecture and was one of the first purpose-built ski villages in France.- Avoriaz: Located in the Portes du Soleil ski area, Avoriaz was built in the late 1960s as a car-free ski resort. The village is known for its distinctive architecture, which features buildings clad in timber and slate.- La Plagne: Like Val d'Isère, La Plagne has a long history but was largely rebuilt in the 1960s to cater to skiers. Today, it is one of the largest ski areas in the world, with over 425 km of pistes.
