Ozone depletion allows for increased levels of Ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation to reach the Earth's surface, which can harm living organisms and lead to negative health effects such as skin cancer, cataracts, and weakened immune systems. It can also have negative impacts on crops, marine ecosystems, and the ozone layer itself. Additionally, ozone depletion can contribute to climate change by affecting atmospheric circulation patterns.
