The organism that acts as a single non-coding RNA gene is the microRNA (miRNA). MiRNAs are a type of non-coding RNA that play important roles in regulating gene expression. They are short RNA molecules (around 22 nucleotides long) that can bind to and inhibit the translation of mRNA molecules, thus preventing the formation of specific proteins. MiRNAs are found in a wide range of organisms, from plants to animals, and are involved in various biological processes, including development, differentiation, and disease.
