During cell division, deuterostome embryos undergo a process called radial cleavage, where the cells divide parallel or perpendicular to the polar axis of the embryo. This leads to the formation of a hollow ball of cells called a blastula. The blastula later undergoes gastrulation, a process that involves the formation of three germ layers the endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. During gastrulation, the blastula invaginates, resulting in the formation of a two-layered structure called the gastrula. In deuterostomes, gastrulation results in the formation of the anus first, followed by the mouth later. This contrasts with protostomes, where the mouth forms first, followed by the anus.
