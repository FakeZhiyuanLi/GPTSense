It depends on the properties of the RPG and the ground it is fired at.If the RPG is a high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) round and the ground is hard and flat, the round could potentially ricochet off the ground and continue traveling, losing some velocity and stability in the process.If the RPG is a fragmentation round or the ground is soft, such as mud or sand, the round is more likely to be absorbed or deflected upon impact, causing it to explode or become inert.It is important to note that firing an RPG in such a way is highly dangerous and not recommended in most situations.
