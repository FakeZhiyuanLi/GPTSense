subfields?Anthropology is a vast and diverse field that has diversified into dozens of subfields over the past century or so. This diversification has occurred largely due to the increasing complexity and specialization of research questions, the emergence of new methodologies and theories, and the globalization of human societies.Some of the major subfields of anthropology include:1. Cultural Anthropology: Also known as social anthropology, this subfield focuses on the study of human cultures and societies, including their beliefs, customs, practices, and social structures.2. Archaeology: This subfield focuses on the study of human societies through their material remains, including artifacts, structures, and other physical remains.3. Linguistic Anthropology: This subfield focuses on the study of human language and its role in shaping culture, communication, and social identity.4. Biological Anthropology: This subfield focuses on the study of human biology, evolution, and variation, including genetics, anatomy, and physiology.5. Medical Anthropology: This subfield focuses on the study of health, illness, and healing in human societies.6. Environmental Anthropology: This subfield focuses on the study of human interactions with the natural environment, including resource use, conservation, and sustainability.7. Economic Anthropology: This subfield focuses on the relationship between economic systems and culture, including the ways in which production, distribution, and consumption are influenced by cultural factors.8. Political Anthropology: This subfield focuses on the study of power, authority, and governance in human societies, including the ways in which political structures are shaped by cultural factors.Other subfields include Urban Anthropology, Psychological Anthropology, Visual Anthropology, Gender and Sexuality Studies, and many more.
