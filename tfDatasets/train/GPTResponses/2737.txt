The density of a tree's wood can often be judged by its color, which can give clues about its strength and hardness. Darker woods are generally denser and stronger than lighter woods. However, this is not always the case as there are other factors that influence the strength and hardness of wood such as its moisture content, grain orientation, and growth patterns.
