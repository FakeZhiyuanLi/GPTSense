The underlying methodology for finding worldwide estimates for losses due to security breaches involves several steps, including:1. Defining the scope of the study: This involves determining what types of security breaches and losses will be included in the analysis, as well as which countries or regions will be included.2. Collecting data: Data on security breaches and losses can be gathered from a variety of sources, such as incident reports, surveys of businesses or individuals, and publicly available data from government or industry sources.3. Categorizing and classifying data: The collected data needs to be categorized into different types of security breaches and losses, such as data breaches, financial losses, and reputational damage.4. Calculating the costs: Once the data is categorized, the costs associated with each type of security breach and loss can be calculated. These costs may include direct costs, such as the cost of investigating and remedying the breach, as well as indirect costs, such as the loss of customers or damage to reputation.5. Estimating the total losses: To estimate the total losses due to security breaches worldwide, the calculated costs will be extrapolated to the entire population or market being studied.6. Validating the estimates: The estimates can be validated by comparing them with previous studies or industry reports, and by conducting sensitivity analyses to test the impact of different assumptions or data sources.Overall, the methodology for finding worldwide estimates for losses due to security breaches involves a combination of data collection, categorization, calculation, and extrapolation, along with careful validation to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the estimates.
