It is difficult to provide an exact percentage as the concept of serfdom varied throughout Western Europe, and records from the time are limited. However, it is estimated that in some regions, such as Germany and France, around 30-40% of the population were serfs during the 12th and 13th centuries. In other areas, such as England and Italy, the percentage was likely lower, ranging from 10-20%. It is important to note that serfdom declined throughout Europe from the 14th to the 18th centuries and was eventually abolished in the 19th century.
