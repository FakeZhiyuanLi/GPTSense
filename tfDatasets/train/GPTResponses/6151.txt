The Great Depression, which impacted the economy and put a halt to the Gold Rush, was caused by a combination of factors including overproduction in agriculture and manufacturing, high levels of debt and speculation in the stock market, a banking crisis, and a reduction in international trade due to protectionist policies. The stock market crash of 1929 is often seen as a turning point and a major catalyst for the Depression.
