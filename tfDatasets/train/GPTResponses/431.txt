Dogs have been taken to mental health facilities and therapy sessions to assist individuals with mental disorders in socializing and managing their symptoms. Therapy dogs, emotional support dogs, and service dogs can all be trained to provide comfort, companionship, and support to individuals with various mental disorders such as anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and autism spectrum disorder. These dogs can help individuals by reducing anxiety, providing a non-judgmental listener, improving communication skills, and increasing socialization skills. Pet therapy has been shown to have significant positive impacts on the mental health and well-being of individuals with mental disorders.
