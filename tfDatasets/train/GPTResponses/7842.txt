One of the first people to experiment with flights from Berlin to New York, stopping in the Azores, was German aviation pioneer Hugo Junkers. In the 1920s, Junkers designed and built a number of aircraft that were capable of making transatlantic flights with a stopover in the mid-Atlantic islands. One of his most famous designs was the Junkers F13, which was one of the first all-metal airplanes and was widely used in the interwar period for both commercial and military purposes. Junkers' experiments and innovations helped pave the way for the development of modern air travel.
