Yes, some varieties of poultry have more dark meat than others. For example, ducks and geese have more dark meat than chickens and turkeys. This is because their muscles are used more frequently and intensely, leading to an increase in myoglobin, a protein that gives the meat its dark color. Additionally, certain breeds within a species can also produce more dark meat than others, depending on their genetics and how actively they use their muscles.
