An alternative power source for an external hard and optical disk drive is a USB port. Many external hard drives and optical disk drives come with USB cables that can transfer data and provide power from a USB port on a computer or other device. Some external hard drives also have AC power adapters that can be used to power the drive independently of a computer or USB port. Additionally, some portable external hard drives have built-in rechargeable batteries that provide power without requiring a separate power source.
