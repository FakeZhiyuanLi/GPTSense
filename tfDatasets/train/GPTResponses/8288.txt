Shen Kua (1031-1095) observed and made important contributions to a wide range of scientific fields, including:1. Astronomy: Shen Kua proposed a new method of determining the sidereal year, accurately calculated the length of the solar year, and made observations of the stars.2. Meteorology: He studied weather patterns and wrote the book "Dream Pool Essays" which contained observations on weather phenomena such as solar and lunar eclipses, rainfall, and fog.3. Geology: Shen Kua was among the first scholars in the world to suggest that land formation was the result of natural processes such as erosion and deposition.4. Environmental Science: He recognized the importance of planting trees to prevent soil erosion and promote ecological balance.5. Physics: Shen Kua studied the properties of light and optics, including the refraction of light in water and glass.6. Mathematics: Shen Kua contributed to the field of trigonometry, coining the terms "right angle" and "acute angle" and developing a table of sines.7. Engineering: He designed hydraulic-powered devices, including a water-powered armillary sphere, and developed theories on the mechanics of floating objects.
