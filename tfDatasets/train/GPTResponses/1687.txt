One notable stone wall built in ancient Somalia is the Amud or "Heel Stone." This is a megalithic monument located in Hargeisa, capital of the northwestern Somaliland region. The Amud wall is believed to have been built during the third millennium BC by the people of the Dhambalin region. It consists of several large stones, one of which is the "Heel Stone," which stands at over 5 meters tall and has a distinctive shape resembling a human heel. The exact purpose of the Amud wall is not known, but it is thought to have been used for ritual or religious purposes.
