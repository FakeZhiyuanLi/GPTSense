in Europe?During the early Middle Ages in Europe, religious works such as illuminated manuscripts, altarpieces, and frescoes were common. These works of art were created for use in churches, monasteries, and other religious institutions. They depicted scenes from the Bible, the lives of saints, and other religious themes, and were intended to inspire devotion and piety in the viewer. Some of the most famous examples of religious works from this period include the Book of Kells, the Lindisfarne Gospels, and the Bayeux Tapestry.
