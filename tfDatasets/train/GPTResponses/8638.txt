Darwin considered three main factors to be the most important in determining the differences in species that evolve separately in similar environments: natural selection, genetic drift, and gene flow.1. Natural selection: This is the process by which organisms with certain advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on those traits to their offspring. Darwin believed that natural selection was the primary driver of evolution, and that it could lead to the development of completely new species over long periods of time.2. Genetic drift: This is the random fluctuation in the frequency of different traits within a population, caused by factors such as chance mating and environmental changes. Darwin recognized that genetic drift could also play a role in shaping the evolution of species, although he considered it to be a less powerful force than natural selection.3. Gene flow: This is the movement of genes between populations, which can occur through migration, hybridization, or other mechanisms. Darwin understood that gene flow could help to connect separate populations and prevent them from evolving into distinct species, but he also recognized that it could introduce new traits into a population and help to drive its evolution in new directions.
