One feature of sweatshops beyond lack of benefits and representation is poor and unsafe working conditions. Sweatshops are often cramped and poorly ventilated, making it difficult for workers to breathe and increasing the risk of respiratory illnesses. Workers may also be exposed to hazardous chemicals and machinery without proper training or protective gear. Additionally, many sweatshops have long and grueling work hours, with workers often forced to work overtime without proper compensation. These work conditions can lead to physical and mental health problems for workers.
