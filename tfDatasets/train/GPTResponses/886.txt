A school that does not base its admissions on academic merit is typically a private or independent school that either has a different criteria for acceptance or does not require academic achievement as a factor. Examples of schools that do not base their admissions on academic merit include Montessori schools, Waldorf schools, and schools that specialize in arts or athletics. Additionally, some schools may focus on character, creativity, or social skills rather than academic performance when considering applicants.
