One example of economic discrimination is when a company pays its female employees less than their male counterparts for doing the same job. This is known as the gender pay gap, and it can have a significant impact on a woman's career prospects and financial stability over time. Other examples of economic discrimination include denying someone a loan or credit based on their race or ethnicity, or refusing to hire someone because of their disability status. These practices can perpetuate systemic inequality and limit opportunities for marginalized groups.
