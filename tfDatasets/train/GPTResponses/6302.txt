When someone's sexuality is fluid, it means that their sexual attraction or orientation can change over time, and may not necessarily be limited to one gender or identity. They may experience attraction to varying degrees towards people of different genders, including those who identify as non-binary, queer, or genderqueer. This can be a natural and normal part of human sexuality, and everyone's experience of it is unique.
