The Stonewall Inn in New York City is considered the spark for LGBT rights. It was the site of the Stonewall riots in 1969, which was a series of protests by members of the LGBT community against police harassment and discrimination. The riots are often cited as the beginning of the modern LGBT rights movement in the United States.
