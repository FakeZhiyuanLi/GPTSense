Word order flexibility in Czech is primarily used for emphasis, clarity and style, rather than for grammatical correctness. It allows speakers to stress important information or elements of a sentence, to add nuances or subtleties, or to create a certain tone or mood in their communication. For example, speakers can choose to place the subject at the beginning of the sentence for emphasis, or put the verb at the end for a more poetic effect. In general, Czech speakers tend to prefer a more fluid and varied word order than other languages, which helps to make their communication more nuanced and expressive.
