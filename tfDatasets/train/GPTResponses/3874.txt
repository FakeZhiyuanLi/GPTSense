Fats are mainly digested in the small intestine, particularly in the duodenum and the first part of the jejunum. The digestion of fats begins in the stomach with the release of gastric lipase enzyme, but most of the digestion occurs in the small intestine with the help of secretions from the pancreas and liver. Bile, which is produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder, emulsifies fats, increasing the surface area for enzymes to act upon, thus aiding in their digestion.
