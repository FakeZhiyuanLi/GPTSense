One consequence of the Roman Empire being divided was the weakening of its overall power and influence. The Eastern and Western empires became increasingly independent, and the constant conflicts between them weakened the economy, military, and overall stability of the empire. This eventually led to the collapse of the Western Roman Empire and the formation of smaller kingdoms across Europe, marking the end of the era of Roman dominance.
