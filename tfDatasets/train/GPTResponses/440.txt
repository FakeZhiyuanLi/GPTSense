There is no legal requirement for a search dog to wear anything specific when searching a mosque or a home occupied by Muslims in Britain. However, some police forces have implemented guidelines to respect the cultural and religious sensitivities of the community they are searching in, and may opt for sniffer dogs that are not trained to detect pork or alcohol products, which are forbidden in Islam. Additionally, searches in places of worship or homes may be conducted with utmost care and consideration to avoid any offense or disrespect.
