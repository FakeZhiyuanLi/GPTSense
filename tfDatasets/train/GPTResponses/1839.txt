Cows on dairy farms are often affected by timing, as they are typically milked at specific times of the day. The timing of milking may impact the yield and quality of milk produced, as well as the overall health and wellbeing of the cows. Additionally, cows may be fed and cared for on a strict schedule, which can also impact their productivity and health.
