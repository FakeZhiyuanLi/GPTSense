Sequencing is done on plants for various reasons such as:1. Understanding plant genetics: Sequencing the DNA of the plant helps in understanding its genetic makeup and how it relates to its characteristics, such as growth rate, disease resistance, and yield.2. Development of better crops: By sequencing plant genomes, scientists can identify genetic variations that influence desirable traits, such as drought tolerance or resistance to pests, and breed plants with those traits.3. Conservation and management of plant species: Sequencing plant genomes also helps in understanding the evolutionary history and genetic diversity of different plant species, which is important in their conservation and management.4. Medicinal and biotechnological uses: Plants are a major source of medicines and biotechnology products, and sequencing their genomes provides insights into how they produce these compounds and how they can be optimized for production.
