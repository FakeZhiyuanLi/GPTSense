The 3:2 pulldown technique is used to convert 24 frames per second (fps) film material to 30 fps video material. This is achieved by repeating certain frames to make up the difference in frame rates.In this technique, two frames of film are converted into three frames of video by repeating certain fields. Therefore, the total time for two frames of film is 1/24 x 2 = 0.0833 seconds (or approximately 83 milliseconds).However, after applying 3:2 pulldown technique, the total time for these two frames becomes 1/30 x 3 = 0.1 seconds (or approximately 100 milliseconds). This is because the two frames are now represented by three frames of video material.
