The massed snow in Antarctica produces ice sheets, which can potentially contribute to sea-level rise as they melt and flow into the ocean. These ice sheets also contain valuable information about past climate and can provide insight into future climate change. Additionally, the snow in Antarctica provides important habitat and resources for various species of wildlife adapted to the extreme conditions of the continent.
