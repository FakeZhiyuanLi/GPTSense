Alfred Thayer Mahan was concerned about the necessity for the United States to have a strong navy to protect and expand its interests around the world. He believed that a country's naval power was a key determinant of its global influence and economic prosperity. In his book, "The Influence of Sea Power upon History," he argued that the great naval powers of history were able to dominate trade routes and project their power around the world, which contributed to their success as empires. He thus advocated for the construction of a strong American Navy capable of protecting American commerce and projecting American power beyond its shores.
