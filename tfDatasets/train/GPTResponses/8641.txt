Unicode-based fonts are normally focused on supporting multiple languages and scripts worldwide. This includes support for characters such as Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and many more. The goal of Unicode is to provide a universal character set that can be used for all languages, making it easier for people to communicate and share information across different cultures and regions.
