In the United States, the responsibility for public transport, traffic control, policing, and education primarily falls under the purview of state and local governments. The federal government plays a limited role in these areas, mainly through funding and regulations.Each state has its own Department of Transportation responsible for overseeing public transportation, traffic control, and highway systems. Local governments, such as cities and counties, often have their own police departments that are responsible for law enforcement in their jurisdictions.Education is primarily a state responsibility, with each state having its own education department and setting its own educational standards. Local school districts are responsible for implementing these standards and managing their local schools.Overall, the system of government in the United States is designed to give significant power and autonomy to state and local governments in these areas.
