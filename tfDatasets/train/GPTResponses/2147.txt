Agreements in a treaty are expressed through specific and precise language in the treaty text. Each agreement is typically expressed as a separate article or clause within the treaty, and each article or clause will specify what the parties to the treaty have agreed to do or not to do. The language used in the agreement may also include technical terms or legal jargon, and may refer to other international agreements or legal frameworks. In some cases, a treaty may also include annexes or protocols that further clarify or expand upon specific agreements.
