Some of the most different elements between the English and Scandinavian languages include:1. Pronunciation: The way vowels and consonants are pronounced can be very different between the two languages. For example, some Scandinavian languages have more vowel sounds than English, and may use guttural or velar sounds that are uncommon in English.2. Grammar: The word order, verb tense, and even the use of articles can vary significantly between English and Scandinavian languages. For example, in some Scandinavian languages, the verb comes at the end of a sentence rather than in the middle or beginning like English.3. Vocabulary: While some words may be similar between the two languages (such as "cat" or "house"), there are many words in each language that are unique to that language and have no direct translation in the other.4. Spelling: While both languages use the Latin alphabet, the spelling conventions can be different. For example, some Scandinavian languages use diacritical marks (such as รถ or รฅ) that are not used in English, and vice versa.5. Syntax: The way that words are combined to form phrases and sentences can also be different between English and Scandinavian languages. This can include the use of prepositions, conjunctions, and other linking words.
