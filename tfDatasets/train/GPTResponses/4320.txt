Puberty is caused by a complex interplay of hormonal and biological changes that start in the brain and trigger the release of hormones from the pituitary gland. These hormones, including luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), stimulate the production of sex hormones in the testes and ovaries. In males, testosterone triggers the development of secondary sex characteristics such as deeper voice, facial hair, and muscle growth, while in females, estrogen and progesterone cause the development of breasts, body hair, and menstruation. The timing and duration of puberty can be influenced by genetics, environmental factors, and overall health.
