It is erroneously believed that the medieval church forbade dissection of human bodies for the purpose of medical research. However, there is evidence to suggest that dissection was allowed and even encouraged in some medieval European universities for the purpose of medical education. The church did place some restrictions on the use of human remains, but these were related to issues of sanctity and respect for the dead, rather than opposition to scientific study.
