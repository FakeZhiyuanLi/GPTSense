There are a few ways a wrestler can get around changing their ring name entirely:1. Use a variation of their original name: Instead of completely changing their ring name, a wrestler could use a variation of their original name. For example, if their original ring name was "John Smith," they could change it to "Johnny Smith" or "Jonathan Smith" to keep some familiarity.2. Add a nickname: Another option is to keep their original ring name but add a nickname to it. For example, if their original ring name was "Sam Jones," they could add a nickname such as "The Samoan Bulldozer" to make it more unique.3. Use a different spelling: Sometimes changing the spelling of their original ring name can make it sound completely different. For example, if their original ring name was "Kaitlyn," they could change it to "Katelyn" or "Kaetlyn."4. Use a different persona: If a wrestler wants to completely change their ring name, they could also create a new persona that complements the new name. This could include a new look, entrance music, and finishing moves.
