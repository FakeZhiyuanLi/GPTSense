The Nazi Party in Germany, led by Adolf Hitler, was responsible for creating antisemitic and anti-masonic propaganda during the 1930s and 1940s. The propaganda aimed to portray Jews and Freemasons as a threat to the German people and their values, and was used to justify the persecution and genocide of Jewish people and others during the Holocaust.
