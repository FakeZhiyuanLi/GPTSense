The process for creating and distributing a new flu vaccine typically takes about 6-7 months. This includes selecting the strains of flu virus to include in the vaccine, growing the viruses in eggs or cell cultures, formulating the vaccine, testing it for safety and effectiveness, and manufacturing and distributing it. The flu vaccine is usually available for distribution in the fall, before the start of flu season.
