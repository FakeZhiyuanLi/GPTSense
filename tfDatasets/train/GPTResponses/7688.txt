The Egyptians used a technique called "rope-stretching" to build rectilinear structures. This involved laying out a grid of ropes on the ground to mark the corners of the building, and then using this grid to guide the construction of the walls and other features. The ropes were adjusted as needed to ensure that the walls were straight and square. The use of rope-stretching suggests that the Egyptians had developed an understanding of basic geometry and measurement.
