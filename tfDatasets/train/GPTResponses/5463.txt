The incorporation of independent kingdoms and sultanates can have various results depending on the context and circumstances. However, some possible outcomes are:1. Political centralization: If the independent kingdoms and sultanates are incorporated into a larger entity with a centralized authority, such as a kingdom or an empire, the result can be political centralization. This means that the power and decision-making authority are concentrated in the hands of a few individuals or institutions, which can lead to greater efficiency and stability, but also increased authoritarianism.2. Cultural assimilation: When independent kingdoms and sultanates are incorporated into a larger entity, their cultures and traditions can be assimilated into the dominant culture of the new entity. This can lead to a loss of diversity and cultural identity, but also to the creation of a new, hybrid culture.3. Economic integration: Incorporating independent kingdoms and sultanates can result in greater economic integration, as trade and commerce can be facilitated and regulated by a central authority. This can lead to greater economic growth and prosperity, but also to the exploitation of weaker regions and peoples by more powerful ones.4. Conflict and resistance: The incorporation of independent kingdoms and sultanates can also lead to conflict and resistance, particularly if the process is perceived as unjust or oppressive. Resistance can take many forms, such as armed rebellion, peaceful protests, or cultural and linguistic preservation efforts.
