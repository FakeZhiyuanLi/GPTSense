A good application for a long-life bulb would be in a streetlight or outdoor lighting fixture. These fixtures are often difficult and costly to access for maintenance, so using a long-life bulb would reduce the frequency of replacements and save time and money in the long run. Additionally, using a long-life bulb in outdoor lighting would be energy-saving and environmentally responsible since the fixture would be lit for extended periods.
