The concept of dividing history into the ancient, medieval and modern periods is generally credited to the Italian scholar Petrarch, who lived in the 14th century. Petrarch was a poet and humanist, and is known for his efforts to revive classical education and scholarship, which he felt had been lost in the medieval period. He wrote extensively about the importance of studying the works of ancient Greece and Rome, and saw the break between the medieval and ancient periods as a significant turning point in history. Over time, his ideas about periodization became widely adopted and are now commonly used to organize and teach history.
