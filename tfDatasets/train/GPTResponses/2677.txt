Henry VIII's wine cellar was located at the Palace of Whitehall in London, England. The palace was Henry VIII's primary residence and seat of government, and it was here that he kept his vast collection of wines. The wine cellar was located beneath the Banqueting House, which is the only surviving part of the palace today.
