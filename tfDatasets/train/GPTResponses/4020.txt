Repetition pitch is caused by the auditory illusion known as the "equally-spaced tone" illusion, also called the "missing fundamental" effect. This illusion occurs when a sequence of sounds with a constant interval or repetition rate is heard, resulting in the perception of a pitch that is lower than the individual tones that make up the sequence. The brain creates this pitch by filling in the missing fundamental frequency, which is the lowest frequency that would otherwise be present in the sequence, but is not actually played.
