A typical system in which a snubber capacitor is found is in power electronics circuits, such as AC/DC power converters, motor drives, and inverters. They are used to suppress voltage spikes, reduce EMI/RFI noises, and protect semiconductor devices from overvoltage and short-circuit currents. Snubber capacitors are also commonly found in high-frequency switch-mode power supplies, where they help to absorb energy and prevent ringing and oscillations in the circuit.
