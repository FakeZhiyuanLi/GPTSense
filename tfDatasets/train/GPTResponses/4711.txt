Heavily laden aircraft sometimes require the assistance from ground equipment such as a tow tractor or pushback tug to move them from their parking position to the runway or taxiway as they may be too heavy to move on their own. Additionally, during takeoff, they may also require the use of runway arresting gear or a catapult system to aid in the acceleration of the aircraft to takeoff speed.
