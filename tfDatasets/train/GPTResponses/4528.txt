Yes, there is evidence to support a drop in self-esteem during adolescence. Research has shown that self-esteem tends to reach a peak in childhood, around age 8 or 9, and then gradually declines until adolescence, where it drops off sharply. The reasons for this drop in self-esteem are complex and multifaceted and can be attributed to a variety of factors such as peer pressure, physical changes, academic challenges, bullying, and social media. However, it's important to note that not all adolescents experience a significant drop in self-esteem and that there are many factors that can contribute to a healthy sense of self-worth during this time.
