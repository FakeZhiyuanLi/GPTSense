It is difficult to make a definitive statement on whether the number of coats of arms in the late Middle Ages fell, as it varied from region to region and over time. However, there were some factors that contributed to a potential decline in the use of coats of arms during this period.One factor was the rise of centralized royal authority, which led to a standardized system of heraldry that limited the ability of individual nobles to invent their own coats of arms. Additionally, the Black Death and other epidemics during the 14th and 15th centuries drastically reduced the population, leading to a decline in the number of noble families with the means to bear coats of arms.Despite these factors, coats of arms continued to be used in the late Middle Ages and even proliferated in some regions. In areas of Italy and Germany, for example, the number of coats of arms increased as urbanization and trade led to the creation of new noble families. Overall, the use of coats of arms remained an important symbol of elite identity and status throughout the Middle Ages.
