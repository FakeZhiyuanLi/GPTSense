When capacitors are connected in parallel, they have the same voltage across them but the current divides among them based on their capacitance values. The capacitor with larger capacitance will draw more current than the capacitor with smaller capacitance.If the power supply connected to the parallel capacitors provides a constant voltage, the capacitors will charge up to that voltage and then the current flowing through them will decrease until it becomes zero. The voltage across the capacitors will remain constant as long as the power supply voltage remains constant.If the power supply voltage changes, the voltage across the capacitors will also change accordingly. Capacitors with smaller capacitance will respond more quickly to changes in voltage, while capacitors with larger capacitance will respond more slowly. Overall, the parallel capacitors will act as a single capacitor with a capacitance equal to the sum of their individual capacitances.
