The Soviet Union's transformer system was used primarily for transmitting and distributing electric power throughout the country. It was an essential component of the Soviet economy, powering industries, homes, and infrastructure. With a vast network of high-voltage power lines and substations, the Soviet Union was able to effectively supply electricity to every corner of the country. The transformer system also played a crucial role in the development of Soviet space technology, providing the power needed for rocket launch sites, communication satellites, and other space-related facilities.
