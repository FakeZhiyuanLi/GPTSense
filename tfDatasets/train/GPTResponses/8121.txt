- Costly: Nutritional studies often require extensive funding due to their length, complexity and large study populations.- Ethical challenges: Some studies involving human subjects raise difficult ethical concerns, such as administering a placebo or withholding a certain nutrient.- Difficulty in controlling variables: It can be challenging to control all variables during a study, given that people's diets and lifestyles are often unpredictable and multifaceted.- Limited generalizability: The results of a study may only apply to the specific population and conditions that were studied, making it difficult to apply the findings to other groups or situations.- Potential for bias: Researchers may have their own biases or preferences that influence how they design, interpret or report a study's results.
