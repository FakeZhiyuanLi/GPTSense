In the battery cage system, eggs are collected mechanically by an automatic conveyor system. The conveyor moves along the length of the tiers of cages, collecting the eggs from the laying hens as it goes. The eggs roll onto the conveyor belt and are then transported to a central location for grading and packing. This system is designed to minimize the need for human labor in egg collection, thereby reducing costs and increasing efficiency. However, critics argue that this mechanized approach can lead to higher stress levels and injuries among hens, as well as an increased risk of disease transmission.
