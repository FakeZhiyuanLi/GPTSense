Another benefit of nocturnal migration is that it allows migrating birds to avoid predators. Many predators hunt during the day, and by traveling at night, migrating birds can reduce their risk of being preyed upon. Additionally, in the early morning, when predators are just starting to roost or move around, birds can complete their migration before any risk of predation.
