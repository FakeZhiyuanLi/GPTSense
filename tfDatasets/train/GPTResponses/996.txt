AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which primarily suppresses the immune system's ability to fight off infections by targeting and destroying CD4+ T cells, which are a type of white blood cells that play a crucial role in the immune response. HIV infects CD4+ T cells and uses them to replicate, leading to a decline in the number of these cells over time. As a result, people with AIDS have a weakened immune system, making them vulnerable to opportunistic infections and cancers that would otherwise be easily fought off by a healthy immune system. In addition to CD4+ T cells, HIV can also infect and damage other cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells, which are involved in the immune response.
