Many European powers were concerned with Russia capturing Constantinople (present-day Istanbul) during the late 19th and early 20th century, including Great Britain, France, Germany, and Austria-Hungary. The potential Russian control of the city and access to the Black Sea could threaten these powers' economic and strategic interests in the region. The Ottoman Empire, which controlled Constantinople at the time, was also uneasy about the possibility of Russian expansion into their territory.
