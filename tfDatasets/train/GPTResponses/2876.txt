Sexual organisms have two copies of each chromosome, one from each parent, because they reproduce through a process called sexual reproduction. During sexual reproduction, two gametes (sperm and egg) fuse together, each contributing one copy of each chromosome to form a zygote. This zygote then divides and develops into a new organism with two sets of chromosomes, one inherited from each parent. This process ensures genetic diversity and allows for the expression of different traits, which can be beneficial for survival and adaptation to changing environments. Additionally, having two copies of each chromosome provides a backup in case one copy contains a harmful mutation or is damaged.
