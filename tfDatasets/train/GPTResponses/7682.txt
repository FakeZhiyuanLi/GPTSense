Several biomolecules and substances can be synthesized using carbohydrates and proteins such as:1. Enzymes: Enzymes are proteins that catalyze biochemical reactions. Carbohydrates and proteins combine to form enzymes that can help in different metabolic processes.2. Glycoproteins: These are proteins that have carbohydrates attached to them. They play important roles in cell-to-cell communication, hormone regulation, and immune system function.3. Lipoproteins: These are complexes of lipids and proteins that are involved in transport of lipids in blood.4. Proteoglycans: They are compounds containing a protein core and one or more long chains of carbohydrates that are responsible for providing support and cushioning to joints.5. Polysaccharides: These are complex carbohydrates that can serve as energy storage molecules or structural components in cells.6. Mucopolysaccharides: They are complex carbohydrates that are found in various tissues like cartilage, bone, and skin. They provide structure and support to these tissues.7. Chitin: It is a complex carbohydrate found in the exoskeletons of insects and crustaceans. It provides structural support and protection.8. Cellulose: It is a complex carbohydrate found in plants that provides structural support and serves as a source of dietary fiber.9. Glucagon and insulin: These hormones are made up of proteins and carbohydrates and are involved in regulating blood sugar levels in the body.Overall, carbohydrates and proteins can form a wide variety of complex biomolecules that are essential for life processes.
