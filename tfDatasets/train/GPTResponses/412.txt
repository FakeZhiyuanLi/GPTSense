One of the reasons experts believe contributed to the volatility in oil prices in 2008 was the global financial crisis and the resulting decrease in demand for oil. As countries entered recession, energy demand dropped, leading to excess supply and falling prices. However, geopolitical tensions, such as the conflict in the Middle East, also played a role in keeping prices volatile. Additionally, speculation and trading activities in the futures market, as well as the weakening of the U.S. dollar, further exacerbated price fluctuations.
