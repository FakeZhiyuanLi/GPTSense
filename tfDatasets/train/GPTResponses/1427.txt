Two opposing theories of early 20th century immunology are the cellular theory and the humoral theory.The cellular theory, developed by Ã‰lie Metchnikoff, proposed that immune responses were mediated by specialized cells, particularly phagocytes, which could recognize and destroy invading pathogens. This theory emphasized the importance of cellular interactions in the immune response.On the other hand, the humoral theory, developed by Paul Ehrlich, proposed that immune responses were mediated by soluble antibodies or "humors" that could specifically recognize and neutralize pathogens. This theory emphasized the importance of soluble factors in the immune response.These two theories were initially seen as mutually exclusive, but they were eventually reconciled in the modern understanding of the immune system, which recognizes the complementary roles of cells and soluble factors in immune defense.
