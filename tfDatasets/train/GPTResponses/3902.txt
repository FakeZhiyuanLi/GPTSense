Taste and smell stimuli are first detected by specialized sensory receptors located in the taste buds (for taste) and olfactory receptors (for smell) in the nose. These receptors send signals to the brain, which interprets them as specific tastes and smells. The signals from taste buds are sent to the brain via the gustatory nerve, while signals from the olfactory receptors are sent via the olfactory nerve. The brain integrates these signals to give us the perception of flavor.
