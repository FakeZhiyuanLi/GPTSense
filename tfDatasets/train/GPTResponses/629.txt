Social anthropology helps develop an understanding of human societies and cultures, their diversity, and their ways of life. It helps us to comprehend the social, cultural, economic, and political behavior of individuals and groups within different societies. By studying the cultural customs, beliefs, and values of a society, social anthropology helps us to understand how people within that society lead their lives, interact with one another, and engage with the wider world. It also helps us to understand how power structures, social hierarchies, and inequalities operate within societies, which can inform efforts at creating more equitable and just social systems. Additionally, social anthropology can provide insights into contemporary social issues such as migration, globalization, identity politics, climate change, and social justice movements.
