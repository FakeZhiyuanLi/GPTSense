During a pin attempt in wrestling, one wrestler tries to hold his opponent's shoulders on the mat for a specified period (typically two or three seconds) while the other wrestler tries to get his shoulders off the mat. If the wrestler's shoulders are down for the count, the referee will tap the mat three times and announce a pin, resulting in a victory for the wrestler who was on top. If the opponent successfully gets his shoulders off the mat before the count of three, the match continues.
