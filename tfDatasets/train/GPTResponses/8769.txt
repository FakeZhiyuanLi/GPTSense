There have been many labor leaders of the autoworkers, but one of the most well-known is Walter Reuther, who was the president of the United Automobile Workers (UAW) from 1946 until his death in 1970. He was instrumental in negotiating better wages and working conditions for autoworkers, and also played a key role in the civil rights movement.
