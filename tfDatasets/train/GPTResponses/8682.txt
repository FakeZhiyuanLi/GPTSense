Thomas Kuhn viewed the history of science as a series of paradigm shifts, or revolutions, in which old scientific frameworks and theories were replaced by new ones. According to Kuhn, science progresses not by steady and gradual accumulation of knowledge over time, but rather by periods of stability in which scientists work within a dominant paradigm, and occasional episodes of revolutionary upheaval and replacement of paradigms. These shifts occur as a result of anomalies or contradictions in the existing paradigm, which eventually accumulate enough that they can no longer be ignored or resolved within the current framework. Kuhn believed that scientific progress is driven by these moments of crisis, as they create the impetus for a new paradigm to emerge and for scientific knowledge to advance in a new direction.
