Zaire used to be known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) from the time it gained independence from Belgium in 1960 until 1971 when it was renamed Zaire under President Mobutu Sese Seko's regime. In 1997, it was renamed back to the Democratic Republic of the Congo after Mobutu was overthrown.
