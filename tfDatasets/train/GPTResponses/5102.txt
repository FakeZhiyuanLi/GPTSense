The light caused condition that is a serious problem for humans in Antarctica is known as "polar insomnia." It occurs due to the long summer days and constant daylight, which disrupts the body's natural circadian rhythm and makes it difficult to fall asleep. This can lead to sleep deprivation and other health problems. To combat this, people working in Antarctica often use blackout curtains and wear eye masks.
