Aerobic gymnastics is a form of gymnastics that involves high-energy routines performed to music. It typically involves a combination of strength, flexibility, and cardiovascular endurance exercises. Aerobic gymnastics routines are performed on a competition floor and can include elements such as choreographed jumps, flips, leaps, and spins, along with dance and acrobatic movements. The goal of aerobic gymnastics is to perform these elements with precision and style, while maintaining a high level of cardiovascular fitness throughout the routine. The routines are typically performed as either solo, duo, trio, or group performances, and are judged based on a combination of difficulty, execution, and artistic impression.
