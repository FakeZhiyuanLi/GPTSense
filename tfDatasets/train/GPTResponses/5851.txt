At the beginning of the war, the Americans used mainly muskets, rifles, cannons, and bayonets as their primary weapons. They also used cavalry, primarily horses, to transport troops and supplies. The American navy was very weak, so their early naval strategy mostly involved using privateers (armed private ships) to disrupt British trade and supply lines.
