Max Weber viewed rationalization as a process of increasing efficiency and control within society, but also as a potential threat to human autonomy and individuality. He argued that modern societies have become more rationalized due to the increasing dominance of bureaucratic structures and scientific knowledge, leading to a greater emphasis on bureaucratic rules and regulations, and a decrease in traditional customs and practices.Weber believed that rationalization has both positive and negative consequences, as it enables individuals to achieve their goals and ambitions more efficiently, but also results in the loss of individuality and creativity, and the domination of bureaucratic structures over the individual. He also argued that rationalization can result in the dehumanization of individuals, as they become mere cogs in the bureaucratic machine.Overall, Weber viewed rationalization as a complex and paradoxical process that has transformed modern societies, but also poses significant challenges to human freedom and autonomy.
