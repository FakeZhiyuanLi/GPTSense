It is not possible to determine the exact number of generations of European ancestors that Sandra Laing has without more information about her family history. However, it is known that she was born to white South African parents in 1955 but was classified as "coloured" (mixed-race) due to her appearance. This suggests that she likely has European ancestry dating back several generations, but may also have African ancestry from earlier generations.
