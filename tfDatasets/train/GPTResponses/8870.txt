During the Battle of Balaclava in the Crimean War, the base was defended by a combination of British, French, and Ottoman forces. The most famous action that took place during the battle was the Charge of the Light Brigade, in which British cavalry were ordered to charge Russian artillery positions. The charge was a costly failure, with many British soldiers killed or injured. Despite this, the base was ultimately successfully defended.
