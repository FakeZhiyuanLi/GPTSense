The theory of plate tectonics suggests that the Earth's lithosphere, or outermost layer, is made up of several major plates that move and interact with each other. While the exact timing of when these plates first began to break up is not known, it is believed to have occurred over a period of approximately 3 billion years. The process of plate tectonics is ongoing, with the movement and interaction of these plates still shaping our planet today.
