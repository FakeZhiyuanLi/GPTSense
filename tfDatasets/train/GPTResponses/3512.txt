is called a myelin sheath. The myelin sheath is an insulating layer that is formed by specialized cells called oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system. The myelin sheath functions to increase the speed and efficiency of nerve signal transmission, allowing for more rapid and coordinated responses to stimuli.
