When Napoleon suggested to his senior officers and marshals that they march on Paris, there was initially resistance and disbelief among them. However, some of his trusted commanders like Marshal Ney and General Bertrand, who were loyal to him, supported his plan.Other officers like Marshal Soult and Marshal Augereau were uncertain and hesitant to support Napoleon's plan, and they expressed their concerns about the potential consequences of marching on Paris. Some officers, like Marshal Davout, strongly advised against such a move, warning that it would lead to civil war.Despite the mixed reactions, Napoleon managed to convince some of his marshals to join him, and he headed towards Paris with his forces. However, he was ultimately unable to secure his position and was exiled to the island of Elba after his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo.
