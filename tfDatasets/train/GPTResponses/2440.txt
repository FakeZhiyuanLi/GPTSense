The steep vertical peaks of the Alpine orogenic belt are the result of tectonic forces that uplifted and folded the rocks of the region. The tectonic forces were caused by the collision of the African and Eurasian plates, which began around 60 million years ago. This collision caused the Earth's crust to buckle and fold, creating the high mountain ranges of the region. The process is ongoing and continues to shape the landscape of the Alps today.
