The late Cretaceous period (about 100-66 million years ago) was generally warm and humid, with high atmospheric carbon dioxide levels that contributed to a greenhouse effect and global temperatures that were significantly warmer than present day. During this time, tropical forests dominated and there were no polar ice caps. However, there were fluctuations in climate due to factors such as changes in ocean currents and volcanic activity.The Cenozoic era (from 66 million years ago to present day) saw a significant cooling trend overall, with the evolution of various ice ages and glacial periods. During the Eocene epoch (about 56-34 million years ago), temperatures were relatively warm but gradually cooled throughout the Oligocene (34-23 million years ago) and into the Miocene (23-5 million years ago). The Pliocene epoch (5-2.6 million years ago) saw a further cooling trend, culminating in the Quaternary period (2.6 million years ago to present day), which has seen repeated glaciations and interglacial periods. These colder temperatures are thought to have been caused by changes in ocean circulation and tectonic activity.
