The MLB All-Star winning team does not gain anything in the World Series as the All-Star Game is a separate exhibition game played in the middle of the season, while the World Series is the championship series played between the two best teams in the league at the end of the season. The winning team in the World Series receives the Commissioner's Trophy and is crowned the champions of the league for that season.
