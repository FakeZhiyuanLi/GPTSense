1. Electroencephalography (EEG) - measures electrical activity in the brain using electrodes placed on the scalp.2. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) - measures magnetic fields produced by electrical activity in the brain using sensors placed outside the scalp.3. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) - measures changes in blood flow in the brain to map patterns of neural activity using a magnetic field and radio waves.
