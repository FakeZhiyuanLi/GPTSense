There is no scandal that prompted Palmerston's removal in 1851, as he was not removed from office that year. In fact, he continued to serve as Foreign Secretary under Prime Minister Russell until 1852. However, Palmerston was eventually forced to resign in 1851 from his position as Home Secretary over a dispute with the French government regarding the extradition of an infamous criminal named Francois Benjamin Courvoisier. Palmerston had refused to extradite Courvoisier to France, causing tensions between the two countries. While this incident did not directly lead to his resignation as Foreign Secretary, it did damage his political reputation and contributed to his eventual downfall.
