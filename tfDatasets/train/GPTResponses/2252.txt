When a place observes Daylight Saving Time (DST), the clock is moved forward by one hour during the summer months. This change typically results in more daylight during the evening, while there is less sunlight in the morning. This is done in an effort to conserve energy and reduce the need for artificial lighting during the longer summer days. The time change can also affect agriculture, transportation schedules, and daily routines.
