The notable non-Muslim group that existed in the Umayyad Caliphate was the Jewish community. They had a significant presence in the region and were allowed to practice their religion and hold important positions in the government, including serving as advisors to the caliphs. However, they faced occasional persecution and discrimination, especially under some of the more intolerant caliphs.
