It is believed that tides and currents similar to our current system began to form about 3.5 billion years ago when the oceans first formed on Earth. However, the exact details of how the currents and tides evolved over time are still not fully understood. The movement of water is affected by a range of factors, including the rotation of the Earth, the gravitational pull of the moon and sun, and the shape and depth of the ocean floor. It is likely that these factors have interacted in complex ways to shape the pattern of tides and currents we observe today.
