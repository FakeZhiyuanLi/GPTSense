There are several reasons why a US president might prefer executive agreements over treaties:1. The approval process for executive agreements is simpler and quicker. Under the US Constitution, treaties require approval by two-thirds of the Senate, while executive agreements can be made by the president without explicit approval from Congress.2. Executive agreements are more flexible than treaties. Treaties are binding agreements that cannot be easily amended or changed, while executive agreements can be altered or terminated more easily by either party.3. Executive agreements can be used to bypass potential opposition in Congress. If a president believes that a treaty might face opposition from certain senators or interest groups, they may choose to use an executive agreement instead.4. Executive agreements can be used for more minor agreements. While treaties tend to be reserved for major international agreements, executive agreements can be used for smaller agreements that don't require the same level of scrutiny.Overall, the approval process for executive agreements is less time-consuming and more flexible than that for treaties, which can make them a more attractive option for a US president seeking to negotiate international agreements.
