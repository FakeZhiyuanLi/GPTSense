A late maturing boy may be less confident when comparing himself to others because he may not have reached physical milestones such as growth, muscle development, or facial hair, which are commonly associated with masculinity and may be valued by society. As a result, he may perceive himself as being less masculine or mature compared to his peers who have already undergone these changes, which can impact his confidence and self-esteem.
