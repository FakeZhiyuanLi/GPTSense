There are several things that exist today because of the refusal of early American lodges to admit African Americans. One of them is the creation of separate fraternal organizations for African Americans. For example, the Prince Hall Masonic Lodge was created in Boston in 1775 by African American men who were not allowed to join the white Masonic lodges of the time. Today, the Prince Hall Masonic Lodge is one of the largest and most active African American fraternal organizations in the United States.Another consequence is the ongoing issue of racial exclusion and segregation in American society. The early exclusion of African Americans from white-dominated fraternal organizations reinforced a system of racial segregation and discrimination that persisted for decades after the Civil War. This legacy continues to affect social and political relations in the United States today.Finally, the refusal of early American lodges to admit African Americans helped to shape the broader social and political dynamics of the country. It contributed to the formation of African American communities in the United States, as well as to the development of the civil rights movement and other efforts to combat racial discrimination and inequality.
