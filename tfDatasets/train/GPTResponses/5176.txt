Scientists, researchers and medical professionals who specialize in environmental health, occupational health, and military medicine are typically interested in the effects of harsh environments on humans. Additionally, emergency responders, adventurers, and travellers who routinely expose themselves to extreme weather conditions, high altitude, and extreme temperature variations may also be interested in learning more about the impact of harsh environments on human health and well-being.
