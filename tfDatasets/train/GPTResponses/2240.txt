Substandard materials are often used in construction when corruption is involved. This is because corrupt officials or contractors may prioritize their own financial gain over the quality and safety of the building. They may use low-quality materials that are cheaper, but not effective or safe, which can lead to the collapse of the building or other problems in the future. Additionally, they may cut corners on inspections, permits, and other necessary processes, further compromising the integrity of the construction project.
