The subgroup lattice, also known as Hasse diagram, is a type of map that shows the relation between subgroups and quotient groups of a parent group. In this diagram, the parent group appears at the top, and each subgroup is represented by a node below it. The nodes are connected by lines that indicate the subgroup relationship, with smaller subgroups placed lower than their larger counterparts. Quotient groups are also shown in the diagram, typically as group tables or other symbols that represent their structure. The subgroup lattice is a useful tool for visualizing the relationships between groups and identifying their properties, such as their normality or index.
