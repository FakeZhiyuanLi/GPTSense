In general, Greek temples built in the Hellenistic period were larger than those built in the Classical period. This was partly due to advances in engineering and construction techniques, as well as a desire to make a grander statement with architecture. Hellenistic temples often featured elaborate decoration and ornamentation, with more detail and intricate carvings than earlier temples. The size and complexity of these temples were also a reflection of the wealth and power of the Hellenistic kingdoms, which were larger and more populous than Greek city-states of the Classical period.
