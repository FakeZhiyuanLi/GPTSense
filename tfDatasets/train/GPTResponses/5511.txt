The main disease that caused a significant decline in the aboriginal population was smallpox. Other diseases such as influenza, measles, tuberculosis, and venereal diseases also contributed to the decline. The introduction of these diseases into the aboriginal population by European colonizers and their impact on the population has been well-documented in historical records.
