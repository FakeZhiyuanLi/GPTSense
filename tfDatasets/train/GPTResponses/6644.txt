Paul VI created 144 cardinals during his pontificate but it is impossible to determine exactly how many of those cardinals eventually became popes as it would depend on various factors such as age, health, and election processes. However, it is known that two cardinals created by Paul VI, Albino Luciani (Pope John Paul I) and Karol Wojty≈Ça (Pope John Paul II), went on to become popes.
