The krill, a small, shrimp-like crustacean, is a very important species in the Southern Ocean. They play a vital role in the food chain as they are a primary food source for many marine predators, including whales, seals, penguins, and other fish species. They are also important for their role in cycling nutrients and carbon through the oceanic ecosystem. Additionally, krill is one of the largest biomass species on Earth.
