Transpiration is the process by which water evaporates from the leaves and stems of plants and enters the atmosphere as water vapor. It is an important process in the water cycle and helps plants absorb nutrients and stay cool. Transpiration is affected by factors such as humidity, temperature, wind, and soil moisture.
