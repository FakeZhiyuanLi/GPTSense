CMBS stands for Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities. They are investment securities comprising a pool of commercial mortgage loans that have been securitized and sold to investors. These loans are typically made to investors who buy income-generating properties such as office buildings, shopping centers, hotels, and apartment buildings. The income from these properties is used to pay off the mortgage loans, which in turn are pooled, packaged, and sold as CMBS to investors. CMBS are considered a form of structured finance and are traded in the secondary market.
