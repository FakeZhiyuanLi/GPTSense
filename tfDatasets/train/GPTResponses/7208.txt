Yes, cubism did influence other fields outside of painting and sculpture.One example is in the field of graphic design where cubism's use of geometric shapes, fragmented forms, and multiple viewpoints influenced the design of posters, book covers, and other printed materials.Another example is in the field of architecture where cubism's emphasis on the structure and form of objects influenced modernist architects such as Le Corbusier in the design of buildings.Cubism also had an impact on literature, influencing writers such as James Joyce and Gertrude Stein in their use of multiple viewpoints and fragmented narratives in their work.Overall, the influence of cubism extended beyond painting and sculpture to affect a wide range of fields and disciplines.
