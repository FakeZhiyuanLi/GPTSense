A solar cell is an electronic device that can convert sunlight directly into electricity through the photovoltaic effect. It is also known as a photovoltaic cell or PV cell. The solar cell consists of a thin layer of semiconductor material, usually made of silicon, that is coated with a layer of metal and placed under a protective cover. When sunlight hits the cell, the energy in the light is absorbed by the semiconductor material, which causes electrons to be knocked free from their atoms. These free electrons can flow through a circuit and create an electrical current. The more sunlight that hits the solar cell, the more electricity it can generate. Solar cells are commonly used in solar panels to provide power for homes, businesses, and other applications.
