It is difficult to say exactly how much money Darwin earned from his book "On the Origin of Species" during his lifetime, as there are no exact records. However, it is known that the first print run of the book in 1859 sold out on the first day and subsequent editions continued to sell well. Darwin's publisher, John Murray, estimated that by 1876, Darwin had earned over £90,000 (equivalent to over £10 million today) from his books, which included "The Descent of Man" and "The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals," in addition to "On the Origin of Species."
