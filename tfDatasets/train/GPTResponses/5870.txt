Zurias are ankle-length dresses made out of cotton or other lightweight fabric. They are loose-fitting and typically have short sleeves. The dress is usually adorned with intricate embroidery or applique work on the neckline, sleeves and hemlines. The dress is accompanied by a shawl that is draped over the shoulders and can be used to cover the head. The shawl is also decorated with embroidery or lace work. Zurias are typically worn as traditional attire for special occasions, such as weddings and religious ceremonies.
