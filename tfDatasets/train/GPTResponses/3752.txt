The antioxidant strength of purple grapes is higher because they contain greater amounts of anthocyanins, which are natural pigments that give the grape skins their purple color. These anthocyanins act as powerful antioxidants, protecting the fruit from environmental stressors like UV radiation and harmful free radicals. Additionally, purple grapes contain higher amounts of resveratrol, which is another beneficial antioxidant compound. This combination of anthocyanins and resveratrol makes purple grapes a potent source of antioxidants, which have been linked to numerous health benefits, including reducing inflammation, improving heart health, and reducing the risk of chronic diseases.
