One important Old English historical record is the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. It is a collection of annals that cover the history of England beginning with the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons in the 5th century and continuing until the 12th century. The Chronicle provides valuable insights into the politics, religion, culture, and language of the time period. It also contains accounts of major events such as battles, invasions, and the reigns of different kings.
