The heyday of secular Arab nationalism can be traced back to the 1950s and 1960s, when several Arab countries gained independence from colonial powers and began to establish governments based on socialist and secular principles. During this time, leaders such as Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt, Hafez al-Assad of Syria, and Saddam Hussein of Iraq emerged as strong advocates of Arab unity and nationalism. However, the influence of secular Arab nationalism began to wane in the 1980s and 1990s, as many Arab countries shifted towards liberalization and economic reforms, while others were affected by religious fundamentalism and sectarian conflict.
