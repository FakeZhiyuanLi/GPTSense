The ideas of Cubo-Futurism influenced avant-garde architects by introducing a new approach to design, emphasizing geometric forms and the use of new materials such as steel and glass. This movement emphasized dynamic, linear forms, asymmetry, and a rejection of decorative ornamentation. The influence of Cubo-Futurism can be seen in the work of the Russian Constructivists, especially in the designs of Vladimir Tatlin, whose "Monument to the Third International" was a centerpiece of the movement. The ideas of Cubo-Futurism also influenced the Dutch De Stijl movement and the Bauhaus in Germany. Architects such as Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius drew on these ideas to develop a new, functionalist approach to architecture that embraced industrialization and technology. Overall, the ideas of Cubo-Futurism helped to shape the modernist movement in architecture, which continues to influence design to this day.
