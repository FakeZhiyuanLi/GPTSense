The system of social organization used in Japan is primarily based on a hierarchical structure known as the "Four-Tier System." This system emphasizes the importance of social status and is divided into four major social classes:1. Emperor: The highest and most revered social class in Japan is the imperial family, which is headed by the Emperor.2. Samurai: The samurai were a class of warriors who were highly respected for their courage and strength in battle.3. Farmers: This social group was responsible for cultivating and harvesting crops to feed the nation.4. Merchants: The merchant class was responsible for trading and commerce, and they were often considered the lowest tier of the social hierarchy.Although the four-tier system has been abolished in modern Japan, it still plays a significant role in shaping the social structure of the country today.
