MANPADS is an acronym for Man-Portable Air Defense Systems. These are portable shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles that are designed to be carried and operated by an individual soldier. They are typically used against low-flying aircraft such as helicopters or fixed-wing aircraft that are within visual range. MANPADS have been used by both military and non-state actors in conflicts around the world.
