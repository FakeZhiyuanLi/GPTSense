During slavery in Brazil, the prevalent culture was that of the slave owners, who were mostly Portuguese and came from Europe. They brought with them their language, religion, and customs, and imposed them on the slaves.Slavery in Brazil lasted for over three centuries, and during that time, the African slaves brought their own cultures and traditions with them. However, they were forbidden to practice their religions and traditions, which led to the formation of syncretic religions, such as Candombl√© and Umbanda. These religions combined African and Catholic beliefs and practices.Another prevalent aspect of Brazilian culture during slavery was the exploitation of the African slaves for their labor. They were forced to work on plantations and in mines, often in harsh conditions and for very little pay. This led to the development of a hierarchical society, where the slave owners and the whites were at the top, and the slaves and Afro-Brazilians were at the bottom.Finally, music and dance were also prevalent in Brazilian culture during slavery. The slaves brought with them their own musical traditions, such as batuque and samba, which evolved over time and became an important part of Brazilian culture. These music and dance forms were often used as a means of social and cultural expression by the slaves and their descendants.
