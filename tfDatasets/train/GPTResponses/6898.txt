A pretrial deposition is a legal proceeding before trial during which a witness or a party to a lawsuit provides sworn testimony under oath. The deposition typically takes place in an attorney's office or another neutral location, and a court reporter records a verbatim transcript of the testimony. The purpose of a pretrial deposition is to gather information, clarify facts, and determine the strengths and weaknesses of a case in advance of trial. The deposition can be used to impeach a witness's credibility or to corroborate evidence presented at trial. The testimony given during a pretrial deposition can be used as evidence in court if the witness is unable to testify during the trial or if the testimony is deemed relevant and admissible by the judge.
