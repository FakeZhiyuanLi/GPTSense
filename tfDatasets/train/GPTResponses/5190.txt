Jesus was not known as the "king of kings" because of his lineage, but rather because it was a title given to him in the New Testament as a symbol of his authority and power as the spiritual leader of his followers. The phrase "king of kings" has its roots in ancient Assyrian and Persian cultures, where it was used to describe the highest ruler or leader of a given region. In the New Testament, Jesus is described as the king of kings and lord of lords, suggesting that he is the ultimate ruler and leader in the spiritual realm.
