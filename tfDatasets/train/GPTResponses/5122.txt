During the Early Triassic, which occurred from about 251 to 247 million years ago, a number of reptile groups emerged and diversified. Some of the common reptiles of this time include:1. Procolophonoids: These were small, lizard-like reptiles that were common in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats.2. Temnospondyls: These were large, amphibious reptiles that resembled crocodiles or salamanders. They were the dominant group of predatory vertebrates during the Early Triassic.3. Archosaurs: These were a group of reptiles that included the ancestors of dinosaurs, crocodiles, and pterosaurs. They became more diverse and were a dominant group in later periods.4. Thalattosaurs: These were marine reptiles that resembled lizards and had paddle-like limbs for swimming.5. Placodonts: These were marine reptiles that had flattened, crushing teeth for eating shelled animals like clams.Overall, the reptile fauna of the Early Triassic was relatively diverse but not as abundant or varied as in later periods. The extinction event that ended the Permian period, from which the Early Triassic emerged, had decimated many groups of reptiles and other fauna, so the recovery and diversification of surviving groups took time.
