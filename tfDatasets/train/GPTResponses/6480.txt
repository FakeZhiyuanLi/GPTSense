Napoleon used artillery as the initial means of breaking down enemy defenses, rather than the traditional reliance on infantry. He believed that well-placed and well-coordinated artillery could quickly neutralize enemy fortifications and weaken their troops, making it easier for his own infantry to advance and engage in close combat. This tactic was particularly effective in smaller battles, where artillery could be positioned in a way that allowed it to target specific areas of the enemy's defenses.
