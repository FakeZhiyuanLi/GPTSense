Sexual orientation refers to a person's enduring pattern of emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attractions to men, women, both genders, or neither gender. It is an innate and often unchangeable aspect of a person's identity that is distinct from their gender identity or biological sex. Some common sexual orientations include heterosexuality, homosexuality, bisexuality, and asexuality. It is important to respect and accept individuals for their sexual orientation, as it is a fundamental component of their identity.
