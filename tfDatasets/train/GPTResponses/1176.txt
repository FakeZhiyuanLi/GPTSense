This is accomplished through the use of programming languages and algorithms, which enable the computer to follow a set of instructions and perform tasks automatically. This is often referred to as automation, and can be achieved through the use of scripts, macros, or specialized software tools designed for a specific purpose. Examples of repetitive tasks that can be automated include data entry, file backups, report generation, and system maintenance.
