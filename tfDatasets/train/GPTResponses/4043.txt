Yes, terrorism was considered a significant threat after the Cold War. The attacks on September 11, 2001, in the United States, demonstrated the devastating impact that terrorist attacks could have on civilians and economies. In response, countries around the world began to implement stricter security measures, increase intelligence gathering, and collaborate to combat terrorism. The rise of various extremist groups, such as Al-Qaeda, ISIS, and Boko Haram, further reinforced the importance of addressing terrorism as a significant security concern.
