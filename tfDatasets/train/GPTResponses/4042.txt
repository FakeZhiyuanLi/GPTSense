The first council of Nicaea (325 AD) did not rule that Easter be celebrated by all Christians, but it did establish the date for celebrating Easter in relation to the spring equinox. It determined that Easter should be celebrated on the Sunday following the first full moon after the spring equinox, and this calculation is still used today. However, it took several more centuries for the celebration of Easter to become standardized throughout the Christian world.
