It is not possible to calculate the exact percent growth of the Ashkenazi Jewish population from the 11th century until 1931 as there is no reliable data available for the entire time period. However, according to estimates, the population of Ashkenazi Jews increased from around 500,000 in the 11th century to approximately 11 million in 1931. This represents a growth of around 2,100%.
