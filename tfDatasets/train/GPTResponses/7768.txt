The Somers Isles Company's charter was revoked in 1684 because it believed that the company's management of Bermuda was inefficient and corrupt. King Charles II wanted to establish greater control over the colony, and felt that the company's existence as a private enterprise was interfering with his ability to do so. The Bermuda islands were made a royal colony, and the company's powers and privileges were terminated.
