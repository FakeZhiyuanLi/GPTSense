Power lines can affect the surrounding environment by producing electromagnetic fields that may disturb animal and plant behavior. Wind farms can affect birds and bats by causing collisions, causing displacement, and interfering with migration patterns. Oil rigs can impact marine life through oil spills, noise pollution, and habitat destruction. Additionally, they can also affect the environment through the emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollution from the drilling and extraction process.
