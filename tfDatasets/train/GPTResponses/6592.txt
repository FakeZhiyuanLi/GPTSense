In 2007, the Australian government introduced a mandatory phase-out of incandescent light bulbs, which were gradually banned from sale and importation in order to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The ban was fully implemented by 2010, and retailers were only allowed to sell more energy-efficient alternatives such as compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) and light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
