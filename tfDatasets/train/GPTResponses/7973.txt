The goal of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is to enforce federal laws that prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability or genetic information. The EEOC seeks to promote equal opportunity in employment by investigating and resolving discrimination complaints filed by individuals, initiating legal action against employers who violate anti-discrimination laws, and providing education and outreach to help employers understand their responsibilities under the law. The ultimate goal of the EEOC is to ensure that all individuals have an equal opportunity to succeed in the workforce regardless of their protected characteristics.
