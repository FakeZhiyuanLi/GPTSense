Dukkha is a central concept in Buddhism that refers to suffering, dissatisfaction, or unsatisfactoriness. Its origin is thought to be rooted in the first noble truth of Buddhism, which states that life is marked by suffering. The Buddha taught that all beings experience dukkha due to the impermanence and unsatisfactoriness of life, and that this suffering can be alleviated through the practice of the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path. The origin of dukkha is thus seen as an innate aspect of existence and a fundamental truth that must be recognized and understood in order to achieve liberation from suffering.
