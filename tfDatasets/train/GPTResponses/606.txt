Therapy dogs can help increase social interaction, communication, and memory retention in people suffering with Alzheimer's. They can also help reduce feelings of stress, anxiety, and depression, and improve overall mood and quality of life. Additionally, spending time with therapy dogs can stimulate physical activity, such as walking or playing with the dog, which can help improve mobility and balance.
