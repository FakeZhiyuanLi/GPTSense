1. Microsatellites: These are short tandem repeats of 1-6 nucleotides that are repeated in tandem within a given region of DNA. They are commonly used to identify individuals in forensic or paternity testing.2. Minisatellites: These are longer tandem repeats of 10-60 nucleotides that occur in non-coding regions of DNA. They are more variable than microsatellites and are used in genetic mapping and DNA fingerprinting. One example of a minisatellite is the variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) locus in the DNA of humans.
