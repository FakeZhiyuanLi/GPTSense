During the '50s to the '80s, the field's focus was primarily on explaining patterns of behavior, rather than just describing them. This period saw a shift towards more theoretical and experimental approaches to psychology, with an emphasis on understanding the underlying mechanisms and processes that govern human behavior. This emphasis on explanation was reflected in the development of new theoretical frameworks, such as cognitive psychology, which sought to explain how mental processes functioned, and social psychology, which sought to explain how social context influenced behavior. Overall, the focus during this period was on uncovering the underlying causes and mechanisms that drive human behavior, rather than simply describing it.
