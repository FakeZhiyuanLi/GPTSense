Carpatho-Ruthenia historically existed, primarily in the Carpathian Mountains region of eastern Europe. This includes parts of present-day Ukraine, Slovakia, Poland, and Romania. Lemkos, who are a Slavic ethnic group, largely live in the mountainous areas of southeastern Poland, northeastern Slovakia, and western Ukraine. Therefore, it can be said that the idea of a "Carpatho-Ruthenian" nation is primarily supported by Lemkos residing in these areas. However, it is important to note that there are various factors that impact people's support for the idea of a distinct Carpatho-Ruthenian nation, and individual viewpoints can vary.
