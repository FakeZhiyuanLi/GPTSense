Samsara is caused by karma, which is the consequence of one's actions and thoughts. It is believed that every action, thought, and intention has an effect that determines one's future experiences in this life and in future lives. Therefore, samsara is seen as a cycle of birth, death, and rebirth, where one's actions in previous lives dictate their current and future existence. The goal of many Eastern religions and philosophies is to break this cycle and achieve liberation from samsara through spiritual enlightenment.
