The theory of evolution explains how living organisms have evolved and adapted over time to the changing environment. It suggests that all living organisms share a common ancestry and that they have evolved through natural selection, genetic drift, and mutation. This theory also explains how different species have diverged and developed unique features and characteristics. It has helped us understand the diversity of life, and how it has been shaped by various environmental and genetic factors over millions of years.
