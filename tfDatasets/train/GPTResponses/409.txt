The most important import in 18th century Plymouth was probably textiles, including wool and cotton. These were used to manufacture clothing and other goods for the growing population of the city and the wider region. Other important imports included sugar, tobacco, and spices from the colonies, as well as luxury goods such as tea and porcelain from Asia.
