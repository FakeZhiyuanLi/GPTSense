Josef Jungmann was a prominent Czech linguist and literary historian who advocated for the revival and popularization of the Czech language during the 19th century. He believed that the Czech language and its literature had significantly contributed to the cultural heritage of the Czech people and should, therefore, be given its rightful place in the country's intellectual and social life. Jungmann advocated for the use of the Czech language in literature, education, and the media, as well as for the development of a standard Czech language based on the language spoken by the people. He played a crucial role in establishing the Czech language as a literary language and the development of the Czech national identity.
