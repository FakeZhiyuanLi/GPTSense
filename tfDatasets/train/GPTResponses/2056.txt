The limitation in human hearing is referred to as the audible frequency range. Humans can typically hear sounds in the range of 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. Sounds outside of this range, such as ultrasonic or infrasonic frequencies, are not audible to humans without the use of specialized equipment. Additionally, some individuals may have hearing impairments that limit their ability to hear sounds within the audible frequency range.
