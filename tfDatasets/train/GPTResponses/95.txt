Islamism seeks to integrate itself into many aspects of life, including politics, economics, education, culture, and social norms. Islamists believe that Islam is a comprehensive way of life that should guide all aspects of society. They seek to implement Islamic law (Sharia) in all areas of life, including governance, economics, and social relations. Islamists also seek to promote Islamic education and cultural values, such as modesty, piety, and family values, in society. Additionally, they seek to address social issues, such as poverty and inequality, through Islamic principles and teachings.
