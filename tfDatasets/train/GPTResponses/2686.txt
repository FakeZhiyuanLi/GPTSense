One example of imposing sanctions on Lithuanians was during the Soviet Union's occupation of Lithuania in 1988-1991. The Soviet government imposed economic sanctions on Lithuania in an attempt to force them to abandon their independence movement. These measures included a ban on imports and exports, cutting off fuel and energy supplies, and stopping all financial transactions with Lithuania. These sanctions caused significant economic hardship for the Lithuanian people. However, Lithuania eventually gained its independence in 1991.
