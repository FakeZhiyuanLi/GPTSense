The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) hoped to provide more accurate and consistent data on race and ethnicity by revising its standards in 1997. The new standards aimed to improve classification and reporting of the rapidly changing ethnic and racial diversity in the United States. The revision provided clearer definitions of race and ethnicity categories, allowed individuals to self-identify their race and ethnicity, and added new categories to better reflect the multicultural society. The purpose of these changes was to better track and measure disparities in education, housing, health, and other social and economic factors affecting diverse communities.
