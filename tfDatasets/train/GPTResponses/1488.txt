Quantum computers use a specific algorithm called Shor's algorithm to solve encryption algorithms quickly. This algorithm exploits the properties of quantum bits or qubits, such as superposition and entanglement, to efficiently factor large numbers, which is the basis of many encryption algorithms such as RSA. By factoring the large numbers, quantum computers can quickly break the encryption and retrieve the encrypted information. This poses a significant threat to the security of conventional cryptographic systems, which rely on the difficulty of factorization to protect sensitive information.
