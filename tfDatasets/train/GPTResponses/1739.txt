Using the sun for direction involves determining the orientation of the sun in relation to the cardinal directions (north, south, east, and west) in order to navigate. By observing where the sun rises and sets, and using the shadow cast by an object as a reference point, one can determine the general direction they are facing or traveling. This technique is commonly used in outdoor activities such as hiking, camping, and backpacking.
