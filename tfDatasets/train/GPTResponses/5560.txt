The complex system based on the sun, moon, and planets movements that determine one's personality is called astrology. It is a belief that the positions of celestial bodies at the time of a person's birth can influence their personality traits, behavior, and future events in their lives. Astrology is not a scientifically proven concept and is often considered a pseudoscience.
