happens after the immune system recognizes an antigen.The topics covered in part 2 include:1. Immune responses to infection: This section covers the innate and adaptive immune responses to infections, including the role of antibodies, T cells and B cells in fighting infections.2. Immunological memory: This section covers how the immune system "remembers" previous infections, allowing it to respond more quickly and effectively to subsequent exposure to the same pathogen.3. Autoimmune diseases: This section covers the mechanisms underlying autoimmune diseases, in which the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells and tissues.4. Immunodeficiencies: This section covers the different types of immunodeficiencies, including primary and secondary immunodeficiencies, and their causes and effects on the immune system.5. Vaccines: This section covers the basics of vaccine development and how vaccines work to prevent and control infectious diseases.Overall, Part 2 of the AAi Introductory Immunology course provides a deeper understanding of the immune response and its role in protecting the body from infectious agents and diseases.
