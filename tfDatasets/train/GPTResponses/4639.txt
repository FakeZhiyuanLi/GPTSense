Black Sabbath is often credited with introducing darker themes to heavy metal music. Their self-titled debut album released in 1970 featured heavy riffs, lyrics about death and the occult, and a gloomy atmosphere that became a defining characteristic of the genre. Black Sabbath's influence on heavy metal can still be heard today.
