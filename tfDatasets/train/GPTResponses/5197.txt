Nontrinitarian beliefs vary, but in most cases Mary is considered to be the mother of Jesus as a human being, rather than the mother of God or the second person of the Trinity. Some nontrinitarian groups, such as Jehovah's Witnesses, believe that Jesus was created by God as a separate being, and that Mary was a human vessel through which he was born. Other nontrinitarians may see Jesus as a special human being or prophet, rather than God incarnate, and view Mary as his biological mother in the same way as any other human mother.
