The most substantial part of a bird's anatomy as it relates to the consumption of its meat is the breast meat. It is a lean, high-protein meat with a mild flavor and a relatively low amount of connective tissue, making it tender and easy to eat. The breast meat of birds such as chicken, turkey, and duck is particularly popular among meat consumers.
