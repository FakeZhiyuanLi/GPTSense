There were a number of prominent individuals who advocated for the use of the term "African American" to describe Black Americans. One of the most well-known is Jesse Jackson, a civil rights activist and former presidential candidate, who has long argued that the term more accurately reflects the cultural and historical identity of Black Americans. Other notable figures who have supported the use of "African American" include Maya Angelou, Toni Morrison, and Barack Obama.
