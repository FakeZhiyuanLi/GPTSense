Zygotes derive their genetic information from the sperm and egg cells that combine during fertilization. The sperm carries a haploid set of chromosomes (23 chromosomes) and the egg carries another haploid set of chromosomes. When the sperm and egg combine, they form a diploid zygote with a complete set of chromosomes (46 chromosomes). This genetic information from both parents determines the traits and characteristics of the individual that develops from the zygote.
