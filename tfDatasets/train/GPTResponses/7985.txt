The earliest known map in China is the "Ganshi Map," which is believed to have originated during the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD). This map is a type of topographical map that shows important geographical features, such as mountains, rivers, and cities. There are also later examples of Chinese maps, such as the Shanhai Yudi Quantu (满洲一抔土) or Map of the Mountains and Seas, which is a world map from the 18th century AD that shows a combination of geographic and mythological features.
