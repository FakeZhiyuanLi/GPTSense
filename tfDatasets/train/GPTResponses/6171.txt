The most intensive type of enclosure system used in the poultry business is called the battery cage system. This system involves confining birds to small wire cages stacked on top of one another. The cages are designed to maximize space and allow for efficient feeding and egg collection, but they can be restrictive and stressful for the birds. Many animal welfare organizations have advocated against the use of battery cages due to the cramped living conditions and lack of natural behaviors allowed. Other enclosure systems, such as free range and aviary systems, provide more space and opportunities for birds to engage in natural behaviors, but they may be less efficient and more costly for producers.
