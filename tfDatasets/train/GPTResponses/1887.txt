One noble thing the poor szlachta did was participate in the defense of their country during times of war. Despite their lack of wealth and social standing, they still fought and even died for their nation's independence and sovereignty. Additionally, some szlachta who fell on hard times would work as laborers or farmers, showing a willingness to do physical work and contribute to society in any way possible.
