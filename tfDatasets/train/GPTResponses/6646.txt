After a bill is signed by the President, it becomes a law and is assigned a public law number. It is then sent to the Office of the Federal Register to be officially published and added to the United States Code, which is the official compilation of federal laws. The newly passed law is also distributed to various government agencies and departments to implement and enforce the provisions of the law.
