It is likely better to use the heartwood of a small tree for hard and strong wood. The heartwood is usually darker in color and denser than the sapwood, which makes it stronger and more durable. Additionally, the heartwood has been known to be more resistant to decay and insect infestation. However, the sapwood may still have some usable qualities, such as flexibility, and can be used in certain applications.
