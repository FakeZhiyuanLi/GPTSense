The basic social unit of Somali society is the clan or extended family. Clans are large, extended family groups made up of individuals who share the same ancestry, traditions, and culture. Within each clan, there are smaller sub-clans and lineages that are connected by a common ancestor. Clans play a central role in Somali society, providing social support, protection, and a sense of identity for their members. They also influence political, economic, and cultural life in Somalia.
