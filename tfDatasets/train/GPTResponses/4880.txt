Erikson's work on identity formation throughout a lifetime is rooted in the tradition of developmental psychology. He developed his theory of identity development based on his observations of children and adolescents, and later expanded it to include adults. His approach emphasizes the importance of social and cultural factors in shaping identity, and presents a series of psychosocial crises that individuals must navigate in order to achieve a stable sense of identity. This approach has had a significant impact on the field of psychology, and remains influential today.
