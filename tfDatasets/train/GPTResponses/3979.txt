The cephalic phase is the first phase of digestion, which begins when you start thinking about food, smelling it, or tasting it. It is a neurologically mediated response that prepares the body for digestion by stimulating the brain, which signals the stomach to begin secreting digestive enzymes and hydrochloric acid. The cephalic phase is responsible for approximately 30% of the total digestive response, and it is primarily triggered by the parasympathetic nervous system. This phase is essential for efficient digestion and nutrient absorption, and it plays a vital role in appetite control and overall digestion.
