Henri Poincaré introduced the concept of homology theory, which is a fundamental tool in algebraic topology. Homology is used to study the properties of topological spaces by associating algebraic objects, called homology groups, to spaces. Poincaré also introduced the concept of the fundamental group, which is a group determined by loops in a space, and he developed the theory of simplicial complexes. All of these concepts are essential in the modern field of algebraic topology.
