Mammals appeared in the Late Triassic period, approximately 220 million years ago. They remained relatively small until the Cenozoic Era, which began approximately 66 million years ago and is known as the "Age of Mammals". During this period, mammals underwent rapid diversification and evolution, leading to the development of larger and more complex species.
