An Islamic revival movement refers to a movement that seeks to revive the Islamic faith and practices as an authentic and legitimate solution to modern challenges facing Muslims. Such movements take different forms, ranging from peaceful to violent, and are often sparked by perceived injustices or failures in existing social, economic, or political systems. Islamic revival movements can be traced back to various historical periods, and examples include the Wahhabi movement in Saudi Arabia, the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, and the Taliban in Afghanistan. The goals of these movements can vary, but commonly include promoting Islamic identity, morality, and values, building unity among Muslims, and seeking to establish Islamic governance based on Sharia law.
