During his time in Egypt, Napoleon displayed tolerance towards Islam and its practices. He made several gestures to respect the religion and culture of the Egyptian people, such as visiting mosques and removing his shoes before entering. He also issued a proclamation declaring that the French army was not there to interfere with the religious customs of the people. Furthermore, he established the Institut d'Egypte (Institute of Egypt), which aimed to study and preserve the country's history and culture, including Islamic texts and artifacts. All these actions indicate Napoleon's willingness to learn and accommodate the religious beliefs and practices of the Egyptians.
