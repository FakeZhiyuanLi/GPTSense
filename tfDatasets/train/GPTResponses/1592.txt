Approximately 50% of Europe's territory is inhabited by Slavic-speaking communities. These communities are spread out across Eastern Europe and parts of Central Europe, including countries such as Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Bulgaria, and others. However, it is important to note that the percentage of the population that speaks Slavic languages varies greatly from country to country.
