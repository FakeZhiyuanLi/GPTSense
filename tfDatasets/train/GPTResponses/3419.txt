During medieval periods, religious orders established:1. Monasteries and Convents: These were communal living spaces for monks and nuns, respectively. They were self-sufficient communities that provided for the basic needs of their inhabitants, such as food, clothing, and shelter. Monasteries and convents also served as centers of learning, where religious doctrine, as well as secular subjects like science and philosophy were taught.2. Hospitals: Many religious orders, such as the Knights Hospitaller and the Order of St. John, established hospitals throughout Europe to provide medical care to the sick and injured. These hospitals were staffed by members of the order who were trained in medicine.3. Universities: Religious orders established many of the first universities in Europe, such as the University of Bologna, the University of Paris, and the University of Oxford. These institutions of higher education focused on theology and philosophy but also taught subjects like law, medicine, and the liberal arts.4. Missionary work: Many religious orders, such as the Franciscans and the Dominicans, sent their members on missionary trips to spread Christianity to non-Christian lands. This helped to expand Christianity's influence throughout the world.5. Religious art and architecture: Religious orders were responsible for commissioning some of the most beautiful and lasting works of art and architecture of the medieval period. They commissioned artists to produce illuminated manuscripts, stained glass windows, and sculptures for use in churches and monasteries. They also built some of the most iconic structures of the period, including the Chartres Cathedral and the Basilica of San Francesco in Assisi.
