The research supporting insect mimicry using natural selection has been authored by numerous scientists and researchers over the years. Some notable figures include Alfred Russel Wallace, Henry Walter Bates, and E.B. Poulton, who were among the first to document and explain the phenomenon of mimicry in insects in the late 1800s and early 1900s. More recent researchers in this area include Paul W. Sherman, Mark E. Hauber, and James R.A. Butler, among others.
