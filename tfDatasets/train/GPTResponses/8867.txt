Social Darwinism is a political commentary that attempted to widen the idea of natural selection to include competition between different races of people and countries. It was a belief system that emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, fueled by the theories of Charles Darwin and Herbert Spencer. Social Darwinists believed that competition between individuals, groups, and nations was necessary for progress and survival, and that some races and nations were inherently superior to others. This ideology was used to justify imperialism, colonialism, and eugenics programs, and it had a lasting impact on political and social thought.
