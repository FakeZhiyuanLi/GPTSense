Pesticides contribute to water pollution, soil pollution, and air pollution. The chemicals in pesticides can wash into rivers, lakes, and oceans through surface runoff and groundwater, which can harm aquatic life and impact drinking water. Pesticides can also leach into the soil and affect soil organisms, animals that live in soil, and plants. In addition, some pesticides release toxic gases into the air, which can impact human health and wildlife.
