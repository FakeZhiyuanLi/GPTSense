Gender identity has become widely accepted as an individual's deeply held sense of their own gender, which may or may not correspond with the sex assigned to them at birth. It is now viewed as a fundamental aspect of human diversity, and one that should be respected, acknowledged and supported by society. This has been seen as a significant shift from earlier times when gender was viewed as solely binary, with only two options - male or female - and any deviations from these norms were seen as abnormal or deviant.
