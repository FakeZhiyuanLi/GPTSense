This can happen in any sport or competition where there are titles or belts to be won.2) Being stripped of the title: A champion may lose their title if they fail to defend it within a certain timeframe or if they violate the rules of the sport.

This can also happen if a champion is forced to retire due to injury or health concerns.4) Injury or illness: A champion may lose their title if they suffer a serious injury or illness that prevents them from competing at their best. In some cases, they may be forced to forfeit their title if they are unable to compete.5) Referee's decision: A champion may lose their title if the referee decides to disqualify them for breaking the rules or for unsportsmanlike conduct.
