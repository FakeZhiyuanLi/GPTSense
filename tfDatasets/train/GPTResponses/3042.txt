Uppercase letters are preferred in situations with restricted space for several reasons:1. They are larger and more easily legible than lowercase letters, especially in small font sizes.2. They create a more uniform shape, making it easier to distinguish individual letters from each other.3. They require less vertical space than mixed-case or lowercase letters, allowing for more information to be displayed in a limited area.4. They are often used in abbreviations or acronyms where the uppercase letters form an easily recognizable and memorable sequence.Overall, uppercase letters are a practical solution when space is restricted because they maximize legibility and efficiency.
