Several factors can cause DNA to be less available for RNA polymerase to transcribe into RNA. These include:1. DNA packaging: DNA is tightly packaged in the form of chromatin in eukaryotic cells, which can limit the access of RNA polymerase to the DNA.2. DNA methylation: Methylation of DNA can inhibit transcription by RNA polymerase by blocking its binding sites.3. Repression factors: Repression factors are proteins that bind to DNA and prevent RNA polymerase from binding and transcribing the DNA into RNA.4. Chromosomal location: DNA sequences that are located near the centromere or telomere are generally less accessible for RNA polymerase because of the compact chromatin structure in these regions.5. Histone modification: Histones are protein molecules that help to package DNA in the nucleus. Modification of histones can affect their interaction with DNA, which can impact RNA polymerase access to the DNA.6. DNA damage: DNA damage can inhibit transcription by RNA polymerase by disrupting its binding sites and leading to the activation of DNA repair pathways.
