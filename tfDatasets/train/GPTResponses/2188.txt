Patents can become patent-free for several reasons.One reason is that the patent has expired. Patents in most countries have a set term, usually around 20 years, after which they expire and the invention becomes part of the public domain, meaning that anyone can manufacture, use, or sell it without the need for a license from the patent holder.Another reason is that the patent holder has chosen not to renew or maintain the patent. In order to keep a patent in force, the patent holder must typically pay periodic fees to the relevant patent office. If these fees are not paid, the patent may become abandoned and the invention may become part of the public domain.Additionally, a patent can be invalidated by a court or other authority if it is found to be invalid, not novel, obvious, or not meeting the other requirements for patentability. In some cases, the patent holder may voluntarily surrender the patent or license it to others, effectively making it patent-free.
