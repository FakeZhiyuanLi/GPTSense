The assembly language that is translated into machine language can be done by any computer that has a processor capable of executing machine instructions. Assemblers, which are software programs that translate assembly language code into machine language, are often specific to a particular CPU architecture or family of processors. Therefore, the computer must have an assembler that is compatible with its processor to translate assembly language code into machine language.
