The Gregorian calendar set the same date of the full moon not preceding Easter by implementing a more accurate method of calculating the length of a year. Specifically, the Gregorian calendar takes into account the fact that a year is not exactly 365 days long. Instead, it is approximately 365.2422 days long. To account for this, the Gregorian calendar includes leap years (i.e., years with an extra day) every four years, except for years that are divisible by 100 but not by 400. This more accurate method of calculating the length of a year helped ensure that the date of the full moon not preceding Easter remained consistent.
