The two democratic values that are soiled due to corruption are:1. Justice: Corruption undermines the principle of justice by creating an environment where people can buy their way out of trouble or manipulate the system to get favorable outcomes.2. Equality: Corruption creates unequal access to resources and opportunities, and it undermines the idea that all individuals should have an equal chance to succeed based on merit and hard work.
