The high public interest in the private lives of the royal family caused a surge in sensationalist media coverage and tabloid journalism. The press often reported on scandals, rumors, and controversy surrounding the monarchy, often with little regard for accuracy or the impact on the individuals involved. This led to exploitation and invasion of privacy, with paparazzi frequently hounding members of the royal family and their associates. It also fueled a lucrative industry of royal-themed merchandise and gossip magazines.
