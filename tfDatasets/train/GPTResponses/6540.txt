Modern courts often cite the period of the Enlightenment as a reference point when discussing changes in law. This period, which took place in the 18th century in Europe, was marked by a focus on reason and individualism, and its principles influenced the development of modern legal systems. The ideas of the Enlightenment, such as the separation of powers, the protection of individual rights, and the rule of law, continue to shape legal discourse and decision-making in many countries today.
