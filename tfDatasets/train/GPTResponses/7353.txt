In 500 BC, Greece was not ruled by a single entity or individual. It was divided into several city-states, each with their own government and rulers. Examples of these city-states include Athens, Sparta, Corinth, and Thebes. These city-states often competed and fought against each other, but they also shared a common language, religion, and culture.
