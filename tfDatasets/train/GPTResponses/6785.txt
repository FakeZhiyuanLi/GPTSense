Lucha libre wrestlers typically wear masks and colorful, tight-fitting outfits known as "luchador costumes". These costumes include tight spandex pants, elaborate capes, and often have designs inspired by Mexican folklore or comic books. They may also wear wrestling boots or shoes with strong support for ankle and foot protection.
