One of the ten meritorious deeds of Buddhism is giving, which involves acts of generosity and charity towards others. This can include giving food, money, clothing, or any other resources that can benefit those in need. Giving is viewed as a way to cultivate compassion and generosity, and to accumulate positive karma that can lead to a happier and more peaceful life.
