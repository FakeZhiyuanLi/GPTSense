The first model for communication is known as the Shannon-Weaver model, which was developed in 1949 by Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver. This model consists of a sender who encodes a message, which is then transmitted through a channel to a receiver who decodes the message. The model includes noise, which can affect the accuracy of the message transmission. The model also includes a feedback loop, which allows the receiver to provide feedback to the sender for clarification or further communication. The Shannon-Weaver model is a linear model of communication, which means that it assumes communication to be a one-way process from sender to receiver.
