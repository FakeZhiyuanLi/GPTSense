The inviolability of nobles' property was established by the feudal system in medieval Europe. Under the feudal system, nobles were granted land by the king in exchange for their loyalty and military service. The land that was granted to the nobles was considered their own property, which was protected by law and tradition from interference by others, including the king. This concept of property rights became a fundamental aspect of the nobles' position in society and was later adopted as a principle of modern property law.
