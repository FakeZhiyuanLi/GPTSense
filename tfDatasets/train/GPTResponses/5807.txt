is known as the Nicene Creed, which was adopted at the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD. The Athanasian Creed was likely composed in the fifth century, and is named after St. Athanasius, who strongly advocated for the Nicene Creed during the Arian controversy. The Athanasian Creed emphasizes the doctrine of the Trinity and the divinity of Jesus Christ, and affirms the belief in the unity of God. It is considered one of the three major creeds of Christianity along with the Apostles' Creed and the Nicene Creed.
