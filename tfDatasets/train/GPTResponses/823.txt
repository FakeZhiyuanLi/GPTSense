Mahayana followers use the term "Hinayana" to name the early schools of Buddhism. However, this term is considered derogatory and is not preferred by many scholars and practitioners of the early schools. Instead, they use terms like Theravada, Sravakayana, or Nikaya Buddhism to refer to the early schools.
