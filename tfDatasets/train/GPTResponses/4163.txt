The British Calendar (New Style) Act of 1750 introduced the use of the Gregorian calendar in Great Britain, replacing the Julian calendar. This law was enacted to bring the English calendar in line with the rest of Europe, where the Gregorian calendar had been adopted in 1582. The law also made adjustments to the date of the start of the new year, moving it from March 25 to January 1.
