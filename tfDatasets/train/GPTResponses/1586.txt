The Arab slave trade was predominantly carried out in the Middle East, North Africa, and parts of Asia from the 7th to the 19th century. Some of the major centers of the Arab slave trade were present-day Oman, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Lebanon, and Egypt. The trade also extended to East Africa, where Arab traders would capture and sell Africans to be used as slaves.
