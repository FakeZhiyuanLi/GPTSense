Star compass: Birds use the position of the stars to navigate during the night.3. Magnetic compass: Birds have magnetic particles in their eyes, which allow them to sense the Earth's magnetic field and use it to navigate.4. Visual landmarks: Birds use visual landmarks such as mountains, rivers, and coastlines to navigate.5. Smell: Some birds have been shown to use their sense of smell to navigate, especially when the weather is cloudy or foggy.6.
