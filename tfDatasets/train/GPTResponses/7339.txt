It is believed that the earliest clothing was likely tied or fastened onto the body with simple cords or belts made from animal materials such as hides or sinews. Some early garments may have been draped or wrapped around the body, while others could have been tailored or stitched together. The exact methods of securing clothing onto the body during prehistoric times are unclear, as no physical evidence remains from that time period. However, anthropologists and archaeologists have studied the earliest known clothing items, such as the 5,000-year-old Ã–tzi the Iceman's leather clothes, to gain insights into how they may have been worn and fastened.
