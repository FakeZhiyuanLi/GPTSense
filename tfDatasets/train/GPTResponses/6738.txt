Rose windows are not typically found on English cathedrals. While they are often associated with French Gothic architecture, they were not a significant feature of English Gothic design. English cathedrals instead tended to focus on intricate stone carvings and arches. However, some churches in England that were built after the Gothic period, such as the church of St. George in Sunderland, do have rose windows.
