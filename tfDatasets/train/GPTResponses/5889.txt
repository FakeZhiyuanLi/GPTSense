SAMs (Surface-to-Air Missiles) that are launched by individuals in the US are mostly illegal, and there is no specific term for them. However, they may be referred to as black market or smuggled SAMs. It is important to note that launching a SAM without proper authorization is a serious criminal offense and can have severe consequences.
