The first 256 code points in Unicode were made identical to ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1) because it was widely used and established as the de facto standard for character encoding in Western European languages. This simplifies the conversion of legacy systems that were using ISO-8859-1 to Unicode, as the first 256 characters can be directly mapped to their equivalent Unicode code points. Additionally, many software applications and operating systems were already using ISO-8859-1 as the default encoding, so the compatibility with this standard ensured widespread adoption of Unicode.
