The royal assent is typically used by a monarch to approve a bill that has been passed by both houses of parliament and is ready to become law. The monarch may also use the royal assent to approve other official documents or to signify agreement to a declaration or agreement. In modern times, the royal assent is seen as largely ceremonial, and the monarch essentially acts as a symbolic representative of the government and the people.
