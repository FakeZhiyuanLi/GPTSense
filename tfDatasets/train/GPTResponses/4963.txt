There are several causes of mass extinctions, including:1. Large-scale volcanic activity: Arriving in the form of massive volcanic eruptions, sometimes referred to as "volcanic winters," these eruptions can cause a radical shift in the Earth's climate.2. Changes in sea levels: Changing sea levels can be caused by various factors such as global warming, climate change or severe ocean currents. These changes in the ecosystems can have a major impact and lead to the death of many species.3. Asteroid or comet impact: A mass extinction can be caused by a massive asteroid or comet impact that disrupts the global climate, causing widespread devastation.4. Climate change: Sudden and significant changes in Earth's climate can force species to migrate, utterly transforming entire ecosystems.5. Catastrophic events: Earthquakes, tsunamis, and other catastrophic events can cause mass extinction events by destroying habitats and wiping out populations of species.6. Human activity: Human activity can lead to mass extinctions through deforestation, pollution, and the introduction of invasive species.7. Disease: The spread of disease can cause a mass extinction event in a particular species based on their susceptibility.
