The Prussian army was composed of Landwehr and Landsturm instead of regulars. The Landwehr was an army reserve force consisting of men between the ages of 17 and 45 who could be called up for service in times of war. The Landsturm was an even more basic reserve force, made up of men between the ages of 17 and 60 who were not already serving in the Landwehr. These forces were often less well-equipped and trained than regular troops, but were still an essential part of Prussian military strategy.
