has now expanded to cover cultural, social, and historical aspects as well. The study of language has always been an integral part of understanding the human experience, but now it is viewed as a complex system that interacts with and is influenced by various factors such as culture, history, politics, and power relations.

This interdisciplinary approach has opened up new avenues of research and has deepened our understanding of the complex nature of language and its role in shaping our world.
