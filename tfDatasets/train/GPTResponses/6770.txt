are called localities. Localities refer to specific geographic areas that are defined by their inhabitants, geography, and/or political status. They are often used to describe smaller areas within larger regions, such as cities or counties. In the case of neighborhoods and blocks, these localities are defined by the people who live in them and the physical boundaries that separate them from other areas. Municipalities, on the other hand, are localities that have a formal government structure and are typically larger than neighborhoods or blocks.
