There have been several watershed events in human history, but one of the most significant is the development of agriculture. This occurred around 12,000 years ago when humans began to domesticate plants and animals, marking the transition from a hunter-gatherer society to a more settled agrarian one. This allowed for the development of permanent settlements, the growth of communities, the emergence of social classes, and the formation of organized societies. Agriculture also led to advances in technology, such as irrigation and the plow, which improved food production and led to the growth of trade and commerce. Overall, the development of agriculture marked a significant shift in human history and had a profound impact on human civilization.
