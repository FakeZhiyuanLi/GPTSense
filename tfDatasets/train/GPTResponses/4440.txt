The Confederate overall strategy to win the Civil War was to defend their home territory and force the Union to fight on their terms. They believed that if they could hold out long enough, the Union would tire of the war and be willing to negotiate a peace settlement on Confederate terms. The Confederates also hoped to gain recognition from foreign powers, particularly Britain and France, who they believed might come to their aid. Additionally, they attempted to disrupt Union supply lines by raiding Union territory and capturing supplies.
