The closest living relatives of flatworms (phylum Platyhelminthes) are other bilaterally symmetrical animals, including annelids (segmented worms) and nemerteans (ribbon worms). Some molecular studies also suggest that flatworms may have a more distant relationship with mollusks and arthropods, which are also part of the larger group of animals called protostomes.
