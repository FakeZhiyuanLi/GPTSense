Dogs have the ability to recognize a variety of human sounds, including their owner's voice, other familiar voices, and even certain words or phrases that are commonly associated with specific actions or commands. They can also distinguish between different vocalizations, such as a friendly tone versus an angry or threatening tone. Additionally, dogs are adept at interpreting nonverbal cues such as body language and facial expressions to understand and respond to human behavior.
