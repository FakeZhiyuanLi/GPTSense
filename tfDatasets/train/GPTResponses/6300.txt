Yes, the avian flu can be spread from wild birds to birds kept in husbandry. Wild birds can carry the virus and transmit it to domesticated birds directly, through contact with contaminated materials like feces or saliva, or through contact with contaminated water or feed. Therefore, it is important for bird owners to take measures to protect their birds from exposure to wild birds and to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus.
