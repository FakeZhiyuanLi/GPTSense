The ship conversions in 1927 gave rise to the first aircraft carriers, which were typically converted from existing battleships or cruisers. These early aircraft carriers lacked many of the features that became standard in later designs, such as a full-length flight deck, angled landing area, and steam catapults. Instead, the converted ships typically had a small landing platform aft, with aircraft launched by a catapult or simply rolled off the deck. Despite these limitations, these early carriers represented a major step forward in naval aviation, allowing aircraft to operate from the seas for the first time.
