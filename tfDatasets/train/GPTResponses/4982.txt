The "evil quartet" is a term coined by economist Paul Collier in his 2007 book "The Bottom Billion". Collier uses the term to describe the four elements that he believes keep countries in poverty: conflict, natural resources, corruption, and bad governance. He argues that these four factors create a vicious cycle that traps many of the world's poorest countries in a state of poverty and underdevelopment.
