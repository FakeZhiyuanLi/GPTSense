The formalist definition is difficult to apply because it focuses solely on the formal elements of a text, such as its structure, language, and style, without considering the cultural, historical, or social context in which it was created. This means that there are many factors that can influence a reader's interpretation of a text, and the formalist approach may not take these into account. Additionally, different readers may have different interpretations of a text based on their own experiences and cultural backgrounds, which makes it challenging to apply a universal formalist approach.
