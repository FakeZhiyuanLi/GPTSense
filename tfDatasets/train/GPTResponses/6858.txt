New Haven pizza style, also known as “apizza”, originated from New Haven, Connecticut in the early 20th century. It was created by Italian immigrants who brought their traditional pizza-making techniques with them to the United States. The style is characterized by thin, crispy crust with a slightly charred and blistered texture, a simple tomato sauce, and toppings such as fresh clams, garlic, and grated pecorino romano cheese. One of the most famous pizzerias in New Haven that serves this style is Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana, which opened in 1925.
