One negative outcome that might result from the process of treaty renegotiation is the breakdown of trust and cooperation between the parties involved. When one party seeks to renegotiate a treaty, it may be perceived as a lack of commitment or good faith on their part. This can erode the relationship and create tension and suspicion that can carry over into other areas of cooperation. Additionally, the uncertainty and instability that come with treaty renegotiation can create economic and political instability, which can affect the livelihoods of people and businesses on both sides of the treaty.
