There are several things that the USB Battery Charging Specification Revision 1.2 makes clear of:1. Charging Current: The specification clearly defines the maximum charging current that can be provided by a USB port, which is 1.5A for USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports, and 3A for USB Type-C ports.2. Charging Voltage: The specification also defines the voltage ranges that are allowed for charging, which are 5V ± 5% for USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports, and 5V ± 3% for USB Type-C ports.3. Charger Identification: The specification includes a method for the device to identify whether it is connected to a dedicated charger or a standard USB port. This allows the device to optimize its charging behavior based on the available power source.4. Charging Status: The specification defines the signaling method that can be used to indicate the charging status of the device to the user, such as through LED indicators or display messages.5. Data Transfer during Charging: The specification permits data transfer while a device is being charged, which was not possible in previous versions of the specification.Overall, the USB Battery Charging Specification Revision 1.2 provides clear guidelines for charging devices through USB ports, ensuring consistent and safe charging experiences for users.
