Drinking to cope with negative emotional states correlates strongly with impulsive behavior, aggression, and emotional instability. It can also lead to increased risk-taking behavior and substance abuse problems. Over time, these negative behavioral qualities can exacerbate the drinker's emotional distress, leading to a dangerous cycle of negative emotions and problematic drinking habits.
