There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on the context and country in question. However, one possible answer could be the United States Military's Good Conduct Medal, which was redesigned and updated in 1974 to include a bronze clasp with the words "Good Conduct" inscribed on it. Prior to this, the medal had no clasp and did not include the words "Good Conduct" on it. Another possible answer could be any number of medals from other countries, organizations, or military branches that may have been replaced or updated in 1974 for various reasons.
