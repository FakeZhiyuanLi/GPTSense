None of the four canonical Gospels in the Christian Bible (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John) provide an identical account of the virgin birth as found in Surah 19 of the Qur'an. While the Gospels mention the virgin birth of Jesus, the details and specific language used differ from the description in the Qur'an. Additionally, some scholars argue that the accounts of the virgin birth in the Gospels may be allegorical or symbolic rather than literal.
