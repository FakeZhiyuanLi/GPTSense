It is difficult to pinpoint a specific date or time when universities started growing gardens, as the practice has likely been around for centuries in some form or another. However, in recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in campus gardens and sustainable agriculture practices, with many universities across the world implementing food gardens and urban agriculture initiatives on their campuses in order to promote healthy eating habits, increase access to fresh produce, and reduce their carbon footprint. The exact time frame for the growth of these initiatives varies depending on the university and region.
