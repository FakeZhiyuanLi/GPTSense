Other components of the immune system include:1. White blood cells: White blood cells, also called leukocytes, are specialized cells that help fight off infections and disease. They include lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils.2. Antibodies: Antibodies are proteins that are produced by the immune system in response to foreign invaders, such as viruses or bacteria. They attach to the invader and help to destroy it.3. Lymphatic system: The lymphatic system is a network of vessels and nodes that help to circulate lymph, a fluid that contains immune cells and other substances.4. Complement system: The complement system is a group of proteins that work together to destroy foreign invaders. They can also help to trigger inflammation.5. Cytokines: Cytokines are signaling molecules that are released by immune cells. They help to regulate the immune response and can also trigger inflammation.6. Bone marrow: The bone marrow is the site where immune cells, such as white blood cells and lymphocytes, are produced.7. Thymus: The thymus is a gland located in the chest that helps to produce and mature T cells, a type of lymphocyte.8. Spleen: The spleen is an organ located in the abdomen that helps to filter and remove old or damaged red blood cells from circulation. It also contains immune cells that can help to fight infections.
