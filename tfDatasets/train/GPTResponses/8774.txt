The primary debate at the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting of 1860 was between Thomas Huxley and Samuel Wilberforce over the theory of evolution. Huxley argued in favor of Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection, while Wilberforce, a bishop, opposed it on religious grounds. The debate became known as the "Great Debate" and was a significant moment in the history of science and the relationship between science and religion.
