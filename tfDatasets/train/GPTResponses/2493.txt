Supporters of the November end to DST do not necessarily use a specific U.S. holiday as the justification for keeping the change through the end of October. However, many proponents of ending DST argue that the practice disrupts people's sleep patterns, causes health problems, and increases the risk of accidents. They also point out that most of the world does not observe DST, and that there is no clear evidence that it saves energy. Therefore, they argue that the best course of action is to end DST altogether, rather than simply extend or shorten it.
