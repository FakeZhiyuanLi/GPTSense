When it is claimed that many fatty acids are non-essential, it means that they can be synthesized by the body from other nutrients and do not need to be obtained from the diet. The body can produce these fatty acids through processes such as beta-oxidation, lipogenesis, and elongation. Essential fatty acids, on the other hand, cannot be produced by the body and must be obtained from the diet. These include alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) and linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid).
