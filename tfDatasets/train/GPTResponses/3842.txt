Teeth are made primarily of calcium, phosphorus, and other minerals. The enamel, which is the hard outer layer of the tooth, is made up of tightly packed mineral crystals called hydroxyapatite. The dentin, which is the softer layer beneath the enamel, is made up of a combination of minerals and organic material. The roots of teeth also contain small amounts of connective tissue, nerves, and blood vessels.
