Bar-tailed godwits undertake one of the longest migratory journeys of any bird species, traveling up to 11,000 kilometers (6,835 miles) each way between their breeding grounds in Alaska and their non-breeding grounds in New Zealand and Australia. This migration route involves a non-stop flight of 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) across the Pacific Ocean, which can take up to 9 consecutive days of flying without rest or food.
