French and Italian are not very mutually comprehensible because they developed from different branches of the Romance language family. French evolved from the Gallo-Romance dialects spoken in northern France, while Italian evolved from the Italo-Romance dialects spoken in central and southern Italy. Therefore, these two languages have different grammar, vocabulary, phonetics, and pronunciation. Furthermore, French has more Germanic influence due to invasions and interactions with Germanic peoples in the past, while Italian has more Greek and Arabic influence due to its historical connections with southeastern Europe and North Africa. Hence, despite sharing some similarities and borrowings, French and Italian remain distinct and independent languages.
