A finite group of order p, a prime number, is necessarily cyclic (abelian) group Zp because, by Lagrange's theorem, the only possible orders of subgroups of a group of order p are 1, p, and p itself.Since the subgroup of order 1 is trivial, and the subgroup of order p is the group itself, there is only one non-trivial proper subgroup of the group.By the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups, any abelian group of order p is isomorphic to Zp. Therefore, the only possible non-trivial proper subgroup of an abelian group of order p is isomorphic to Zp itself.This implies that there is only one possible non-trivial proper subgroup of the group, which is cyclic and generated by any non-identity element of the group. Hence, the group itself must be cyclic (abelian).
