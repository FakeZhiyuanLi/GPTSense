Schnellweg is a German term that translates to "fast road" or "expressway." It refers to a type of multi-lane highway or freeway that is designed for higher speeds and longer distances between exits than regular city streets or state highways. Schnellwegs are found primarily in Germany and other European countries and are often marked with the "Autobahn" sign.
