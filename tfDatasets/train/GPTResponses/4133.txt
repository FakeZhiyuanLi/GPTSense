is known as sedimentary rock. The combination of the sediment and organic matter is commonly referred to as shale, which is a type of sedimentary rock characterized by its fine-grained texture and ability to split into thin layers. Over time, mineral-rich water percolates through the rock and causes the organic matter to undergo a process known as diagenesis, which transforms it into oil or natural gas. This is how shale oil and gas are formed.
