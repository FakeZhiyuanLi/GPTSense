The formation of the Alps began about 65 million years ago, during the late Cretaceous period, as a result of tectonic plate movements and collision between the African and Eurasian plates. The process of mountain building continued through the Paleogene and Neogene periods, and is still going on today, albeit at a much slower pace.
