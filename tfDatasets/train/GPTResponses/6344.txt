Candidates for a Masonic lodge are typically introduced to the lodge by existing members who sponsor them for membership. The sponsoring member(s) will usually vouch for the candidate's character and suitability for membership. After the sponsor's recommendation is shared with the lodge, the candidate may be invited to attend meetings and other events to get to know the members and learn more about Masonry.
