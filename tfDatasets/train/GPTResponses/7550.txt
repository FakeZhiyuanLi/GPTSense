During the last ice age, which occurred between 110,000 and 12,000 years ago, large areas of land that are now submerged were above water. This includes a land bridge between Asia and North America known as Beringia, as well as parts of what is now the continental shelf of the Atlantic Ocean, North Sea, and southern Australia. Additionally, glaciers covered large parts of North America, Europe, and Asia.
