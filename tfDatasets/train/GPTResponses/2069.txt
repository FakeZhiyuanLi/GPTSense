When one party withdraws from a multilateral treaty, their rights and obligations under that treaty are terminated. However, the treaty remains in force for the other parties that have not withdrawn. The remaining parties must continue to abide by the terms of the treaty and fulfill their obligations. The withdrawal of one party does not invalidate the treaty or necessarily affect its effectiveness, but it may impact its implementation and effectiveness depending on the significance of the withdrawing party.
