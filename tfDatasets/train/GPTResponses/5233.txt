Scandza/Scanzia is viewed as the ancient homeland of the Germanic people, which encompassed modern-day Scandinavia and parts of northern Germany. The connection to Ashkenaz may come from the fact that Ashkenazi Jews have origins in Central and Eastern Europe, regions where Germanic tribes once settled and established kingdoms. Additionally, some scholars believe that Ashkenazi Jews may have intermarried with Germanic peoples during their time in Europe.
