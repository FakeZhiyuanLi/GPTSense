Only women are allowed to compete in rhythmic gymnastics according to the regulations set by the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG). This is because the sport requires a high level of flexibility, grace, and artistry, which are considered to be more traditionally feminine attributes. Additionally, the use of props, such as ribbons, hoops, and clubs, is also a defining characteristic of rhythmic gymnastics, and these items have historically been associated with women's performance art.
