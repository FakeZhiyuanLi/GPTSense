One subtle tool that can be used in an informal imperialistic situation to expand a controlled area is cultural influence. By introducing and promoting the dominant culture of the controlling power, the population of the controlled area may begin to adopt and assimilate to the controlling power's values and beliefs, ultimately expanding the controlled area. This can be achieved through various means such as media, education, and social interactions.
