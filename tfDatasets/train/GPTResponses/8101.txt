This theory is commonly known as the theory of divine creation or creationism. It was widely believed in the past, but it has been largely discredited by modern science. One of the most prominent advocates of this theory was the English natural theologian William Paley, who argued that the complexity of the natural world was evidence of God's handiwork. Another influential proponent of creationism was the French naturalist Georges Cuvier, who believed that each species was created by God as a unique and fixed form.
