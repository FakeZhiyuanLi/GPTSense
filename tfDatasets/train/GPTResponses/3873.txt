One major barrier to videoconferencing between some communities is inadequate internet connectivity due to a lack of infrastructure, limited resources, or poor accessibility. This can result in poor video and audio quality, delays, and dropped connections, making it difficult for participants to communicate effectively. Additionally, some cultures or communities may have reservations or concerns about using technology for communication and may prefer in-person interactions. Other factors, such as language barriers, time zone differences, and technical skill level, may also contribute to challenges in videoconferencing between communities.
