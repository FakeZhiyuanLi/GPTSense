The Italian influences on Eritrean cuisine come from Eritrea's colonial past. Eritrea was part of Italian East Africa from 1936 to 1941, and during this time, Italian culinary traditions and ingredients heavily influenced Eritrean cuisine. Some popular Italian-influenced dishes in Eritrea include spaghetti with meat sauce, pizza, and lasagna. Additionally, Italian coffee culture has also become an integral part of Eritrea's social fabric.
