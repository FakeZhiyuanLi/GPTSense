This statement is true. Ashkenazi Jews are a population group with a distinct genetic profile, and specific genetic variations have been found to be more common in this group than in other populations. For example, mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes that increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancer are more prevalent among Ashkenazi Jews. Other genetic variations that are more common in this group include those related to Tay-Sachs disease, Gaucher disease, and Niemann-Pick disease.
