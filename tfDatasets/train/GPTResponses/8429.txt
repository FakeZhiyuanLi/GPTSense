Nigeria has had several major nationalist movements over the years. The most significant was the Nigerian Nationalist Movement, which emerged in the 1940s and was led by people like Nnamdi Azikiwe, Obafemi Awolowo, and Ahmadu Bello. The goal of the movement was to gain independence from British colonial rule and establish Nigeria as an independent nation. The movement was successful, and Nigeria gained its independence in 1960. Other significant nationalist movements in Nigeria include the Arewa People's Congress and the Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB).
