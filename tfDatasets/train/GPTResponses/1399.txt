The staples of classical music, such as symphonies, concertos, operas, and sonatas, are often used for formal performances in concert halls, theaters, and opera houses. They are also frequently played on radio stations and recorded for commercial release. Additionally, classical music is sometimes used in films, television, and other media for dramatic effect, and is often used in educational settings to teach music theory, history, and appreciation.
