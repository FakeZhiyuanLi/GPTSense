Napoleon reorganized the French economy, government, and military institutions to supply the personnel and money required to fight great wars. He introduced several key reforms, including the creation of a national conscription system, the establishment of government-controlled factories for arms and other war materials, the adoption of a system of taxation to fund the military, and the establishment of a centralized system of government control to manage the war effort. Additionally, Napoleon relied heavily on his own charisma and military genius to rally the French people behind his cause and to inspire his soldiers to fight fiercely for France.
