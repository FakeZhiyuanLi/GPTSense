Some common types of discrimination in Nigeria include:1. Ethnic discrimination: Discrimination based on one's ethnic identity, which is prevalent in the country due to the existence of over 250 ethnic groups.2. Religious discrimination: Discrimination based on one's religious beliefs, which can manifest in the form of hate speech, attacks on places of worship, and exclusion from certain social or political activities.3. Gender discrimination: Discrimination based on one's gender, which affects women more than men, particularly in education, employment, and political participation.4. Sexual orientation discrimination: Discrimination based on one's sexual orientation, which is still illegal and socially stigmatized in Nigeria, putting members of the LGBT community at risk of violence and discrimination.5. Age discrimination: Discrimination based on one's age, which can limit access to opportunities and resources for both young and elderly people in Nigeria.
