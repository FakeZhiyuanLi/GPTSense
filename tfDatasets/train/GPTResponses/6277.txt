The new Allied peace proposal after World War I was the Treaty of Versailles. In this treaty, France was not required to surrender any territory. In fact, France gained back the territories of Alsace-Lorraine, which had been lost to Germany in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. However, the treaty did impose huge financial reparations on Germany, which France deemed insufficient for the destruction and loss it had suffered during the war.
