The 3' end refers to the end of a nucleotide sequence in DNA or RNA that has a free hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to the 3' carbon of the sugar molecule in the nucleotide. This end is also known as the 'trailing end' and is important in DNA replication, transcription, and translation processes. The other end of the nucleotide sequence is known as the 5' end, which has a phosphate group attached to the 5' carbon of the sugar molecule.
