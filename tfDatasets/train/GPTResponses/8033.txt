Arabic numerals originated in India, around the 6th or 7th century. They were then introduced to the Arab world through trade and cultural exchange, and the Arabs further developed and popularized the system. These numerals are also known as Hindu-Arabic numerals as they combine elements from both Indian and Arabic cultures.
