A closed river refers to a river that has no outflow or access to the sea. Closed rivers can serve as natural habitats for some aquatic wildlife and provide a source of water for local populations. However, when closed rivers dry up, they can lead to soil degradation, desertification, and other negative environmental impacts. In some cases, closed rivers can also become breeding grounds for mosquitoes and other disease-carrying insects, posing a health risk to nearby communities.
