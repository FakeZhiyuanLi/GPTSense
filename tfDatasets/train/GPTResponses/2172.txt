Most systems use the data from the Global Positioning System (GPS) to calculate local time. GPS satellites transmit a highly accurate time signal that can be used to synchronize clocks in devices, which in turn can calculate local time based on the time zone and location data configured in the device. Other systems may use online time servers or time signals from radio stations to obtain accurate time data.
