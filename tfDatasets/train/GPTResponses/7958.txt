During the Heian period (794-1185), Buddhism continued to spread throughout Japan, particularly the Tendai and Shingon sects, which blended elements of Shintoism and Taoism with Buddhism. Additionally, Pure Land Buddhism gained popularity among the common people as it emphasized the concept of salvation through the power of Amida Buddha's vow to save all beings.
