The main goal of sociology is to understand and explain how human societies function, how they are organized, and how individuals and groups interact within them. It seeks to examine the social structures, institutions, and cultural patterns that shape people's lives, and to identify and analyze the social forces that influence social behavior and social change. Ultimately, the aim of sociology is to improve the social conditions of individuals and groups by fostering greater understanding of the social world and developing strategies for addressing social problems.
