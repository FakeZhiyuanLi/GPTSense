The oldest way to study migration is through oral histories, which involve collecting the memories and stories of people who have migrated from one place to another. Before written records and formal research methods were established, people would share stories of their experiences and journeys, passing down knowledge from generation to generation. Oral histories remain an important tool for understanding migration today, particularly in cultures where written records are scarce or inaccessible.
