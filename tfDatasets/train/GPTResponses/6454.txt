Alfred Kinsey, an American biologist and sexologist, developed the Kinsey Scale as a way to measure individuals' sexual orientation beyond just binary categories of homosexuality and heterosexuality. He argued that human sexuality is a continuum and that people do not necessarily fit neatly into one category or another. The Kinsey Scale ranges from 0 (exclusively heterosexual) to 6 (exclusively homosexual) with varying degrees of bisexuality in between. Kinsey believed that understanding this continuum could help society better understand and accept diverse forms of human sexuality.
