The abstand and ausbau framework discussed the unification of speech communities in terms of linguistic distance and linguistic standardization.Abstand refers to the linguistic differences or distance between two speech communities, which can be measured in terms of phonological, morphological, syntactic, and lexical features. The greater the abstand, the more difficult it is for speakers of these communities to understand each other.Ausbau, on the other hand, refers to the standardization and elaboration of a language, through the establishment of norms, rules, and conventions. This process can involve the development of a standardized grammar, the creation of new words, and the adoption of features from other languages. Ausbau aims to unify a speech community by establishing a common language standard that can be used in education, media, and other domains.Together, the abstand and ausbau framework suggests that the unification of speech communities involves both reducing the linguistic distance between speakers and establishing a common language standard.
