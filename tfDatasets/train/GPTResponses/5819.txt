1. Irregularity: If a Grand Lodge is not following the established Masonic principles, practices, and rules that are recognized by the majority of other Grand Lodges, it may be considered irregular. This could include not requiring a belief in a supreme being, admitting women or minors, or allowing political discussions during lodge meetings.2. Interference: If a Grand Lodge interferes with the jurisdiction of another Grand Lodge, such as by attempting to establish a lodge within another Grand Lodge's territory, this could lead to withholding of recognition. This is considered a violation of Masonic protocol and can create tension and conflict between Grand Lodges.
