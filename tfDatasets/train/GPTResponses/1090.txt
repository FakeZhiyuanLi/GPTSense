A register of a CPU (Central Processing Unit) keeps track of temporary data that the CPU needs to access quickly during its operation. It may store instructions, data values, memory addresses, flags, and more. Registers are small, high-speed memory locations that are part of the CPU and can be accessed much faster than other types of memory. The number of registers varies depending on the CPU architecture, but they typically include a program counter (PC), stack pointer (SP), and general-purpose registers (GPRs) that can hold integers, floating-point numbers, and other data types.
