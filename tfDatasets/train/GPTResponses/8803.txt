Jan Hus advocated for the use of the vernacular language in religious practices and for the church to become more accessible to the common people. He also criticized the clergy's corruption and extravagance, calling for a return to the simplicity and poverty of the early church. He inspired a nationalist and anti-German sentiment among the Czechs and supported the authority of the Bohemian king over the papacy.
