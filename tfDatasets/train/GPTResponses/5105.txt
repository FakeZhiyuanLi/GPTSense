Deductions in execution and artistry are taken from the technical score in figure skating competitions. The technical score is based on the difficulty and execution of elements performed in the program, while the artistic score is based on the skater's interpretation and presentation of the music, choreography, and overall performance. The deductions in execution and artistry are subtracted from the total score, along with deductions for falls and other mistakes.
