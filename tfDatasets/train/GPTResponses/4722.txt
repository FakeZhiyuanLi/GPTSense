The value of the dollar can typically decline during times of economic uncertainty or political instability. Other factors that can contribute to a decline in the value of the dollar include inflation, excessive national debt, and a weak employment market. Additionally, changes in monetary policy, such as reducing interest rates, can also contribute to a decline in the value of the dollar.
