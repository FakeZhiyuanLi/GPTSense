Regulations are published in the Federal Register, which is a daily publication of the United States government that contains proposed rules, final rules, and notices of federal agencies and organizations. Once a regulation is adopted, it is also published in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), which is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register. Additionally, regulations may be published on individual agency websites or in state registers.
