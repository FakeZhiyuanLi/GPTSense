Genetic engineering allows the manipulation or alteration of an organism's genetic material using biotechnology processes. This can lead to the creation of new traits or characteristics that may improve the organism's functionality, productivity, or commercial value. Some examples of what genetic engineering can allow include:1. The creation of genetically modified crops that are resistant to pests, diseases, or harsh environmental conditions.2. The development of medicines and vaccines that are produced using genetically engineered organisms, such as bacteria or yeast.3. The production of animal models that can replicate human diseases or be used in medical research.4. The cloning of animals or crops with desirable traits, such as high yields or superior performance.5. The identification and manipulation of specific genes that cause inherited disorders or diseases, enabling their correction or prevention.
