It is not accurate to say that short range missiles are replacing specific weapons. Short range missiles are one type of weapon that can be used alongside or in place of other modes of attack, depending on the specific circumstances of a military operation. They are often used to target relatively close-range objectives, such as enemy vehicles, fortifications, or ground troops. Other weapons that can be used in similar situations include artillery, mortars, and close air support from fighter jets or attack helicopters. Ultimately, the choice of weapons depends on a variety of factors, including the military objectives, the terrain of the battlefield, and the capabilities of the opposing forces.
