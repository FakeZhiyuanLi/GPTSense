The origins of Polish knighthood can be traced back to the medieval period when Poland had a system of feudalism, and warriors were awarded land in exchange for military service. The earliest known order of knights in Poland was the Order of the Knights of the Sword, founded in the 14th century. However, the most famous and prestigious order of Polish knighthood is the Order of the White Eagle, founded in 1705 by King Augustus II the Strong. The order was awarded to Polish and foreign dignitaries for their outstanding contributions to the country and its people.
