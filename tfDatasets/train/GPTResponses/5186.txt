The visions of Anne Catherine Emmerich, a German nun and mystic, led to the identification of the house of the Virgin Mary. In the early 19th century, Emmerich described in detail the location and appearance of the house where Mary spent the last years of her life. Her visions inspired a search for the house in the vicinity of Ephesus, Turkey, and in 1891, the ruins of a small stone house were discovered and later confirmed as the house of Mary. Today, the site is a popular destination for pilgrims and tourists.
