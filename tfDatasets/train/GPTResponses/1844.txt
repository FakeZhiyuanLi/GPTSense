There are several factors that led to an increase in the number of Somalis leaving the country, including:1. Political instability and conflict- Somalia has experienced decades of civil war, resulting in widespread violence, insecurity, and displacement. The ongoing conflict has made life difficult for ordinary citizens, leading many to flee the country.2. Drought and food insecurity - Somalia experiences frequent droughts and famines, especially in rural areas. The lack of access to food and water resources has forced many Somalis to leave the country in search of better living conditions.3. Economic hardship - The Somali economy has been severely impacted by the conflict and instability, resulting in high levels of poverty and unemployment. Many Somalis have left the country in search of employment and economic opportunities elsewhere.4. Climate change - Somalia is vulnerable to climate change, with the country experiencing increased frequency and intensity of floods and droughts. This has negatively impacted agricultural production and further worsened food insecurity, leading many to leave the country.
