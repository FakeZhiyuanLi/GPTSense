Kanye West and his mother co-founded the Kanye West Foundation in 2003. The foundation's mission was to combat education inequality and support underprivileged young people with music and arts education. The foundation's activities included funding after-school programs, providing scholarships, and hosting events designed to inspire and elevate young people. The foundation closed down in 2011, two years after the death of Kanye's mother, Donda West.
