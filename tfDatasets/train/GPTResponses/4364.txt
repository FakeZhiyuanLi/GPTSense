There is no specific age limit when wisdom increases. Wisdom can increase throughout a person's lifetime, as it is gained through life experiences, self-reflection, and learning from mistakes. However, research suggests that the brain's prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for decision-making, problem-solving, and emotional regulation, continues to develop until a person's mid-20s. Therefore, young adults may experience a significant increase in wisdom during this period, as their brains mature and they gain more life experiences.
