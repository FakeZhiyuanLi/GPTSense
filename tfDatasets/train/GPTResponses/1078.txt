The term gemmule refers to a small asexual reproductive structure or an element in the theory of pangenesis, proposed by Charles Darwin. In the theory of pangenesis, gemmules are hypothetical units of heredity that are produced by every part of the body and are necessary for the formation of new organisms. However, the theory of pangenesis was later discredited, and gemmules are no longer considered a valid concept in biology.
