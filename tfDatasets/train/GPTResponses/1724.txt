Most universities teaching liberal arts have a diverse range of academic departments, including humanities (e.g. literature, philosophy, history, religious studies), social sciences (e.g. psychology, sociology, anthropology, economics, political science), and natural sciences (e.g. biology, chemistry, physics, astronomy). Additionally, liberal arts colleges often offer interdisciplinary programs that combine multiple fields of study, such as gender studies, environmental studies, or neuroscience. They may also place a strong emphasis on critical thinking, writing, and communication skills, as well as provide opportunities for leadership development, community service, and experiential learning.
