Emperor Valens was an Arian Christian, which was a controversial sect of Christianity that emerged in the 4th century. Arianism was founded by Arius of Alexandria, who believed that Jesus was not of the same substance as God, but was rather a created being. Valens supported the Arian view and was a strong opponent of the orthodox Christian view held by the Nicene Creed. He persecuted those who supported the Nicene Creed, including prominent figures such as Saint Basil the Great and Saint Gregory of Nyssa. Valens also supported the use of force to enforce religious conformity in his empire.
