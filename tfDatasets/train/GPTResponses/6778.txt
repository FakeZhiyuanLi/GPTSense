Binding precedent became a possibility due to the development and evolution of the common law system. In common law systems, judges rely on prior court decisions, or case law, to interpret the law and make decisions in current cases. Over time, certain cases and their interpretations of the law gained more weight and authority, leading to the development of binding precedent. This meant that future courts were obligated to follow the legal reasoning and conclusions of previous cases in similar circumstances, creating a consistent and predictable body of law. The establishment of binding precedent has been a key feature of common law systems, and has helped to ensure fairness and consistency in the administration of justice.
