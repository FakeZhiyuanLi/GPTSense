The geological features removed underground that have caused sinking in areas of southeast Houston are known as subsurface reservoirs of oil and gas. The extraction of these resources has led to the compaction and settling of the ground, resulting in sinking or subsidence. Additionally, the area is built on a thick layer of clay which exacerbates the sinking problem.
