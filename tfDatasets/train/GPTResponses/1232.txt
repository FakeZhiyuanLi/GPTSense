Neuroanatomists study the anatomy, structure, and organization of the nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and associated structures. They focus on understanding the complex relationships between neurons, glial cells, and other neural components, as well as the functions and behaviors that are controlled by these structures. Some of the specific areas of research in neuroanatomy include brain development, neural plasticity, neurodegenerative disorders, and the impact of drugs and environmental factors on the nervous system.
