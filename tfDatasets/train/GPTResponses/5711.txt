The price for the reforms of the voting system was paid by the government and taxpayers who funded the changes in technology, infrastructure, and training required for the implementation of the new systems. Additionally, political parties and candidates who had to adapt to the new voting processes and regulations also incurred costs. Some individual voters may have also faced inconvenience or confusion during the transition period.
