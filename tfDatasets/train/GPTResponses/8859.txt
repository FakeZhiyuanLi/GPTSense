There is no specific rediscovered inheritance that invalidates Darwin's views on evolution. Darwin's theory of evolution through natural selection still remains a widely accepted scientific theory, supported by extensive evidence from various fields of study, including genetics, paleontology, and anatomy. However, the discovery of epigenetic inheritance, which refers to changes in gene expression that can be passed down from one generation to the next without changes in DNA sequence, has challenged some aspects of traditional genetic inheritance and has led to a more nuanced understanding of how traits are passed down between generations. However, this discovery does not invalidate Darwin's views on evolution, but rather adds a layer of complexity to our understanding of the mechanisms that drive evolution.
