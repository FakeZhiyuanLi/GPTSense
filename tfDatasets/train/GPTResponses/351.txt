The financial crisis of 2008 resulted in significant defaults and losses in various other financial instruments, including:1. Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs): CDOs were securities created by bundling together various types of debt, including mortgages, and creating new securities with varying levels of risk. Many of these securities were rated as safe investments, but the underlying subprime mortgages began to default, causing significant losses for investors who had purchased these securities.2. Credit Default Swaps (CDS): CDS are financial contracts designed to transfer the risk of default from one party to another. During the financial crisis, many investors had purchased CDS on mortgage-backed securities, assuming that their investments were safer. However, as the underlying mortgages began to default, the CDS sellers were unable to honor their obligations, causing significant losses for investors.3. Asset-backed Commercial Paper (ABCP): ABCP is a short-term debt instrument that is backed by assets such as mortgages, credit card receivables, or auto loans. Many ABCP programs were funded by banks and investment firms, and as the underlying assets began to default, investors in these programs suffered significant losses.4. Structured Investment Vehicles (SIVs): SIVs are investment funds that borrow money to invest in a range of assets, including mortgages. These funds were popular during the housing boom, but as the subprime mortgages began to default, many SIVs were unable to meet their obligations to investors, causing significant losses.5. Mortgage-backed Securities (MBS): MBS are securities created by bundling together mortgage loans and selling them to investors. As subprime mortgages began to default, many MBS became worthless, causing significant losses for investors who had purchased these securities.
