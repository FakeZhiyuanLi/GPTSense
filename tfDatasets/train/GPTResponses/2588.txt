There have been several instances where changes in DST policy have cost North America a significant amount of money in extra work. However, the most recent and significant one was in 2007 when the US extended DST by four weeks, from the second Sunday in March to the first Sunday in November. This change was made to conserve energy, reduce traffic accidents, and promote outdoor leisure activities. However, it ended up costing North American businesses around $500 million to $1 billion in extra work, as they had to adjust their computer systems, calibrate schedules, and coordinate with international partners who did not observe DST or had different DST schedules.
