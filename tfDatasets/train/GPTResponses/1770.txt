The energy industry has also been in favor of DST as it provides an opportunity to reduce energy consumption during peak usage times. By extending daylight hours, this reduces the need for artificial lighting and other energy-consuming activities during the early evening hours. This is especially important for the energy industry as it helps to ensure that the electrical grids can handle the demands placed on them during peak usage times.
