There is no specific weather event that could offset the loss of ice shelves. The loss of ice shelves is a long-term process caused by factors such as global warming and rising sea temperatures. Weather events, such as storms or heavy precipitation, can cause temporary fluctuations in ice melt rates but cannot reverse the long-term trend of ice shelf loss. The only solution to offset the loss of ice shelves is to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and take actions to mitigate the impacts of climate change.
