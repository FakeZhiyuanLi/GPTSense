Company rule in India produced a significant impact on the Indian Rebellion of 1857 or the First War of Indian Independence. The British East India Company had been ruling India since the mid-18th century and had established their control over various regions of the country. The company's policies, including the land revenue system, economic exploitation, and cultural and racial discrimination, had caused resentment among Indians.The British East India Company's annexation of Indian princely states and the introduction of the Doctrine of Lapse further caused anger and frustration among Indian rulers and the common people. These factors led to widespread discontent and rebellion against the British rule, which was sparked by the Indian soldiers of the British East India Company's army in May 1857.The Indian Rebellion of 1857 was a significant turning point in Indian history and resulted in the end of the British East India Company's rule in India. It also led to the transfer of power from the British East India Company to the British Crown, which took over the administration of India. The rebellion also paved the way for the Indian independence movement, which ultimately resulted in India's independence from British rule in 1947.
