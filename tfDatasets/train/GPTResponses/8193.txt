The scientific revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries is considered to be the dividing line between ancient thought and classical physics. This period saw a shift from traditional Aristotelian philosophy to a more empirical and experimental approach to understanding the natural world, spearheaded by the work of scientists such as Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler, and Sir Isaac Newton.
