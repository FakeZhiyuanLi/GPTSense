In order to determine what is absorbed in the body and compare it to waste products, the following factors need to be considered:1. Diet: The type of food we eat can affect the absorption and metabolism of nutrients in our body.2. Age: As we age, our body's ability to absorb nutrients may decrease.3. Health conditions: Some health conditions can affect the body's absorption and utilization of nutrients.4. Medications: Certain medications can interfere with nutrient absorption or metabolism.5. Gut microbiota: The composition of gut bacteria can influence nutrient absorption and metabolism.By considering these factors, we can compare the waste products with the nutrients that were absorbed in the body to determine if there is any imbalance or deficiency in the diet or if there are any underlying health conditions that need to be addressed.
