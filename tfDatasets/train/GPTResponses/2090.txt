is known as "leakage." Leakage refers to various methods of diverting resources from their intended recipient, including theft by food aid workers or contractors, bribery of officials to divert aid, or the resale of aid on the black market. Leakage can occur at any point along the supply chain, including in procurement, storage, transportation, and distribution. Additionally, aid can be diverted to non-targeted households or communities due to inadequate targeting mechanisms or corruption within the distribution system. To address these challenges, aid organizations must implement robust monitoring and evaluation systems, enhance transparency and accountability mechanisms, and work closely with local communities and governments to ensure aid reaches its intended recipients.
