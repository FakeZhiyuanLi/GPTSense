The broad operational definition of a gene classifies gene-associated regions as any DNA sequence that is physically linked to a coding sequence and that significantly contributes to its regulation, expression, or function in the cell. These include regulatory elements, such as enhancers and promoters, intronic sequences, untranslated regions (UTRs), and other non-coding regions that impact gene expression through various mechanisms, including chromatin remodeling and RNA processing. Additionally, gene-associated regions may also include nearby genes whose expression is influenced by the same regulatory elements or chromatin environment as the primary gene of interest.
