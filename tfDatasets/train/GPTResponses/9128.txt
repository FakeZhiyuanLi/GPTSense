John von Neumann, a Hungarian-American mathematician, worked on a variety of projects during his time in Berlin in 1930 and Princeton from 1935 to 1939.In Berlin, von Neumann worked on a project related to quantum mechanics. Specifically, he collaborated with Werner Heisenberg on developing the mathematical framework that describes the behavior of subatomic particles. This was important work in the early days of quantum theory, and von Neumann's contributions helped pave the way for future developments in this field.In Princeton, von Neumann's work was more diverse. He was involved in research on topics ranging from game theory to nuclear physics. He worked closely with Albert Einstein and others on the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb during World War II. Von Neumann was also instrumental in developing the concept of the stored-program computer, which was a significant breakthrough in the field of computer science. Overall, von Neumann's work during this time spanned many different areas of mathematics and science, and helped lay the foundation for many important developments in the years to come.
