The effect on the emulsion after exposure is determined by several factors, including the type of emulsion used, the intensity and duration of the exposure, the wavelength of light used, and the processing method. Additionally, factors such as temperature, humidity, and agitation during processing can also affect the final result. Other factors that may influence the effect on the emulsion after exposure include the type of camera used, the quality of the lens, and the method of development.
