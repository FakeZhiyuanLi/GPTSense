about human communication?Speech perception and articulation findings and insights provide a deeper understanding of how humans process and produce language. This knowledge challenges some previous and traditional ideas about human communication. For example:1. Speech perception studies show that humans do not rely strictly on auditory information to understand speech. They also use visual and contextual information to help them interpret what is being said. This challenges the idea that speech perception is purely an auditory process.2. Articulation studies reveal that speech production is not just a mechanical process of moving the mouth and vocal cords. It is also influenced by cognitive processes such as attention, memory, and language planning. This challenges the older notion that speech production is simply a motor activity.3. The findings from speech perception and articulation research also challenge the idea that language is a separate and distinct module of the brain. Instead, language is now recognized as being integrated with other cognitive processes.In summary, speech perception and articulation insights challenge some previous and traditional ideas about how humans communicate. These findings allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the complex processes involved in human communication.
