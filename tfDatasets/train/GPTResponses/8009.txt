Oxidizers are substances or compounds that have a strong tendency to gain electrons or lose hydrogen ions in a chemical reaction, thereby causing other compounds or elements to become oxidized. They assist combustion by providing an abundant supply of oxygen to the fuel, resulting in a rapid and often violent reaction that produces heat and light. Examples of common oxidizers include chlorine, fluorine, ozone, hydrogen peroxide, nitric acid, and potassium permanganate. Some oxidizers are highly reactive and may cause oxidation and chemical breakdown of an organic material, causing harm to living organisms or the environment.
