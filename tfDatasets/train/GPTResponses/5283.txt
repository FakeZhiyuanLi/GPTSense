In 1923, it was discovered that a toxin-antitoxin mixture was safer to treat diphtheria toxin. The antitoxin was able to neutralize the dangerous effects of the diphtheria toxin and prevent further damage to the body. This development led to the widespread use of antitoxin as a treatment for diphtheria and greatly reduced the mortality rate associated with the disease.
