The ecological approach is the other major approach to understanding cognitive change during adolescence. This approach views cognitive development as a dynamic interaction between the individual and their environment, emphasizing the importance of context and culture in shaping cognitive processes. The ecological approach considers how youths' interactions with diverse environmental systems (family, school, peer group, media) and the broader cultural contexts (e.g., socioeconomic, historical, political) where these systems are embedded can contribute to differential patterns of cognitive change.
