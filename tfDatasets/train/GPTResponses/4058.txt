The Tanarim and Amoraim legislated various texts, including the Mishnah, the Tosefta, the Midrashim, and the Talmud. These texts were meant to help interpret the Torah and provide guidance for Jewish religious and legal practices. They also helped to standardize Jewish law and rituals across different geographic locations and communities.
