Plants and animals are different in many ways. Some of the most significant differences include:1. Mode of nutrition: Plants are autotrophic organisms, meaning they can produce their own food through photosynthesis. Animals, on the other hand, are heterotrophs and must consume other organisms for nutrition.2. Cell structure: Plant cells have rigid cell walls made of cellulose, which provides support and protection. Animal cells lack cell walls but have a flexible membrane that allows for movement and maneuverability.3. Reproduction: Plants reproduce asexually through methods like budding or vegetative propagation and sexually through pollination and seed formation. Animals reproduce sexually, with male and female gametes combining to form offspring.4. Mobility: While some plants, such as ferns and Venus flytraps, can move slightly, most are stationary. Animals, on the other hand, have the ability to move from one place to another.5. Respiration: Plants undergo respiration, a process that breaks down nutrients to produce energy. However, they also undergo photosynthesis, which produces oxygen as a byproduct. Animals undergo respiration by inhaling oxygen and exhaling carbon dioxide.Overall, plants and animals have many differences due to their distinct biological structures and lifestyles.
