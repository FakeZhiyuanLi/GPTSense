One example of another symmetry function is the radial distribution function (RDF). The RDF describes the probability density of finding a particle at a given distance from a reference particle in a system. It quantifies the distribution of particles around a central particle and considers the spherical symmetry of the system. The RDF can be used to determine the local structure of materials and the arrangement of atoms or molecules in a system.
