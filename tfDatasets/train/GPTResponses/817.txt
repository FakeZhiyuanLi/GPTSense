The Portuguese art of pastry has its origins in various cultural influences, including the Moorish, Jewish, and Catholic traditions. The use of sugar and eggs, two key ingredients in many Portuguese sweets, was introduced by the Moors during their occupation of the Iberian Peninsula. The Jewish community also had a significant impact on Portuguese pastry, with their use of almonds and honey. The Catholic Church also played a role, with their influence on religious celebrations and feasts leading to the creation of many seasonal sweets and pastries.
