In 2015, the Florida congressional map was redrawn due to a court ruling that the previous map violated the state constitution by unfairly favoring Republicans. The new map resulted in a more balanced representation of Democrats and Republicans in the state's congressional delegation. This decision was the result of a lawsuit brought by the League of Women Voters of Florida and a coalition of Democratic-leaning groups who argued that the previous map had been gerrymandered to protect Republican incumbents.
