country and culture. In general, political corruption refers to the abuse of power by politicians and government officials to gain personal benefits or to benefit their associates, family members, or friends. This can occur through bribery, embezzlement, nepotism, cronyism, patronage, fraud or other behaviors that violate ethical or legal standards. However, the specific practices and norms that constitute political corruption vary widely across different contexts, and what may be considered corrupt in one society may be perceived as acceptable or even normal behavior in another.
