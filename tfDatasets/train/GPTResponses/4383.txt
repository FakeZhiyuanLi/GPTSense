Liverpool?The group of fans that demanded that Everton remain within the city boundaries of Liverpool was known as Keep Everton in Our City (KEIOC). The group was formed in response to plans by Everton to relocate to a new stadium in Kirkby, a town located outside of the Liverpool city limits. KEIOC argued that the move would be detrimental to the local economy and the community, and that Everton should instead invest in a new stadium within the city boundaries. The campaign ultimately succeeded, and Everton announced in 2017 that they would be building a new stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock within Liverpool.
