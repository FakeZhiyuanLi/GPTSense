The exact number of Tibetans who died during the Great Leap Forward (1958-1962) is not known. However, it is estimated that millions of people died of starvation and other causes during this period of widespread famine and economic turmoil in China. Tibet was also affected by the policies of the Great Leap Forward, which included forced collectivization and agricultural reforms, leading to crop failures and food shortages. The exact number of Tibetans who died as a result of these policies is unclear, but it is likely that they suffered disproportionately compared to other regions of China due to their geographical and cultural isolation.
