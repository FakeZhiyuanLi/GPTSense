A naval air station is a military airfield used by naval aviation units as a base for training, maintenance, and operations. The primary function of a naval air station is to support Naval forces to maintain readiness and defend the country using air power. It's used for conducting training, testing, and research for maritime and land-based aircraft, helicopters, and unmanned aerial vehicles to enhance national defense capabilities. Additionally, some naval air stations also serve as logistics hubs, housing and maintaining Naval aircraft and other equipment as well.
