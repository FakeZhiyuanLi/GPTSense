The diagnosis of asthma is typically confirmed through a combination of medical history, physical examination, lung function tests, and response to asthma medications. Lung function tests, such as spirometry, measure how much air a person can exhale and how quickly they can do it. These tests may indicate airway obstruction that is consistent with asthma. In addition, a doctor may perform a bronchoprovocation test, in which the patient inhales a small amount of a substance that can trigger asthma symptoms. If the patientâ€™s airways constrict and their breathing worsens after inhaling the substance, it can be a sign of asthma. However, the diagnosis of asthma is complex and should always be made by a qualified medical professional.
