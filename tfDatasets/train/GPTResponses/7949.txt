The English originally colonized Bermuda in 1609 as a result of a shipwreck. A fleet of English ships, bound for Virginia, was caught in a storm and ended up on the reefs surrounding Bermuda. The survivors of the shipwreck found the island to be a suitable location for settlement and decided to establish a colony there. The English Government later acknowledged the potential strategic and economic value of this location and formally claimed Bermuda as a British colony.
