The two states of the immune system are state of health and state of disease. In a state of health, the immune system is working properly, protecting the body from foreign invaders like viruses and bacteria, and maintaining healthy tissues through processes like cell maintenance and repair. In a state of disease, the immune system is compromised or overactive, leading to conditions like autoimmune diseases or allergies. Immunology seeks to understand the mechanisms behind these states and develop treatments to improve immune system function.
