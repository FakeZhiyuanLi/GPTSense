Barcelona has acted as a draw to new arrivals from Catalonia throughout its history, but there have been several notable periods when this was particularly significant. One was during the industrialization of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when the city's growth and expanding economy attracted workers from across Catalonia and beyond. Another was during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), when Barcelona was the seat of the Republican government and saw an influx of refugees and activists. In more recent decades, Barcelona has become a hub for immigration from Latin America, North Africa, and other parts of the world.
