Migration has been documented throughout human history, with the earliest recorded instances dating back many thousands of years. For example, ancient cave paintings in Europe depict migratory patterns of animals, and ancient human populations are known to have migrated in search of food and resources. The first recorded human migrations that were documented in written form date back to ancient civilizations such as the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, who recorded movements of people and populations across regions and countries.
