Tibetan Buddhism is a form of Mahayana Buddhism that preserves teachings from various Buddhist traditions, including Indian Buddhism, Chinese Buddhism, and local Tibetan religion. Some of the key teachings preserved in Tibetan Buddhism include:1. The Four Noble Truths: the truth of suffering, the cause of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the path to the cessation of suffering.2. The Eightfold Path: right understanding, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.3. The Three Jewels: the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha.4. Impermanence: the understanding that all things are fleeting and constantly changing.5. Interdependence: the understanding that all things are connected and dependent on each other.6. Compassion and Bodhicitta: the cultivation of compassion and the aspiration to attain enlightenment for the benefit of all beings.7. Wisdom and Emptiness: the understanding of the true nature of reality as empty of inherent existence.8. Vajrayana practices: the use of meditation, visualizations, mantras, and rituals to transform the mind and achieve enlightenment.Overall, Tibetan Buddhism places a strong emphasis on practice and realization rather than solely on intellectual understanding. It also emphasizes the importance of lineage, transmission, and devotion to one's teacher or guru.
