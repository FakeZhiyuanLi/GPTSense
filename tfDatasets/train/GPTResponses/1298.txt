There is no definitive answer to this question, as the use of the term "Middle East" has evolved over time and has been used by a variety of sources. Some historians trace the origins of the term to the early 20th century, when British colonial officials began using it to refer to the region between India and Egypt. Others argue that the term has more complex roots, arising from geopolitical and economic changes in the region over the past few centuries. Ultimately, it is difficult to pinpoint a single individual or group who can be credited with introducing the term into scholarly discourse or public use.
