After a bill is delivered to the Office of the Federal Register (OFR), it goes through a process of review and publication. The OFR will review the bill to ensure it has been properly formatted and labeled before publishing it in the Federal Register. Once published, the bill will become part of the official record of proposed legislation and can be accessed by the public. The bill will then be assigned to a committee in Congress for further review and debate. Depending on the outcome of the committee review, the bill may be revised, amended, or rejected. If it is passed by both houses of Congress, it will then be sent to the President for signature or veto.
