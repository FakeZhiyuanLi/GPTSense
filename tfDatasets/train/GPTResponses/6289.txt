During the later Abbasid era, Iran mainly adhered to the Shia branch of Islam. The Safavid dynasty, which ruled Iran from 1501 to 1736, made Shia Islam the dominant form of Islam in Iran and cemented it as the official religion of the state. It also had a significant impact on shaping Iran's cultural and social identity.
