The reforms of Britain's voting system had a significant impact on the House of Commons. One of the major changes was the introduction of universal suffrage, which allowed all men and women over the age of 21 to vote. The Representation of the People Act 1918 extended the franchise to women over 30 who met certain property qualifications. This increased the number of eligible voters from 7.7 million to 21 million.The other significant change was the introduction of the Alternative Vote system (AV) in 1918 that replaced the first-past-the-post system. In the AV system, voters rank candidates in order of preference, and if no candidate receives a majority of first-preference votes, the candidate with the least first-preference votes is eliminated, and their second-preference votes are redistributed until one candidate has a majority.These changes had a profound impact on the House of Commons, as it became more representative of the population, and allowed for greater participation in democracy. It also led to the rise of smaller parties, as the AV system meant that votes for these parties could still have an impact, even if their first-choice candidate was unlikely to win.Overall, the reforms of Britain's voting system improved the fairness and effectiveness of the electoral process and made the House of Commons more democratic, representative, and diverse.
