The printed word enabled the dissemination of information and knowledge on a much larger scale than was possible before. It allowed for the mass production of books, newspapers, and other printed materials, which could be distributed widely and easily accessible to a large audience. This had a significant impact on education, politics, and the spread of ideas, as people could access more information and learn about different cultures and perspectives. The printed word also facilitated the development of the literary world and the spread of literature to a wider audience.
