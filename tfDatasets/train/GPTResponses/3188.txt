Archival descriptions of holdings under the custody of NARA (National Archives and Records Administration) are stored in two main locations:1. National Archives Catalog: The National Archives Catalog serves as the online catalog and portal for researchers and users to access descriptions and information about all of NARA's holdings. The catalog contains descriptions of more than 124 million records and documents, including photographs, maps, audiovisual materials, and more. These descriptions are searchable by keyword, record group, location, and other criteria.2. Finding Aids: NARA also produces finding aids, which are more detailed and comprehensive guides to specific record groups or collections. Finding aids provide context and further information about the records, including their arrangement, scope, and content. Finding aids are generally available in print or online and can be accessed through the National Archives Catalog or directly from NARA's website.
