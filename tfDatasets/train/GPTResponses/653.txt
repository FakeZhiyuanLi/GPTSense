After the Parinirvana (death) of Gautama Buddha, the first Buddhist council was held, which is known as the "First Buddhist Council." It was held in the town of Rajagaha in the kingdom of Magadha, under the patronage of King Ajatashatru. The main purpose of the council was to recite and compile the Buddhist scriptures, teachings, and rules (Vinaya) preached by Gautama Buddha. The council was attended by 500 Arhats (enlightened disciples) of Buddha, including Mahakassapa, Ananda, and Upali. The First Buddhist Council is considered to be a significant event in the history of Buddhism, as it helped to preserve and establish the Buddha's teachings for future generations.
