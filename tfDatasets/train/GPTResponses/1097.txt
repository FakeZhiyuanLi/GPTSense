Multiprocessor and multi-core computers have multiples of CPUs (Central Processing Units) or cores. A CPU or core is the primary component of a computer's processing unit, responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations. A single-processor computer has only one CPU, while a multiple processor or multi-core computer has two or more CPUs or cores that can work together to perform tasks faster and more efficiently. This allows the computer to run multiple tasks simultaneously or more complex tasks that require greater processing power.
