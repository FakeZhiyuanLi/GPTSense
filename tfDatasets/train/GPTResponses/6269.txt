It is believed that thousands of Freemasons were killed under Hitler's Nazi regime, but the exact number is unknown. Estimates range from 80,000 to 200,000, as Freemasonry was deemed a threat to the Nazi ideology and considered a "Jewish-Bolshevist" organization. Freemasons were among the groups targeted by the Nazis during the Holocaust.
