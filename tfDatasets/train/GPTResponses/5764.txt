Many of the larger suburban mansions from the boom era faced a decline in popularity after the housing boom ended in the early 2000s. As a result, many of these homes were left vacant and fell into disrepair. Some were also foreclosed upon and sold for significantly less than their original value. Additionally, changing demographics and preferences led to a shift in demand towards smaller, more efficient homes, further diminishing the appeal of these large suburban mansions. In some cases, the homes were renovated and repurposed as corporate or community spaces, while others were simply demolished.
