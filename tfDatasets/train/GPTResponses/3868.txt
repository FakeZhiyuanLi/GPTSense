Some foods are coated with a thin layer of oil or fat for easier passage through the digestive system. This is particularly common with foods that are high in insoluble fiber, such as nuts and seeds. The oil or fat helps to lubricate the food and prevent it from getting stuck in the digestive tract. Additionally, some foods may be coated in a batter or breadcrumb mixture before frying or baking, which can also make them easier to digest.
