Pathways can be manipulated by using various tools and techniques such as drugs, enzymes, genetic engineering, gene editing, cell signaling blockers, receptor agonists/antagonists, metabolic inhibitors, and metabolic activators. These tools can alter or regulate the activities of enzymes or proteins involved in the pathway, thus changing the pathway's overall function.
