The Enlightenment produced a parallel revolution in political thought. The Enlightenment was a movement that spread throughout Europe and North America in the 18th century, and it marked a major shift in the way people thought about politics, society, and the world around them. Enlightenment thinkers such as John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Montesquieu challenged traditional ideas about monarchy and the divine right of kings, and advocated for individual rights, democracy, and social contracts between citizens and their governments. Their ideas had a significant impact on the American and French Revolutions, and laid the groundwork for modern Western political thought.
