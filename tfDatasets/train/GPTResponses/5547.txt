There were numerous subjects of public criticism in the 80s, but one of the main ones was the economic policies of the Reagan administration, particularly regarding income inequality and the widening wealth gap. The exploding epidemic of the AIDS virus also garnered significant criticism due to the government's slow and inadequate response. There was also widespread criticism of the US involvement in Central America, particularly in Nicaragua and El Salvador, as well as the environmental policies of the government.
