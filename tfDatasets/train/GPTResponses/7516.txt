Communitarians tend to support decentralized and local forms of control, with an emphasis on collective decision-making and participation in community governance. They are generally skeptical of centralized authority and the concentration of power in the hands of large corporations or government institutions. Communitarians believe that individuals are best served through strong, vibrant communities that are able to shape their own destiny and address local needs and concerns. This can be achieved through diverse forms of representation, including community assemblies, neighborhood councils, and other grassroots organizations that foster ongoing engagement and participation among citizens.
