Many other Catholics and Christians considered Paul VI reforms to be controversial and divisive. Some conservative Catholics and Christians felt that the reforms went too far and undermined traditional teachings and practices. They criticized the changes to the liturgy, such as the use of the vernacular language and the removal of certain prayers and rituals. On the other hand, some liberal Catholics and Christians felt that the reforms did not go far enough and failed to address important issues such as women's roles in the Church and the use of birth control. Overall, the reforms sparked heated debates and continue to be a topic of discussion among Catholics and Christians.
