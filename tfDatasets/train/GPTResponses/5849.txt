Desfile de las Llamadas, also known as the Parade of the Calls, is a traditional carnival parade in Uruguay, specifically in the city of Montevideo. The parade features African drumming groups, known as "comparsas," which originated in the Barrio Sur neighborhoods in Montevideo. The parade takes place during the first two Saturdays of February and is considered a celebration and recognition of Afro-Uruguayan culture.
