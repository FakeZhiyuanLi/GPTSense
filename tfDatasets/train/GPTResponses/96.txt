Maududi considered Islam to be a complete way of life that encompasses all aspects of human existence, including social, political, economic, and spiritual realms. His books placed Islam at the center of human existence and emphasized the need for Muslims to actively engage in society and strive for the establishment of an Islamic state. Maududi rejected secularism and advocated for the implementation of Islamic law (Sharia) as the basis of governance. He also believed in the duty of Muslims to spread Islam throughout the world.
