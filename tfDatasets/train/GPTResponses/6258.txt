The protobacterium that is known to bioremediate ground water uranium is Desulfovibrio vulgaris. It is a sulfate-reducing bacteria that can convert uranium into a less toxic form, thus reducing its concentration in ground water. This bacterium can also help in the remediation of other toxic metals such as chromium and lead.
