There are several products that were manufactured in Valencia and helped improve the economy:1. Citrus fruits: Oranges, lemons, and other citrus fruits have been grown in Valencia for centuries. The region's warm climate and fertile soil have made it a prime location for citrus fruit production. The export of Valencia oranges was particularly important in boosting the economy in the 19th and early 20th centuries.2. Silk: In the Middle Ages, Valencia was a major center for silk production. The industry declined in the 18th and 19th centuries, but it was revived in the late 19th century when new technology made it easier to produce silk.3. Textiles: Valencia has a long history of textile production, including the manufacture of cotton, linen, and wool. The textile industry boomed in the 19th century, thanks to the introduction of steam-powered machinery.4. Ceramics: Valencia has been a center for ceramics production since Roman times. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the city's famous ceramics industry underwent a major expansion, with large factories producing decorative tiles and other pieces.All of these industries helped to create jobs and generate wealth for the region, contributing to the overall improvement of the Valencian economy.
