Asita is a figure in Buddhist tradition who predicted that Prince Siddhartha (who later became known as Gautama Buddha) would either become a great king or a great religious leader, depending on whether he encountered four specific signs outside of the palace walls: old age, sickness, death, and a wandering holy man. Siddhartha encountered all four signs, leading him to renounce his life as a prince and become a wandering ascetic, eventually attaining enlightenment and founding Buddhism.
