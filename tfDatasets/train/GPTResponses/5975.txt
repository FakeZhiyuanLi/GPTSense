The student-teacher ratio in secondary schools can vary depending on the country and region, as well as the specific school district and school. In the United States, for example, the average student-teacher ratio in public secondary schools was 16.0 to 1 in the 2017-2018 academic year, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. However, some schools may have ratios as low as 10 to 1 or even as high as 30 to 1. It is important to note that the student-teacher ratio is not the only factor that impacts educational outcomes, and other factors such as class size, teacher qualifications, and school resources can also play a significant role.
