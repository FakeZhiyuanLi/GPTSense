Civilizations in the Yangtze region can be dated back as early as 5000 BCE, during the Neolithic period, with the emergence of early farming communities such as the Hemudu culture. More advanced cities and empires, such as the Shang Dynasty (1600-1046 BCE) and the Wu Kingdom (222-280 CE), also flourished in the Yangtze region.
