Binary fission occurs much faster than cell division in eukaryotes. In bacteria, the whole process of binary fission can take as little as 20 minutes, while in eukaryotes cell division can take several hours or even days. This is because bacteria have a simpler cell structure and fewer processes to go through during division compared to eukaryotic cells.
