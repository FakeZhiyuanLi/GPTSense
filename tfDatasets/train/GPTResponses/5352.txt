Protestants describe Mary as devoted to God. However, they do not give her the same level of honor and veneration as Catholics because they believe that only God should be worshiped and that Mary is a human being who has been exalted by God as an example to follow. Protestants see Mary as a faithful servant of God who played a crucial role in the incarnation of Jesus but do not believe in the Catholic teachings on Mary's immaculate conception, perpetual virginity, and assumption into heaven.
