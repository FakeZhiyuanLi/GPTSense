Slavery existed in the Middle East for centuries and was mainly facilitated through the Arab slave trade. African slaves were obtained through the trans-Saharan trade routes and were transported to the Middle East, where they were primarily used as domestic servants, soldiers, and concubines. Additionally, the Ottoman Empire traded in slaves from Eastern Europe and the Caucasus region. European colonial powers such as Portugal and Spain also engaged in the slave trade in the Middle East in the 16th and 17th centuries.
