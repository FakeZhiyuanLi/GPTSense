The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is published by the government agency in charge of collecting economic data in each country. In the United States, it is published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which is part of the U.S. Department of Labor. In other countries, it may be published by a similar government agency or a central bank.
