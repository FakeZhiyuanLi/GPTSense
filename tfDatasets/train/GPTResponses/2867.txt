One common advantage of miniscule (small) handwriting over majuscule (large) handwriting is that it takes up less space on a page, allowing for more words to be written in a given area. This can be particularly useful in situations where space is limited, such as when taking notes in a small notebook or on a post-it note. Additionally, small handwriting may be easier to read when writing in cursive, as the letters can flow more easily and be written closer together, making it easier to distinguish individual letters.
