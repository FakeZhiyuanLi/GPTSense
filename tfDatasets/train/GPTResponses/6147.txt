The county where glass with uranium oxide content was found cannot be determined as it is not specified in the question. Uranium oxide has been used in glass production for various purposes such as to create an amber or green color tint. However, the presence of uranium oxide in glass may pose a health risk if the glass is not properly contained or disposed of due to the potential release of radioactive particles.
