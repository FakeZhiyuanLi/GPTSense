In the case of Katz v. United States (1967), the Supreme Court ruled that evidence obtained by the FBI via wiretapping was inadmissible in court because it violated the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. The Court held that individuals have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their conversations, even when conducted in a public phone booth, and that wiretapping constitutes an illegal search and seizure without a warrant. This landmark decision led to the development of strict guidelines for law enforcement agencies when conducting electronic surveillance.
