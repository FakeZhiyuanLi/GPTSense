The requirement that a receipt for expenditures of all public money must be published is dictated by transparency and accountability principles in government. It is important to ensure that public funds are being used appropriately and efficiently, and publishing receipts is a way to demonstrate this to the public. Additionally, it allows citizens to review and scrutinize government spending, and provides a mechanism for identifying and addressing issues of waste, fraud, and abuse. This requirement may be mandated by laws or regulations at the national or local level.
