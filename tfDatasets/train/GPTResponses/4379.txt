Cask ales are typically stored in cellars at a temperature of around 11-13째C (51-55째F) before being tapped. This temperature is ideal for conditioning the beer and allowing it to develop its flavors and aromas. Once the cask ale is tapped, it is usually served at around 12-14째C (54-57째F) to allow for the full range of flavors and aromas to be enjoyed.
