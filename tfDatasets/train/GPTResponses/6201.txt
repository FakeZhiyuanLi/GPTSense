There is no city that directly "profited" from Seattle's maritime strike. The strike, which occurred in 1934 and lasted for several months, was a labor dispute between dock workers and their employers. The goal of the strike was to secure better working conditions and higher wages for the workers. While the strike ultimately led to some gains for the workers, it also caused significant economic disruption and hardship for the city of Seattle and the wider region. The strike resulted in the shutdown of the city's ports, which had a negative impact on local businesses and industries that relied on maritime trade.
