is known as "reactive" measures. This means that law enforcement agencies and security companies primarily focus on responding to cyber attacks after they have already occurred, rather than proactively preventing them in the first place. While reactive measures such as incident response and forensic analysis are important tools for combating cyber crime, they are insufficient on their own.To truly eradicate cyber crime, there needs to be a shift towards more proactive and preventative measures. This includes investing in cybersecurity education and awareness, implementing stronger security protocols and access controls, and conducting regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing. Additionally, law enforcement agencies must work more closely with the private sector to create a shared understanding of cyber threats and how to prevent them.Ultimately, the key to eradicating cyber crime is to treat it as a collective responsibility rather than something that can be solved by an individual or organization in isolation. It requires a collaborative effort between governments, businesses, and individuals to take proactive steps to strengthen cybersecurity and prevent cyber attacks before they can even occur.
