A common rule about referees is that they are responsible for enforcing the rules and ensuring fair play during a game or competition. They are also required to remain impartial and make objective decisions based on what they see on the field or court. Referees must have a thorough knowledge of the rules of the game and be able to identify when players are breaking the rules or engaging in unsportsmanlike behavior.
