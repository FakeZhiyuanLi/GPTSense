is known as the "innovation index". This index measures the amount of new and innovative products, technologies, and services that are being created in a given year. When GDP declines, businesses have less money to invest in research and development, which in turn leads to fewer innovations being produced. This can have long-term effects on productivity and economic growth, as innovation is one of the key drivers of progress and competitiveness in modern economies.
