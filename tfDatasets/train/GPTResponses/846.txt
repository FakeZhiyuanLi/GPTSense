The third of the Four Noble Truths in Buddhism is called Nirodha, which means "cessation" or "extinction." This truth explains that there is an end to suffering, and it can be attained by eliminating the root cause of suffering, which is craving or attachment.The cessation of suffering is achieved by following the Noble Eightfold Path, which includes ethical conduct, mental discipline, and insight into the nature of reality. As one cultivates these qualities, they gradually let go of craving and attachment, and experience a sense of peace and freedom from suffering.The third Noble Truth emphasizes that the end of suffering is not just a temporary state of relief but a permanent and lasting change in one's experience of life. It is a state of enlightenment, characterized by wisdom, compassion, and clarity of mind.
