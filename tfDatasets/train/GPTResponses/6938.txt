Darwin introduced the concept of evolution through natural selection, which challenged traditional classification systems based on fixed characteristics. His theory proposed that species were not static and unchanging, but instead underwent gradual changes over time due to environmental pressures and genetic variation. This concept created a need for more accurate and dynamic classification systems that reflected the evolutionary relationships between species. Darwin's work also encouraged the use of molecular and genetic data in classification, which has become a common practice in modern taxonomy.
