The beginning of psychology was classified as a subfield of philosophy. Philosophers such as Descartes, Locke, and Kant explored questions related to the mind, consciousness, perception, and reasoning, which laid the foundation for the development of psychology as a scientific discipline. The first psychology laboratory was established by Wilhelm Wundt in 1879 in Leipzig, Germany, marking the beginning of psychology as an experimental and empirical science.
