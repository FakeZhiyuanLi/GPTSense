The Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has been quoted as saying: "The Zionist regime [Israel] will vanish from the pages of history." However, Iranian officials have clarified that this statement was not a call for Israel's destruction or annihilation, but rather a prediction of Israel's eventual demise due to what they see as its own illegitimacy and problematic policies.
