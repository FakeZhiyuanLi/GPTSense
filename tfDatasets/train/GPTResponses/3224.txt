Under US law, any treaty provision that conflicts with the US Constitution is considered to be void and unenforceable. This is based on the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, which establishes the Constitution as the supreme law of the land. Therefore, any treaty provision that violates the Constitution would be in conflict with this principle and would not be legally binding within the United States.
