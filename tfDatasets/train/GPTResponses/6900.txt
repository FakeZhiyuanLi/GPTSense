The term "cell" was coined by English physicist and microbiologist Robert Hooke in 1665. He used the term to describe the small, box-like structures he observed when examining a thin slice of cork with a microscope. The appearance of the structure reminded him of the small rooms, or cells, occupied by monks in a monastery.
