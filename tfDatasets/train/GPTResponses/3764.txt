In the Catholic Church, there is no substitute for wine during the consecration. However, in cases where a person cannot consume alcohol due to health reasons or being an alcoholic, they can receive the consecrated bread (host) only, which is still considered the full communion. In extreme cases, such as allergies or medical conditions where even a small amount of wine could be harmful, a priest could use mustum, which is grape juice that has begun to ferment but has an alcohol content of less than 0.5%, and is still considered valid matter for consecration. However, approval from the local bishop is required before using mustum.
