Training and positive reinforcement techniques have become increasingly important in ensuring that dogs do not exhibit unwanted behavior. It is important to establish clear boundaries and consistently enforce them in a kind and patient manner. Regular exercise and mental stimulation can also help reduce unwanted behaviors such as jumping. Many pet owners also turn to professional trainers or behaviorists to help address specific issues. Additionally, using tools such as leashes, fences, or other physical barriers can be effective in preventing dogs from engaging in unwanted behaviors.
