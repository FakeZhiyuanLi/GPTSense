West Antarctica most closely resembles the Andes mountain range in South America, as they are both geologically similar, consisting largely of volcanic and sedimentary rocks that have been folded and faulted by tectonic activity. Additionally, West Antarctica and the Andes share a similar geographic history, including the formation of a subduction zone that gave rise to the volcanism and mountain building that characterizes both regions.
