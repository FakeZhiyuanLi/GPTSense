The German Jewish Reform movement began in the early 19th century, with the establishment of the first Reform congregation in Hamburg in 1818. This movement sought to modernize Jewish beliefs and practices, adapting them to the changing world and society of the time. The movement emphasized the importance of reason and individual autonomy, and sought to achieve greater inclusivity and gender equality within Jewish communities.
