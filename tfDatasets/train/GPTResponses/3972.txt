called the frequency ratio. In Western music, the most common frequency ratio is 2:1, known as an octave, which is the doubling of frequency between two pitches. Other common frequency ratios include 3:2 (a perfect fifth), 4:3 (a perfect fourth), and 5:4 (a major third). These ratios help dictate the intervals and harmonies present in music.
