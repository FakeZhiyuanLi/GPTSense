Smoking bans are in place to protect the health and wellbeing of people in public spaces, workplaces, and other areas where individuals may be exposed to secondhand smoke. Secondhand smoke contains various chemicals and toxins that can cause cancer, lung disease, and other health problems. Additionally, smoking bans can help to reduce the risk of fires and promote a cleaner environment by reducing cigarette litter.
