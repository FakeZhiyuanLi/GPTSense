Darwin used various examples and evidence to illustrate the way that original species change and adapt into new ones through the process of natural selection. Some of these examples include the variation of finches on the Galapagos Islands, the evolution of moths in industrialized areas, and fossil records of transitional species. He also studied the way that humans selectively breed animals and plants to create new species, a process known as artificial selection. Ultimately, Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection was based on a synthesis of all these pieces of evidence.
