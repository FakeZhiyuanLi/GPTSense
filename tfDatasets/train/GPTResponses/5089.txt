A standardized ecosystem is formed through a process of standardization, which involves the creation and adoption of standards for various components of the ecosystem. These standards can include technical standards for data formats, protocols and interfaces, as well as business standards for processes and workflows.The process of standardization typically involves collaboration among stakeholders such as technology providers, industry associations, regulatory bodies, and end-users. Standards are developed and refined through a process of consensus-building, which involves formal reviews, comments, and revisions.Once standards are in place, they are generally adopted by industry actors and incorporated into products and services. This creates a network of interoperable components that can be combined and configured in various ways to support a range of use cases and workflows. Over time, the ecosystem may evolve as new technologies and standards are developed, but the underlying standards often remain in place, providing a stable foundation for innovation and growth.
