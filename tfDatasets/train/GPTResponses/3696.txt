Companies that may engage in only a few types of communications include small or local businesses, specialized niche companies, or companies that have limited resources for marketing and advertising. For example, a small bakery may only communicate through social media and word-of-mouth referrals, while a company that produces a specific type of software may only communicate through industry events and targeted email campaigns.
