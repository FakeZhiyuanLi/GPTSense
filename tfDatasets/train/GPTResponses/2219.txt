In a democratic society, the legislative power is held by the parliament, which is composed of elected representatives of the people. In some countries, the legislative power may also be divided into two branches, such as the Senate and the House of Representatives in the United States. However, the ultimate power still lies with the people, who have the right to vote and elect their representatives to make laws on their behalf.
