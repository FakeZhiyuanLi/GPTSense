The S roads are a classification of roads in some countries, primarily in Africa, that connect district capitals to regional capitals. They are often secondary roads that are less developed than primary highways or national roads, but they play an important role in connecting smaller communities to larger urban centers. The letter "S" typically stands for "secondary" or "subordinate" in this context. Some examples of S roads include S1 in Tanzania, S3 in Ghana, and S4 in Kenya.
