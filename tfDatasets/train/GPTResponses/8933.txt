The dense population can make several things difficult, including:1. Access to resources: When too many people live in a particular area, it can put a strain on resources such as water, food, and energy. This can lead to scarcity and increase competition for resources.2. Traffic congestion: With more people living in an area, there will be more vehicles on the road, leading to traffic congestion and longer travel times.3. Housing availability and affordability: Dense populations often lead to housing shortages and higher prices, making it difficult for many to afford a place to live.4. Pollution: With more people living in an area, there will be more waste production, vehicle emissions, and other pollutants that negatively impact the environment and public health.5. Social problems: Crime, overcrowding, and social isolation can become more common in densely populated areas, making it difficult for individuals and communities to thrive.
