The theory of plant hormones was first introduced in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The term "hormone" was first used in the context of plants by Th. W. Engelmann in 1905 to describe a substance that stimulated stem elongation in the coleoptile of oat seedlings. In 1926, Frits Warmolt Went proposed the known concept of auxin, which became the first identified plant hormone. Other plant hormones such as cytokinins, gibberellins, and abscisic acid were discovered over the next several decades.
