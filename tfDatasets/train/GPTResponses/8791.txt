Tsetse flies hinder livestock development as they transmit African trypanosomiasis (also known as sleeping sickness) which can be fatal to cattle, sheep, pigs, goats, and other domestic animals. The disease also affects humans and can cause serious health problems. Tsetse flies are found mainly in sub-Saharan Africa and have a significant impact on livestock production in affected areas.
