Oklahoma receives hot dry air from a variety of sources. One is from the desert Southwest, including areas such as Arizona and New Mexico. This air mass can travel eastward and reach Oklahoma during the summer months. Another source is the Gulf of Mexico. As warm and moist air rises over the Gulf, it can be drawn northward into Oklahoma, especially during the spring and early summer. Additionally, high pressure systems in the central United States can also bring in hot and dry air from the west or southwest, impacting Oklahoma's weather patterns.
