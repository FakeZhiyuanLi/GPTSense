The two mechanisms for email transmission are:1. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) - SMTP is the standard protocol used for sending emails over the internet. It is responsible for transferring emails from one server to another until it reaches its final destination. SMTP operates on port 25 of the server and uses a variety of commands and responses to communicate with other mail servers.2. Post Office Protocol (POP) or Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) - POP and IMAP are used for receiving emails. They are responsible for retrieving emails from the mail server and delivering them to the email client. POP and IMAP are both used to access the same mailbox, but they work in different ways. POP downloads email messages to the user's computer and deletes them from the server, while IMAP leaves the messages on the server and synchronizes them with the email client.
