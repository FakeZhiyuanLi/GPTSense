There are several factors that may have contributed to the marked downturn in the production of quail eggs following the industry boom:1. Oversupply: During the boom, many farmers got into the quail egg production business. As a result, there was a glut in the market, leading to oversupply and lower prices. This made it less profitable for farmers to continue producing quail eggs.2. Disease outbreaks: Disease outbreaks can have a significant impact on quail egg production. For example, avian influenza can cause a drop in egg production and increase mortality rates among the quails. This could have contributed to the downturn in production.3. Lack of demand: If consumers are not interested in buying quail eggs, it can lead to a drop in production. Even if the supply is high, if there is no demand, farmers have no incentive to continue producing quail eggs.4. Higher production costs: The cost of producing quail eggs may have increased during the boom, as more farmers entered the market and competition for resources such as feed, labor, and equipment intensified. This could have made it less profitable for some farmers to continue producing quail eggs.Overall, it is likely that a combination of these factors contributed to the downturn in the production of quail eggs following the industry boom.
