One example of a regulatory region of a gene that does not have to be close to the coding sequence is an enhancer element. Enhancers are regulatory segments of DNA that can be located far away from the gene they control, sometimes even thousands of base pairs away. They work by binding to transcription factors and other regulatory proteins, which then interact with the basal transcription machinery near the promoter of the target gene. Enhancers can activate or repress gene expression depending on the presence or absence of specific signaling molecules or external stimuli. Due to their long-range effects and complex interactions, enhancers play a critical role in regulating developmental pathways, tissue-specific gene expression, and disease-related gene networks.
