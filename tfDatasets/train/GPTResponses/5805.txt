The concept used to determine relations between grand lodges is called recognition. Recognition is the formal acknowledgement by one sovereign grand lodge of the existence and legitimacy of another sovereign grand lodge. It establishes the basis for fraternal relations between the two grand lodges, including the ability for members to visit and work with one another. Recognition is typically based on shared values, practices, and beliefs, and is subject to strict criteria and protocols established by each grand lodge.
