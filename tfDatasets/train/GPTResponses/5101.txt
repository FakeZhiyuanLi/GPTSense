The type of science that is firmly fixated on the visible world is called empirical science. This type of science relies on observation, measurement, and experimentation to acquire knowledge about the natural world. It is concerned with understanding the physical, observable phenomena around us and aims to describe and explain them in a testable and repeatable way. Examples of empirical sciences include physics, chemistry, and biology.
