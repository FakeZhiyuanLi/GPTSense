Water birds tend to avoid flying over large bodies of open water during migration, as it poses a significant risk to their survival. They also avoid areas with high levels of human disturbance, such as densely populated cities, industrial areas, and agricultural lands where pesticides may be present. Additionally, they tend to avoid areas with unfavorable weather conditions, such as strong winds or storms. Lastly, they also avoid areas with limited food resources, such as arid or desert regions.
