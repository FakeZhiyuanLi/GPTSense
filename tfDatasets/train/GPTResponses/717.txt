This statement is incomplete and unclear. The third noble truth in Buddhism is "the cessation of suffering" or "the end of craving." It refers to the idea that it is possible to achieve a state where all suffering and unsatisfactoriness in life come to an end. This state is known as Nirvana, and it is attained through the elimination of all forms of craving and attachment. Therefore, the complete cessation of suffering is possible, and it can be achieved through the eightfold path, which is the fourth noble truth.
