The Sangha or the community of Buddhist monks and nuns provides refuge by preserving the authentic teachings of the Buddha. The Sangha is responsible for safeguarding and passing down the teachings of Buddha through generations. They do this by practicing the Buddha's teachings and passing on their knowledge to their disciples. They maintain the purity of the teachings, protect them from corruption, and ensure that they remain relevant in changing times. The Sangha serves as a source of inspiration and guidance for all those who seek refuge in the Buddha's teachings.
