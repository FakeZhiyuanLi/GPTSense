Roland Barthes believed that a wrestler gives the audience a spectacle of excess and passion, a theatrical performance that embodies the collective myths and archetypes of a society. He saw it as a form of mythology that revealed the deeper cultural values and desires of the audience. The wrestler's exaggerated movements, costumes, and personas offered a window into the unconscious desires and fears of the viewers who projected their own struggles and aspirations onto the stage. In this way, Barthes argued that wrestling was not just a sport or entertainment, but a symbolic language that spoke to the innermost emotions and beliefs of its spectators.
