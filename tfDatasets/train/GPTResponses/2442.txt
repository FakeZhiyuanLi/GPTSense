The directionality of DNA strands is caused by the orientation of the sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA molecule. The sugar and phosphate groups in the backbone alternate and are connected by phosphodiester bonds, forming a 5' to 3' directionality. The 5' end of the DNA strand has a phosphate group attached to the 5' carbon of the sugar molecule, while the 3' end has a hydroxyl (-OH) group attached to the 3' carbon of the sugar molecule. This polarity of the DNA strand determines the direction of DNA replication, transcription, and translation.
