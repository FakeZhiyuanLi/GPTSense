In Pakistan, the admission to a diploma program is generally based on the results of a student's Intermediate examination. Intermediate is a two-year post-secondary school education program that is equivalent to 12th grade in other countries. The results of the Intermediate examination, usually taken in the 12th grade, are used to determine a student's eligibility for admission to a diploma program in Pakistan. However, different diploma programs may have their own specific admission requirements and criteria.
