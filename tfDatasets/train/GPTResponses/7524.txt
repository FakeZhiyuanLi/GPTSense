1. Diameter: A larger diameter shaft typically has greater torque resistance than a smaller diameter shaft.2. Material: The type and strength of the material used to make the shaft can affect its torque resistance. Stronger materials generally offer greater resistance to torque.3. Length: Generally, the longer the shaft, the greater the torque resistance. However, there is a limit to this, beyond which the shaft may become too flexible, reducing its resistance to torque.4. Shape: The shape of the shaft can also affect its torque resistance. Different shapes are better suited for different types of torques.5. Surface finish: A smooth surface finish reduces friction, which can increase torque resistance.6. Temperature: The temperature at which the shaft operates can also affect its torque resistance. Higher temperatures can cause materials to expand, reducing the shaft's ability to resist torque.7. Lubrication: Proper lubrication can reduce friction and increase torque resistance.8. Torque load: The amount of torque that the shaft is expected to handle will also determine its torque resistance. Larger torque loads require larger and stronger shafts.
