There are multiple processes that contributed to the expansion and fragility of the financial system, but some of the primary factors include:1. Deregulation: The financial industry was deregulated in the 1980s and 1990s, which allowed for the creation of new financial products and trading practices that were more complex and risky than before. This led to an increase in the size and complexity of the financial sector, as well as less oversight and regulation.2. Financial innovation: Financial innovations such as securitization, derivatives, and structured finance products allowed for the bundling of assets and the creation of new financial instruments that were designed to maximize returns, but were inherently more complex and opaque than traditional banking products.3. Globalization: The increasing interconnectedness of financial markets across the world allowed for greater capital flows and investment opportunities. However, it also meant that problems in one part of the financial system could quickly spread to other parts.4. Low interest rates: Low interest rates in the aftermath of the dot-com bubble and the 9/11 attacks led investors to look for higher returns in riskier assets. This fueled a housing and credit bubble that eventually burst in 2008.Overall, these processes led to an unprecedented expansion of the financial system, but also made it much more complex and fragile. When problems arose in one part of the system, they could quickly spread to other parts, leading to a systemic crisis that threatened the stability of the entire system.
