are known as interpreters. These interpreters read the code line by line and convert it into machine language or bytecode that can be executed by the computer's processor. This process takes place while the program is running, which is why it is referred to as runtime translation or interpretation. Some programming languages, such as Java, use a combination of compilation and interpretation, where the code is compiled into bytecode at compile time and interpreted at runtime.
