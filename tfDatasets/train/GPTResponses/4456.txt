There is no one foreign organization that can be identified as encouraging Villa's guerilla war against the US. However, Villa did receive support from some foreign powers during his campaign, including Germany, which saw Villa as a means to distract the US from the war in Europe. Japan also reportedly aided Villa's cause by providing arms and ammunition.
