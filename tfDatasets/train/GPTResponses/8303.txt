A finite composition of two symmetries or their inverses is a sequence of two or more symmetries or their inverses applied in succession to an object or shape, resulting in a final image that is the result of their combined effects. For example, if we have a square and apply a reflection across the diagonal and then a 90-degree rotation, we get a different image than if we had applied the rotation first and then the reflection. These compositions can result in a wide range of transformations, including translations, rotations, reflections, and combinations thereof.
