There are several judicial bodies that may be called upon to resolve disputes pertaining to the interpretation of treaties, including:1. International Court of Justice (ICJ): The ICJ is the principal judicial body of the United Nations and adjudicates disputes between states concerning the interpretation, application, or violation of international treaties.2. Arbitral tribunals: These are courts that are established specifically to resolve disputes arising from international treaties. Arbitration is a consensual process whereby the disputing parties select a neutral arbitrator to resolve the dispute.3. Dispute settlement bodies of regional organizations: Regional organizations such as the European Union, North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the African Union have dispute settlement bodies that are available to resolve disputes arising from regional treaties.4. Ad hoc tribunals: These are tribunals established to resolve specific disputes arising from certain treaties. For example, the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal was established to resolve disputes between the two countries arising from the Algiers Accords.5. National courts: If a treaty has been incorporated into domestic law, disputes may be resolved by national courts. However, not all treaties are directly enforceable in national courts, and some require implementing legislation to be passed to make them enforceable.
