A mixed tag team consists of a team of two professional wrestlers (one male and one female) who compete against another mixed tag team. The male wrestlers can only wrestle with the other male wrestler, and the female wrestlers can only wrestle with the other female wrestler. Therefore, a mixed tag team match will feature a male wrestler and a female wrestler teaming up against another male wrestler and a female wrestler.
