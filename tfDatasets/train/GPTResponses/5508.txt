The Greco-Macedonian elites remained committed to the Greek culture. They regarded themselves as descendants of the ancient Greeks and saw their culture, language, and traditions as superior to those of the conquered peoples. They continued to promote Greek language, literature, art, philosophy, and religion in the areas they ruled, even after the arrival of the Romans. This cultural imperialism had a significant impact on the civilizations that came under their influence and played a significant role in shaping the Western world.
