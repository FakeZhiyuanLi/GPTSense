When Royal Assent takes place in the UK, the Sovereign does not typically make a public appearance. Instead, the Royal Assent is given by a Lord Commissioner or sometimes by the Speaker of the House of Commons. The monarch's approval is given in writing and recorded in the Journal of Proceedings of each House.
