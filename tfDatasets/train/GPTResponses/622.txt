Condensed study texts were created in the Buddhist tradition. One example is the Prajnaparamita texts, which are condensed versions of the larger Mahayana Buddhist sutras. These texts are considered to contain the essence of Buddhist wisdom and are very important in both Buddhist philosophy and practice. Another example is the Dhammapada, a condensed version of the Buddhaâ€™s teachings that is widely read and studied by Buddhist practitioners.
