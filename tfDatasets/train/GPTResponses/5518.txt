It depends on the location and mythology. In Greek mythology, Aphrodite was associated with several gods, including Ares, Hephaestus, Dionysus, Adonis, and Hermes. In Roman mythology, she was associated with Venus and was often paired with Mars. In other mythologies, such as those found in Egypt and the Near East, there were similar goddesses of love and fertility who were associated with their own gods.
