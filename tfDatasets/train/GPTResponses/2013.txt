humans perceive as color using a process called YUV to RGB conversion. This converts the YUV color space, which separates the color information (U and V) from the brightness information (Y), into the RGB color space, which represents colors as combinations of red, green, and blue values. This process is necessary because computer monitors and cameras use RGB color space, while YUV color space is used for broadcasting and transmission purposes.
