One of Albert the Great's biggest contributions during the medieval period was his integration of Aristotelianism into Christian theology. He studied and wrote extensively on Aristotle's works, and saw the potential for their compatibility with Christian beliefs. He also emphasized the importance of empirical observation and experimentation in scientific inquiry, laying the foundation for the scientific method that would later be developed during the Renaissance.
