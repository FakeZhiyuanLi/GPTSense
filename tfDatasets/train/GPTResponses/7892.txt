The legislative branch of Bermuda is modeled after the Westminster system of parliamentary democracy used in the United Kingdom. It consists of a bicameral Parliament with a House of Assembly and a Senate. The Speaker of the House of Assembly, who is elected by the members, presides over the proceedings. The Bermuda constitution also allows for a Governor appointed by the monarch of the United Kingdom to act as a ceremonial figurehead and to perform certain administrative duties.
