The family history of African Americans in the US has its roots in the transatlantic slave trade, which brought millions of Africans to the Americas as slaves from the 16th to the 19th centuries. Many African American families have limited knowledge of their ancestors beyond a certain point due to the destruction and loss of many historical documents during the period of slavery and its aftermath. Some families have been able to trace their lineage back to specific African countries, but for others, their origins remain unknown. The family histories of African Americans have been shaped by a long and complex history of slavery, segregation, and discrimination, as well as resilience, resistance, and perseverance in the face of adversity.
