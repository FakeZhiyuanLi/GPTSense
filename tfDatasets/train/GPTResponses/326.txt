Kanye West criticized the overabundance of themes centered around materialism, misogyny, and violence in early hip-hop culture. He believed that these themes were limiting and damaging to the culture and society as a whole. Instead, he focused on more personal and introspective themes in his music, such as identity, love, and spirituality.
