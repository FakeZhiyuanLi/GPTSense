One possible more permissive rule could be the adoption of a "substantial compliance" standard, whereby states are considered to be in compliance with a treaty as long as they make a good faith effort to implement its provisions, rather than requiring strict adherence to every detail of the treaty. This would make it easier for states with varying levels of resources and capabilities to participate in and benefit from the treaty regime, while still maintaining overall compliance with its objectives. Additionally, providing technical assistance and capacity-building programs to help states meet treaty obligations could also encourage greater participation and compliance.
