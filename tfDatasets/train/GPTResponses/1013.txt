The variation that soon developed among the scholars and the men of the cloth and their associates was in their approach and interpretation of religious teachings and practices. While some scholars were more liberal and open-minded, advocating for reformation and changes in traditional practices, the men of the cloth and their associates held a conservative view, emphasizing the importance of adhering to orthodoxy and established traditions. This led to tensions and disagreements between the two groups, with some scholars being persecuted for their beliefs and ideas.
