Nelson Mandela is one example of a leader who succeeded in liberating territory despite conflicts. Mandela fought against and ultimately overthrew the apartheid regime in South Africa, which had oppressed the black population for decades. Despite being imprisoned for 27 years, Mandela continued to advocate for peaceful resistance and negotiations with the government until his release in 1990. He then went on to become the first black president of South Africa in 1994, and his leadership helped inspire reconciliation and healing in a deeply divided country.
