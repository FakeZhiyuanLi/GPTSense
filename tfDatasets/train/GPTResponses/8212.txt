There are some individuals and groups who argue that artificially raising minority students into schools has a negative effect on them. Some conservative politicians, academics, and activists have said that affirmative action policies and other efforts to increase diversity in schools result in minority students being placed in schools where they are not academically prepared to succeed. They argue that this can lead to feelings of isolation, low self-esteem, and poor academic performance. However, many scholars and experts have disputed this argument, pointing to research showing that diversity in schools can benefit both minority and non-minority students, and that affirmative action policies can lead to greater equality of opportunity.
