an experienced bird on its migration?A young bird on its first migration is likely to have less knowledge of the migration route, may be weaker and less capable of handling the challenges of the journey, and may be more vulnerable to dangers such as predators, storms, and lack of food and water. In contrast, an experienced bird on its migration is likely to have a better sense of the migration route, may have built up physical stamina and endurance through previous journeys, and may be better at avoiding dangers and finding food and water along the route.
