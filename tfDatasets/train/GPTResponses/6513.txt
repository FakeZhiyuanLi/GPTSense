The former Archbishop of Canterbury who expressed reservations about the Freemasons is Dr. Rowan Williams. In 2013, he described the Masonic movement as "tempting" but cautioned against joining it, citing concerns about secrecy and elitism. He stated that the Freemasons were not an organization in which someone should feel comfortable holding high public office.
