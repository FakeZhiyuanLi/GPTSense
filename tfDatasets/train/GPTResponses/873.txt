they know, believe, and value. They examine how cultural beliefs, values, and experiences shape cognition and thought processes, including decision-making, problem-solving, and language use.

Ultimately, cognitive anthropologists aim to develop a more comprehensive understanding of human cognition and its relationship to cultural context.
