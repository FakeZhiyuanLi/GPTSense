Wood retains a small amount of moisture in its cell walls despite being air-dried. This is because wood is a very porous material and some moisture gets trapped in the pores of the wood structure. Additionally, wood contains natural chemicals and compounds, such as lignin and hemicellulose, which can also contribute to its retained moisture. Despite the retained moisture, air-dried wood is considered relatively dry and stable for use in furniture, construction, and other applications.
