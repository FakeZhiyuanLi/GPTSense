Russian carriers primarily use arrestor wires and barricades to recover aircraft on their flight decks. Some carriers, such as the Admiral Kuznetsov, also use a ski-jump ramp to assist aircraft in taking off. However, it is worth noting that the Admiral Kuznetsov is currently undergoing major repairs and upgrades, and it is uncertain whether it will return to service in its current form.
