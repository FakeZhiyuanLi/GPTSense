is known as the "Dominican Fourteen," a group of friars who lived in the early 14th century and were known for their intense pursuit of contemplative prayer and mystical experiences. The most famous of these friars was Meister Eckhart, a German Dominican who is considered one of the greatest Christian mystics of all time. Eckhart's teachings on the union of the soul with God and the need for detachment from worldly things continue to inspire contemplatives and spiritual seekers to this day. Other famous Dominican mystics include St. Catherine of Siena and St. John of the Cross.
