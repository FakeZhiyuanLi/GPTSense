Peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing became popular due to the large file sizes of MP3s. P2P networks allowed users to share music files directly with each other, without relying on a centralized server. This allowed for faster downloads and unlimited file sharing, making it easier for people to share and discover new music. Some popular P2P software that emerged during this time included Napster, Kazaa, Limewire, and BitTorrent.
