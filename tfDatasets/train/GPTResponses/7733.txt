Kidinnu's solar year can be found in use in ancient Babylonian astronomy and astrology. It was used to calculate the positions of celestial bodies and make predictions about their movements and influences on human affairs. Today, the Babylonian calendar system is no longer used, but its impact can be seen in modern astrology and astronomy.
