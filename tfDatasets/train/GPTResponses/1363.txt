There are four types of brain waves that are seen in mammalian sleep:1. Alpha waves - These are observed when an individual is in a state of relaxation or drowsiness, with eyes closed.2. Theta waves - These are observed in the initial stages of sleep, and are seen in the drowsy, light sleep stage.3. Delta waves - These are observed in the deeper stages of sleep, and are characteristic of slow-wave sleep (SWS).4. Rapid Eye Movement (REM) waves - These are observed during the REM stage of sleep, and are characterized by rapid eye movements, muscle paralysis, and vivid dreaming. During REM sleep, brain activity is high and resembles that of a waking state.
