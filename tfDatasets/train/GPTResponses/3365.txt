Music was transmitted orally before the invention of musical notation. Musicians would learn pieces by listening to them being played or sung by others and would then memorize and reproduce them. This was often done in a master-apprentice relationship, where a more experienced musician would teach a younger one. Certain musical styles and traditions were passed down through generations in this way. Another common method was through the use of mnemonic devices, such as using lyrics or rhymes to help remember melodies or rhythms. Some cultures also used graphical depictions or diagrams to represent musical ideas.
