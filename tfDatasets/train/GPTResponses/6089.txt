Colloquial language and expressions are found to a lesser extent in classical Sanskrit compared to other forms of Sanskrit such as Vedic or Medieval Sanskrit. Classical Sanskrit is characterized by its formal, structured, and literary style, which adheres to strict grammatical rules and conventions. This is because Classical Sanskrit was primarily used for religious, political, philosophical, and literary purposes, where a precise and refined form of expression was required.
