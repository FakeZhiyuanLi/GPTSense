1. The cyclic group - This group is commonly used in cyclic codes, which are a type of linear error-correcting code. The group has finite order, meaning that there is a finite number of distinct elements, and is represented by the standard notation C_n, where n is the number of elements in the group.2. The dihedral group - This group is used in several different types of linear error-correcting codes and has order 2n, where n is the number of elements in the group. The dihedral group is represented by the standard notation D_n.3. The binary symmetric group - This group is commonly used in the construction of binary linear codes. It has order 2^n, where n is the number of bits in the code, and is represented by B_n.4. The general linear group - This group is used in several different types of linear error-correcting codes and has an infinite order. It is represented by the standard notation GL_n(F), where n is the dimension of the code and F is the underlying field.5. The Reed-Muller group - This group is used in the construction of Reed-Muller codes, which are a class of binary linear codes. The group has order 2^(n choose m), where n is the number of bits in the code and m is the minimum distance of the code. It is represented by the standard notation RM(m, n).
