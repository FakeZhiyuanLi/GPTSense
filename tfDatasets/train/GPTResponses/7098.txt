The first significant change in Cubism occurred around 1912-1914, known as the Analytical Cubism period. During this time, the artists began to break down objects into smaller and more multiple perspectives, using a monochromatic color scheme and sometimes incorporating text or newspaper clippings into their work. This period marked the height of the movement's abstraction and was followed by the Synthetic Cubism period, where artists reintroduced more color and recognizable shapes into their artwork.
