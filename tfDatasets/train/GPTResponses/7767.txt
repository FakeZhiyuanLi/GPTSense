The sovereign grants assent by Royal Assent, which is given by the monarch in person or through a representative, usually the Lord Chancellor or the Speaker of the House of Commons, after a bill has been passed by both Houses of Parliament. The exact order in which this is done varies depending on the circumstances and traditions of the Royal Family, but it typically involves the monarch signing a document that confirms the bill has been passed and is now law.
