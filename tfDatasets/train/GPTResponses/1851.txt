Somalia has had connections to the Arab world for over a millennium, through trade, migration, and religious ties. In the 7th century, Arab traders and Islamic missionaries introduced Islam to the region, where it quickly gained popularity and became the dominant religion. Over time, Somali culture has been heavily influenced by Arab culture, including language, dress, and cuisine. The country has also been a member of the Arab League since 1974.
