If the pitch is not up to par, it could negatively impact the players' performance and lead to injuries. A rough or uneven pitch could cause players to trip or twist their ankles, and a poorly maintained pitch could also affect the ball's movement and overall playability. In addition, if the pitch does not meet official regulations or standards, it could result in disqualification, penalties, or fines for the team or venue.
