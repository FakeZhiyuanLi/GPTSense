Migrating birds usually follow established flyways or migration routes that take them between their breeding and wintering grounds. These flyways typically have favorable weather conditions, food sources, and stopover sites that birds use to rest and refuel during their long journeys. Some of the major flyways include the Pacific Flyway, Central Flyway, Mississippi Flyway, and Atlantic Flyway.
