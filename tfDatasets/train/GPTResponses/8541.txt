Charles Darwin gave several examples of how eyes evolved in different animal species in his book "On the Origin of Species." One such example is the evolution of the eye in mollusks, such as snails and squids. Darwin proposed that the first step in the evolution of the eye was the development of a simple light-sensitive patch of cells on the surface of the mollusk's body. Over time, this patch of cells became more complex and began to form a concave surface that could focus light onto a group of photoreceptor cells. This eventually led to the development of a lens and the ability to form images, which was advantageous for detecting potential predators and prey in the environment.
