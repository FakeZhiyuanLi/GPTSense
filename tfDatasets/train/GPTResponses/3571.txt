One notable chanson de geste is "The Song of Roland" (La Chanson de Roland), which is a medieval epic poem that depicts the Battle of Roncevaux Pass in 778 between Charlemagne's army and the rear guard of his own army, commanded by his nephew Roland. The poem celebrates the knightly virtues of loyalty, courage, and chivalry, and showcases the medieval ideal of honor and sacrifice.
