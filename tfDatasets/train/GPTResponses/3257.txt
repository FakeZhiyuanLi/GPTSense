There is no clear answer to this question as the Spanish explorers who visited the Marshall Islands in the 16th century did not leave any record of specific island names. However, it is possible that Ailuk or other nearby islands were referred to by Spanish explorers with general terms such as "Islas de los Pintados" (Islands of the Painted Ones) or "Islas de los Ladrones" (Islands of Thieves).
