Bottle conditioned beers contain live yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle, which allows for a secondary fermentation process to take place. This gives the beer natural carbonation and can also create unique flavors and aromas. Most mass-produced beers use filtered or pasteurized processes that remove the yeast sediment and do not undergo a secondary fermentation process.
