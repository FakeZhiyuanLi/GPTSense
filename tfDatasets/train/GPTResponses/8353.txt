Racial preferences are most highlighted in the United States in the realm of education, specifically in college admissions and scholarship programs. Affirmative action policies, which aim to address past discrimination and increase diversity, consider race as a factor in college admissions and in awarding certain scholarships. This has been a controversial issue, with some arguing that it promotes fairness and opportunities and others claiming it is a form of discrimination against non-minority groups. Other areas where racial preferences can be found include employment, housing, and healthcare.
