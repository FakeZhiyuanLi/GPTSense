The Ahl al-Bayt, also known as the "People of the House," are members of the family of the Prophet Muhammad. They include his daughter Fatima, her husband Ali ibn Abi Talib (who was also the Prophet's cousin and closest companion), their two sons Hasan and Husayn, and their descendants. In Shia Islam, the Ahl al-Bayt are considered to be the rightful successors to the Prophet and revered as spiritual and moral authorities.
