An axon can connect to multiple other cells, but the number varies depending on the specific neuron and its function. Some neurons have a single axon that connects to one other cell, while others can have many branches that connect to multiple cells. In some cases, such as with motor neurons that innervate muscles, a single axon can connect to hundreds or even thousands of muscle cells.
