In Old English, noun endings varied based on their grammatical case, which expressed the noun's function in the sentence. There were five cases in Old English: nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, and instrumental. The endings of Old English nouns changed depending on which case they were in. For example, the noun "hund" (dog) would change to "hund" (nominative), "hundas" (accusative), "hundes" (genitive), "hunde" (dative), and "hunde" (instrumental).
