It is difficult to determine the exact group referred to in the question without more context. However, if the question is referring to a military group, it could be the Yugoslav Partisans, a Communist-led resistance movement that fought against occupying powers and collaborationist forces during World War II, including the forces of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. The Yugoslav Partisans were led by Josip Broz Tito and played a crucial role in the liberation of Yugoslavia.
