Algebraic topology was not founded by any one person. Rather, it has evolved over time through the work of many mathematicians, including Henri Poincar√©, Emmy Noether, and Samuel Eilenberg. The development of algebraic topology was rooted in the analysis of the topology of spaces and the application of algebraic techniques to describe and study these spaces.
