Islamism seeks to establish an Islamic state and governance based on Islamic principles and laws. This type of role is controversial because it can be interpreted in different ways, ranging from peaceful activism to extremist violence. Some people see Islamism as a threat to secularism and individual rights, while others view it as a legitimate expression of religious identity and political aspiration. Furthermore, some Islamists advocate for democracy and pluralism, while others reject them as Western values incompatible with Islam. These varied perspectives and actions associated with Islamism have led to debates and conflicts both within and outside Muslim-majority countries, making it a controversial concept.
