Mistwalker's second 360 title to be released was "Blue Dragon Plus," a tactical role-playing game released in Japan in 2008 and North America in 2009. However, it should be noted that "Blue Dragon Plus" was actually a Nintendo DS game, not a Xbox 360 game. This means that "Lost Odyssey" was actually their second Xbox 360 title to be released.
