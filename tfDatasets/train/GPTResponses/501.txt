The purpose of the fruit walls built by French and English farmers was to create microclimates that would allow the cultivation of fruit trees and other crops that would normally not survive in those areas. These walls, also known as espaliers or fruit fences, were built using a lattice-like framework of wooden or stone posts that supported the growth of vines and fruit trees. They provided protection from harsh winds, cold temperatures, and frost, which enabled farmers to grow a wider variety of fruits, such as apricots, peaches, and figs, in regions that were less favorable for agriculture. The fruit walls also allowed farmers to maximize their use of available land and increase their crop yield, making them an important agricultural innovation of the time.
