During World War II, soldiers manned anti-aircraft (AA) guns and searchlights. These were highly trained soldiers who had specialized in operating the guns and searchlights that were used for defense against enemy bombing raids. They were usually stationed at strategic locations like airfields, coastal cities, and military bases, where they could protect friendly forces against aerial assaults from enemy planes. The crews of AA guns and searchlights were often under constant pressure and danger during bombing attacks, and they had to be ready to respond quickly and accurately in order to defend their positions.
