The primordialist and social constructionist views need to be understood in the context of identity formation and ethnic/national identity.Primordialism argues that identity is innate and predetermined by factors such as biology, ethnicity, and culture, and therefore it is unchangeable and inherent. It perceives ethnic and national identities as fixed and timeless categories that develop through ancestry, language, and shared traditions. This view is often employed to justify exclusive and hierarchical social structures based on these identities.On the other hand, social constructionism holds that identity and ethnicity are socially constructed, and therefore they are subject to change and negotiation. Identity is formed through social interaction and cultural practices, and it is not predetermined by any biological or cultural factors. This view emphasizes the role of power, representation, and discourse in shaping identities, and it rejects any essentialist or deterministic understanding of identity.The context in which these views emerge is crucial to understanding their implications. Primordialism has often been used to justify nationalist and ethnic conflicts, while social constructionism has been used to promote diversity and tolerance. However, both views have limitations and have been criticized for their narrow focus on either biology or culture in explaining identity formation. Therefore, it is important to contextualize their arguments and consider the complexity of identity formation in different contexts.
