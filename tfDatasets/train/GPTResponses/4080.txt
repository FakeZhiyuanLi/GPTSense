Orthodox Judaism seeks to preserve the spiritual and ethical integrity of Jewish tradition as it has been handed down over generations. This includes maintaining strict adherence to halakhah (Jewish law) and upholding the importance of Torah study and observance, as well as preserving the traditions and customs that have been an integral part of Jewish practice for centuries. The goal of Orthodox Judaism is to maintain a strong sense of continuity with the past while also remaining relevant in the modern world.
