The frame of the car may someday be replaced by components of wood. Wooden cars were actually popular in the early 20th century due to the abundance and affordability of wood at the time. In recent years, manufacturers have been experimenting with using wood as a viable alternative to steel and aluminum frames, as it is a sustainable and renewable material with high strength-to-weight ratio. Additionally, wooden frames can absorb more energy during a crash, making the car safer for passengers. Some companies have already started producing cars with wooden frames, such as Roding Automobile's RD320.
