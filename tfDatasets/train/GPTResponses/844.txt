The Four Noble Truths are the core ideas of Buddhism that explain the nature of suffering and the path to liberation from suffering. They are:1) Dukkha (suffering): All life is characterized by suffering, dissatisfaction, or frustration.2) Samudaya (cause of suffering): Suffering arises from craving, attachment, and ignorance.3) Nirodha (end of suffering): Suffering can be ended by eliminating craving, attachment, and ignorance.4) Magga (path to end of suffering): The path to the end of suffering is the Noble Eightfold Path, which includes right understanding, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.
