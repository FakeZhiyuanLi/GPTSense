There are several small errors that can cause large errors in shell fall height and time until exploding, including:1. Incorrect calculations of wind speed and direction: When a shell is fired, it is affected by the wind, which can cause it to deviate from its intended trajectory. If the wind speed and direction are not properly accounted for in the calculations, the shell may fall short or overshoot the target.2. Miscalculated trajectory: The trajectory of a shell is affected by factors such as the angle of elevation, muzzle velocity, and air resistance. If any of these factors are not accurately calculated, the shell may fall at a different height or explode at a different time than intended.3. Inconsistent explosive materials: The timing and power of the explosion are determined by the type and amount of explosive material used. If the material is not consistent in quality or quantity, the shell may explode prematurely or fail to explode altogether.4. Poor quality or damaged fuses: The fuse is the component that controls the timing of the explosive charge. If the fuse is damaged or of poor quality, it may malfunction, causing the shell to explode earlier or later than intended.5. Human error: Finally, human error can also play a role in the accuracy of shell fall height and time until exploding. This can range from mistakes in loading the shell or setting the fuse, to errors in measuring wind speed and direction or calculating the trajectory.
