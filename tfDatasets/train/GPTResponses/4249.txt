The Copa del Rey finals where Espanyol and Barcelona faced each other in 2006 is more relevant to Espanyol supporters than to Barcelona fans. Espanyol won the match 2-1, marking their first Copa del Rey victory in 60 years. This victory holds a significant place in the history of Espanyol, and their supporters hold it as a cherished memory. On the other hand, Barcelona has won several Copa del Rey titles, and losing one of them is not as significant to their fans as it is for Espanyol supporters.
