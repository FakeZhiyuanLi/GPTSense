Von Bellingshausen and Lazarev were the first people to reach the Antarctic mainland. They sailed from southern Africa in 1819 and arrived in what is now known as Mirny Bay on the coast of East Antarctica on January 11, 1820. They also discovered the nearby continent of Antarctica and claimed it for the Russian Empire.
