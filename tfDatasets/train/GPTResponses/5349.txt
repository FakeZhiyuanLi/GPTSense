a particular group of people or an idea. They may be created to depict a certain stereotype or to evoke a particular emotion or feeling among the audience. For example, in the Harry Potter series, the character of Hermione Granger represents intelligent and hardworking young girls who are often underestimated and undervalued. In The Lord of the Rings, the character of Gandalf represents wisdom and guidance, while Gollum represents the destructive power of obsession and addiction. Characters can also be created to challenge stereotypes and bring attention to social issues, such as the character of Rue in The Hunger Games, who raises awareness about the mistreatment of black people in society.
