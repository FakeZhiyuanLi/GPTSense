The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system promotes sustainability in building design and construction. It was developed by the United States Green Building Council (USGBC) and is widely recognized as the premier rating system for sustainable building practices. LEED awards points for energy efficiency, water conservation, indoor air quality, and the use of sustainable materials and resources. Buildings can achieve certifications ranging from Certified, Silver, Gold, to Platinum, based on the number of points they earn.
