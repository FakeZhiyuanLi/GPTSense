One compound that can mobilize solid copper is hydrochloric acid (HCl). When solid copper is placed in HCl, it will react to form copper (II) chloride and hydrogen gas. The copper ions will then be in solution and can be mobilized. Other compounds that can mobilize solid copper include nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4).
