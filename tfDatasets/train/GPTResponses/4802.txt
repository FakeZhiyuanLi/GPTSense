the gold standard?After the U.S. dollar was no longer anchored to the gold standard, its value was determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The value of the dollar fluctuated depending on economic conditions, political events, and the actions of central banks and investors. In general, a stronger dollar meant that it could buy more foreign currency, while a weaker dollar meant that it could buy less. The value of the dollar compared to other currencies is still a major factor in international trade and finance today.
