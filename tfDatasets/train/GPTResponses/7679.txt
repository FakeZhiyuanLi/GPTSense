The issue that may occur if a high-speed external disk drive is powered from just one USB 2.0 port is that the drive may not receive enough power to operate at its full speed. This could result in slower data transfer rates and potential data loss or corruption. Additionally, the USB port itself may be damaged or overloaded, which could cause the drive to malfunction or fail entirely. To avoid these issues, it is recommended to use a dedicated power source or a USB hub with sufficient power output to connect and power the external drive.
