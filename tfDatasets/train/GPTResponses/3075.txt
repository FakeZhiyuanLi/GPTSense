In the final days of WWII in Yugoslavia, both the German occupation forces and the Yugoslav Partisan resistance committed atrocities against civilians. The German forces engaged in mass killings and executions, particularly of Jews and Romani people. The Partisans also engaged in brutal retaliation against collaborators and opponents, including summary executions and political purges. Additionally, nationalist and ethnic tensions led to violence between various Yugoslav ethnic groups, including massacres of Croats by Serbs and vice versa. Ultimately, the responsibility for these atrocities falls on all parties involved in the conflict.
