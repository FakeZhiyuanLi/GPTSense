The Order of Preachers, or the Dominican Order, has a few different congregations of nuns that follow the same charism and mission. One such congregation is the Dominican Sisters of St. Cecilia, also known as the Nashville Dominicans. This group of nuns is known for their dedication to education and evangelization, and they operate schools and other apostolates around the world. They follow the Rule of St. Augustine and the Dominican Constitutions, and are committed to the four pillars of the Dominican life: prayer, study, community, and preaching.
