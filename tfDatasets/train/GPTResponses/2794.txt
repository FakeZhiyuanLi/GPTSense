Techniques for adding, removing and editing genes began to be developed in the 1970s with the discovery of recombinant DNA technology. The first successful recombinant DNA experiment was performed in 1972 by Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer. Since then, various techniques such as gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9, gene therapy, and transgenesis have been developed and refined to enable efficient and precise manipulation of genes.
