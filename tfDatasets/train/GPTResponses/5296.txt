The Gospel of Matthew mentions that Mary fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah. In Matthew 1:22-23, it is written, "All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet: 'Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel' (which means, God with us)." This refers to Isaiah 7:14, where it is prophesied that a virgin will give birth to a son who will be called Immanuel.
