A mutual guarantee treaty is a type of alliance treaty in which two or more states pledge to support each other in the event of an attack by an external party. It is a form of collective defense treaty whereby the signatories promise to provide military, economic, or political assistance to one another if any of them are threatened or attacked. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is an example of a mutual guarantee treaty.
