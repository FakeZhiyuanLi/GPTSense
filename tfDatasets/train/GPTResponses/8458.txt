Most undergraduate degrees in mathematics or applied mathematics include courses on algebra and calculus, which cover methods for solving cubic and quartic equations. However, there may be some specialized degrees or programs that do not include such courses. Additionally, some degrees may cover the topic briefly but not in depth. It is best to consult the curriculum requirements of a specific degree program to determine if it includes these topics.
