. With a standardized schedule, everyone is on the same page and there is no confusion about when to adjust their clocks. It also helps businesses and other organizations plan their activities and schedules accordingly. On the other hand, if everyone tried to adjust their clocks on their own, it would lead to chaos and confusion, with some people showing up early or late for appointments, meetings, and other events. A standardized schedule ensures that everyone is on the same page and helps maintain some level of order and predictability in our daily lives.
