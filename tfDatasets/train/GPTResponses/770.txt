Financial innovation that allows investment banks and hedge banks to make large wagers is the use of derivatives. Derivatives are financial contracts whose value is based on an underlying asset or group of assets. These instruments allow investment banks and hedge banks to take on large positions without having to own the underlying asset. This allows them to make large bets on the direction of the market or specific assets while minimizing their capital requirements. However, derivatives can also be highly risky and can lead to significant losses if the underlying assets move in unexpected ways.
