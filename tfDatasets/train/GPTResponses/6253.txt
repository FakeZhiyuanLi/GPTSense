Many Islamic and anti-masonic groups and individuals argue that Freemasonry is a secret society, which promotes a non-Abrahamic religion, and undermines traditional values and institutions such as nationalism, religion, and family. They also accuse Masons of having a hidden agenda to establish a global government or "New World Order" and impose their own moral and political views on society. Some Muslim groups also see Freemasonry as a manifestation of Western cultural imperialism and a threat to Islamic values and identity. In contrast, many Freemasons and their supporters argue that their organization is a fraternity dedicated to moral and personal development, charity, and community service, and that their teachings are compatible with Abrahamic faiths and do not contradict any religious beliefs or practices.
