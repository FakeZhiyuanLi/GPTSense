The first copper miners in North America were most likely the indigenous people of the Great Lakes region, specifically the Ojibwe and Menominee tribes, who began mining on the shores of Lake Superior around 5000 BC. They used the copper to make tools, weapons, and ornaments. Later, European settlers would also mine copper in the area.
