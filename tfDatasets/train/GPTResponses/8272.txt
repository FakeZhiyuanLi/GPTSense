A subset of a group must satisfy three conditions to be a subgroup:1. Closure: The subset must be closed under the group operation.2. Associativity: The subset must satisfy the associative property of the group operation.3. Identity element: The subset must contain the identity element of the group.In addition, the subset must also contain the inverse element of each of its elements, which implies that if a and b belong to the subset, then their product ab and their inverses a^-1 and b^-1 also belong to the subset.
