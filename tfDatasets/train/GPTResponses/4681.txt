The Joachimstalers were a silver coin used in Europe during the 16th century, and they were composed of silver. The term "Joachimstaler" originated from the town of Joachimsthal in modern-day Czech Republic, where the first coins were minted in 1518. The coins quickly gained popularity and became the standard currency across Europe, leading to the term "thaler" being used to refer to various silver coins throughout Europe, including the German thaler, Dutch daalder, and American dollar.
