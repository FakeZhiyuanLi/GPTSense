it mattered most, in Europe. Specifically, Napoleon hoped to distract the British from their ongoing blockade of French ports and force them to divert resources from their European campaigns to defend their colonial possessions in the Caribbean. This would not only relieve pressure on the French fleet and economy, but also sow confusion and instability in Britain's imperial ranks. Furthermore, Napoleon believed that by capturing key sugar-producing islands like Jamaica or Trinidad, he could undercut the British economy and drive up the price of sugar in Europe, which would make it more difficult for Britain to finance its wars against France. Ultimately, however, Napoleon's plans to invade the West Indies were hindered by logistical challenges, disease outbreaks, and a lack of naval supremacy in the region, and the British were able to maintain their hold on the Caribbean throughout the Napoleonic Wars.
