will become the head. These swellings are referred to as the prosencephalon (forebrain), the mesencephalon (midbrain), and the rhombencephalon (hindbrain). Over time, these structures differentiate and develop into different regions of the brain with specific functions. For example, the prosencephalon develops into the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and hypothalamus, which are involved in higher cognitive functions, sensory processing, and homeostasis, respectively. The hindbrain, on the other hand, develops into structures such as the cerebellum, which plays a crucial role in motor coordination and balance.
