During France's retreat from Moscow in 1812, atrocities were committed against French soldiers by Cossack troops and other irregular forces made up of peasants and volunteers from the Russian population. These forces acted independently of the regular Russian army and were known for their brutality, looting, and indiscriminate attacks on both civilians and military personnel. The Cossacks, in particular, were feared for their horseback riding skills and use of sabers, which allowed them to quickly and brutally kill their targets. French soldiers were often killed, tortured, or taken prisoner by these forces, leading to widespread fear and resentment among the French ranks.
