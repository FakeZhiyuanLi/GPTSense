Historians and scholars have outlined the four main views of Baptist origins, including:1. Anabaptist/Mennonite View: This view suggests that Baptists originated from the Anabaptist/Mennonite movement that emerged in Europe during the 16th century. Anabaptists rejected infant baptism and practiced believer's baptism instead. This view is popular among scholars who see strong similarities between Anabaptist/Mennonite teachings and Baptist beliefs.2. English Separatist View: This view posits that Baptists originated from the English Separatist movement that emerged in the 16th and 17th centuries. Separatists rejected the Church of England and formed their own congregations, with some later adopting Baptist beliefs and practices.3. Calvinist/Reformed View: This view suggests that Baptists originated from the Calvinist/Reformed tradition that emerged during the Reformation. This view maintains that Baptists are a continuation of the radical wing of the Reformers who rejected infant baptism and emphasized believer's baptism.4. Baptist Succession View: This view asserts that Baptists have an unbroken succession from the apostolic church and that they have always existed in various forms throughout history. This view is based on the belief that Baptists have always adhered to biblical principles and practices, regardless of their inclusion or exclusion from institutionalized churches.
