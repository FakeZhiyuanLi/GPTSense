The letters in a bulb shape designation typically identify the shape and type of the bulb. For example, the letter "A" typically designates an "arbitrary" shape, while "G" often designates a globe-shaped bulb. The letters may also indicate the type of base, such as "E" for Edison screw or "GU" for a bi-pin base. There may also be additional letters or numbers indicating the wattage or other specifications.
