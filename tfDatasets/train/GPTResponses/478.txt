In Australia, the prime minister may resign voluntarily or be forced to do so through a vote of no confidence in the House of Representatives or the loss of the support of their political party. Additionally, the prime minister may also be required to resign if they are found to be ineligible to hold office due to citizenship issues or if they are convicted of a criminal offence.
