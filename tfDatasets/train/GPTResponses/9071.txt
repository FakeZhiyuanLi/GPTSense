is known as gonzo journalism. This style of journalism is characterized by a subjective, first-person narrative that often involves the reporter immersing themselves in the story and becoming a part of it. It is a style that is characterized by its honesty, humor, and often unconventional approach to traditional news reporting. Gonzo journalism is typically associated with Hunter S. Thompson, but Russell's work in the 1960s and 1970s also contributed to the development and popularization of the style.
