The frequency reproduction is strictly half the sampling frequency, according to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. This means that in order to accurately reproduce a signal, the sampling frequency should be at least twice the highest frequency present in the signal. If the sampling frequency is less than this, aliasing can occur, which results in distortion of the signal. Therefore, it is important to choose an appropriate sampling frequency to ensure accurate reproduction of the signal.
