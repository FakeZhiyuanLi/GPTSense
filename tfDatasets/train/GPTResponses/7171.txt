One way to group pesticides is by their chemical composition or active ingredient. For example, some common active ingredients in pesticides include glyphosate, neonicotinoids, and pyrethroids. These active ingredients have different modes of action and target different pests or weeds. By grouping pesticides based on their active ingredient, it can help farmers and growers choose the most effective and appropriate pesticide for their specific needs while minimizing the risk of developing resistance to a particular pesticide.
