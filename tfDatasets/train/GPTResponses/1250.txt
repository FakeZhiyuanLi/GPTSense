The British established a number of policies and institutions to control the Indigenous Australians, including:1. Terra nullius: The doctrine that the land was unoccupied and belonged to no one, which allowed the British to claim ownership of the land and dispossess Indigenous Australians of their traditional lands.2. Protection policies: Indigenous Australians were placed under the control of the government or mission managers, as they were seen as unable to govern themselves. These policies aimed to assimilate Indigenous Australians into European culture and were marked by forced removals of children from their families.3. Reserves and missions: Indigenous Australians were forcibly removed from their traditional lands and confined to designated reserves or missions. These institutions were often overcrowded, and Indigenous Australians were subjected to poor living conditions and inadequate access to health care and education.4. Forced labor: Indigenous Australians were often forced to work in missions or on cattle stations without pay or with minimal wages. Many were subjected to exploitation and abuse.5. Control of movement: Indigenous Australians were often restricted in their movements and required to obtain permits to travel outside of their designated areas. This aimed to control their movements and ensure they did not challenge the dominant colonial order.Overall, these policies aimed to control Indigenous Australians, dispossess them of their land, and assimilate them into European culture. They had devastating consequences for Indigenous Australians, including loss of culture and identity, trauma, and ongoing social and economic disadvantage.
