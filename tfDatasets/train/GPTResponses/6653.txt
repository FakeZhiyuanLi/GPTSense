is known as a "bill." The bill goes through several stages of review and debate in both the House of Representatives and the Senate before it is passed by both chambers and sent to the President for signature. Once the President signs the bill into law, it is published in the United States Statutes at Large and assigned a Public Law number. This number is used to identify and reference the law in legal documents and other official communications.
