USB was designed for connecting electronic devices, such as computers, printers, cameras, keyboards, and mice, to transfer data and power between them. It was first introduced in 1996 as a replacement for various types of connectors used for these kinds of devices. USB has become a standard interface for most electronic devices and is widely used for data transfer and charging purposes.
