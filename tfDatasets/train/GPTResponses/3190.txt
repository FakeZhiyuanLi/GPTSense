Recessive alleles give rise to their corresponding phenotype only when two copies of the recessive allele are present in an individual's genotype (homozygous recessive). If an individual has one dominant allele and one recessive allele (heterozygous), the dominant allele will mask the expression of the recessive allele, and the individual will exhibit the dominant phenotype. Therefore, recessive alleles require a lack of dominant allele to express their corresponding phenotype.
