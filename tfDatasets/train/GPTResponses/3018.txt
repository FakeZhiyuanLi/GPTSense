The Slave Coast was a historical region in West Africa that encompassed the coastal areas of present-day Benin, Togo and parts of Nigeria. The name “Slave Coast” came from the fact that this region was a major center for the international slave trade from the 16th to the 19th century, where millions of Africans were captured, traded and transported to the Americas and European colonies as slaves.
