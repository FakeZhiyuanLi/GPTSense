Orthodox Judaism overlaps significantly with Hasidic Judaism. Both adhere to traditional Jewish law and ritual practices, emphasize the importance of prayer, Torah study, and community, and prioritize spirituality and connection with God in everyday life. However, Hasidic Judaism places a strong emphasis on mysticism, the role of the tzaddik (spiritual leader), and joyous worship through singing and dancing, which distinguishes it from other branches of Orthodox Judaism.
