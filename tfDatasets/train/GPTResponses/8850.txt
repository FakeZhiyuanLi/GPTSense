It is important to consult with a healthcare provider regarding any rapidly worsening symptoms, as the type of medication taken by mouth will depend on the specific condition being treated. In an emergency situation, such as an anaphylactic reaction, an EpiPen (epinephrine auto-injector) may be administered orally to quickly relieve symptoms. Other medications commonly taken orally to treat rapidly worsening symptoms include bronchodilators for asthma or COPD, antiepileptic medications for seizures, and pain medications for acute pain.
