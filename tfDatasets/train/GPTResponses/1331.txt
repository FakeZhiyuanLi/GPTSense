The Russian Empire began to question the existence of the Ottoman Empire in the late 18th century and early 19th century, during the reign of Catherine the Great. The Ottoman Empire had been in decline for several centuries, and Russia saw an opportunity to expand its influence into the Balkans and the Black Sea region. The Russo-Turkish Wars of the late 18th and early 19th centuries were a result of this rivalry and marked the beginning of the decline of the Ottoman Empire.
