La Maison Cubiste (The Cubist House) was an architectural installation created for the 1912 Salon d'Automne in Paris by French artist Andr√© Mare and architect and designer Roger-Henri Expert. It was a full-scale model of a modernist interior, using Cubist elements such as geometric shapes, angled walls, and fragmented forms. The installation showcased a new aesthetic that was emerging in the early 20th century and signaled a new direction in architecture and design. The purpose of La Maison Cubiste was to create an immersive experience that demonstrated the potential of modern art and design to transform everyday life.
