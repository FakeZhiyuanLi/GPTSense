Effigies can be made of various materials, depending on the purpose and culture. Here are some examples:- Straw: Effigies made of straw are often used in European folklore and customs, such as the Wickerman in Scotland or the Guy Fawkes in England. The straw is woven or bundled around a wooden frame, and dressed in clothing or other decorations.- Papier-mache: Similarly, papier-mache is a common material for making effigies, especially for protest or political purposes. The pulp of paper and glue is molded into a desired shape and dried, then painted or covered in other materials.- Wood: Many cultures use wood carvings as effigies, either for religious or artistic purposes. For example, Native American totem poles often depict animals or ancestors as symbols of their clans.- Wax: Wax effigies are often used for historical or celebrity figures. These are sculpted in a realistic likeness and dressed in clothing, then displayed in museums or exhibitions.- Clay: Clay is another material that is used to make effigies, especially for religious or ceremonial reasons. In many parts of Africa and Asia, clay figures are used as representations of ancestral spirits or gods, and are elaborately decorated and placed in shrines or other sacred places.
