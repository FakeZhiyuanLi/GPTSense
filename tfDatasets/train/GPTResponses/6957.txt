Nicholas Vavilov built upon the earlier work of Gregor Mendel, the father of genetics, who discovered the basic laws of inheritance in the 19th century. Vavilov expanded on these principles to create a classification system for plants based on their geographic origin and traits, which became the foundation for modern plant breeding and agricultural research.
