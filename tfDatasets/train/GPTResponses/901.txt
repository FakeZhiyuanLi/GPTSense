Whitehead opposed the predominant Western philosophy of reality that saw the world as composed of independent and static substance-objects, with their properties and relations, which existed separately from their interactions and processes. This philosophy, known as substance dualism, was championed by thinkers such as Rene Descartes and Enlightenment philosophers, and was based on the idea of a strict separation between mind and matter. Whitehead saw this view as incomplete and inadequate for understanding the dynamic and interdependent nature of reality, and instead proposed his process philosophy, which emphasized the primacy of change and the interconnectedness of all things in the cosmos.
