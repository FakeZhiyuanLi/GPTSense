The American Baptist Home Mission Society prevented slaveholders from being appointed as missionaries in the mid-19th century. This decision was led by prominent abolitionist leaders such as William Lloyd Garrison and Frederick Douglass. Other missionary societies, such as the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, also adopted similar policies.
