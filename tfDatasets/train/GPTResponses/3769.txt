The philosopher Robert C. Solomon argued that emotions arise from cognitive intentionality. According to Solomon, emotions are not just physiological responses, but are also shaped by our beliefs, values, and interpretation of the situation. He believed that emotions are not just reactions to events, but are constructed through our interactions with the world. Solomon's theory emphasized the role of cognition in shaping emotional experiences, and challenged the idea that emotions are purely instinctual or automatic.
