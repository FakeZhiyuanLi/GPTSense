Scientists explore the function of the disrupted gene by adding genes to mice that can modify or restore its function. By doing so, they can study the role of the gene in different biological processes, as well as investigate potential treatments for genetic disorders caused by mutations or deficiencies in that gene. The added genes can also help elucidate the interactions between genes and their effect on the development and progression of diseases. Additionally, the use of mice with disrupted genes can provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying a variety of human diseases, including cancer, neurological disorders, and cardiovascular diseases.
