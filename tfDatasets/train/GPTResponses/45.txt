There were several reasons why the initial suggestions for a devolved parliament before 1914 were shelved:1. Lack of Political Consensus: There was a lack of political consensus on the issue of devolution. Many politicians were divided on the issue, and there was no consensus on the form or scope of any devolved parliament.2. Changing Political Priorities: Other political issues, such as the Irish Home Rule, took priority over devolution, and many politicians focused their attention on these issues instead.3. World War I: The outbreak of World War I in 1914 led to a shift in priorities, and many politicians were forced to prioritize the war effort over domestic political reforms.4. Resistance from the Westminster Government: The Westminster government was resistant to the idea of devolution and saw it as a potential threat to their power, which made it difficult to gain traction for any proposals for devolution.Overall, a lack of consensus, changing priorities, the outbreak of war, and resistance from the Westminster government were significant factors in why the initial suggestions for a devolved parliament before 1914 were shelved.
