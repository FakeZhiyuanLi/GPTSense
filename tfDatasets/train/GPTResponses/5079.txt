The maximum number of points possible for a rhythmic gymnastics routine varies depending on the competition level and format. In international competitions, the maximum score is usually 20 points for each individual apparatus (hoop, ball, clubs, ribbon), with an overall maximum score of 100 points for the entire routine. However, in some national or regional competitions, the maximum score may differ.
