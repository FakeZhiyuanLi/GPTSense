After 1573, only members of the Polish-Lithuanian nobility (szlachta) could become a Polish-Lithuanian monarch. This was due to the establishment of the elective monarchy system, which required the approval of the szlachta through a royal election process. Additionally, the monarch had to be a baptized Christian and male.
