The American Psychological Association (APA) and the Royal College of Psychiatrists have expressed concerns about the National Association for Research & Therapy of Homosexuality (NARTH), an organization that promotes conversion therapy or reparative therapy, which aims to change a person's sexual orientation. Both organizations consider conversion therapy to be harmful and unethical, and they have criticized NARTH for promoting practices that are not supported by scientific evidence and can cause psychological harm to individuals. The APA has stated that conversion therapy can result in increased anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts and has called for an end to its practice. The Royal College of Psychiatrists has similarly called for an end to conversion therapy and has condemned any attempt to treat homosexuality as a mental disorder.
