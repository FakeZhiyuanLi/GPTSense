One example of how students can benefit from videoconferencing is by connecting with experts or guest speakers from different parts of the world. Videoconferencing allows students to interact with professionals in real time, ask questions and learn about different cultures, perspectives and career opportunities. This can broaden their horizons and inspire them to pursue their interests and goals. Additionally, videoconferencing can also facilitate collaborative projects and discussions among students who may be geographically distant, enabling them to work on joint assignments or share ideas and feedback in a more engaging and interactive way.
