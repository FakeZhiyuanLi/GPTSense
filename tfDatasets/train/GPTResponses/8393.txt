There are many funds and organizations that support travel to classical lands, but one notable example is the Classical Association of the Atlantic States (CAAS) Student Travel Awards. These awards are given annually to undergraduate or graduate students who wish to travel to classical lands for scholarly purposes, such as attending an archaeological excavation or participating in a language program. The funds can be used to cover travel expenses, accommodations, and other related costs.
