is called logarithmic. This means that the perceived difference in pitch between two frequencies increases exponentially as the frequencies themselves get farther apart. For example, the perceived difference between two notes that are an octave apart (e.g., C4 and C5) is greater than the perceived difference between two notes that are a half-step apart (e.g., C4 and C#4).The precise relationship between the perceived difference in pitch and the actual difference in frequency is often described using a unit called the "cent," which is equal to 1/100th of a semitone. However, it's worth noting that different cultures and musical traditions may have slightly different perceptions of intervals and scales, and that individual listeners may have their own idiosyncratic ways of perceiving and interpreting music.
