In very severe cases of asthma, the airways become dangerously narrow, making it difficult for the person to breathe. They may experience severe shortness of breath, wheezing, chest tightness, and coughing that does not go away even after using rescue inhalers. The individual may also develop a bluish tint to their lips or nails (known as cyanosis), indicating a lack of oxygen in their blood. Severe asthma attacks can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention, with hospitalization and intensive treatment such as oxygen therapy or intravenous medications to help open the airways. In some cases, mechanical ventilation may be necessary to help the person breathe until the asthma attack subsides.
