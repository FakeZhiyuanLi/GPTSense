The minimum bit rate for compressed video and audio transmission depends on several factors such as resolution, frame rate, audio quality, and compression algorithm used. However, as a general guideline, a bit rate of 1 Mbps for 720p video and 128 kbps for stereo audio is considered to be the minimum acceptable level for good quality transmission. For higher resolution videos, the bit rate will need to be increased accordingly.
