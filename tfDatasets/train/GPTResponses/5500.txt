One of the major agricultural products of Victoria around 1860 was wool. The state had a booming wool industry, with major wool producing areas in the western districts and the Riverina region. The discovery of gold in Victoria in the 1850s also led to an increase in demand for wool, as miners needed woolen clothing to keep warm in the cold climate.
