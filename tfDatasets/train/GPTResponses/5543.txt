There have been many long lines in history, but the longest line in the world during its time was the Great Wall of China. The wall stretches more than 13,000 miles (21,000 kilometers) and was built over a period of more than 2,000 years. It was constructed to protect the Chinese empire from invasions from the north and is considered one of the greatest engineering feats in history.
