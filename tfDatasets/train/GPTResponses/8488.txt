Darwin observed that domestic animals, such as dogs, cats, and pigeons, had undergone significant changes in their physical characteristics due to human intervention in their breeding. He noted that certain traits, such as coat color, size, and shape, had been selectively bred to suit human needs and preferences. He also hypothesized that these changes were the result of variation and natural selection, similar to the process of evolution in wild species. This observation played an important role in the development of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection.
