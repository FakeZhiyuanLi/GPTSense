The reduced independence of British overseas possessions from their commanders in London was caused by several factors, including:1. Increased centralization of power in London: During the 19th century, the British government began to centralize its administrative and political machinery, bringing more control under the Westminster Parliament. This meant that colonies and other overseas possessions had less autonomy and more decisions were taken in London.2. The imposition of direct rule: The British government gradually took over direct rule of some colonies, especially those that were seen as strategic or important to the empire. This meant that the local governors and officials had less power and authority, and had to take their instructions from London.3. The end of mercantilism: The traditional economic policy of the British Empire, mercantilism, had given colonies some level of autonomy and independence. However, as free trade became the norm in the 19th century, colonial economies became more closely integrated with that of Britain, and so the colonies had to follow the lead of London.4. The impact of the world wars: The two world wars of the 20th century had a significant impact on the relationship between the empire and the mother country. The wars drained Britain of resources and manpower, and so it became necessary to give the colonies more autonomy and self-rule. This led to the decolonization movement that began in the mid-20th century.
