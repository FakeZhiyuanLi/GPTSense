In places that are segregated by race or class, there are several things that tend to decline, including:1. Economic opportunities: Segregated neighborhoods tend to have fewer job opportunities, which can lead to lower incomes and higher poverty rates.2. Educational quality: Segregated schools tend to receive less funding and have lower-quality teachers, which can lead to a lower quality of education for students.3. Social cohesion: When people live in segregated neighborhoods, they are less likely to interact with people from different backgrounds, which can lead to a lack of community cohesion and social fragmentation.4. Access to services: Segregated neighborhoods may have fewer public services, such as parks or libraries, which can negatively impact the quality of life for residents.5. Health outcomes: People living in segregated neighborhoods may have limited access to healthcare, healthy food options or recreational outlets, which can lead to poorer health outcomes.6. Safety: Segregated neighborhoods may experience higher levels of crime and violence, as well as feel less safe due to tensions between different groups.
