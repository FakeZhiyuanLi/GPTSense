The so-called gentlemen's agreement between Sadat and the Islamists began to break down in 1977, when Sadat signed the Camp David Accords with Israel, which were seen as a betrayal by many Islamist groups who viewed Israel as an enemy of Islam. The breaking point came in 1981, when Sadat was assassinated by Islamist extremists during a military parade.
