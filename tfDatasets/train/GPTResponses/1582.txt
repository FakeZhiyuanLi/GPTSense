During the Six Dynasties period in China (220-589 AD), the wealthiest area was the Yangtze River Delta region, particularly the cities of Nanjing and Suzhou. These cities were major centers of commerce, manufacturing, and culture, with a flourishing textile industry, sophisticated urban infrastructure, and a vibrant arts scene. The wealthy merchants, aristocrats, and scholars who lived in these cities had a significant influence on the political and cultural life of China during this period.
