The concept of the gene as a unit of natural selection refers to the idea that individual genes, rather than whole organisms, are the fundamental units that are acted upon by natural selection. This means that genes that confer beneficial traits, such as those that promote survival, reproduction, or adaptation to the environment, are more likely to be passed on to future generations. Genes that are detrimental to an organism's fitness, on the other hand, are more likely to be eliminated from the gene pool over time. The gene-centric view of evolution emphasizes the importance of genetic variation and the role of random mutations in generating new genetic material that can be acted upon by natural selection.
