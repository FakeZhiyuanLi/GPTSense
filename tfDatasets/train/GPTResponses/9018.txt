One of the main tests that can differentiate between asthma and COPD is a pulmonary function test (PFT), also known as spirometry. This test measures how much air a person can breathe in and out, how fast they can breathe it out, and how well their lungs are functioning.In asthma, the airways are often narrowed due to inflammation and muscle tightening, which can cause a decrease in airflow. Spirometry testing in asthma will show a reversible obstruction, meaning that after the person uses a bronchodilator medication, their lung function will improve.In COPD, the airways are narrowed due to damage and scarring, often caused by smoking, which can cause a progressive decrease in airflow. Spirometry testing in COPD will show a non-reversible obstruction, which means that lung function will not significantly improve after using a bronchodilator medication.Additionally, a doctor may also perform chest X-rays or CT scans to rule out other possible underlying conditions, such as lung cancer, that can cause similar symptoms to asthma and COPD.
