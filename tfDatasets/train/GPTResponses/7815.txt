The true backer of the cause of affirmative action is not one specific person, but rather a social and political movement that emerged in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s. This movement sought to address past and present discrimination against minorities and women in fields such as education, employment, and contracting. Affirmative action policies aimed to eliminate barriers and provide equal opportunities for underrepresented groups through measures such as prioritizing diverse hiring and admissions practices. While there were many key figures and organizations involved in this movement, it was ultimately the collective efforts of activists, policymakers, and advocates that led to the adoption of affirmative action policies.
