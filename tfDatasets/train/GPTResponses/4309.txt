Mollusca and Annelida are considered to be close relatives because they share several similarities in their anatomical and developmental characteristics. Both these groups are classified under the superphylum Lophotrochozoa, and they possess a lophophore or trochophore larva during their development.Mollusks and annelids both have a similar body plan, consisting of a head, a foot, and a visceral mass. Their bodies are also segmented, although the degree of segmentation may differ. Mollusks have a segmented mantle, while annelids have segmented bodies with repeated units along their length.Furthermore, both groups have similar organ systems, such as a digestive system with mouth and anus, a nervous system, and circulatory systems with a heart and blood vessels.Finally, molecular studies have shown that mollusks and annelids share a common ancestor and are closely related on the evolutionary tree.
