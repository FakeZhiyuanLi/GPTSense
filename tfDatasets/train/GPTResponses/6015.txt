Breeding has played a significant role in the poultry industry by helping to improve productivity, profitability, and bird health. Some of the ways that breeding has helped include:1. Higher egg production: Through selective breeding, modern egg-laying breeds can lay up to 300 eggs per year, compared to around 50 eggs per year for traditional breeds.2. Faster growth rates: Broiler chickens bred for meat production reach market weight twice as fast as they did 50 years ago, resulting in increased efficiency and profitability.3. Disease resistance: Through genetic selection, chickens are being bred to be more resistant to diseases, reducing the need for antibiotics and other medications.4. Improved feed efficiency: By selecting birds with higher feed-to-meat conversion ratios, breeders can increase meat production while reducing the amount of feed consumed per bird.Overall, breeding has allowed for the development of highly specialized and efficient chicken breeds that meet the demands of modern-day poultry production.
