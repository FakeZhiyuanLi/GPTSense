Gregor Mendel explained his results in terms of genes and heredity. He proposed that traits were determined by discrete units of heredity, which he called genes. These genes are passed down from parents to offspring in predictable patterns, and the combination of genes inherited from both parents determines the traits of the offspring. Mendel's work laid the foundation for the modern understanding of genetics and heredity.
