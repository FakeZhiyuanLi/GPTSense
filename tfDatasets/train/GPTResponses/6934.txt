Picasso's 1907 paintings were usually characterized by the use of vibrant colors, fragmented depictions of objects, and distorted perspectives. This style, known as Cubism, was a major departure from traditional forms of art and involved breaking down objects into geometric shapes and multiple viewpoints. Some of his most famous works from this period include "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon" and "The Old Guitarist."
