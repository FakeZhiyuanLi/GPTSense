Pope John XXIII, who reigned from 1958 to 1963, was noted for his warmth and humor. He was known for his spontaneous and informal style, and his willingness to break with tradition and engage with people from all walks of life. He called the Second Vatican Council, which brought significant changes to the Catholic Church, and was canonized as a saint in 2014.
