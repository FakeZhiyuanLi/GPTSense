Chongqing Municipality was formed in 1997 to elevate the administrative status of the city of Chongqing from a provincial-level city to a direct-controlled municipality. This was done to promote economic development and better governance in the region. Chongqing is a major transportation hub and industrial center in southwestern China with a population of over 30 million people. The formation of the municipality was seen as a strategic move by the Chinese government to accelerate the modernization of this important manufacturing and logistics hub.
