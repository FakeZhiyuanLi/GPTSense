The tide is the property of the English Channel that affects water flow in Southampton Water. The tide in the English Channel rises and falls at regular intervals, and this movement of water affects the flow of water in Southampton Water. Specifically, as the tide rises from the Channel into Southampton Water, it brings more water into the area, causing the flow of water in the waterway to slow down or even reverse direction. Conversely, as the tide falls and water flows back out into the Channel, it can increase the flow of water moving out of Southampton Water. This tidal ebb and flow play a critical role in maintaining the health of the ecosystem in the region, as well as in supporting commercial and leisure activities that rely on this waterway.
