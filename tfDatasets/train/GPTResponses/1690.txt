The sequence of nucleotides in a gene specifies a particular trait with a different sequence of alleles. Alleles are different forms of a gene, which arise due to differences in the sequence of nucleotides. The specific sequence of nucleotides in a gene determines the sequence of amino acids in the resulting protein or the regulatory elements that control the expression of the gene. Small differences in the sequence of nucleotides can lead to major differences in the structure or function of the protein the gene encodes, which can affect the resulting trait.
