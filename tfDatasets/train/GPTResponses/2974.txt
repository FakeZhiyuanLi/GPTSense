Transcription produces an RNA copy of a DNA sequence. This process is essential for protein synthesis, as the RNA molecule carries the genetic information from the DNA to the ribosome, where it is translated into a sequence of amino acids to form a protein. It also plays a critical role in gene regulation, as different types of RNA molecules can control the expression of genes by interacting with other cellular components, such as proteins or DNA sequences.
