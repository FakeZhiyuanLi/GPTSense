Buddhism is a non-theistic religion and philosophy that originated in ancient India, founded by Siddhartha Gautama, also known as the Buddha. It focuses on the teachings and practices of the Buddha, aimed at achieving enlightenment and liberation from suffering. Buddhists strive to follow the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path to achieve Nirvana, a state of ultimate peace and liberation. Buddhism emphasizes meditation, mindfulness, and ethical behavior as key practices in achieving this goal.
