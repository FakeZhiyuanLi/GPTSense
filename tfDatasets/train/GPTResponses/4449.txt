Some adolescents feel that social media platforms and online dating apps such as Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, and Tinder are safe places to seek out romantic relationships, try out dating, and identity exploration. This is because they offer a level of anonymity and privacy, and people can choose who they want to communicate with and when to communicate with them. Additionally, some adolescents may feel that school clubs, parties, and social events are safe places for romantic relationships and identity exploration because they allow them to meet new people and make connections in a supervised setting.
