Czech is a language that uses cases to mark subject nouns. The subject of a sentence can be marked in the nominative case, which usually appears in its base form (the form you would find in a dictionary). For example: "Pes běží ve parku" (The dog runs in the park) - "pes" (dog) is in the nominative case.However, depending on the sentence structure and the verb used, other cases can also be used to mark the subject, such as the accusative, genitive, or locative cases. These different cases reflect the grammatical function of the noun within the sentence.
