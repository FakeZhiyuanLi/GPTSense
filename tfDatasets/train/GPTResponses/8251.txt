Strasbourg lost its status as a free city in 1681 when it was annexed by King Louis XIV of France. The city had previously been a free imperial city within the Holy Roman Empire, but its strategic location and wealth eventually attracted the attention of France, which succeeded in taking control of the city after a brief military conflict. The annexation of Strasbourg marked the end of its independence and autonomy as a free city.
