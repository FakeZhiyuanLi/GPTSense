The Paris Agreement commits countries to develop resources for sustainability. The agreement was reached in 2015 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, with the goal of limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The Paris Agreement requires countries to develop and regularly update their nationally determined contributions (NDCs), which should include specific targets and actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and build resilience to climate impacts. The agreement also encourages countries to enhance their efforts on adaptation, finance, technology transfer, and capacity building, in order to support sustainable development and the transition to low-carbon, climate-resilient economies.
