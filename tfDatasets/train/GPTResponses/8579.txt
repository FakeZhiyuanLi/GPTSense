One solution to the placement of combining marks is to ensure that they are properly aligned with the base character they are modifying. This can be achieved through the use of vertical and horizontal spacing adjustments. Additionally, software developers can create algorithms that automatically adjust the placement of combining marks based on the context in which they appear. This can help to ensure that the combining marks are properly positioned and do not overlap or interfere with adjacent characters. Finally, it is important for font designers to take into account the placement of combining marks when creating their glyphs, and to test their fonts to ensure that the combining marks are correctly positioned and rendered.
