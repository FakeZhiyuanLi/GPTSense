Many historians have described Napoleon's foreign policy ambitions as expansionist and aggressive. He sought to establish a French-dominated Europe, leading to conflicts with other major powers such as Britain, Russia, and Austria. Napoleon also aimed to spread the French Revolution's principles, such as patriotism and liberty, throughout Europe. Some historians also argue that Napoleon's foreign policy was driven by his personal ambition and desire for fame and glory.
