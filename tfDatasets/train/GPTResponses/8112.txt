The Native Americans did not lose their land at a specific moment in time, but rather suffered a prolonged loss of land due to colonization, westward expansion, and forced removals over centuries. Some of the major events include the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which led to the forced relocation of thousands of Native Americans, including the Trail of Tears, the Dawes Act of 1887, which allowed for the division and distribution of Native American land to individual Native Americans and non-Native Americans, and the termination policy of the 1950s, which sought to assimilate Native Americans into mainstream American culture by terminating their tribal sovereignty and allocating their land to non-Native American groups. Despite these policies, Native American communities continue to fight for their land rights and maintain their cultural identities today.
