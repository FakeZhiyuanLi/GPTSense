Runways at sea are typically aircraft carriers or amphibious assault ships that have a flat, open deck area used for the takeoff and landing of military aircraft. These vessels are equipped with catapults and arresting gear to launch and recover planes with limited space available for landing and takeoff operations. They are designed to provide aerial support for military operations at sea, offering a mobile airbase for missions such as reconnaissance, search and rescue, and combat operations.
