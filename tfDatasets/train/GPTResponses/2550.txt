Treaties between indigenous peoples and governments or colonial powers formed an important part of political discourse in the late 20th and early 21st century. These treaties addressed issues such as sovereignty, self-determination, land rights, resource management, cultural preservation, and equality. Some of the most significant and contentious treaty negotiations in recent decades have taken place in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United States, and various Latin American countries. The recognition and implementation of these treaties have been the subject of ongoing debate and activism among indigenous peoples and their allies.
