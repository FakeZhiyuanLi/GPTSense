In early Oklahoma, agriculture and land investments were the most important types of investments. The state had a fertile soil, and investors purchased large plots of land to establish farms and ranches. Oil and gas exploration also started gaining importance in the early 1900s, making oil drilling and refining a significant investment. Additionally, investments in transportation infrastructure, such as railroads and highways, were crucial for economic growth and development.
