It is difficult to determine an exact percentage of alcohol by volume that beer achieves when re-pitched with champagne yeast as it depends on various factors such as the original alcohol content of the beer, the amount and type of yeast added, and the fermentation conditions. However, using champagne yeast for re-fermenting beer can increase the alcohol content by 1-2% ABV or more.
