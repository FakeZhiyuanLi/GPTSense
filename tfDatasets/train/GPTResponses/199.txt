The three jewels of the Buddhist tradition are:1. Buddha - the founder of Buddhism, who achieved enlightenment and taught the path to liberation from suffering.2. Dharma - the teachings of the Buddha, which guide practitioners in achieving liberation from suffering.3. Sangha - the community of Buddhist practitioners who support and encourage each other on the path to liberation.
