One of the oldest uses of solar energy is for heating, specifically for drying crops or food. People have been drying food using the sun's heat for thousands of years as a way to preserve and store food for long periods of time. This method was used in ancient civilizations such as Egypt, Greece, and Rome. Additionally, indigenous communities around the world have used solar energy for centuries, such as the Anasazi people in North America who built their homes to capture and utilize the sun's warmth.
