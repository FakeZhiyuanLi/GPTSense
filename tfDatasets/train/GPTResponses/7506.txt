Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India, played a significant role in improving the relations between India and Burma. He visited Burma several times, and his friendship with Burmese leaders, especially U Nu, helped strengthen the ties between the two countries. Additionally, Indian independence leader and one of Nehru's close associates, Subhas Chandra Bose, had established close relations with Burmese independence leaders, such as Aung San, which laid the foundation for future cooperation between India and Burma.
