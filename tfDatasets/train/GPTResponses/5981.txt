Companies who develop drugs for orphan diseases may be granted incentives and benefits by the government, such as exclusivity periods, tax credits, and grants. These incentives are aimed at encouraging research and development of treatments for rare diseases, which may not otherwise be a commercially viable venture for pharmaceutical companies due to the small patient pool.
