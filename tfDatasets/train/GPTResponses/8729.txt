There are several reasons why many Slavic languages have distanced themselves from Russian influences:1. Historical reasons: Many Slavic countries were under Soviet rule during the Cold War, and as a result, they wanted to distance themselves from their Russian oppressors.2. Linguistic differences: Slavic languages have different linguistic features and grammar rules, which makes it difficult for them to be influenced by Russian language.3. Cultural differences: Slavic countries have different cultural traditions, and they do not want to lose their cultural identity by adopting the language and customs of their Russian neighbors.4. Political reasons: Many Slavic countries have experienced political conflicts with Russia, such as territorial disputes, which have led to a desire to distance themselves from Russian influence.
