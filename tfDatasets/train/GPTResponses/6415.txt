The abolition of Valencia's ancient charters was carried out by King Philip V of Spain in 1707 as part of the Nueva Planta decrees, which were intended to centralize power and unify Spain under a single monarchy. These decrees abolished the traditional liberties and institutions of the Crown of Aragon, of which Valencia was a part.
