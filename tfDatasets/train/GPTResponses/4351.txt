Executive function thinking provides the ability to plan ahead and makes adolescents more skilled debaters. This type of thinking includes skills such as working memory, attention control, inhibitory control, mental flexibility, and goal setting. Adolescents with stronger executive function skills are better at organizing their thoughts, anticipating counterarguments, and presenting their ideas in a clear and persuasive manner during a debate. Additionally, these skills also allow them to plan their arguments ahead of time, strategize how to respond to their opponents' arguments, and adjust their approach as needed during the debate.
