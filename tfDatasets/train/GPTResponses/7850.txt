During the second phase of shoen development in Japan, the number of private estates or shoen expanded dramatically, and the size of the estates grew significantly. Wealthy landowners acquired land from smaller shoen and merged them to create larger and more efficient agricultural operations. This led to the growth of large and powerful landholding families and the emergence of a new social and political class of aristocrats. Additionally, the introduction of new agricultural techniques and technologies led to increased agricultural productivity and an increase in the production of agricultural surpluses, which further contributed to the growth of shoen.
