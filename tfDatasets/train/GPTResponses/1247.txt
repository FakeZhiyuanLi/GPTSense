In the 1890s, the term "Near East" mainly focused on the Ottoman Empire and its surrounding territories, including modern-day Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Israel/Palestine, and Iraq. These areas were of significant interest to European powers due to their strategic location and rich natural resources, such as oil and minerals. The term "Near East" was also associated with the idea of Orientalism, a cultural and intellectual movement that romanticized and exoticized the cultures of the East, particularly the Ottoman Empire.
