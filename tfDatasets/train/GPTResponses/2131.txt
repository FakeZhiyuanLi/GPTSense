The reddish-brown streaks in hickory wood are caused by the tunneling activity of the ambrosia beetle. The beetle infests the living hickory tree and spends its life tunneling through the wood, creating galleries that extend outward from the main tunnel. The reddish-brown staining is caused by a fungus that the beetle carries in its mandibles and introduces into the galleries as it burrows through the wood. The beetle and the fungus work together to break down the wood, making it more suitable for the beetle to feed on. Over time, the tunnels and galleries created by the beetle and the fungus will cause the hickory wood to become discolored and weakened, making it less valuable as lumber.
