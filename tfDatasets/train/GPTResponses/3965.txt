Chyme mixes with digestive enzymes, bile, and bicarbonate in the duodenum. The digestive enzymes come from the pancreas and the bile comes from the liver and is stored in the gallbladder. The bicarbonate is secreted by the pancreas and neutralizes the acidic chyme from the stomach, creating a more alkaline environment for digestion to occur.
