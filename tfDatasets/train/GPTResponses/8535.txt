The demands for changes that Nicholas II later refused came from a wide range of groups including the proletariat, the peasants, the intelligentsia, and various political parties such as the Social Democrats and the Liberals. The demands included a call for democratic reforms, civil liberties, land reform, and an end to the autocratic rule of the Tsar. The demands also included demands for better working conditions, higher wages, and an end to oppressive government policies such as censorship and police brutality.
