The total immune system is generally composed of the following structures:1. Primary lymphoid organs: These organs include the bone marrow and thymus, where immune cells are produced and matured.2. Secondary lymphoid organs: These organs include the lymph nodes, spleen, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (such as the tonsils and Peyer's patches in the gut), where immune cells gather and interact with foreign substances.3. Immune cells: These include various types of white blood cells, such as T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages, which are responsible for recognizing, attacking, and eliminating pathogens.4. Antibodies: These are proteins produced by B cells that specifically target and neutralize foreign substances.5. Complement system: This is a group of proteins that work together to enhance the immune response, killing pathogens directly or marking them for destruction by immune cells.6. Cytokines: These are signaling molecules produced by immune cells that regulate the immune response and coordinate communication between immune cells.
