Swans have been marked in several ways for scientific study and management purposes. Some methods include:1. Leg Bands: Swans are often fitted with metal or plastic leg bands that have unique identification numbers. These bands are lightweight and do not interfere with the bird's movement.2. Neck Collars: Neck collars, also known as neckbands, are made of plastic and are attached around the swan's neck. These collars may have identification numbers or other markings on them.3. Wing Tags: Wing tags are usually made of plastic and are attached to the swan's wing feathers. They usually have identification numbers or other markings on them.4. Radio Transmitters: Radio transmitters are devices that are attached to the swan's body and emit radio signals that can be tracked by researchers. These devices can provide information on the swan's movements, behavior, and habitat use.5. GPS Transmitters: GPS transmitters are similar to radio transmitters but use GPS technology to track the swan's movements. These devices can provide more accurate information on the swan's location and movement patterns.
