Despite the collapse of the Roman Empire, literate men continued to acknowledge Virgil as a master poet. This is because his works, particularly the Aeneid, had a significant impact on Western literature and culture. Virgil's poetry and ideas were influential in shaping the literary and cultural traditions that followed in Rome and beyond. Even in the dark ages of Europe, Virgil's works were revered and sought after by scholars and poets alike, and his influence on the Western literary canon remains strong today.
