The church condemned witches throughout history, but one of the most significant periods of witch hunts was during the medieval and early modern period, particularly in the 16th and 17th centuries. For example, in 1484, Pope Innocent VIII issued the papal bull "Summis desiderantes affectibus," which condemned witchcraft and authorized the Inquisition to investigate and prosecute cases of heresy and witchcraft. The church's condemnation of witches continued throughout this period and beyond, leading to numerous witch trials and persecutions across Europe and in colonial America.
