The final patina on metal surfaces is generally a complex mixture of various compounds, including metal oxides, carbonates, sulfates, and chlorides. The specific composition and appearance of the patina can depend on factors such as the type of metal, environmental conditions, and exposure to various chemical substances. Some common components of metal patinas include iron oxide (rust), copper carbonate (verdigris), and zinc carbonate (white rust). However, the exact mixture of compounds can vary greatly depending on the specific circumstances of the patina formation.
