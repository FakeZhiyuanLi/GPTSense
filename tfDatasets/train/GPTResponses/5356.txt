Christians believe that Isaiah 7:14 prophesized the birth of Jesus Christ. The verse states, "Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel." Christians interpret this as a reference to the miraculous virgin birth of Jesus Christ, who is referred to as Immanuel meaning "God with us" throughout the New Testament.
