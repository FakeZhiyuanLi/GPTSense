Institutional corruption is distinguished from individual or petty corruption. Institutional corruption involves the systemic and pervasive misuse of power within an organization or institution, while individual or petty corruption refers to corruption that occurs on a smaller scale, typically involving an individual abusing their power for personal gain.
