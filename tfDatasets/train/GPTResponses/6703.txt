Rose windows can be found in the facades of cathedrals, but they are not always present in this location. Some cathedrals may have rose windows located in other parts of the building, such as the transept or the apse. Additionally, some Gothic cathedrals may not have a rose window at all, and instead have other types of decorative windows or ornamentation.
