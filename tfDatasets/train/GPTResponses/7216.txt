The properties of speed and torque are determined by a number of factors including the design of the motor or engine, the voltage or current supplied to the motor, the type and quality of the materials used in the motor, and the load or resistance the motor is working against. The number and size of the coils, magnets, and other components in the motor also have an impact on its performance. Additionally, the gears, transmission, and other mechanical components of a device can affect the speed and torque output of a motor. Finally, factors such as temperature, vibration, and wear can impact the performance of a motor over time.
