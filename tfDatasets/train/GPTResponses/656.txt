is now known as Mahayana Buddhism. Instead, the term "Mahayana" initially referred to a set of bodhisattva practices and ideals that were held by certain Buddhist practitioners, including the view that enlightenment is achievable not only for oneself but for all beings, and the practice of the six perfections (generosity, ethical conduct, patience, diligence, meditative concentration, and wisdom). These practices and ideals became associated with certain Buddhist texts and were further developed over time, eventually leading to the emergence of what is now known as Mahayana Buddhism as a distinct tradition.
