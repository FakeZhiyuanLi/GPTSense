Yes, the FBI under the leadership of J. Edgar Hoover targeted Martin Luther King Jr. with surveillance and harassment in the 1960s due to his civil rights activism and criticism of segregation and the Vietnam War. The FBI wiretapped King's phones, planted bugs in his hotel rooms, and sent him threatening letters in an effort to discredit and intimidate him. This was revealed in documents released by the FBI and congressional investigations in the 1970s.
