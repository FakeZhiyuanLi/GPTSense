There are a variety of factors thought to possibly cause neurobehavioral alterations, including:1. Genetics: certain genes have been linked to an increased risk of neurobehavioral disorders such as autism, ADHD, and schizophrenia.2. Environmental factors: exposure to toxins such as lead or mercury, infections during pregnancy, or traumatic brain injury can all impact the brain's development and potentially lead to neurobehavioral alterations.3. Hormonal imbalances: certain hormones such as cortisol and estrogen play a crucial role in brain development and function, and imbalances in these hormones may contribute to neurobehavioral alterations.4. Nutrition: inadequate intake of certain nutrients, such as omega-3 fatty acids and B vitamins, has been linked to an increased risk of neurobehavioral disorders.5. Stress: chronic or severe stress can have lasting effects on brain function and may increase the risk of developing neurobehavioral disorders.
