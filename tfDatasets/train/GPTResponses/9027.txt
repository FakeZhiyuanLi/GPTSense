Asthma is clinically classified based on the frequency and severity of symptoms, as well as the level of lung function impairment.According to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines, asthma is classified into four categories:1. Intermittent asthma: Symptoms occur less than two days a week and nocturnal symptoms occur less than two nights per month. Lung function is normal between exacerbations.2. Mild persistent asthma: Symptoms occur more than twice a week and less than once a day. Nocturnal symptoms occur more than two nights per month. Lung function is at least 80% of predicted normal.3. Moderate persistent asthma: Symptoms occur daily, and nocturnal symptoms occur more than once a week. Lung function is between 60% and 80% of predicted normal.4. Severe persistent asthma: Symptoms occur throughout the day, and nocturnal symptoms occur more than once a week. Lung function is less than 60% of predicted normal.Other factors that might influence the classification of asthma include age, comorbidities, exposure to environmental triggers, and response to treatment.
