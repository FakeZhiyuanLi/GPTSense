Some other modern materials that have joined composites, carbon fiber, titanium, and aluminum to replace wood in the manufacture of sporting equipment are:1. Fiberglass: Fiberglass is a type of composite material made from fine fibers of glass. It is lightweight, strong, and durable, making it a common material in the construction of sporting goods like boats, kayaks, and surfboards.2. Kevlar: Kevlar is a synthetic fiber that is five times stronger than steel, but much lighter. It is commonly used in the construction of helmets, body armor, and other protective gear for contact sports like football and hockey.3. Graphene: Graphene is a thin, lightweight material made from carbon atoms. It is incredibly strong, flexible, and conductive, and is starting to be used in the construction of tennis rackets, skis, and other sporting goods.4. Ceramics: Ceramics are strong, lightweight materials that are often used in the construction of high-performance bicycle frames and other equipment where weight is a critical factor.5. Plastics: High-performance plastics like polycarbonate and polyethylene are often used in the construction of sports equipment like snowboards, hockey sticks, and lacrosse sticks. They are lightweight, durable, and can be molded into complex shapes.
