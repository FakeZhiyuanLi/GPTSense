The foundation of samadhi/bhavana is mindfulness and concentration. Mindfulness is being fully present in the present moment, without judgment or distraction, while concentration is the ability to focus the mind on a single object or point of attention. These two qualities work together to cultivate samadhi, which is a state of deep concentration and tranquility, and bhavana, which is the cultivation of positive mental states such as loving kindness or compassion. Through consistent practice of mindfulness and concentration, one can develop a stable and focused mind, which can lead to profound states of samadhi and bhavana.
