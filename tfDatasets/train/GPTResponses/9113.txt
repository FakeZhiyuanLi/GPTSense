The definition of literature began to narrow during the Modernist literary movement, which began in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Modernist writers focused on the inner workings of the human mind and explored issues such as alienation, fragmentation, and uncertainty. They often used experimental techniques and rejected traditional narrative structures in favor of more fragmented and impressionistic styles of writing. This narrow focus on a specific style and subject matter led to the exclusion of other forms of writing, such as popular fiction and non-fiction works.
