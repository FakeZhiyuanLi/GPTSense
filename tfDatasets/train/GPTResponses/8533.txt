Supply-side economics sought to increase the amount of money in the market by reducing taxes and regulations on businesses and individuals, with the belief that this would stimulate economic growth and ultimately result in increased tax revenue for the government. The theory held that by lowering taxes on businesses, they would have more money to invest in their operations, which would lead to increased productivity, job creation, and ultimately, greater output and economic growth. This was also known as "trickle-down economics," as the benefits of the tax cuts were believed to trickle down to lower-income individuals and households, through increased employment opportunities and higher wages. In addition, supply-side economics also aimed to reduce government spending and balance the budget, which was seen as a way to decrease inflation and increase confidence in the economy.
