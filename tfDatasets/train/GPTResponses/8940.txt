The French Constitution recognizes Alsatian as part of France's cultural heritage and promotes regional languages, including Alsatian. However, French remains the official language of the country and is the language of government and administration. In the Alsace region, Alsatian is recognized as a minority language and is taught in schools as an optional subject.
