The Reform Acts of 1832, 1867 and 1884 increased the power of the House of Commons by granting more people the right to vote, reducing the influence of the aristocracy and redistributing seats in Parliament to better reflect the population. These reforms helped to create a more democratic and representative government in Britain.
