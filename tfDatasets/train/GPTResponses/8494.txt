Mathematicians try to reach a level of absolute certainty or absolute truth with math concepts. They strive to prove mathematical theorems and conjectures with rigorous and logical processes. The rigorous proofs and logical processes ensure that the mathematical results are reproducible and universally accepted. Hence, the finality level that mathematicians try to reach with mathematical concepts is very high.
