is called the Earth's crust. The crust comprises the outermost layer of the Earth, and it spans the continents, ocean floors, and other geological features. The crust is divided into several large plates that float and move on the Earth's mantle. These movements, along with other geological processes, shape the Earth's surface and create the different landscapes we see today.
