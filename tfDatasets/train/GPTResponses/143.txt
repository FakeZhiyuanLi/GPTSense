There are various modern types of primality tests available for general numbers n. Some of them are:1. AKS primality test: It is a deterministic primality test based on the theory of cyclotomic fields.2. Miller-Rabin primality test: It is a probabilistic primality test that uses the concept of strong pseudoprimes.3. Solovay-Strassen primality test: It is a probabilistic primality test that uses the Euler's criterion and the concept of strong pseudoprimes.4. Lucas-Lehmer primality test: It is a deterministic primality test used specifically for Mersenne numbers of the form 2^p-1.5. Baillie-PSW primality test: It is a probabilistic primality test that combines the Lucas test with the Miller-Rabin test.6. Adleman-Pomerance-Rumely primality test: It is a deterministic primality test based on the theory of elliptic curves.7. Atkin-Morain primality test: It is a probabilistic primality test based on the theory of elliptic curves.8. Agrawal-Kayal-Saxena primality test: It is a deterministic primality test based on the polynomial-time algorithm.Overall, there are numerous modern types of primality tests that exist each with its own set of advantages and limitations.
