Self-psychology recognizes that human experience and behavior cannot be fully understood or explained without acknowledging the interconnectedness of the personal self and the larger self.This investigation includes exploring how individuals form their sense of identity and how they perceive and interact with the world around them. Self-psychology seeks to understand the dynamics between the personal self and the larger self, including how individuals relate to others, their environment, and the spiritual or existential aspects of life.For some, the larger self may be understood as a higher power or divine entity, while for others it may be seen as the interconnectedness of all beings and the universe. Regardless of how it is defined, self-psychology recognizes the importance of exploring and understanding the relationship between the personal self and the larger self for a more holistic understanding of human experience and behavior.
