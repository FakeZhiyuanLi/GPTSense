The verdict at the Council of Sardica, also known as the Council of Serdica, was the recognition of Julius I as the rightful Pope by most of the Eastern bishops in attendance. The council also established new rules for the handling of disputes between bishops and allowed appeals to be made to Rome. Ultimately, the Council did not heal the major rift between the Eastern and Western branches of Christianity, but instead deepened it.
