In modern Orthodoxy, a central role is assigned to the study and observance of Jewish law (halakha) and Jewish tradition. This includes the belief in the authority of the Talmudic sages and a commitment to the values of Torah study, prayer, and acts of kindness (chesed) as essential components of religious life. Additionally, modern Orthodoxy places a strong emphasis on the balance between religious commitments and engagement with modern secular society.
