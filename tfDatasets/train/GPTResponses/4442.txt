is known as the "digital computer metaphor" which suggests that human cognition can be understood as the input, storage, and output of information through mental processes. This perspective was derived primarily from the study of artificial intelligence, cognitive psychology, and neuroscience. Researchers in this field are interested in how the brain processes incoming sensory information, stores it in memory, retrieves it, and uses it to guide behavior. They also study how attention, perception, language, and problem-solving skills develop over time through interactions with the environment.
