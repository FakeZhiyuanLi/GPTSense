Theories related to human emotional arousal have been developed by several psychologists, but one of the most comprehensive theories is the James-Lange theory, named after its originators, William James and Carl Lange. The theory proposes that physiological changes occur in response to a stimulus, which then leads to the experience of an emotion. This theory suggests that the experience of emotion is directly related to bodily responses, and different emotions are associated with unique patterns of physiological responses.
