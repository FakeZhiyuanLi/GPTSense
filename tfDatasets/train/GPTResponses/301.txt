The doctrine that rejects the idea of permanent self is called anatta or anatman in Buddhism. This concept asserts that there is no eternal soul, and that the notion of a permanent self or ego is an illusion created by the mind. According to Buddhism, all phenomena, including humans, are impermanent and subject to constant change, therefore, there is no unchanging entity that can be called 'self'. The belief in anatta is essential to understanding Buddhist teachings and is considered a key component of achieving enlightenment.
