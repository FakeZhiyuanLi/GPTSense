The Alps are a major tourist destination, attracting millions of visitors every year to enjoy the mountain scenery, skiing, hiking, and other outdoor activities. Many communities in the Alps rely heavily on tourism for their economic well-being, and the industry supports a wide range of businesses, from hotels and restaurants to ski resorts and outdoor equipment retailers.
