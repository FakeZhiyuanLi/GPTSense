that can affect plant growth?1. Light: The intensity and quality of light that a plant receives can affect its growth and development. Plants require light for photosynthesis, which is the process of converting light energy into chemical energy that fuels plant growth. If a plant does not receive enough light, it may not grow as rapidly or may become leggy and weak. Similarly, if a plant receives too much light, it may experience sunburn or excessive water loss, which can also inhibit growth.2. Water: Water is another crucial environmental factor that can impact plant growth. Plants need water to photosynthesize, transport nutrients, and maintain turgor pressure, which is essential for cell structure and function. If a plant does not receive enough water, it may wilt or die. Conversely, if a plant receives too much water, it may develop root rot or other diseases, which can also inhibit growth. The amount of water a plant needs varies depending on its species, environmental conditions, and stage of growth.
