If the alleles on the chromatids are the same, there will be no effect arising from genetic recombination because there will be no exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes during meiosis. Genetic recombination occurs when there is a crossing over of DNA segments between homologous chromosomes, leading to the production of gametes with new genetic combinations. Therefore, if the alleles on the chromatids are the same, there will be no genetic recombination, and the resulting gametes will be identical to the parent cell.
