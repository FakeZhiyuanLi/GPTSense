By the 18th century, Czech had developed into a standardized literary language, based on the central Bohemian dialect, called "Common Czech" or "Standard Czech". This language was used in literature, journalism, and official documents, and served as a unifying force for Czech cultural and national identity. Additionally, the Czech language had also influenced and absorbed German loanwords, due to the proximity and historical influence of the German-speaking regions.
