Experiments in the 1940s to 1950s showed that the molecular repository of genetic information is DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). This was demonstrated through several famous experiments, including the transformation experiments done by Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty in 1944, the Hershey-Chase experiment in 1952, and the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953. These experiments provided overwhelming evidence that DNA is the genetic material responsible for passing on hereditary traits from one generation to the next.
