In countries where there is no formal deal, prosecuting bribes can be difficult because there may be no clear legal framework or guidelines for what constitutes bribery. This can make it difficult for law enforcement officials to gather evidence and build a case against individuals suspected of engaging in bribery. Additionally, corruption and bribery may be seen as a normalized or accepted part of the culture in some countries, making it harder to create meaningful changes in attitude and behavior around the issue. Finally, corruption and bribery often involve complex networks and schemes that are difficult to unravel, further complicating the process of prosecution.
