The FBI operates Legat (Legal Attach√©) offices in foreign countries to facilitate cooperation with foreign law enforcement agencies and to gather intelligence on international criminal activities that may impact the United States. These offices also facilitate the exchange of information and evidence between the FBI and foreign law enforcement agencies, which can help to more effectively investigate and prosecute transnational crimes such as terrorism, drug trafficking, cybercrime, and human trafficking. The Legat offices also help to protect U.S. citizens and interests abroad and provide support to the FBI's overall mission to protect the United States from foreign threats.
