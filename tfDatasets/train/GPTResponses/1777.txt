RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a type of nucleic acid that is essential in the process of protein synthesis. RNA carries genetic information from DNA to ribosomes, where it serves as a template for the production of proteins. RNA molecules are made up of nucleotides, like DNA, but instead of thymine, RNA contains uracil. RNA also plays a role in regulating gene expression and can act as an enzyme in certain biological reactions.
