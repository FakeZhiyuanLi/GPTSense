The study of symmetry is called symmetry analysis or symmetry theory. It involves exploring the properties of objects and systems that are preserved under certain transformations, such as rotations, reflections, translations, and combinations of these. This field is important in many areas of mathematics, physics, chemistry, engineering, and art, as symmetry plays a fundamental role in understanding the structure, behavior, and aesthetics of natural and man-made systems. Some specific areas of study within symmetry theory include group theory, crystallography, topology, and representation theory.
