A fatal four-way match is a type of professional wrestling match where four wrestlers compete against each other. The match can be a standard pinfall or submission match or an elimination match where wrestlers are eliminated one at a time. The match continues until one wrestler is left standing or wins by pinfall or submission. The rules and stipulations of the match can vary depending on the promotion and event. In a fatal four-way, the action tends to be fast-paced and unpredictable as multiple wrestlers are vying for victory at the same time, often resulting in chaotic and exciting moments.
