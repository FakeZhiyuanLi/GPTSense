There is no direct or genetic relationship between Indo-Iranian and Baltic languages. Indo-Iranian languages belong to the Indo-European language family, while Baltic languages belong to the Baltic group of languages within the same family. However, there may have been some historical and cultural interactions between the Indo-Iranian and Baltic-speaking peoples, which might have led to some linguistic borrowing and influences on both languages.
