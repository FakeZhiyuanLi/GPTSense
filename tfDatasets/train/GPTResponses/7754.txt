In ancient times, the first scientists would have been considered philosophers. They were interested in understanding the natural world and the laws that governed it. They asked questions about the universe, the planets, the stars, and the elements, and sought to find answers through observation and reasoning. They believed that knowledge could be gained through logical deduction and empirical evidence, and many of their ideas formed the basis of modern science.
