The responsibility for stage hand duties, lighting, sound, and management can depend on the specific production or event. However, typically, stage hands are responsible for setting up and taking down equipment, props, and scenery. Lighting and sound crew are responsible for controlling the lighting and sound effects for the performance. Management is responsible for overseeing the event and making sure everything runs smoothly. In some cases, all of these responsibilities may be under the direction of a production manager or director.
