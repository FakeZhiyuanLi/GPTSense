No, not all political prisoners were released due to the 2012 elections in Burma (also known as Myanmar). While the elections did lead to some political reforms and the release of a significant number of political prisoners, there were still many who remained in detention or were continuously being arrested. In fact, it wasn't until several years later, in 2016, that the government announced the release of over 200 political prisoners, including some who had been imprisoned for decades. However, even after that, there have still been reports of political prisoners being jailed, indicating that there is still work left to be done to resolve the ongoing issue of political repression in Myanmar.
