Navigation can be based on several factors, including:1. GPS (Global Positioning System): GPS is a satellite-based navigation system that provides accurate location and time information anywhere on earth.2. Map and route planning: Navigation can also be based on pre-planned routes and maps. The user enters a destination, and the navigation system calculates the fastest or most efficient way to get there.3. Landmarks: Landmarks such as buildings, statues, or other distinctive features can also be used to navigate. This is especially useful in urban areas where GPS might not be accurate.4. Compass: Navigation can also be based on a compass, which can provide directional guidance.5. Visual cues: Navigation can also be based on visual cues, such as road signs and landmarks, that guide a person to their destination.
