An MSP (Member of Scottish Parliament) may introduce a bill as a Private Members Bill. Private Members Bills are initiated by individual MSPs rather than the government, and can cover a wide range of topics. However, the chances of a Private Members Bill becoming law are generally considered to be relatively low, as they have limited parliamentary time allocated to them.
