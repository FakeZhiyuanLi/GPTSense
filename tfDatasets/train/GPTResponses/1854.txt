The black Checked pattern in western hemlock wood is caused by a fungus called Phaeolus schweinitzii or "black stain root disease." This fungus discolors and weakens the sapwood of trees, making it desirable for insects and other decay organisms. The black check pattern is a result of the uneven growth of the fungus within the wood, which creates alternating bands of stained and unstained wood. While the black check pattern can detract from the appearance of the wood, it does not affect its structural integrity.
