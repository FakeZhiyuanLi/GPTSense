A contemporary lawyer would discuss a case where an ancient judge-made common law principle was applied and used as precedent in a modern legal dispute or issue. The lawyer might analyze the historical context and evolution of the principle, as well as its relevance and application to the current case. They may also argue for or against the continued use of the principle in modern legal practice.
