Peer influence is one large determining factor in normative adolescent behavior. Adolescents tend to conform to the behaviors and attitudes of their peers in order to fit in and be accepted. This can lead to the adoption of certain behaviors that may not be entirely healthy or positive, but are viewed as normal within the adolescent's peer group. Peer pressure can be a strong influence on adolescent behavior, but it is important for individuals to make their own decisions and choose behaviors that align with their personal values and beliefs.
