The amount of rain received in the region where Burma (also known as Myanmar) is located can vary depending on the time of year and location within the country. Generally, Myanmar experiences a monsoon climate, which means there are distinctive wet and dry seasons. The wet season typically lasts from May to October, when the southwest monsoon brings heavy rainfall to much of the country. The dry season usually occurs from November to April, when rainfall decreases significantly.In terms of specific numbers, the annual average rainfall in Yangon (Myanmar's largest city) is around 2,500 millimeters (98 inches), while Mandalay (another major city) receives around 760 millimeters (30 inches) of rainfall per year. However, some areas in the country, particularly in the mountainous regions, can receive much higher amounts of rainfall. For example, the town of Mawlamyine (located in southeastern Myanmar) receives an average of 5,000 millimeters (197 inches) of rainfall per year.
