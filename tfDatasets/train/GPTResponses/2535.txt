The Detroit techno development was started by three African American musicians: Juan Atkins, Kevin Saunderson, and Derrick May. They are collectively known as the Belleville Three, named after the high school they attended in Belleville, Michigan. They started experimenting with electronic music in the late 1970s and early 1980s, blending elements of funk, soul, and electro with the use of synthesizers and drum machines. Their innovative sound and style laid the foundation for Detroit techno, which has since influenced electronic dance music around the world.
