Researchers believe that social event reporting by adolescents is important because it is a window into their social lives, their peer relationships, and the norms and values that govern their behavior. Adolescents are socially active and participate in a wide range of social events such as parties, hanging out with friends, going to the movies, etc. These social events provide opportunities for them to interact with their peers, establish friendships, and learn social skills. By reporting on these events, researchers can gain valuable insights into adolescent behavior, including their use of drugs and alcohol, their sexual behavior, and their attitudes towards various issues. Additionally, social event reporting is less stigmatized and more socially acceptable for adolescents to report on, making it a more reliable source of information than sexual activity reporting.
