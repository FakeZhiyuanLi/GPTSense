The color difference between heartwood and sapwood can vary between different tree species, but it is usually noticeable, ranging from subtle to conspicuous. Heartwood is usually darker and richer in color than sapwood, which tends to be lighter due to the presence of living cells. The color difference can also depend on the age of the tree and the amount of exposure to light and other environmental factors. In some species, such as walnut, the contrast between heartwood and sapwood is very striking, while in others, such as pine, it is more subtle.
