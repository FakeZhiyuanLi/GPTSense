Wood's breaking strength is susceptible to many factors including the type of wood, its moisture content, knots and defects, grain orientation, and the direction of load applied. The condition and size of the structural component also affect its breaking strength. Additionally, temperature, duration of the load, and frequency of cyclic loading can all impact the breaking strength of wood.
