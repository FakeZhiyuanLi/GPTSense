Smallpox had the biggest decline of deaths as a result of global efforts to contain and eradicate the disease. The last known natural case of smallpox occurred in Somalia in 1977, and the disease was declared eradicated by the World Health Organization in 1980. Before the development of vaccines and eradication campaigns, smallpox caused an estimated 300-500 million deaths in the 20th century alone.
