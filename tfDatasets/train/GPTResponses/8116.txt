In the 1790s, Erasmus Darwin outlined his theory of evolution in his book "Zoonomia, or The Laws of Organic Life." He proposed that all forms of life had evolved from a common ancestor through a process of natural selection. Darwin also suggested that traits acquired during an organism's lifetime could be passed down to their offspring, a theory later known as Lamarckism. He also described the concept of sexual selection and argued that the environment played a significant role in evolution. Darwin's theory had a significant impact on the development of evolutionary thought leading up to and after Charles Darwin's publication of "On the Origin of Species" in 1859.
