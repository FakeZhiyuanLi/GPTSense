Monastics are instructed by the Buddha to live as ascetics or renunciants, giving up worldly possessions and pleasures to pursue a life of spiritual development and service to others. They are also instructed to follow the monastic rules and guidelines set forth by the Buddha, including celibacy, simplicity, and mindfulness in all aspects of daily life.
