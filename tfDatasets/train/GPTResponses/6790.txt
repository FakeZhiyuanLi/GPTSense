A character can be owned by an individual, an author, a filmmaker, a comic book artist, a video game designer, a cartoonist, or any other creator who invents and develops the character. Additionally, characters can be owned by organizations such as non-profit groups, educational institutions, or government agencies. Legal entities such as trusts or estates can also own characters.
