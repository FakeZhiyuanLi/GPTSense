Some poets who are closely aligned with Cubism are Guillaume Apollinaire, Pierre Reverdy, and Max Jacob. They were associated with the Cubist movement in Paris in the early 20th century and wrote poetry that echoed the principles of Cubism, such as fragmentation, multiple perspectives, and the use of collage techniques in art. These poets were known for their experimental styles and their exploration of language and form.
