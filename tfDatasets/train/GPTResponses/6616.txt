it called its "Arctic drilling program" in the Alaskan Chukchi Sea for the remainder of the year. This decision was made after a series of mishaps, equipment failures, and harsh weather conditions that had plagued its attempts to drill for oil in the region. The announcement was seen as a major setback for Shell's ambitious plans to source a significant amount of its crude oil from the Arctic region, a move that had been opposed by environmental groups and some indigenous communities. The company stated that it would use the pause to reevaluate its plans and ensure it had the proper permits and equipment to safely drill in the Arctic in the future.
