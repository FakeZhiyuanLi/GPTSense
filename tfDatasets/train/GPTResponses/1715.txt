The route a migrating bird follows largely depends on its species and its breeding and wintering grounds. However, many bird species follow established routes known as flyways. There are four major flyways in North America: the Atlantic flyway, the Mississippi flyway, the Central flyway, and the Pacific flyway. Migrating birds generally follow these flyways and often make stops at specific hotspots along the way to rest and refuel before continuing on their journey. Some birds also follow landmarks, such as mountains or coastlines, as they navigate their way to their destination.
