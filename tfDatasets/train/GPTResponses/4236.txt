The extracellular matrix (ECM) surrounding eukaryotic cells is primarily made up of proteins such as collagen, elastin, fibronectin, and laminin. These proteins are secreted by the cells and assembled outside the cell membrane to form a network of fibers that provide structural support to the cell. The ECM also contains other molecules such as glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans which help to regulate cell behavior and provide a barrier against pathogens.
