Reptiles are cold-blooded, which means their internal body temperature is regulated by the temperature of their surroundings. They cannot bear cold temperatures because it can slow down their metabolism, disrupt their bodily functions, and even cause them to go into a state of torpor or hibernation. To survive in colder climates, reptiles may hibernate, migrate to warmer areas, or seek shelter in protected areas such as rock crevices, burrows, or underground dens. Some reptiles, such as turtles and tortoises, may also rely on basking in the sun to warm up and regulate their body temperature.
