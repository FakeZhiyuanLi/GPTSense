The toxicity of copper salt in animals depends on various factors such as the species, age, sex, weight, and health status. In general, copper toxicity can occur when animals are exposed to high levels of copper in their diet or environment, leading to liver damage, hemolysis (rupture of red blood cells), and death. The lethal dose of copper in animals varies widely, but as a general guideline, it is considered toxic at concentrations above 5 ppm (parts per million) in the diet for ruminants (such as cattle and sheep) and above 0.5 ppm for non-ruminants (such as pigs and poultry). However, toxicity may occur at lower concentrations under certain circumstances, such as high dietary iron or molybdenum levels, or genetic mutations that impair copper metabolism. Therefore, it is important to consult a veterinarian or animal nutritionist to determine the safe copper levels for specific animals and diets.
