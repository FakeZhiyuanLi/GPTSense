Choline is not an example of a vitamin. Although it is often grouped with other B-vitamins, choline is not officially classified as a vitamin since it can be synthesized by the body in small amounts. However, choline is still considered an essential nutrient and has important roles in the body, including aiding in cell membrane structure, neurotransmitter production, and liver function.
