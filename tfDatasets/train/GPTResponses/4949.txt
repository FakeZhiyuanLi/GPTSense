with a computer?Yes, short-range Bluetooth accessories, such as wireless keyboards, mice, and speakers, can be used with a computer that has Bluetooth capabilities. Most modern computers have built-in Bluetooth, but if your computer doesn't have Bluetooth, you can purchase a Bluetooth adapter to use with it. Once connected, the computer will recognize and pair with the Bluetooth accessory, allowing you to use it wirelessly with your computer.
