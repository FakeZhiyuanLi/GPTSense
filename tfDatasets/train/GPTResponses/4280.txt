The original Xbox did not fare well in Japan. It launched in February 2002, several months after its release in North America, and struggled to gain a foothold in the Japanese market. One of the main reasons for this was that the console was seen as primarily targeting Western audiences with its focus on first-person shooters and sports games, which were not as popular in Japan. Additionally, the Xbox faced competition from established consoles like the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube, which were better suited to Japanese gaming preferences. As a result, the Xbox struggled to sell in Japan and its market share remained relatively low throughout its lifespan.
