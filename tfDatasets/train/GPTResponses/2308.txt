The Acid House Tour, which featured DJ sets and live performances by artists such as Danny Rampling, Paul Oakenfold, and Nicky Holloway, is often credited with bringing House music to the mainstream in the UK in the late 80s. The tour included events at venues such as the London nightclub Heaven and Manchester's Hacienda nightclub.
