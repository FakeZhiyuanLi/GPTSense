The starvation of 80 million people in the Soviet Union did not occur. However, there were two major famines in the Soviet Union in the 20th century: the famine of 1921-1922 and the famine of 1932-1933.The famine of 1921-1922 was caused by a combination of factors, including a drought, a civil war, and economic policies that led to a shortage of food. The Soviet government’s policy of requisitioning grain from the farmers also contributed to the famine.The famine of 1932-1933, known as the Holodomor, was deliberately caused by the Soviet government as a result of its policies of collectivization and forced grain requisitioning. The government’s policies led to a decline in agricultural productivity and harvests and left millions of people without access to food. The Soviet government also restricted the movement of people and food, making it difficult for people to access food in other areas.Overall, both famines were caused by a combination of natural disasters, poor economic policies, and government actions that limited access to food.
