Behaviorists identified emotion with observable behaviors, such as facial expressions, bodily reactions, and verbal responses, rather than with internal mental states or feelings. They believed that emotions could be explained through the process of classical conditioning, in which a neutral stimulus is repeatedly paired with a stimulus that elicits an emotional response, leading the neutral stimulus to become associated with the emotion and eventually eliciting the response on its own. In this way, behaviorists emphasized the role of environmental factors and learning in shaping emotions, rather than innate or biological factors.
