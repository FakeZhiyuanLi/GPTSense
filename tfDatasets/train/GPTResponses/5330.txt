There were several states of affairs that produced revelations and problems for Elizabeth:1. The death of her sister, Queen Mary I, in 1558, which made Elizabeth the Queen of England.2. Elizabeth's adherence to Protestantism in a predominantly Catholic country, which caused tensions between her and her Catholic subjects.3. Her unmarried status and lack of an heir, which led to concerns about succession and the stability of the monarchy.4. The involvement of Elizabeth's advisors, such as William Cecil and Robert Dudley, in her personal and political affairs, which led to accusations of favoritism and corruption.5. The threat of foreign invasion, particularly from Spain, which led to the development of a powerful navy and increased military spending.6. The rise of Catholic plots against Elizabeth, including the 1571 Ridolfi Plot and the 1586 Babington Plot, which revealed the depth of Catholic opposition to her reign.7. The execution of her cousin, Mary Queen of Scots, in 1587, which sparked outrage among Catholics and led to increased tensions with Spain.
