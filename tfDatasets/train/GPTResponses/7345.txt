One thing that can be used in place of pesticides is integrated pest management (IPM). IPM involves using a combination of non-chemical methods such as crop rotation, biological controls, natural predators, and physical barriers to manage pests. This approach can reduce the amount of pesticides needed and is often more sustainable and environmentally friendly.
