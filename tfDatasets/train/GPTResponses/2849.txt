Incunabula (or incunables) refers to books, pamphlets, or other printed materials that were produced using moveable type printing technology in Europe prior to the year 1501. These early printed materials are usually characterized by distinctive features such as Gothic fonts, woodcut illustrations, and hand-colored initial letters. The term "incunabula" comes from the Latin word for "swaddling clothes" or "cradle," reflecting the fact that these printed works are seen as the infancy of printing technology.
