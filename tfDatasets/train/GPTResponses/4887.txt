is known as the self-presentation or impression management. It refers to the intentional efforts of individuals to shape and control how they are perceived by others. This process includes the selection of particular behaviors, attitudes, and appearance cues that are consistent with the desired image or identity. The self-presentation can also involve strategic use of language and nonverbal communication to convey a particular impression to others. Ultimately, the success of self-presentation depends on how well it aligns with the perceptions and expectations of the audience.
