The sentiment that persists even though racial and colonial definitions of the Middle East are no longer ideologically sound is the belief in cultural and religious stereotypes. Many individuals still hold stereotypical beliefs and attitudes towards people from the Middle East, such as seeing them as backward, violent, and oppressive towards women. These beliefs have been perpetuated through media representations and political rhetoric, despite being inaccurate and harmful. Additionally, there is often a tendency to lump all countries in the Middle East together, disregarding the diversity of cultures and experiences within the region.
