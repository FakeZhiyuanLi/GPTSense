Shorebirds: Many species of shorebirds, such as sandpipers and plovers, stop at coastal areas to rest and refuel before continuing their migration.2. Warblers: These small songbirds are known for their bright colors and beautiful songs. Many species stop in forested areas to rest and feed on insects and fruit.3. Waterfowl: Ducks, geese, and other waterfowl may stop at lakes, rivers, and wetlands to rest and feed on aquatic plants and invertebrates.4. Raptors: Birds of prey, such as hawks and eagles, may stop at areas with high thermals, which they use to soar and conserve energy during their migration.5. Swallows: These small, agile birds may stop at areas with large insect populations to feed before continuing their migration.6. Thrushes: These medium-sized songbirds may stop at woodland areas to rest and feed on berries and insects before continuing their migration.Overall, many bird species stop at different locations during their migratory journey to rest, feed, and refuel before continuing on their long journey.
