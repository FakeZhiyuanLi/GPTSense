Low German in the Middle Ages was a West Germanic language that was spoken in the lowlands of Northwestern Europe, including areas of modern-day Germany, the Netherlands, and Denmark. It was characterized by its use of a diverse range of dialects and regional variations, which made it difficult for speakers of different regions to understand each other. Additionally, Low German was influenced by various other languages, such as Latin, French, and Dutch, which shaped its vocabulary and grammar.
