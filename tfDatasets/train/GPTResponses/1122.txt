The Platonic idea of universals or forms, which posits that certain abstract concepts have an existence beyond the individual objects or beings, lost influence as a result of the work of Ockham and Duns Scotus. They rejected this idea and instead argued for nominalism, which suggests that there are no universal concepts or forms, but rather only individual things with their own unique properties. This marked a shift towards a more empirical and skeptical approach to knowledge and ontology, which had far-reaching consequences in the development of modern philosophy and science.
