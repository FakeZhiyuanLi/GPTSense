The example of post-translational modification of a protein that was first described in 1961 is the phosphorylation of proteins. In this process, a phosphate group is added to proteins by enzymes called kinases, which can alter protein activity or interactions with other molecules. This discovery was made by Edmond Fischer and Edwin Krebs, for which they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1992.
