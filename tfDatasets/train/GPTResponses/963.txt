Organisms inherit the characteristics of their parents through a process called heredity. This is because parents pass on their genetic material to their offspring in the form of DNA.DNA contains the instructions for building and maintaining an organism, including its physical and behavioral characteristics. When an organism reproduces, part of its DNA is passed on to its offspring, ensuring that certain traits are carried on from one generation to the next.The way in which genes are inherited can also play a role in the expression of certain traits. For example, genes may be dominant or recessive, which can affect how traits are expressed in the offspring.Overall, the inheritance of characteristics from parents is a fundamental principle of genetics and is essential for the survival and evolution of species.
