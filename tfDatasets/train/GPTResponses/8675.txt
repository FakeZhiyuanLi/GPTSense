Social science added the idea that human behavior and social interactions can be studied scientifically, just like other natural phenomena. It introduced the concept of using systematic observation, experimentation, and analysis to understand social phenomena like culture, politics, economics, and human behavior. Social science also emphasized the importance of subjective experiences, cultural contexts, and historical factors in shaping human behavior and society. It helped to broaden the scope of scientific inquiry to include the study of social phenomena and contributed to the development of interdisciplinary approaches to problem-solving.
