Lie algebras and hyperbolic quaternions demonstrated a need for more complex mathematical structures and tools to explain and model complex physical phenomena. These structures are necessary to adequately describe the behavior of particles and fields, as well as the behavior of complex systems in economics, biology, and other fields. Additionally, understanding these structures allows for new insights into the nature of mathematics and its applications.
