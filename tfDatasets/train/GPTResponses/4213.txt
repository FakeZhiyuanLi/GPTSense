FIFA banned Barcelona from buying players for two transfer windows in 2014 due to breaching regulations relating to the international transfer and registration of under-18 players. The ban was imposed after FIFA found violations in 10 of the 18 cases examined. As a result, Barcelona was prohibited from signing any players during the summer of 2014 and winter of 2015 transfer windows. The ban was eventually lifted in January 2016.
