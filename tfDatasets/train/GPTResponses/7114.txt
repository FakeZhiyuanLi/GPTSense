This is a subjective question and open to interpretation. However, if you are talking about the rise of professional wrestling and its popularity, it can be argued that many companies handling wrestling footage were founded in the 1980s and 90s. This is when wrestling became a mainstream phenomenon and large promotions such as WWE (founded in the 1950s but gained national and international success in the 80s) and WCW (founded in the 80s) were at their peak. With the advent of cable television and pay-per-view, the demand for wrestling content increased, leading to the founding of many companies like Coliseum Video, RF Video, and Highspots in the 90s.
