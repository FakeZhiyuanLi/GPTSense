When simple carbohydrates undergo metabolic pathways and are partially catabolized, they result in the production of energy in the form of ATP, as well as intermediate compounds such as pyruvate and acetyl-CoA that can be further used in other metabolic pathways or converted into other biomolecules. Additionally, the partial catabolism of simple carbohydrates can result in the production of carbon dioxide and water as waste products.
