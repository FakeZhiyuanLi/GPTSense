Studies on the genetics of Ashkenazim have come to varying conclusions regarding the degree and sources of their European ancestry. Some studies suggest that Ashkenazim have predominantly Near Eastern genetic ancestry, with additional admixture from various European populations. However, other studies have found that Ashkenazi Jewish genetic ancestry is primarily European, with a significant contribution from Near Eastern populations. Ultimately, the degree and sources of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry likely vary depending on the specific population and time period in question.
