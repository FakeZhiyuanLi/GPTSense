In Matthew's account of the crucifixion (Matthew 27:55-56), it says that "Many women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedeeâ€™s sons." So, besides Mary of Clopas and Mary Magdalene, there were also other women watching from a distance, including Mary the mother of James and Joseph and the mother of Zebedee's sons.
