James T. Costa thought that "On the Origin of Species" was more likely to draw interest than Darwin's larger book because it presented a concise and accessible summary of Darwin's key ideas about evolution and natural selection. In contrast, the larger book contained much more detailed and technical information that would only be of interest to a smaller, more specialized audience. Additionally, "On the Origin of Species" was written in a clear and straightforward style that made it more accessible to the general public, which helped to generate widespread interest and controversy.
