Westminster Abbey suffered damage during the German bombing raid known as the "Blitz" on November 15th, 1940, during World War II. A high-explosive bomb hit the Abbey's triforium, causing significant damage to the roof and lighting. However, the famous stained glass windows were not shattered, as they were protected by wooden shutters. Despite the damage, the Abbey remained open to the public and continued to hold services, demonstrating the resilience and determination of the British people during the war.
