One financial benefit to researching orphan drugs is that they often qualify for various financial incentives, such as tax credits and grants, to encourage their development. This can offset some of the high costs associated with drug development and make it more financially viable for pharmaceutical companies to invest in researching and bringing these drugs to market. Additionally, since orphan drugs target rare diseases with smaller patient populations, they often have less competition and can command higher prices. These financial benefits can make researching orphan drugs a potentially profitable venture for pharmaceutical companies.
