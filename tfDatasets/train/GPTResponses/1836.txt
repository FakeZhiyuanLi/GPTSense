An agreement entered into by actors in international law refers to a legally binding understanding between two or more parties that are recognized and governed by the principles of international law. These agreements can take many forms, including treaties, conventions, protocols, charters, and memoranda of understanding, among others. They are meant to detail the terms and conditions of cooperation, responsibilities, obligations, and rights of the parties involved. The parties to these agreements can be states, international organizations, or even private actors such as corporations or non-governmental organizations. Examples of such agreements include the United Nations Charter, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, and the Geneva Conventions.
