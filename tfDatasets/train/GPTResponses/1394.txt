The duality that describes the conflicting properties of matter in the fields of chemistry and physics is the wave-particle duality. According to this duality, matter can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior, depending on the type of experiment conducted. In the field of chemistry, matter is often studied as particles, while in physics, matter is studied as waves. This duality is essential to understanding the behavior of matter at both the atomic and subatomic levels.
