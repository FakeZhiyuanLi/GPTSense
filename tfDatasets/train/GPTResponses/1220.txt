The Russian population was estimated to be about 90 million fewer than it could have been during the 20th century, specifically from 1917 to 1991. This was largely due to various factors such as World War I, the Russian Revolution, Stalin's purges and forced deportations, World War II, and the economic and political instability during the Soviet era.
