A house master is an adult who is responsible for the overall management of a boarding house or residential dormitory, often in a school or university setting. Their duties may include supervising students, maintaining discipline, managing staff, overseeing maintenance and repairs, and acting as a liaison between the boarding community and the larger institution. House masters may also provide academic support and counseling to the students under their care.
