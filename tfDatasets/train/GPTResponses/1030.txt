There are several reasons why houses were built on piles:1. To prevent flooding: Houses built on piles are common in areas prone to flooding. By raising the house above the ground, it is less likely to be affected by floods.2. To avoid dampness: Piles also protect houses from dampness and moisture. By keeping the house off the ground, the wood does not come into contact with moisture, which can lead to rot and decay.3. To adapt to terrain: In hilly areas or on steep slopes, piles are used to adapt the house to the terrain, making it more stable.4. To improve ventilation: Houses built on piles can also improve ventilation, allowing fresh air to circulate underneath the house.5. To provide a stable foundation: Finally, piles provide a stable foundation for the house, ensuring that it does not shift or move over time.
