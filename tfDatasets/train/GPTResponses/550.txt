Class 2 transposable elements are also known as retrotransposons, and they are characterized by a copy-and-paste mechanism. The constituents of class 2 transposable elements include:1. Long terminal repeats (LTRs): These are sequences present at the ends of retrotransposons that enable them to integrate into the host genome.2. Reverse transcriptase: This is an enzyme that catalyzes the reverse transcription of RNA into DNA, which is a key step in the retrotransposon life cycle.3. Integrase: This is an enzyme that facilitates the integration of retrotransposons into the host genome.4. Poly-A tail: This is a series of adenine nucleotides added to the 3' end of the retrotransposon RNA, which is required for retrotransposition.5. Open reading frames (ORFs): These are segments of DNA that encode for proteins required for retrotransposition, such as the reverse transcriptase and integrase.6. Target site duplications (TSDs): These are short sequences of DNA that are duplicated upon integration of the retrotransposon, and serve as a signature of retrotransposition events.
