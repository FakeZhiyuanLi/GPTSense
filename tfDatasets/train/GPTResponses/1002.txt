Germany did not buy the Marshall Islands from Spain. Spain never owned the Marshall Islands. The Marshall Islands were originally a German colony until they were seized by Japan during World War I. After World War II, the Marshall Islands were placed under the trust of the United States as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.
