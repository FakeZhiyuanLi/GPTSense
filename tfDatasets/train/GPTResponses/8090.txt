The tax system depends on the following three things:1. Income: The amount of tax an individual or entity owes typically depends on the amount of income they receive in a given year. Generally, higher levels of income result in higher taxes owed.2. Tax laws and regulations: The tax system is governed by a complex set of laws and regulations that dictate how taxes are collected, calculated, and enforced. These laws and regulations are subject to change, and taxpayers are expected to stay up-to-date with any developments that may affect their tax liabilities.3. Compliance: Taxpayers are expected to comply with all applicable tax laws and regulations, including filing their tax returns accurately and on time, paying taxes when due, and keeping accurate records related to their tax liabilities. Failure to comply can result in penalties, fines, or even criminal charges.
