The level of exposure to uranium that is considered imminently dangerous to health depends on several factors, including the duration of exposure, the route of exposure (e.g., inhalation, ingestion, or skin contact), and the chemical form of the uranium (e.g., natural or enriched). In general, exposure to high levels of uranium can cause acute health effects, such as kidney damage or respiratory failure, while chronic exposure to low levels of uranium can increase the risk of cancer and other long-term health effects. The specific level of exposure that is considered imminently dangerous will depend on the specific circumstances of the exposure and should be determined by a qualified health professional.
