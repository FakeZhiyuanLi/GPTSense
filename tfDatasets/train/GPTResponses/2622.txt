The process of trees growing out to get bigger around is called radial growth or secondary growth. This occurs in the trunk and branches of the tree, and is facilitated by the activity of the cambium layer, a thin layer of cells located between the bark and the wood. The cambium layer produces new cells to the interior (xylem) and exterior (phloem) of the tree, causing the tree to grow in diameter. This process is also responsible for creating the annual growth rings that are visible in the cross-section of the trunk.
