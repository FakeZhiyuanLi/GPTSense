The older sailing ships in the navy were gradually replaced by steam-powered ships in the mid-19th century. This transition was driven by advancements in shipbuilding technology and the need for faster, more maneuverable vessels that could keep pace with the changing nature of naval warfare. Initially, steam engines were added to existing sailing ships, creating hybrid vessels known as steam/sail ships. However, by the late 1800s, pure steam-powered ships had largely replaced sailing ships in most navies around the world.
