Babangida set up the Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) to help pay Nigeria's national debt. This program involved reducing government spending, devaluing the currency, and increasing exports to earn foreign exchange. SAP was implemented in 1986 and lasted until the late 1990s. However, the program also had some negative effects on the economy, such as high inflation and unemployment.
