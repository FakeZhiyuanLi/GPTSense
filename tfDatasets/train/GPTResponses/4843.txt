psychologists refer to as individuation. This involves separating oneself from the messages and expectations of others in order to develop a more distinct sense of self, leading to greater independence and autonomy. Individuation can often feel difficult or uncomfortable, as it may require challenging long-held beliefs or engaging in behaviors that feel unfamiliar. However, it is an important part of personal growth and often leads to a greater sense of fulfillment and self-confidence in the long run.
