The financial innovation that bundles subprime mortgages is called a mortgage-backed security (MBS). MBSs are created by pooling together a large number of individual mortgages, including both prime and subprime loans, and then selling shares of the pool to investors. The income from the mortgage payments is then divided among the investors based on the proportion of the MBS they own. This allows investors to invest in multiple mortgages at once, reducing their overall risk, while also providing more funding for mortgage lending. However, the bundling of subprime mortgages, which were often high-risk and poorly underwritten, was a major contributing factor to the 2008 financial crisis when many of these loans began to default.
