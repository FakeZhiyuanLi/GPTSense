The Duchy of Lancaster operates as a portfolio of land, property, and investments that are managed to provide income for the British monarch. It is one of two royal duchies, and the current monarch is Queen Elizabeth II. The Duchy is managed independently from the Crown Estate, which manages the sovereign's public properties and estates. The Duchy's portfolio includes urban and rural properties, as well as holdings in several companies and financial investments. The management of the Duchy is overseen by a Chancellor, who is appointed by the monarch, and a board of directors.
