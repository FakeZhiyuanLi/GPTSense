In the 1960s, downtown Houston consisted of mostly commercial high-rise buildings, including office buildings and corporate headquarters. Some notable examples of buildings from that time include the ExxonMobil Building, the JP Morgan Chase Tower, and the Williams Tower (formerly known as the Transco Tower). There were also some government buildings, such as the Houston City Hall and the Harris County Courthouse. The area was mostly known as a business and financial hub.
