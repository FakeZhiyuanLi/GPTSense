Positivism provided the idea that knowledge should come from empirical observation and scientific method, rather than from metaphysical or religious speculation. This idea helped to shape modern science and influenced the development of the social sciences, particularly sociology. It also emphasized the importance of objectivity in scientific inquiry, and the idea that scientific theories should be tested and verified using empirical evidence.
