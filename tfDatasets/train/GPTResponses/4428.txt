Old English, also known as Anglo-Saxon, was spoken in Scotland during the Early Middle Ages (5th-11th centuries) by the Anglo-Saxon settlers who established the Kingdom of Northumbria in the southeast of the country. This area roughly corresponds to present-day Lothian and Borders. After the Viking Invasions in the 9th century AD, the Northumbrian dialect was influenced by Old Norse and eventually developed into Middle English.
