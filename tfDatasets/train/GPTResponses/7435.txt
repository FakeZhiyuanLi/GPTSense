Stepper motors are most useful in applications where precise control of position, speed, and torque is required. This includes robotics, CNC machines, 3D printers, pick-and-place machines, and other industrial automation applications. Stepper motors are also commonly used in consumer electronics such as digital cameras and printers, as well as in medical equipment such as MRI machines and surgical robots.
