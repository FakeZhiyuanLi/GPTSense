The 20th century witnessed significant changes that made farming less dominant, such as:1. Mechanization: The introduction of machines and modern technology made farming more efficient, reducing the need for manual labor and allowing for larger farms that required fewer workers.2. Urbanization: As cities grew, people moved away from rural areas, leading to a decline in demand for agricultural products.3. Industrialization: Many countries shifted their focus towards industrialization, which led to the growth of manufacturing and service sectors, decreasing the importance of agriculture.4. Globalization: The emergence of global markets allowed for the import and export of food, making it easier to meet demand without relying solely on local production.5. Government policies: Governments implemented policies aimed at diversifying their economies away from agriculture, such as subsidies for other industries or urbanization programs.Overall, these factors contributed to a decline in the dominance of farming in the 20th century, although it remains a crucial aspect of many national economies globally.
