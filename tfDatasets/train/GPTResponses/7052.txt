The study of ancient, fossilized plants is called paleobotany. It is the branch of paleontology that deals with plant fossils and their evolutionary history. Paleobotanists use fossilized plant remains to study the morphology, anatomy, and ecology of ancient plant species, as well as their relationships to modern plant groups. This helps researchers to understand how plants evolved over time and how they responded to changes in their environment.
