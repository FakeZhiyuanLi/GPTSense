Charles Martel, also known as Charles the Hammer, was a Frankish military leader who played a significant role in the Battle of Tours in 732 AD. This battle marked the end of the Muslim invasion of Western Europe, and it secured Frankish rule over the region. Charles also expanded the Frankish territory through conquest and established a powerful dynasty that would eventually lead to the crowning of his grandson, Charlemagne, as the Holy Roman Emperor. Additionally, he reformed the Frankish army and laid the foundation for medieval feudalism by granting land and privileges to his loyal supporters.
