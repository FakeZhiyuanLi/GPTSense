In 1935, a person was required to be white or of African descent to become a United States citizen. The Naturalization Act of 1906 designated "white persons" and "African descent" as the only groups eligible for naturalization. It wasn't until the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 that racial and ethnic restrictions on citizenship were removed.
