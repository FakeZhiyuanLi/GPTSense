Samba schools in Brazil can have varying numbers of members, ranging from a few hundred to several thousand. Some of the larger and more established schools may have over 5,000 members. However, it is important to note that not all members are actively involved in performances and parades, as some may only participate in rehearsals, preparation, and other behind-the-scenes activities.
