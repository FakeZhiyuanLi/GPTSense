As air defense evolved, it also covered the following:1. Command and Control: This involves the coordination and management of air defense resources such as aircraft, surface-to-air missiles, and radar systems. Command and control systems enable air defense operators to rapidly identify incoming threats, allocate resources, and communicate with other defense units.2. Intelligence gathering: This involves the collection and analysis of information from various sources to identify potential threats. This includes surveillance of enemy forces, monitoring of communications, and analysis of radar signals.3. Electronic warfare: This involves jamming or disrupting enemy radar and communication systems to prevent them from detecting friendly forces. It also includes the use of decoys and other countermeasures to confuse enemy missiles and aircraft.4. Training and education: Air defense units require specialized training and education to effectively detect and respond to threats. This includes training in weapon systems, radar operations, and communication protocols.5. Integration with other defense systems: Air defense systems must be integrated with other defense systems such as ground troops, naval forces, and intelligence agencies to form a comprehensive defense network. Integration allows for a coordinated response to incoming threats and maximizes the effectiveness of defense resources.
