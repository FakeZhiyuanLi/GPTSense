The purpose of a dual-input USB cable is to be able to charge and transfer data to two different devices simultaneously using one cable. This is particularly useful for people who need to charge and/or sync multiple devices at the same time, such as a smartphone and tablet, or an MP3 player and a digital camera. It eliminates the need to carry multiple cables and allows for more efficient charging and data transfer.
