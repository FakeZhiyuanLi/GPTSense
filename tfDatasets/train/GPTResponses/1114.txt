The men accused of high treason, including Henry Scrope and Sir Thomas Grey, led a rebellion against King Henry V in 1415. They were known as the "Southampton Plot," which aimed to remove Henry V from the throne and replace him with his cousin, Edmund de Mortimer. The plot was discovered, and the rebels were arrested, tried, and executed.
