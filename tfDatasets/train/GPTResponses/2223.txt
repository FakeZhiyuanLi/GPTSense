Piedmont glaciers appear when a valley glacier flows out into a flat plain or a broader valley. As the glacier reaches the edge of the steep terrain, it spreads out and covers the flatter ground, forming a bulb-like shape. This spreading of the ice at the foot of a mountain slope is called "piedmont" because it resembles the shape of the foothills or "piedmonts" in some regions. As the glacier continues to flow, it may extend further down the valley and even into the sea -- forming an ice sheet or ice shelf.
