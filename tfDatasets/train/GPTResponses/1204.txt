AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) is not a disease itself, but rather a collection of conditions and symptoms that appear as a result of weakened immune system as a result of infection with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). AIDS is considered a serious and potentially fatal condition that can affect various organs and systems of the body, making the affected person vulnerable to opportunistic infections and certain types of cancer. HIV attacks the immune system's CD4 cells, which help protect the body from infections, making it difficult for the body to fight off these opportunistic infections.
