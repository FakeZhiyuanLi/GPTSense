One major factor that helped boost the Republicans in 1870 was their support for Reconstruction policies in the South. This included efforts to enforce civil rights for African Americans, protect their right to vote, and promote their education and economic opportunities. The Republicans also benefited from corruption scandals involving the Democratic Party in some states. Additionally, the growth of the Northern economy and the continued expansion of Western settlement further strengthened the Republican Party.
