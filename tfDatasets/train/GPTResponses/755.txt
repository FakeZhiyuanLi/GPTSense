They emphasized compassion and the idea of the bodhisattva, one who seeks to attain enlightenment for the benefit of all beings. The Mahayana also placed great emphasis on the practice of meditation and the cultivation of wisdom and insight. They believed in the existence of multiple Buddhas and the possibility of all beings attaining enlightenment. Ultimately, the Mahayana sought to expand and deepen the teachings of the Buddha to benefit all sentient beings, rather than just individual liberation.
