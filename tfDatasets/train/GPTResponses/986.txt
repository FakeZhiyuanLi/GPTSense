The most common way of determining if languages are dialects is by analyzing mutual intelligibility, which refers to the ability of speakers of one language or dialect to understand and communicate with speakers of another language or dialect. If mutual intelligibility is high, the two varieties are likely dialects of the same language. If mutual intelligibility is low, they are likely separate languages. However, this method can be difficult to apply in practice and is often supplemented by other factors such as historical, cultural, and political considerations.
