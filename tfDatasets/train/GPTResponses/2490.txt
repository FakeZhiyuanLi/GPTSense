Technically speaking, many things did not exist through the entire classical music period (roughly 1750-1820) as the period saw significant developments and changes in music. However, some notable things that did not exist throughout the entire period include:1. The piano as we know it today - while the piano was certainly around during the classical era, it was a relatively new instrument and underwent significant changes throughout the period.2. The symphony orchestra as we know it today - the size and makeup of the orchestra evolved throughout the classical period, but it wasn't until the Romantic era that the orchestra really became the large, standardized ensemble we know today.3. Recording technology - obviously, this didn't exist until much later!4. The concept of the "composer" as a solitary, revered figure - while there were certainly famous composers throughout the classical era, the idea of the composer as an individual artist with a unique voice and a canon of works that would be studied and performed for centuries to come didn't really solidify until later.
