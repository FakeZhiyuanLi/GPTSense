Herschel used a prism and a thermometer to discover the infrared radiation. In 1800, he conducted an experiment where he passed sunlight through a prism and measured the temperature of the different colors of light. He noticed that the temperature increased beyond the red end of the visible spectrum, which led him to discover the infrared radiation.
