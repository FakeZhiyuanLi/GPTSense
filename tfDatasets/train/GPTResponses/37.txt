To verify the primality of the number 37, we need to check if any smaller prime number divides it. The smallest prime number greater than 1 is 2, which doesn't divide 37. The next prime is 3, which also doesn't divide 37. The prime after 3 is 5, which doesn't divide 37 either. We can also skip 4 since it is not a prime number.So, we have checked 2, 3, 5 but we don't need to go beyond that because the square root of 37 is approximately 6.08 (rounded to two decimal places), and any larger prime factor would have a corresponding factor smaller than the square root, which we have already checked.Therefore, only three divisions are required to verify the primality of the number 37.
