Article 12 of the 1886 Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works uses the term piracy to refer to any unauthorized reproduction, distribution or communication of protected works. Specifically, the article prohibits the importation, sale or distribution in any way of copies of works that have been unlawfully made in another country. The article also allows for the seizure of such copies when they are discovered by the authorities, and establishes penalties for those who engage in piracy. Thus, the term piracy in this context refers to any infringement of copyright that involves the unauthorized use of protected works, regardless of the medium or method used for reproduction, distribution or communication.
