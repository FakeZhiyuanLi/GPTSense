The therapy that may examine emotions based on components of facial expressions is known as facial expression analysis therapy or FACS (Facial Action Coding System). This is a type of therapy that focuses on identifying, understanding, and managing emotions through analyzing facial expressions. In FACS, the therapist learns to read micro-expressions, which are fleeting and subtle changes in facial expressions that can reveal a person's emotions. This therapy is often used in conjunction with other approaches such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and psychotherapy, to help individuals understand and manage their emotions more effectively.
