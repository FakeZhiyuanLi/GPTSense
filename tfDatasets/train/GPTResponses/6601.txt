law?Regulations are codified into law through a process called incorporation by reference. This means that the regulations are referenced within a legal document, such as a federal or state law, and become legally enforceable as part of that document. For example, the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) compiles all federal regulations into a single publication that is organized by subject matter. The CFR is incorporated by reference in many federal laws and is therefore considered legal authority for enforcing those laws. Similarly, state regulations are often incorporated into state law through similar processes, such as being published in a state administrative code.
