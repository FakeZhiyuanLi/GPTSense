In contrast to genomics, genetics usually studies specific genes or groups of genes, their functions, and how they are inherited from one generation to the next. It also involves the study of mutations that occur in genes, which can cause diseases or genetic disorders. Genetics can be used to understand the causes of inherited diseases, develop new treatments, and even help with disease prevention.
