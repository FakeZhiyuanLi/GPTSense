Darwin and Wallace made the concept of evolution through natural selection central to understanding the natural world. They proposed that over time, individuals in a population with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and pass on those traits to their offspring. This process of natural selection leads to the gradual evolution of species over time. This theory revolutionized our understanding of the diversity of life on earth and remains a foundational principle of modern biology.
