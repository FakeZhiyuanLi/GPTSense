Kings granted privileges to nobles throughout history, but the timeline will vary depending on the specific monarch and region. In medieval Europe, for example, kings granted privileges to their nobility as a way to secure their loyalty and support in times of conflict. In some regions, such as England, the granting of privileges can be traced back to the Magna Carta in 1215, which established limitations on the monarch's power and guaranteed certain rights to the nobility. In other areas, such as feudal Japan, nobles were granted privileges by their shoguns and emperors as part of the complex social hierarchy known as the class system. Therefore, it is difficult to provide a specific date or time period for when kings began granting privileges to the nobles since it has been happening for so long.
