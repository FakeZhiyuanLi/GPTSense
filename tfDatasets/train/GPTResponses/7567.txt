The top of the seamount may be formed by marine organisms because these organisms attach themselves to hard surfaces and grow, forming structures such as coral reefs or bioherms. Over time, layers of these growths can accumulate and become the top of the seamount. As the seamount rises from the ocean floor, it brings up nutrients from deeper waters, which can support a diverse community of marine organisms, further contributing to the formation of the seamount top. Additionally, the seamount top may offer a favorable environment for certain species of marine organisms, such as those that prefer shallower waters with more sunlight or stronger currents.
