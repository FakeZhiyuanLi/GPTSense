The placement of deciduous trees on the equator facing side of a building can have a negative effect on solar availability during the winter season because the trees will have dropped their leaves, blocking the direct sunlight from entering the building. In the summer season, the leaves of deciduous trees can provide shading which reduces solar heat gain in the building.
