There are several concerns with extensive breeding programs, such as free-range farming:1. Inbreeding: If not managed properly, breeding programs can lead to inbreeding and genetic disorders.2. Disease and parasites: Free-range farming can increase the risk of diseases and parasites infecting the animals due to their exposure to the environment and other animals.3. Overcrowding: Free-range farming can become overcrowded, which can lead to stress and aggression among the animals.4. Environmental impact: Intensive breeding programs can have a negative impact on the environment, as the animals require a significant amount of resources and produce large amounts of waste.5. Ethical concerns: There are ethical concerns about the treatment of animals in breeding programs, including whether the animals are being raised humanely and whether their welfare is being prioritized over profit margins.6. Antibiotic resistance: Overuse of antibiotics in breeding programs can lead to antibiotic resistance in both animals and humans, making it harder to treat infections in the future.
