Many performances of Baroque era operas require improvisation, particularly in the area of ornamentation. During this time period, singers and instrumentalists were expected to add their own embellishments to the music, especially during arias and recitatives. Improvisation was also important in the creation of continuo parts, which were often left unnotated in the score and needed to be improvised by the keyboardist or lutenist. Additionally, some operas featured sections that were left open to improvisation, such as dance interludes or instrumental cadenzas. All of these elements contributed to the spontaneous and expressive nature of Baroque-era opera performances.
