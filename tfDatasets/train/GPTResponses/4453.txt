Copper alloys are commonly used to make aquaculture equipment such as nets, cages, traps, and other enclosures. They are also used to make various fittings and connectors that are necessary for building infrastructure and aquaculture systems. Copper alloys offer excellent corrosion resistance, durability, and strength, which make them suitable for use in harsh marine environments. Additionally, copper alloys have antimicrobial properties, which can help prevent the growth and spread of pathogens and diseases in aquaculture systems.
