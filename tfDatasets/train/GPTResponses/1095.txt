The new kingdoms often relied on feudalism, where the nobility owned land and provided military service to the king in exchange for protection and other benefits. They also used tributes and taxes collected from conquered territories and trade routes, as well as loot and plunder obtained from raids and wars. In some cases, they also had a standing army composed of professional soldiers who were paid through the king's treasury or through the spoils of war.
