Impermanence, also known as "anicca" in Buddhism, is the concept that all phenomena, including physical objects and mental states, are constantly changing and temporary. Impermanence is one of the three universal characteristics of existence, along with suffering and non-self, and is seen as a fundamental truth in Buddhism. It teaches that clinging to things as permanent or expecting them to remain constant leads to suffering, and that acceptance of impermanence can lead to liberation and peace of mind.
