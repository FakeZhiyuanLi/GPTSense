The Dutch Waterlander Mennonites were a group of Mennonites that emerged in the Netherlands in the 16th century. They were one of the largest and most influential Mennonite groups in the country, and were known for their emphasis on nonviolence, simplicity, and social justice. They also placed a great deal of importance on individual conscience and personal piety, and were known for their commitment to democratic decision-making and congregational autonomy. The Dutch Waterlander Mennonites were a significant force in the development of Anabaptism and Mennonitism in Europe, and played a key role in the growth of these movements in North America as well.
