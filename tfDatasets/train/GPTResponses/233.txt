The event that led to the decline in wooden construction in New York City was the Great Fire of 1835. The fire destroyed more than 600 buildings in lower Manhattan, most of which were constructed of wood. This disaster highlighted the dangers of wooden construction in a densely populated urban environment and led to the adoption of new building codes that required the use of fire-resistant materials such as brick and stone.
