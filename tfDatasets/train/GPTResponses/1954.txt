In addition to lumber strength, specific gravity can also be an important indicator of wood's quality. Specific gravity measures the density of a wood species, which can indicate its hardness, durability, and resistance to decay and insect damage. Higher specific gravity generally indicates a denser and stronger wood that is more suitable for construction and furniture making. Lower specific gravity may indicate a softer wood that is more prone to decay and insect damage.
