SV40 (Simian Virus 40) was present in certain polio vaccines that were used from 1955 to 1963 in the United States and some other countries. It was discovered later that the vaccine was contaminated with SV40, which is a virus that can cause cancer in laboratory animals. However, it is not clear whether the virus can cause cancer in humans.
