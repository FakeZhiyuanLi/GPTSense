There is no direct or fixed relation between the number of base pairs and the total complement of genes in a species. While the number of base pairs (i.e. the total length of DNA) in a genome can affect the quantity and type of genes present, it is not necessarily correlated with the total number of genes. The number of genes in a genome depends on various factors such as the complexity of the organism, the presence of repetitive DNA, and the efficiency of DNA packing. For example, the genome of the amoeba Polychaos dubium has 670 billion base pairs but only about 40,000 genes, while the genome of the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana has 157 million base pairs but about 27,000 genes. Therefore, the relationship between the number of base pairs and the total complement of genes in a species is complex and may vary widely among different organisms.
