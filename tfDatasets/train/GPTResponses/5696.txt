Victoria's reign was characterized by a constitutional monarchy, which means that there was a monarch as head of state, but their power was limited by a constitution and the government was run by elected officials. The government was leaning towards a parliamentary democracy, where the power of the monarch was mostly ceremonial and the real power was held by the elected officials.
