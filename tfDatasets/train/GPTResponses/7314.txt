One example of clothing that was once seen as exclusively for males is trousers or pants. Women were expected to wear dresses and skirts for many years, and it was considered inappropriate for them to wear pants in certain settings. However, as attitudes towards gender and fashion have evolved, it is now common for both men and women to wear trousers in a variety of contexts.
