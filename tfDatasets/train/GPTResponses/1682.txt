The DNA sequence encodes the protein or RNA product. This is accomplished through the genetic code, which matches specific sequences of DNA nucleotides with specific amino acids or RNA nucleotides. This process is known as transcription and translation, where the DNA sequence is first transcribed into a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule, which then directs the assembly of specific amino acids into a protein through the process of translation.
