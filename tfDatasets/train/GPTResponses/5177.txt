Glaciology is the science that is concerned with the study of the dynamics of ice. Glaciology investigates the properties, behavior, and movement of glaciers and ice sheets, as well as their interaction with the surrounding environment. This field is interdisciplinary, drawing on principles of physics, geology, geography, and climatology, among others.
