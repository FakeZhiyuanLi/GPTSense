The council under Paul VI, also known as the Second Vatican Council or Vatican II, made various decisions regarding the authority of bishops and the role of the laity in the Church. One of the most significant changes was the recognition of episcopal collegiality, which meant that bishops could make some decisions independently of Rome. This was a departure from the traditional understanding of the Pope as the ultimate authority in the Church.However, the council did not grant bishops unlimited autonomy, and Rome still retained ultimate authority in matters of faith and morals. The council also emphasized the importance of collaboration between the Pope and bishops, as well as the participation of the laity in decision-making processes. These changes were seen as a way to modernize and democratize the Church, while maintaining its essential teachings and traditions.
