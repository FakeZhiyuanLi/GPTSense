During the period of shoen development in Japan (10th-12th centuries), the ritsuryo system of government reorganization lapsed. The ritsuryo system was a set of laws and institutions that governed Japan during the Nara and Heian periods. It established a centralized government with a legal and administrative hierarchy that followed Chinese models. However, the growth of shoen estates challenged the authority of the central government, leading to the decline of the ritsuryo system and the emergence of a decentralized power structure. The shoen owners became increasingly independent and formed alliances with local ruling families, further eroding the power of the central government. This period marked a shift towards a feudal system and the development of the samurai class.
