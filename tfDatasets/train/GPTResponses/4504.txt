Old English had several verb tenses, including present, past, future, and imperative. Each tense had different forms for different subjects and for affirmative and negative statements. For example, the present tense of the verb "to be" in Old English was "eom" (I am), "eart" (you are), "is" (he/she/it is), "syndon" (we are), "sindon" (you are), and "synd" (they are).
