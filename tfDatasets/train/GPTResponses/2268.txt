A modern preamble typically summarizes the shared values, beliefs, aspirations, and ideals of the parties involved. It may also acknowledge historical events, recognize common challenges, offer gratitude, and express hope and optimism for the future. Additionally, a modern preamble may outline the legal framework, processes, and principles upon which the agreement is based, and it may provide context and clarity for the rest of the document.
