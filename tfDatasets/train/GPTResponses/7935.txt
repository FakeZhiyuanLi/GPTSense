China has a long and rich history of observing the sky and recording astronomical events. Some of the observations include:1. Comets: Chinese astronomers observed and recorded the appearance of comets, which they called "broom stars," as early as the Han dynasty (206 BCE - 220 CE). They believed that comets were omens of impending disaster or good fortune, depending on their appearance and location in the sky.2. Solar and lunar eclipses: Chinese astronomers observed and recorded solar and lunar eclipses as early as the Shang dynasty (1600 - 1046 BCE). They developed a system for predicting eclipses based on the movements of the moon and sun.3. Supernovae: Chinese astronomers observed and recorded supernovae, which occur when a star explodes, as early as 185 CE. One of the most famous supernovae they recorded was the "guest star" that appeared in the sky in 1054 CE and was visible for three weeks.4. Planetary positions: Chinese astronomers observed and recorded the positions of the planets, including Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. They believed that these planets had an influence on human affairs and studied their movements to predict future events.5. Constellations: Chinese astronomers observed and recorded the stars and constellations visible in the night sky. They developed their own system of constellations, which included both animal and astronomical names.Overall, Chinese astronomy has a long and rich tradition of observing the sky and recording astronomical events, which has contributed to our understanding of the universe.
