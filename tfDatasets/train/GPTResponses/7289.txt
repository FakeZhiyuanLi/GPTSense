In 2012, there were ongoing conflicts and disturbances in Burma (now Myanmar) as the country was transitioning from military rule to a democratic government. Ethnic tensions and violence, particularly against the Muslim Rohingya minority, were on the rise, and there were concerns about the military's role in the new government. Additionally, there were accusations of censorship and repression of journalists and activists by the authorities. Despite these challenges, the country made some significant progress towards democracy, including the release of political prisoners and the holding of free and fair elections in 2015.
