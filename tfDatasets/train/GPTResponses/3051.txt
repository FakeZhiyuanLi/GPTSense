Attempting to unify Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic would create several problems, including:1. Alphabet Differences: Each of these scripts has its own set of characters and their own unique rules for pronunciation and grammar, making it challenging to create a unified system.2. Language Differences: Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic are used to write vastly different languages, each with its own grammatical structure and vocabulary. This would make it challenging to transfer all the features of one language to another.3. Cultural Differences: Each script also has its own cultural context, history, and writing tradition, which would need to be considered when developing a unified alphabet. It may be challenging to honour each culture's contribution while also unifying them into a single script.4. Technical Considerations: Creating a unified script would also need to consider technical issues, such as how the script would work on keyboards, how to encode files, and how to ensure accurate representation of each language's unique features.
