Darwin uses the phrase "struggle for existence" within the frame of reference of natural selection and evolution. He suggests that in a population, individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, while those with disadvantageous traits are less likely to survive and reproduce. Therefore, there is a constant struggle for survival and reproduction within a population, resulting in the gradual evolution of advantageous traits over time.
