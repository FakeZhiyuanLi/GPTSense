The color red was adopted for Arsenal shirts in recognition of the club's roots as the works team of the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich, London. The workers at the arsenal wore red shirts as a sign of their allegiance to the Crown, and the Arsenal Football Club adopted red as their primary color in honor of this history.
