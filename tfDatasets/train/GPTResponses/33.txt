An extraordinary election held less than six months before the date of an ordinary election would not typically have any direct impact on the ordinary election. The ordinary election would still take place as scheduled, unless there were other unforeseen circumstances that prevented it from occurring. However, the results of the extraordinary election could potentially have an indirect impact on the ordinary election if they cause voters to shift their support or change their opinions about the issues at stake.
