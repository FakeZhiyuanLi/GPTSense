Hubs can skew various statistical measures, such as correlation coefficients and regression coefficients, by exerting a disproportionate influence on the results. This can occur if the hub nodes have a high degree (i.e. they are connected to many other nodes), as they will have a greater impact on the overall network structure and statistics. In some cases, high degree hub nodes can also act as information filters or bottlenecks, biasing the flow of information through the network. As a result, researchers need to be aware of the potential impact of hubs when analyzing network data, and take steps to account for their influence if necessary.
