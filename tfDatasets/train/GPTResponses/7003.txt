The downfall of the original kingdom in Myanmar (also known as Burma) can be attributed to various factors, including:1. Mongol Invasions: In the 13th century, the Mongols invaded and destroyed the Pagan Empire, which was the first major empire in Myanmar. The invasion weakened the empire's power and paved the way for its decline.2. King Narathihapate's Weak Leadership: King Narathihapate, who ruled from 1256 to 1287, was unpopular and unable to defend his kingdom against external threats. His weak leadership led to the fall of the Pagan Empire.3. Internal Rebellion: In the 16th century, internal revolts broke out in various parts of the country, causing instability and weakening the central government. This provided opportunities for neighboring powers to conquer Myanmar.4. Colonialism: Myanmar became a British colony in the 19th century, and the British colonial government systematically dismantled the traditional monarchy and imposed their own political and economic systems.5. Japanese Occupation: During World War II, Japan occupied Myanmar and replaced the British colonial government. The Japanese occupation caused significant damage to the country, and the subsequent independence struggle weakened the country even further.In summary, a combination of external invasions, weak leadership, internal unrest, and colonialism ultimately led to the downfall of the original kingdom in Myanmar.
