There are a few scenarios that may result in a party to a treaty claiming that it should be terminated even in the absence of an express provision for termination:1. Fundamental change in circumstances: One party may argue that the treaty has become outdated or irrelevant due to a fundamental change in circumstances since the time the treaty was signed. For example, a trade treaty that was signed between two countries may become obsolete due to changes in economic conditions or political relations between the two countries.2. Breach of treaty: If one party to a treaty violates the terms of the treaty, the other party may claim that the treaty has been terminated as a result of the breach. For example, if a country violates a nuclear non-proliferation treaty, other countries may argue that the treaty is no longer valid.3. Impossibility of performance: If it becomes impossible for one or both parties to fulfill their obligations under the treaty, one party may argue that the treaty should be terminated. For example, if a treaty requires two countries to share a river for water supply, and a natural disaster causes the river to dry up, the treaty may no longer be possible to honor.4. Change in domestic law: If a change in domestic law within one country conflicts with the terms of a treaty, that country may claim that the treaty should be terminated. For example, if a country passes a law that violates the terms of a human rights treaty it signed, it may argue that the treaty is no longer valid.
