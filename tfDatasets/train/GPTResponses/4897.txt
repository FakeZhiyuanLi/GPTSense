One possible answer could be "memory". Memory is volatile because it is temporary and can be lost or changed easily. It is flexible because it can store and recall various types of information, and can be reconfigured as needed. It is also abstract because it is not a physical object but a mental construct that represents past experiences, knowledge, and perceptions.
