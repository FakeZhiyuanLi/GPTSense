There were several factors that caused different paleogeographic regions in the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous periods, including:1. Plate Tectonics: The shifting of tectonic plates over millions of years led to the creation of new landmasses, the opening and closing of oceans, and the formation of mountain ranges.2. Sea Level Changes: Fluctuations in sea level due to tectonic activity, climate change, and other factors caused the coastline to shift, affecting the distribution of marine organisms and the sedimentary deposits left behind.3. Climate Change: The Earth's climate during these periods varied from hot and tropical to cold and arid, affecting the distribution of flora and fauna and the nature of sedimentary deposits.4. Volcanism: Massive volcanic eruptions during these periods led to the formation of new landmasses and altered the chemical composition of the atmosphere and oceans.5. Biological Evolution: The evolution of plants and animals during these periods led to the development of new ecosystems and the extinction of others, further shaping the paleogeography of the Earth.
