One trait that Old English possesses that modern English lacks is a more complex grammatical system, with inflectional endings and a greater variety of noun and adjective forms. Old English also has a different vocabulary, with many words that have since fallen out of usage or changed in meaning. Additionally, Old English incorporated some Scandinavian and Latin influences, while modern English has been influenced by a wider variety of languages.
