In polygynous species with sexual dimorphism (where males and females have different characteristics), males typically compete for access to females. The females have a greater role in selection since they are the limiting resource in terms of reproduction. As a result, males may develop elaborate physical displays or behaviors to attract mates. This can lead to the evolution of exaggerated traits, such as large antlers or colorful feathers, which may reduce survival but enhance reproductive success. Additionally, females may select males based on their ability to acquire resources, such as food or territory, which can also influence the evolution of dimorphic traits.
