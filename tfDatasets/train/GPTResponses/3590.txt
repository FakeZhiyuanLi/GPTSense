The ability to differentiate between self and other is achieved through a complex system called the immune system. The immune system identifies and responds to foreign substances and pathogens that might pose a threat to the organism.One key mechanism that enables an organism to differentiate self from non-self is the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), a group of genes that produce proteins on the surface of cells. These proteins act as markers that allow the immune system to identify cells as belonging to the organism's own self or as foreign.Another mechanism that helps with self-recognition is the presence of self-tolerance. This means that the immune system does not attack or respond to the body's own cells, tissues, or organs.In summary, the immune system uses various mechanisms including MHC proteins and self-tolerance to differentiate between self and other, and to mount appropriate responses to foreign substances while avoiding attacking the body's own cells.
