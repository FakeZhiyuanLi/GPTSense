The sequence of the pre-mRNA, specifically the location of the splice sites and the presence of splicing regulatory elements, dictate the splice sites that are used to generate the final mature mRNA. Splice sites are recognized by the spliceosome, a complex of RNA and protein that catalyzes splicing, and the selection of specific splice sites is influenced by various factors, including the efficiency of the splice site, the strength of the spliceosome binding site, and the presence of splicing enhancers or silencers. Additionally, alternative splicing can result in different mature mRNA isoforms being generated from a single pre-mRNA by using different splice sites or skipping exons.
