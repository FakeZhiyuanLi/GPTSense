The result of dividing size of repetitive DNA by the length of the total genome is a measure of the proportion or percentage of repetitive DNA in the genome. This can be useful in comparing the relative repetitive content of different organisms, as well as understanding the potential functional consequences and evolutionary effects of this repetitive DNA.
