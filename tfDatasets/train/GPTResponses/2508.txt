Migrating birds will avoid obstacles such as high-rise buildings, towers, wind turbines, power lines, and other man-made structures that can obstruct their flight paths. They also avoid areas with extreme weather conditions, such as strong winds, heavy rain, and storms, as these conditions can be dangerous and energy-draining for them. Additionally, migrating birds avoid areas with limited food and water sources or where their predators are known to be present.
