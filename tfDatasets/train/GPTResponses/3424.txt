One example of a valley carved by glaciers during the ice ages is Yosemite Valley in California, USA. It was formed by the movement of glaciers during the last ice age, approximately 1 million years ago. The glaciers eroded the granite rock and carved out the valley, leaving behind steep cliffs and iconic features such as Half Dome and El Capitan. Today, Yosemite Valley is a popular tourist destination and part of Yosemite National Park.
