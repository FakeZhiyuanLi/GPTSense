The decolonization of Africa and the Caribbean accelerated in the 1950s and 1960s, with many countries gaining their independence from European colonizers during this time period. Some of the key events and factors that contributed to this acceleration include the end of World War II, which weakened European powers and led to the rise of anti-colonial movements the spread of nationalism and a desire for self-determination among colonized peoples and the influence of Cold War competition, which led some colonial powers to grant independence in order to gain political allies.
