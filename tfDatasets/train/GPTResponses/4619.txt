Aircraft carriers are usually equipped with two types of flight decks: the main flight deck and the smaller, lower-level hangar deck. The main flight deck is where the majority of the carrier's aircraft take off and land. It is a large, flat surface that is reinforced to support the weight of the aircraft and their weapons. The hangar deck is where the carrier's aircraft are stored and maintained. It is located below the main flight deck and is used for minor repairs and maintenance of the aircraft.
