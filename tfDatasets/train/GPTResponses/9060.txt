Historians trace the earliest Baptist church back to the 1600s in England, during a time of religious upheaval and persecution. The first Baptist congregation was formed in 1609 in Amsterdam by a group of English Separatists who were seeking religious freedom. The group, led by John Smyth, rejected infant baptism and believed in the separation of church and state. The first Baptist church in North America was established by Roger Williams in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1638.
