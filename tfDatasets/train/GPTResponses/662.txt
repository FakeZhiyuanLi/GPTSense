Nagarjuna criticized the notion of inherent existence or self-nature (Svabhava) in Buddhist teachings. He argued that all phenomena are empty of inherent existence and that they are dependent on causes and conditions. This idea is known as the doctrine of emptiness or Sunyata. Nagarjuna's critique was directed towards those who held onto the idea of inherent existence as a way of understanding reality and achieving enlightenment. His teachings emphasized the importance of understanding the interdependent nature of phenomena in order to attain liberation from suffering.
