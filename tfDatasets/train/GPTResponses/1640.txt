The majority of cricket bats are made from English willow (Salix alba var. caerulea), which is a light and durable wood with exceptional shock resistance and high moisture content. Other popular woods for cricket bats include Kashmir willow, which is a cheaper alternative to English willow, and redwood, which is commonly used for practice or training bats.
