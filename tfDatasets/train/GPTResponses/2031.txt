There are many notable architectural features of basilicas around the world, but one of the most recognizable and significant is the dome. The dome is a large, rounded structure that sits atop the basilica and is typically supported by columns or arches. It is often adorned with intricate mosaics or frescoes, and serves as a symbolic representation of the heavens or the divine. Many famous basilicas, such as St. Peter's Basilica in Rome or the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul, are famous for their massive and ornate domes.
