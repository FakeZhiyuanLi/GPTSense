The phonological study of a language also aims to identify the patterns of sound distribution, such as syllable structure and phonotactic constraints. It also aims to determine the distinctive features and suprasegmental features, such as stress, tone, and intonation patterns. Furthermore, the phonological study can reveal the historical development of sound changes in the language and can shed light on the sociolinguistic factors that affect the use of different sounds and pronunciation variations. Ultimately, the phonological study is essential for understanding the sound system of languages and how it operates in communication.
