One ancient tradition in most alpine countries is yodelling, a style of singing that involves quickly alternating between low and high pitches using the voice's natural registers. Yodelling was historically used by mountain dwellers as a way of communicating across long distances, and it has since become a cultural tradition and popular form of entertainment in many alpine communities. Other ancient traditions found in alpine countries include traditional woodworking, leatherworking, weaving, and folk music and dance.
