One of the linguistic differences between Czech and Slovak is the pronunciation of the sound ř. In Old Czech, this sound was pronounced as a trill, but in the modern Czech language, it is pronounced as a fricative or affricate. However, in Slovak, the trill pronunciation of ř has been retained. Additionally, Slovak language features some unique diacritical marks and modified letters like "ľ" and "ľh".
