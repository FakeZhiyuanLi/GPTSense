The reduced carbon compounds in the food are broken down through the process of cellular respiration to release energy that the animal can use for its own metabolic processes. This process results in the conversion of the reduced carbon compounds (such as sugars) into carbon dioxide and water, which are then eliminated from the animal's body through respiration and excretion. In this way, the carbon in the plants or other sources is cycled through the ecosystem.
