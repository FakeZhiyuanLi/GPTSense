Organisms have been modified for biofuel production. Certain bacteria and algae have been genetically engineered to produce higher amounts of lipids, which can be converted into biofuels such as biodiesel. This is a promising approach to reducing reliance on non-renewable fossil fuels and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions.
