The second stage in the education provisions set out by RIBA (Royal Institute of British Architects) is the Postgraduate (PG) stage, which is required to become a fully qualified architect. This stage involves a two-year PG diploma or Masters in Architecture, which covers advanced architectural design, technology, and professional practice. The PG stage also includes a range of practical work experience, where students gain real-world experience in architectural practice through placements or internships. At the end of this stage, students must complete a final exam and submit a portfolio of their work to receive their Part 2 qualification from RIBA.
