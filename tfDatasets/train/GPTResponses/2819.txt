The downside of using a lossless format is that the file size is generally larger than a compressed or lossy format, which can take up more storage space and require longer transfer times. Additionally, some devices may not support certain lossless formats, which can limit their compatibility. Lastly, lossless formats may also require higher processing power to decode, which can have an impact on battery life or system performance.
