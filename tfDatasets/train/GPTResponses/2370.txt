Herbaceous plants do not produce material that is referred to as "wood". Plants that produce wood are typically woody plants, such as trees and shrubs. The production of wood is due to the secondary growth of tissue in these plants, where cells called cambium produce new cells that form wood. Wood is primarily made up of cellulose and lignin, which provide strength and structure to the plant. Some examples of plants that produce wood include oak trees, pine trees, and maple trees.
