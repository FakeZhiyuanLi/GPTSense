Behavioral autonomy refers to an individual's ability to make decisions and take actions based on personal values, beliefs, and goals rather than external pressures or influences. It involves the capacity to act independently and the freedom to choose one's own course of action. This concept is often studied in the context of psychology, sociology, and organizational behavior.
