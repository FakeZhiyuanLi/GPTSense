Gene therapy techniques can be used to make changes in an adult organism in a variety of ways, such as:1. Treating genetic disorders: Gene therapy can directly intervene in the genetic code of an adult organism and rectify the genetic mutations that cause genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, Huntington's disease, etc.2. Cancer treatment: Gene therapy can be used to modify cells, such as T cells, to target and attack cancer cells specifically. This can help to treat certain types of cancers more effectively.3. Inherited diseases: Gene therapy can be used to replace or supplement the genes of an adult organism that carries an inherited disease, such as hemophilia or muscular dystrophy.4. Diabetes: Gene therapy can target cells in the pancreas to increase or decrease the production of insulin, which could help regulate blood sugar levels and treat diabetes.5. Cardiovascular diseases: Gene therapy can help treat cardiovascular diseases by targeting genes that are responsible for the regulation of blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood clotting factors that may cause heart disease.6. Neurodegenerative diseases: Gene therapy can be used to deliver therapeutic genes to the brain to treat neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, or ALS.
