The goal of the US and Coalition airstrikes in Syria, which began in 2014, was to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and to degrade its ability to operate in both Iraq and Syria. The airstrikes also aimed to support the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in their fight against ISIS and to protect civilians from the terrorist group's brutal tactics. In addition, the airstrikes targeted other extremist groups operating in Syria, including al-Qaeda affiliates. The ultimate objective was to create stability and security in the region and to prevent the resurgence of extremist groups that pose a threat to the region and to the world.
