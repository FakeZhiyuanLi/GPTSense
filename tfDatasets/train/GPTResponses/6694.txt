Pope Paul VI completed the work of the Second Vatican Council (also known as Vatican II), which had been started by his predecessors Pope John XXIII and Pope Paul VI. Vatican II was a series of meetings held by the Catholic Church between 1962 and 1965, aimed at updating and modernizing the Church's practices and teachings. Paul VI oversaw the implementation of the Council's reforms, which included changes to the liturgy, increased engagement with other religious faiths, and an emphasis on the role of the laity in the Church.
