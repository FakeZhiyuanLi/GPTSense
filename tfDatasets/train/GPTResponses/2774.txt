The baroque trumpet became an important instrument in the Baroque period, particularly in the music of the church and the royal court. It was known for its bright and powerful sound that was capable of carrying over larger ensembles. The instrument has since evolved into the modern trumpet that is widely used in jazz, classical, and popular music today.
