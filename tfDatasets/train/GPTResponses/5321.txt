Akathists are a type of hymn or prayer in the Eastern Orthodox Church, typically sung or chanted in honor of a specific saint or theme. The word "akathist" comes from the Greek word "akathistos," which means "not seated" or "not sitting," referring to the tradition that these hymns are sung standing up. Akathists often include poetic language and vivid imagery, and are considered a form of spiritual poetry. They are typically sung or chanted during church services, and can also be used for personal devotions.
