Stepped speed control is achieved by controlling the amount of power supplied to a motor in predefined increments. This is done using electrical devices such as switches, relays or programmable logic controllers (PLCs) which can be set up to change the voltage or current supplied to the motor in steps, thereby controlling its speed. These devices can be set up to switch between different voltage values or to modulate the voltage and current supplied to the motor in order to achieve the desired speed. Stepped speed control is commonly used in applications such as fans, pumps and conveyor belts where different speeds are required for different operations.
