Asphalt overlay typically deposits small aggregates (usually between 0.75 to 1.5 inches in size) of crushed stones and sand mixed with liquid asphalt binder on top of an existing pavement surface. The mixture is compacted to create a new, smooth, and durable surface layer on an existing pavement. The overlay deposition can also include a leveling course added to address any significant surface irregularities.
