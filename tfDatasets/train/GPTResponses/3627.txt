The earliest human inhabitants were discovered in East Africa, specifically in modern-day Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania. The earliest known human species, Homo habilis, lived in this region about 2.8 million years ago. Other early human species, such as Homo erectus and Homo sapiens, also lived in the same region before spreading to other parts of the world.
