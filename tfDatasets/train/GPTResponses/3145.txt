Many alpine countries developed heavy protection to prevent new invasion after World War II, particularly in the 1950s and 1960s. This was prompted by the perceived threat of the Cold War and the tense political climate between the Western powers and the Soviet Union. Many countries built extensive fortifications, such as bunkers and underground tunnels, and placed large numbers of troops along their borders to deter potential invaders. These defensive measures were further reinforced during the 1980s, as tensions between East and West continued to mount.
