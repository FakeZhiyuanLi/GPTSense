The USB 2.0 specification requires the data transfer rate to be at least 480 Mbps (megabits per second), which is 40 times faster than the original USB 1.1 standard. It also requires backward compatibility with USB 1.1 devices, the ability to connect up to 127 devices on a single USB port, and support for hot-swapping of devices without the need for a computer restart. Additionally, the USB 2.0 specification requires devices to go through a specific testing and certification process to ensure compatibility and compliance with the standard.
