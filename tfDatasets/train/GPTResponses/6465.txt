The other requirement needed to form asphalt is the presence of a binding agent, which could be a natural or synthetic material. In most cases, asphalt is formed by mixing bitumen, a sticky black substance derived from crude oil, with aggregate materials such as sand, gravel, or crushed stone. The binding agent helps to hold the aggregate materials together and to provide the necessary strength and durability for the pavement. Other additives such as pigments, polymers, and recycled materials may also be used to enhance the performance and sustainability of asphalt.
