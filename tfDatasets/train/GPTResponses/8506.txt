The BOM (Bill of Materials) specifies the list of materials or components required to manufacture a product, including their quantities, descriptions, and part numbers. It serves as a reference for procurement, production planning, and inventory management. The BOM typically includes information such as the manufacturer or supplier of each part, the unit of measure needed, and the location and sequence of where each part is used in the product assembly.
