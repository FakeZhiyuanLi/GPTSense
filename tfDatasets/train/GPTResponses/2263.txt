One of the most common features shared by most treaties since the late 19th century is the inclusion of dispute resolution mechanisms. These mechanisms aim to help parties involved in a treaty to settle disputes that may arise during the implementation or enforcement of the treaty's provisions. Another common feature is the provision for the establishment of an international body or organization to oversee the implementation and enforcement of the treaty. Additionally, many treaties since the late 19th century have included provisions related to human rights, environmental protection, and disarmament.
