The first breed of domesticated duck is believed to be the Mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos), which has been selectively bred for thousands of years in Asia and Europe. However, other breeds such as the Muscovy duck (Cairina moschata) and the Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos domestica) also have a long history of domestication and have been developed into distinct breeds.
