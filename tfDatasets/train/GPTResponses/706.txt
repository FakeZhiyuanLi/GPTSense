Genome size has a direct relationship with the complexity of an organism in prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes. In general, prokaryotes with smaller genomes tend to have simpler lifestyles and metabolic capabilities, while those with larger genomes tend to have more complex lifestyles and metabolic capabilities. Similarly, lower eukaryotes with smaller genomes tend to have simpler body plans and fewer genes than those with larger genomes. However, there are exceptions to this general trend, and the relationship between genome size and complexity is not always straightforward.
