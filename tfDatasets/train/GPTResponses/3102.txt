The phenotype of an organism describes its observable physical and behavioral characteristics. This includes things like:1. Physical structure (size, shape, color, etc.)2. Biochemistry (enzymes, hormones, neurotransmitters, etc.)3. Physiology (metabolism, growth, reproduction, etc.)4. Behavior (movement, communication, feeding, defense, etc.)5. Developmental processes (embryonic growth, aging, regeneration, etc.)6. Environmental adaptations (tolerance to temperature, pH, salinity, etc.)These traits are determined by the interaction between an organism's genes (genotype) and environmental factors, such as nutrition, stress, and exposure to toxins. The study of phenotypic traits is important in understanding evolution, genetic variability, and disease susceptibility.
