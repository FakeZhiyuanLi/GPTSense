Early state organizations were headed by leaders who were typically appointed or elected by the governing body or the members of the organization. They could be elected officials or appointed officials, such as governors, mayors, or heads of departments. Leaders would have various responsibilities, such as overseeing the operation of the organization, implementing policies and programs, managing budgets and resources, maintaining public trust and support, and representing the organization to the public and other stakeholders.
