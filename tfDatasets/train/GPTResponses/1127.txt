genre of music?It depends on which composer and which time period you are referring to! Popular music from a composer's time could be incorporated into a variety of genres of music, depending on the style and cultural context. For example, if we were talking about Mozart and his time period of the late 1700s, popular music of the time could have been incorporated into classical music and operas. If we were talking about the Beatles in the 1960s, popular music of their time could have been incorporated into rock and roll, pop, and psychedelic music.
