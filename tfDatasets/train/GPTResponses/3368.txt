An opera buffa is a type of operatic genre characterized by a comic, humorous, and often satirical tone. It originated in the 18th century in Italy and was typically performed in the Italian language. Opera buffa often featured common and relatable characters, with amusing storylines and use of farce or slapstick comedy. The music was also lighter in style, often including ensemble numbers and arias with catchy and memorable melodies. Notable examples of opera buffa include Mozart's "The Marriage of Figaro" and Rossini's "The Barber of Seville."
