The split in the Boixos Nois group caused many to support their ban from football stadiums and crackdown on hooliganism in sports. The faction that split from the main group was known for their extreme violence and involvement in criminal activities, leading many to view them as a threat to public safety. Their actions also tarnished the reputation of the football club they associated with, leading many to support measures to remove them from the community.
