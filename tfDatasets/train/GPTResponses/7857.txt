The Imperial British Government continued to advise governors-general of granting of assent, even after their colonies had responsible government. This was because of the constitutional framework of the British Empire, which maintained a hierarchical relationship between the British Crown and the colonies, even when the colonies had gained a degree of self-government. The practice of advising governors-general on the granting of assent continued until the Statute of Westminster was passed in 1931, which granted full autonomy to the Dominions, including the power to make their own laws without the need for British approval.
