A state may withdraw from a treaty because of sovereignty when it believes that the treaty provisions violate its sovereignty or its domestic laws. The sovereignty principle grants states the right to govern themselves without external interference. Therefore, if a state feels that the treaty provisions undermine its sovereignty or impose obligations that violate its domestic laws, it may withdraw from the treaty. However, the withdrawal must be done in accordance with the treaty provisions and international law to avoid causing any legal implications.
