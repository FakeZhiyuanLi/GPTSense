The era that is commonly associated with extended melodic lines is the Romantic era, which spanned from around the early 19th century to the early 20th century. Composers such as Beethoven, Schubert, Chopin, and Tchaikovsky are known for their use of long and expressive melodic lines that often convey intense emotions and deep personal expression. This style of music is often associated with the ideals of individualism, emotionalism, and subjectivity that were prevalent in the Romantic era.
