The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) controls the conferencing while it's active on the signaling plane. SIP is a signaling protocol used to initiate, modify, and terminate Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) sessions, including audio and video conferencing sessions. It manages the establishment of a conference call, adding and removing participants, muting and unmuting participants, and terminating the call.
