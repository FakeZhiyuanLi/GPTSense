Freddie Mercury's surname was inspired by the title of a 1951 song called "My Fairy King" by his band Queen. The lyrics of the song describe a fairy king and his kingdom, which reflected Mercury's fascination with the fantasy genre. He chose the name Mercury as a symbol of communication and the Roman god of commerce, which he felt represented his ambition to connect with audiences around the world.
