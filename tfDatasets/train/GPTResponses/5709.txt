France has a long and complex history with its Jewish population. While there were times of persecution and expulsion, there is not a single event that can be pointed to as the exact expulsion of the original Jewish population.Jews have been present in what is now France since the Roman Empire, with a significant population established by the Middle Ages. However, they faced persecution during the Crusades and were expelled from various regions during the Middle Ages.One of the most significant events in Jewish history in France was the Dreyfus Affair in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, in which a Jewish army officer was falsely accused of espionage and subjected to an antisemitic campaign. This led to calls for the expulsion of Jews from France.During World War II, many Jews in France were deported to concentration camps by the Vichy government, which collaborated with Nazi Germany. However, many Jews also found refuge in France during this time, and the French Resistance included many Jewish fighters.Today, France has a sizeable Jewish population, estimated at around 500,000 people.
