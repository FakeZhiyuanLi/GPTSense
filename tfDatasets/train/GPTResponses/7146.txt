There are several factors that can weaken cell walls including:1. Enzymatic degradation: Certain enzymes can break down the components of cell walls and weaken their integrity.2. Mechanical stress: Physical pressures or stresses can damage cell walls and make them more susceptible to damage.3. Chemical exposure: Exposure to certain chemicals, such as acids, alkalis, or organic solvents, can degrade cell wall components.4. Temperature extremes: Extreme temperatures, both high and low, can weaken cell walls and compromise cell integrity.5. Pathogen attack: Some microorganisms can target cell walls and break them down for access to the cell's contents.
