Victoria lived with her mother, the Duchess of Kent, at the beginning of her reign because her father, the Duke of Kent, had passed away before she was born. As a result, her mother played a prominent role in her upbringing, and Victoria had a close relationship with her. Additionally, the Duchess served as Victoria's regent until she reached the age of 18 and was able to rule on her own.
