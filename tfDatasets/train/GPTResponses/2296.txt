Writers in the Middle Ages often used the scheme of "three ages" to divide history. This scheme divided history into three periods: the Age of Fathers (from Creation to Abraham), the Age of Law (from Moses to Christ), and the Age of Grace (from Christ's birth to the end of time). This scheme was popular in medieval theology and literature and was used to discuss the history of humanity and God's plan for salvation.
