Various animals and plants take advantage of migrating birds. For example, raptors such as eagles and hawks prey on migrating birds, while parasites such as ticks and lice attach themselves to birds and use them as means of transportation. Plants in certain regions also depend on bird migration to disperse their seeds, as birds eat fruits and disperse seeds throughout their journeys. Additionally, birdwatchers and bird conservation organizations also take advantage of migrating birds to study their behavior and monitor their populations.
