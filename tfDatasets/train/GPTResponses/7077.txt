Presbyterianism can be traced back to the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, particularly to the teachings of John Calvin in Geneva, Switzerland. The term "Presbyterian" comes from the Greek word "presbyteros," meaning "elder," which refers to the way in which the church is governed with a group of elders or presbyters as leaders. The first Presbyterian Church was established in Scotland in the 16th century, and the Presbyterian faith spread to England, Ireland, and the United States in subsequent years.
