There were several political guides during the Protestant Reformation, but one of the most prominent was Martin Luther, a German monk and theologian who sparked the movement with his Ninety-Five Theses in 1517. Other political figures who played a role in the Reformation included King Henry VIII of England, who broke away from the Catholic Church and established the Church of England, and John Calvin, who led the Reformed movement in Switzerland and influenced Protestant theology across Europe.
