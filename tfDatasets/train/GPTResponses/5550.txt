Thiazide antihypertensive drugs were primarily used to treat high blood pressure or hypertension. They were often used in combination with other medications such as ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, or calcium channel blockers to help control blood pressure and reduce the risk of complications such as stroke or heart attack. Thiazide diuretics were also sometimes used to treat edema (fluid accumulation) caused by heart failure, liver disease, or kidney problems.
