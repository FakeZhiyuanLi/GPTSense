Chickens are capable of flying short distances, but they are not like other birds that have specialized flight adaptations. Chickens have wings that are designed more for balance and posture than for sustained flight. They typically use their wings to flap and jump to help them reach perches or get over obstacles, but they cannot fly for extended periods of time or reach great heights like other birds.
