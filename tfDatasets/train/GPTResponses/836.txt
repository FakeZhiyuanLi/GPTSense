In the first century CE, the region of what is now known as Europe and Central Asia was home to various tribes who were vying for power, including the Gauls, Celts, Romans, Germans, and Scythians, among others. Each of these tribes had their own unique cultures, languages, and customs, and they often clashed over territory and resources. Ultimately, it was the Romans who emerged as the dominant power in the region, conquering much of Europe and establishing a vast empire that lasted for centuries.
