The primary trigger for immunological changes in teens is puberty. As hormones increase and the body undergoes physical changes, the immune system also undergoes changes that can affect how it responds to infections and illnesses. The increased production of hormones such as testosterone and estrogen can enhance the immune response, while also increasing the risk of autoimmune disorders. Additionally, lifestyle factors such as diet, exercise, and stress can also influence immunological changes in teens.
