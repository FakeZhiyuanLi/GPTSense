Stiffness and elastic strength depend more on the material's composition and structure than defects. The arrangement of atoms and molecules in a material and their ability to resist deformation determine its stiffness and elastic strength. Defects can weaken or affect its mechanical properties but do not play a significant role in determining its intrinsic stiffness and elastic strength.
