The interpretation of Islam that is considered the "gold standard" by many of its adherents is the Sunni school of thought. Sunni Islam is the largest and most widely followed sect of Islam, with approximately 85-90% of the world's Muslim population adhering to this interpretation. Sunni Muslims uphold the Quran and teachings of the Prophet Muhammad as their primary sources of guidance, and emphasize the importance of unity and tradition within the Islamic community. They also place great emphasis on the importance of consensus and the interpretation of Islamic law (sharia) by qualified religious scholars (ulema).
