In Czech, the accusative case is used to mark the direct object of transitive verbs, as well as some prepositions such as "do" (into), "na" (onto), and "pro" (for). For example:- Vidím auto. (I see the car.) - "auto" is in the accusative as it is the direct object of the verb "vidím" (to see).- Dávám dárek mamince. (I give a gift to mom.) - "dárek" (gift) is in the accusative as it is the direct object of the verb "dávám" (to give).- Jdeme do kina. (We are going to the cinema.) - "kino" (cinema) is in the accusative as it follows the preposition "do" (into).- Stavíme hlavu na polštář. (We put our head on the pillow.) - "hlavu" (head) is in the accusative as it follows the preposition "na" (onto).- Kupuji květiny pro maminku. (I am buying flowers for mom.) - "květiny" (flowers) is in the accusative as it follows the preposition "pro" (for).
