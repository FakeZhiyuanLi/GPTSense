The old style date refers to the way dates were written before the adoption of the Gregorian calendar in 1582. This calendar replaced the Julian calendar, which had been in use for many centuries. The old style date system was based on the Julian calendar and can cause confusion because the year would start on March 25th instead of January 1st. Additionally, the old style date system did not account for leap years as accurately as the Gregorian calendar, leading to an accumulated error of approximately three days every four centuries.
