There is no clear record of which of Alexander's commanders were the first to visit Bahrain. The ancient Greek historian, Arrian, who wrote extensively about Alexander's conquests, did not mention any specific commander visiting Bahrain. However, it is believed that Bahrain was an important trading center in the ancient world, and traders and explorers from the Mediterranean region may have visited the island before Alexander's conquests.
