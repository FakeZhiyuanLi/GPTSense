The rift system developed in the Alpine orogeny is the Rhine Rift System. This is a major rift system that runs from the Mediterranean Sea through the Alps and into the North Sea. It formed during the Miocene and Pliocene periods, around 30-40 million years ago, and is still active today. The Rhine Rift System is characterized by earthquakes, volcanic activity, and the presence of hot springs and geysers.
