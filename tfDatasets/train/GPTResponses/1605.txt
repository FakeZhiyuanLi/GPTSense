There is no one single person who discovered all parts of the immune system, as research on immunity has been ongoing for centuries and has involved countless scientists and researchers. However, some notable figures in the history of immunology include Edward Jenner, who discovered the principle of vaccination in the late 18th century, Louis Pasteur, who developed the first vaccine against rabies in 1885, and Emil von Behring, who discovered the first antitoxin to diphtheria in 1890. More recent discoveries have been made by scientists such as James Allison, who won the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 2018 for his work on immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy for cancer.
