There is no specific answer to this question as the bit rate and compression ratio are not directly related. Bit rate refers to the amount of data transmitted per second, while compression ratio represents the amount of data compression achieved relative to the original uncompressed data. Different compression algorithms can achieve different compression ratios at the same bit rate. Therefore, it is not possible to directly correlate a specific bit rate with a compression ratio.
