The sénat conservateur became hostile to Napoleon due to the efforts of several factors, including:1. The military defeats of Napoleon's armies in Russia and Spain, which weakened his political and military position.2. The rising discontent among the French people over Napoleon's policies of conscription, high taxes, and restrictions on civil liberties.3. The opposition of some members of the sénat conservateur who saw Napoleon as a threat to their own power and influence.4. The growing influence of anti-Napoleonic forces in Europe, such as the British and Prussian governments, who sought to undermine Napoleon's rule.Overall, it was a combination of internal and external factors that led to the sénat conservateur becoming hostile to Napoleon's rule.
