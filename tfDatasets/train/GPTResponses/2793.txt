is known as the "traditional" or "vernacular" architecture of different regions, blending modern design with local materials and building techniques. This trend is often referred to as "modern vernacular" or "regional modernism." It aims to create homes that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also sustainable, energy-efficient, and culturally relevant. This approach can be seen in the use of local stone, clay, or wood for construction, as well as the incorporation of traditional elements such as courtyards, terraces, or pitched roofs. The result is a new kind of architecture that respects local traditions while embracing contemporary design principles.
