There is no one specific source that says all high mountains are called "Alpes" by Celts. This is likely due to the fact that the word "Alpes" is derived from a pre-Celtic language spoken in the region, and was later adopted by the Celts who inhabited the area. Additionally, there may be variations in the Celtic languages spoken in different areas, resulting in different names for mountains.
