To ensure that the largest number of people see a movie at the theater, some restrictions may be put in place such as limiting the number of screenings of other movies that may conflict with the popular movie's showtimes, allocating the biggest and best screens and auditoriums to the popular movie, reducing the ticket prices for the movie, or promoting it heavily through marketing and advertising campaigns. Additionally, theaters may also increase the number of showtimes for the popular movie, especially during peak hours, to accommodate more viewers. However, such measures may still not guarantee that every person who wants to see the movie will be able to do so.
