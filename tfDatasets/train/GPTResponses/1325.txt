Africans and mixed-race children were considered as lower-class in many societies, especially during times of slavery and colonialism, where they were subjected to exploitation and discrimination based on their race and social status. However, this varied depending on the country and the context within which they lived. Some societies developed complex systems of social stratification based on race and ancestry, where mixed-race individuals occupied a unique social position between whiteness and blackness. In some cases, they were able to use this position to their advantage, while in others, they faced additional challenges and barriers that limited their opportunities and social mobility.
