Lizzie Magie, an American game designer and writer, invented the precursor to Monopoly called The Landlord's Game in 1903. The game was intended to teach the principles of Georgism, a political philosophy focused on land reform. The game eventually evolved into Monopoly, as we know it today, and was popularized by Charles Darrow during the Great Depression. Darrow, who had learned the game from friends, adapted it and began selling it in Atlantic City in the 1930s.
