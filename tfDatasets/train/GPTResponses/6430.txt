It is commonly believed that the statement "an army with Napoleon at its head was worth 40,000 men" was made by Joseph LÃ©opold Sigisbert Hugo, a French general and father of the famous writer Victor Hugo. However, there is no direct evidence of him ever having said this, and it may have just been a popular legend. Nevertheless, it is a testament to Napoleon's reputation as a skilled military strategist and leader.
