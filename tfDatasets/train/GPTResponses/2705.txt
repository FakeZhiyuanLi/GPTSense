The Arctic Tern holds the record for the longest migration of any bird, traveling between its Arctic breeding grounds and its winter home in the Antarctic each year. They can travel up to 44,000 miles (70,900 km) round-trip annually, which is the equivalent of traveling around the earth two and a half times.
