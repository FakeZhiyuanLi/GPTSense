Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek were both prominent economists who were associated with the Austrian School of economics. They did not run any specific business or organization together, but they were both influential academics and authors who wrote extensively on free market economics, individual liberty, and the role of government in a capitalist society. Their ideas and theories have had a significant impact on modern conservative and libertarian economic thought.
