The steppe is important agriculturally because of its rich and fertile soils. The grasslands provide a perfect environment for growing crops, such as wheat, barley, and oats, and for grazing livestock, such as sheep, goats, and horses. The steppe also has a temperate climate, with warm summers and cold winters, which is conducive to both crop and animal production.
