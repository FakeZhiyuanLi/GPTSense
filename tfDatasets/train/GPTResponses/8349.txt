Beaks are the hard, pointed structures found on the faces of birds, which serve as the primary tool for feeding and manipulating their environment. They are often specialized, with different shapes and sizes adapting them to different types of food, such as cracking nuts or catching insects. Some birds also use their beaks to groom and preen, to fight off predators, and to build and maintain their nests.
