Verticals are found repeated in the interior of Gothic buildings in elements such as columns, piers, moldings, buttresses, and arches. They are used to create a sense of height, rhythm, and structure in the interior space. The verticality of Gothic architecture is an important characteristic that distinguishes it from other architectural styles.
