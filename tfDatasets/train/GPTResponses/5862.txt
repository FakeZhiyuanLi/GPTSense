The initiative launched in Melbourne in February 2010 as an effort to transition human society towards sustainability is called the "Transition Towns" movement. This movement aims to build local resilience and sustainability by encouraging communities to become more self-sufficient and less reliant on fossil fuels. It focuses on developing and implementing innovative solutions to the challenges of climate change, peak oil, and economic instability at a local level. The movement has since spread to many other cities and towns around the world.
