Americans began to establish their own laws independently of the English following the signing of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. The American colonies declared their independence from Great Britain and began forming their own governments with their own laws and constitutions. This led to the creation of the United States of America and the adoption of the Constitution in 1787, which outlines the framework for the federal government and delineates the powers of the states.
