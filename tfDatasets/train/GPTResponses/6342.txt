Yes, chicken contains fat, but the amount and type of fat varies depending on the cut of meat and how it is prepared. Skinless chicken breast is the leanest part of the bird and contains very little fat, while chicken thighs and legs contain more fat. How the chicken is cooked, such as frying or roasting with added oils or butter, can also increase the amount of fat in the meat.
