Some early Dominican followers had trouble reconciling Aristotle's philosophy with their Christian faith. They were concerned that the emphasis on reason and intellect could lead to a neglect of the role of faith and revelation in understanding God. Eventually, Dominican theologians such as Thomas Aquinas worked to integrate Aristotelian philosophy and Christian theology, leading to a fruitful intellectual tradition within the Dominican Order.
