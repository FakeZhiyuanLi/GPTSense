The numbers in a bulb shape designation generally identify the maximum diameter of the bulb (in eighths of an inch) and the maximum length of the bulb (in eighths or quarters of an inch). For example, a BR30 bulb has a maximum bulb diameter of 30 eighths of an inch and may have a length of up to 30 eighths or 3 quarters of an inch. Similarly, a PAR38 bulb has a maximum diameter of 38 eighths of an inch and a length of up to 38 eighths or 4Â¾ inches.
