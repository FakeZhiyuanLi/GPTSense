Vertical takeoff and landing aircraft such as the Harrier and F-35B do not require arresting cables as they are able to hover and land vertically. Additionally, some modern fighter jets like the F-35C are equipped with advanced systems and technology that allow for gentler landings and reduce the need for the use of arresting cables.
