The temporary NBA team, New Orleans Hornets, relocated to Oklahoma City in 2005 due to the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina to the team's home city of New Orleans. The team played its home games at the Ford Center (now known as Chesapeake Energy Arena) in Oklahoma City for two seasons before returning to New Orleans in 2007.
