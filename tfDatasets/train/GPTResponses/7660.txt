One way that the ancestry of Bermudian black population differs from that of British West Indian black population is that a significant percentage of the Bermudian black population is descended from enslaved Africans who were brought directly to Bermuda during the 17th and 18th centuries, while the majority of British West Indian black population is descended from enslaved Africans who were brought to the Caribbean via the transatlantic slave trade. Additionally, Bermuda has a significant population of Afro-Portuguese and Cape Verdean ancestry due to the island's history as a Portuguese settlement.
