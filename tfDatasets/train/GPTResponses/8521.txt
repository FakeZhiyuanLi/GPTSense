Milton Friedman proposed the concept of monetarism, which emphasizes the role of monetary policy in economic stability and growth. According to Friedman, the government's main job is to ensure a stable money supply, and this can be achieved by controlling the growth of the money supply through the use of monetary policy tools such as interest rates, reserve requirements, and open market operations. Friedman argued that excessive government intervention in the economy can lead to inflation and economic instability, and that the free market should be allowed to operate with minimal government interference.
