Multiple protein coding sequences within a single RNA molecule can be transcribed as a polycistronic mRNA. These polycistronic mRNAs are commonly found in prokaryotes, and they contain multiple coding sequences that are translated into different proteins. In eukaryotes, most mRNAs are monocistronic, meaning they contain only one coding sequence that is translated into a single protein. However, rare exceptions do exist, particularly in viruses that infect eukaryotic cells. In these cases, the viral genome may contain multiple coding sequences that are translated into different proteins from a single mRNA molecule.
