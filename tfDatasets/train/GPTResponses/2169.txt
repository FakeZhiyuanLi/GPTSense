Encoders base the encoding rate for each frame on several factors, including the complexity of the image or scene being captured, the desired level of video quality, the available bandwidth or storage capacity, and the encoding standards and algorithms being used. For example, if the scene has a lot of motion or changes frequently, the encoder may need to allocate more bits to each frame to preserve the details and prevent blur or distortion. On the other hand, if the scene is relatively static or simple, the encoder may use fewer bits and compress the data more aggressively. Overall, the goal is to achieve the best balance between video quality and file size, while meeting the requirements of the intended playback or distribution platform.
