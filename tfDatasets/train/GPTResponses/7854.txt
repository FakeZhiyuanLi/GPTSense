Exhibition games in the Olympics refer to friendly or demonstration games that are played outside of the official competitions. These games are intended to showcase a particular sports event or to allow athletes to practice and prepare for the actual competition. Exhibition games may involve Olympic sports or other sports that are not officially included in the Olympic program. They typically do not carry any medals or points towards the final rankings of the Olympic Games. Exhibition games are often organized in the lead-up to the Olympics as part of promotional activities or as part of cultural exchanges between participating countries.
