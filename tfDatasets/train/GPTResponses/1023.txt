Duns Scotus was opposed to the school of thought known as Nominalism, which held that universal concepts or categories (such as "dog" or "beauty") are only names or labels applied to individual instances of those concepts, and not real entities in themselves. Duns Scotus argued for the reality of universals, and proposed a theory of "univocity" that held that the same terms can be applied in the same way to both God and creatures, preserving the unity of being.
