The concept associated with the solvability of polynomials is called Galois theory, named after the French mathematician Ã‰variste Galois. Galois theory deals with the question of whether a given polynomial equation can be solved algebraically, that is, whether its roots can be expressed in terms of algebraic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and root extraction) applied to the coefficients of the polynomial. It also provides a method for determining the symmetries or invariants of those roots, which have implications in number theory and other areas of mathematics. The critical insight of Galois theory is that the solvability of a polynomial equation is related to the structure of its group of symmetries, known as the Galois group.
