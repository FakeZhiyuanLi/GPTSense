The process that splits the chromosome between gametes is called meiosis. It is a type of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half, resulting in the formation of haploid cells (gametes) from diploid cells (somatic cells). During meiosis, two rounds of division occur, resulting in the formation of four genetically diverse daughter cells, each with half the number of chromosomes as their parent cell. This ensures that when sperm and egg cells combine during fertilization, the resulting zygote has the correct number of chromosomes.
