The analysis of the genome has highlighted the crucial role of sponges, placozoans, and choanoflagellates in understanding the arrival of ancestral genes that are unique to the eumetazoa. Eumetazoa are multicellular organisms that possess specialized tissues and organs, and these ancestral genes played a pivotal role in the evolution and diversification of this group.Sponges, placozoans, and choanoflagellates are considered to be key evolutionary intermediates or proxy ancestors for the eumetazoa. Sponges, for instance, are the oldest extant multicellular animals, and their genomes contain a diverse array of genes that have been implicated in the evolution of metazoan cell signaling and adhesion.Similarly, placozoans, which lack specialized organs and possess only two cell layers, exhibit an intriguing mix of ancestral and derived features, making them a valuable model for exploring the evolution of multicellularity. Key eumetazoan innovations, such as cell signaling through receptor tyrosine kinases, are present in the placozoan genome but absent in sponges, underscoring the importance of studying these intermediates in understanding the origin and diversification of novel traits.Choanoflagellates are unicellular eukaryotes that possess a distinctive collar of microvilli, which strikingly resembles the collar cells of sponges. Recent comparative genomic analyses have revealed that choanoflagellates contain a large number of genes that are also present in animals, including many eumetazoan-specific genes. These findings suggest that choanoflagellates may have played an important role in the evolution of eumetazoan-specific innovations.Together, the genomes of sponges, placozoans, and choanoflagellates have provided valuable insights into the evolutionary origins of the eumetazoa. These evolutionary intermediates possess unique combinations of ancestral and derived features, which have allowed researchers to reconstruct the pathways that led to the emergence of novel traits and functions in multicellular animals. Thus, the analysis of these genomes has significantly improved our understanding of the processes that shaped the evolution of eumetazoan organisms.
