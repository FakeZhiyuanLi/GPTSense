Historically, bishops of the West have met in various locations depending on the time period and purpose of the meeting. Some of the most notable locations include Rome, which has been the traditional seat of the Bishop of Rome (the Pope) and a center of Christian authority and pilgrimage for hundreds of years. Other important locations have included major cities such as Constantinople, Alexandria, Jerusalem, and Antioch, which were centers of the early Christian church and home to many important bishops and theological thinkers. In more recent times, bishops of the West have also convened at various ecumenical councils, such as the Second Vatican Council, which was held in Rome in 1962-65.
