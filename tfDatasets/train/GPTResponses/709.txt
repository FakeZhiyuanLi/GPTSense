Two types of repetitive DNA found in genomes are:1. Satellite DNA: Satellite DNA consists of repetitive sequences of non-coding DNA that are often found in centromeric and telomeric regions of chromosomes. These sequences are repeated a large number of times and vary in length from a few to thousands of base pairs.2. Transposable Elements: Transposable Elements (TEs) are fragments of DNA that can move or transpose from one location to another within a genome. TEs can be divided into two classes: DNA transposons and retrotransposons. Both classes of TEs have the ability to cause changes in the structure and function of a genome.
