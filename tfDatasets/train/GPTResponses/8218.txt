The uniform theory of groups developed from different sources throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. It drew on the work of mathematicians like Ã‰variste Galois, Arthur Cayley, and Augustin-Louis Cauchy, who studied the structure of permutations and permutations groups. It also incorporated ideas from algebraic number theory, particularly the concept of group actions on lattices and ideals.The early development of the theory was marked by debates over the significance and nature of groups, as well as the relationship between group theory and other branches of mathematics. However, as more mathematicians began to study groups in the late 19th century, a consensus emerged around the idea that groups were a fundamental concept in mathematics, and that the structure of groups could be analyzed using a unified set of axioms and definitions.This culminated in the publication of the first systematic treatment of group theory, written by the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie in 1884. Lie's work helped to establish the uniform theory of groups as a distinct branch of mathematics, and laid the foundations for many of the modern techniques used in the study of groups today.
