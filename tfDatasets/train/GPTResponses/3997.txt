Harmonics are an important class of frequencies that occur in various fields, including physics, music, and electrical engineering. They refer to the multiple frequencies or tones that are produced by a vibrating object or system, in addition to the fundamental frequency. These harmonics are characterized by their frequency, amplitude, and phase with respect to the fundamental frequency. Understanding harmonics is critical in many applications, including designing efficient electrical systems, analyzing sound and music, and studying wave phenomena.
