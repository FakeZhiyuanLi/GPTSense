The Cathars were a religious group that lived primarily in the Languedoc region of France during the 12th and 13th centuries. They held beliefs that differed from those of the Catholic Church, and were therefore persecuted and eventually exterminated by the Inquisition.The Cathars lived simple lives, eschewing material possessions and emphasizing spiritual purity. They believed in a dualistic worldview, in which the material world was corrupt and the spiritual world was pure. They believed in a hierarchy of souls, with the perfecti (or "pure ones") at the top, who were considered to be the most spiritually advanced members of the community. Cathars also renounced marriage, sex, and procreation, believing that these were manifestations of the evil of the material world.Cathars lived in communities, often in remote areas, and were known for their peacefulness and kindness to one another. They believed in non-violence and would not take an oath in a court of law or serve in the military. They were also vegetarian and would not kill animals for food, as they believed that all living beings had souls.Despite their peacefulness, the Cathars were persecuted by the Catholic Church, and many were burned at the stake. The Cathar faith eventually died out, but remnants of their beliefs and practices can still be found in some modern spiritual traditions.
