Dichotomous keys are tools used in biology and other fields to identify and classify organisms based on their characteristics. They are often composed of a series of questions or statements that require a yes or no answer, leading the user toward the correct identification of the organism. This process divides the specimens into two distinct categories, hence the term "dichotomous". Dichotomous keys are commonly used in the field of taxonomy, where they help scientists classify and name new species based on their physical or genetic features.
