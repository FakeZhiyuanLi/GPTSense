The variety of alleles within a single species refers to the different versions of genes that exist in the population of that species. Alleles are alternative forms of a gene that are responsible for different traits or characteristics. For example, in humans, the gene for eye color has several different alleles, including those for blue, green, and brown eyes. The variety of alleles within a species is important for genetic diversity, and it can impact things like adaptability to changing environments, disease resistance, and overall fitness.
