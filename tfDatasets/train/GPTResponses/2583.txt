Sarmatism is a cultural and historical movement that originated in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in the 17th century. The name is derived from the Sarmatians, an ancient Iranian tribe that inhabited parts of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. The Sarmatians were known for their bravery, military prowess, and nomadic lifestyles, which were admired by the Polish nobility. Sarmatism became associated with the Polish nobility's sense of identity, emphasizing their roots and ancestral traditions, which were often exaggerated and embellished.
