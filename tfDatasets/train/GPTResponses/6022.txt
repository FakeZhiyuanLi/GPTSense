Sanskrit is traditionally written using the Devanagari script, which has been the primary script for Sanskrit writing since ancient times. Other scripts, such as the Brahmi script, have also been used historically for writing Sanskrit. Nowadays, Sanskrit is also written using various computer fonts that support the Devanagari script.
