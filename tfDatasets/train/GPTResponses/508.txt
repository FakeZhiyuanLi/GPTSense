The legal case that sought to compel the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate greenhouse gases was Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, decided by the US Supreme Court in 2007. The case was brought by a group of states, cities, and environmental organizations, who argued that the EPA had the authority and obligation under the Clean Air Act to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as pollutants that contribute to global warming. The court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and held that greenhouse gases were indeed pollutants subject to EPA regulation under the Clean Air Act, and directed the agency to either provide a scientific basis for declining to regulate them or to establish regulations to address their impact on climate change.
