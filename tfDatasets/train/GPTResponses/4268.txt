Kinect is a motion sensing input device that was developed by Microsoft for use with Xbox gaming consoles and Windows PCs. Essentially, it allows users to control and interact with their devices using gestures and spoken commands, without the need for a physical controller. The device uses a combination of cameras, microphones, and infrared sensors to track the movements and positions of the user, and translate those into on-screen actions. It was first released in 2010 and has since been used for a variety of purposes beyond gaming, including medical rehabilitation, education, and virtual reality applications.
