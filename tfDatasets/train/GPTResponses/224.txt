European regulators introduced several measures to increase the oversight of banks, including:1. The European Banking Union: This framework, set up in 2014, is designed to ensure that the supervision and resolution of banks is consistent across the EU. It includes a Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) that gives the European Central Bank (ECB) the power to supervise banks in the eurozone.2. Capital Requirements Directive IV (CRD IV): This directive, which came into force in 2014, sets out capital requirements for banks in the EU. It requires banks to hold a minimum amount of capital to absorb any losses they might face.3. Stress testing: European regulators conduct regular stress tests on banks to assess their resilience to potential economic shocks. This helps to identify any weaknesses in a bank's balance sheet and allows regulators to take action to address any issues.4. Recovery and Resolution Directive (RRD): This directive, implemented in 2015, establishes a framework for dealing with failing banks. It requires banks to prepare plans outlining how they would manage their affairs in the event of financial distress or failure, and gives authorities the power to intervene and take action to ensure that the bank's failure does not harm the wider financial system.Overall, these measures aim to strengthen the stability of the European banking system and minimize the risks of financial instability.
