The slave states, particularly those in the Deep South, reacted strongly and negatively to Lincoln's election in 1860. Many white Southerners believed that Lincoln and his party were hostile to the institution of slavery and would seek to abolish it or restrict its expansion. This fear was compounded by the fact that the Republican Party, which Lincoln represented, had little support in the South and was viewed as a regional party representing only northern interests.Several states, including South Carolina, seceded from the Union in the weeks following Lincoln's election. They argued that secession was necessary to protect their rights to own slaves and to preserve their way of life. Other Southern states soon followed suit, forming the Confederate States of America and sparking the start of the Civil War.Overall, the slave states' reaction to Lincoln's election was one of fear and defiance, leading to a major crisis in American history.
