In 2012, SÃ£o Paulo suffered a severe drought that affected the city's water supply. The drought was caused by a combination of low rainfall and high temperatures, which led to decreased water levels in the city's reservoirs. As a result, the city implemented strict water rationing measures, and residents were urged to conserve water. The drought had a significant impact on the city's economy and daily life, with businesses and industries forced to scale back operations and residents struggling to access adequate water supplies.
