Copyright registration: By registering their original works with the U.S. Copyright Office or other appropriate authorities, content creators can establish legal ownership of their works and protect them from infringement.2. Digital rights management (DRM): Content creators are using DRM technologies to limit unauthorized access, distribution, and use of their digital content. DRM techniques include encryption, watermarking, and authentication.3. Licensing agreements: Content creators are entering into licensing agreements with distributors and other parties to control how their works are used and distributed. These agreements can include provisions for royalties, minimum sale prices, and usage restrictions.4. Litigation: Content creators are taking legal action against infringers to protect their intellectual property rights. This includes filing lawsuits, sending cease and desist letters, and pursuing damages.5. Education and awareness: Content creators are working to educate consumers and others about copyright law and the importance of respecting intellectual property rights. This includes providing information about how to legally obtain and use copyrighted works, as well as the consequences of infringement.
