Xylophaga is a genus of marine bivalve mollusks that are known to harbor symbiotic bacteria that help in the digestion of wood. The most common bacterial species found in the gut of Xylophaga include aerobic cellulose-degrading bacteria such as Caulobacter, Pseudomonas, Aeromonas, Vibrio, and Flavobacterium. Additionally, anaerobic bacteria such as Clostridium, Bacteroides, Desulfovibrio, and Methanosarcina have also been found in Xylophaga gills and digestive glands.
