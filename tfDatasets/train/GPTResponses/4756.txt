The dollar was originally based on the Spanish silver dollar, also known as the Spanish peso, which became a widely accepted currency in the American colonies in the late 1700s. The U.S. Mint began producing its own silver dollars in 1794, and in 1837, the gold dollar was introduced. Today, the value of the U.S. dollar is based on a variety of factors, including the country's economic performance, interest rates, and global trade patterns.
