FLNG technology facilitates the liquefaction and storage of natural gas directly at offshore gas fields. This technology allows gas producers to avoid the cost and environmental risks associated with the construction of pipelines and onshore liquefaction plants, as well as providing a flexible solution for gas exportation. FLNG also helps to reduce emissions and increase energy efficiency by using natural gas as fuel in the liquefaction process.
