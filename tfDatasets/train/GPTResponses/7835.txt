One example of a carbohydrate that is unable to be fully absorbed in humans is FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols). These are short-chain carbohydrates that are poorly absorbed in the small intestine and can cause digestive symptoms such as bloating, gas, and diarrhea in some people. Foods high in FODMAPs include wheat, onions, garlic, apples, pears, and honey.
