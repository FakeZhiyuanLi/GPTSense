The preferred narrative medium for the interior of Italian cathedrals is fresco painting. Frescoes are paintings made on wet plaster and are known for their durability and ability to withstand the test of time. They have been used in Italian cathedrals since the Middle Ages and are often used to depict religious stories and figures. The frescoes are typically painted on the walls and ceilings of the cathedrals and are often accompanied by intricate mosaics and sculptures to create a rich visual narrative.
