There is no record of Martin Luther preaching a sermon on Marian devotion a month before his death. In fact, Luther's views on Mary were often controversial and he is known for his rejection of some Catholic teachings regarding her. However, it is possible that he may have mentioned Mary or Marian devotion in passing during a sermon, but it is unclear where or when this may have occurred.
