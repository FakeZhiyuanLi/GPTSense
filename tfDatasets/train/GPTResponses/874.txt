There were a number of factors that led to mortgage lenders relaxing underwriting standards and approving riskier mortgages:1. The housing boom: The housing market was on an upswing, and housing prices were rising steadily. This created a sense of optimism among lenders that even riskier borrowers could afford to make their mortgage payments.2. High demand for mortgage-backed securities: The demand for mortgage-backed securities was high, and lenders were under pressure to issue more loans so that they could package them into these securities and sell them on the secondary market.3. Increased competition: With so many lenders vying for business, some began to approve loans for riskier borrowers in order to increase their market share and profitability.4. Low interest rates: Interest rates were historically low, which made it easier for borrowers to qualify for larger loans, even if they had less-than-stellar credit histories.5. Poor oversight: There was a lack of regulation and oversight in the mortgage industry, which allowed lenders to approve loans without proper due diligence or regard for risk. This lax oversight contributed to the housing bubble and ultimately led to the financial crisis of 2008.
