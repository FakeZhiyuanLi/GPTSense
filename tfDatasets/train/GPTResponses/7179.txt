The Great Sphinx of Giza in Egypt was a popular tourist site that was particularly active during the 1920s. Many tourists visited Egypt during this time to see the ancient pyramids and sphinx, and the discovery of King Tutankhamun's tomb in 1922 added to the excitement and interest in Egyptian antiquities.
