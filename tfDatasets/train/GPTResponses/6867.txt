Glass bulbs are typically blown into their characteristic shape using a technique called glassblowing. This involves heating a glass tube or cylinder to a high temperature until it becomes soft and malleable. The glass is then blown using a blowpipe or other tool, which creates pressure inside the glass and causes it to expand into the desired shape. The glass may also be shaped using other tools and techniques, such as molds, paddles, or hand tools. The temperature and timing of the glassblowing process can have a significant impact on the final shape and characteristics of the glass bulb.
