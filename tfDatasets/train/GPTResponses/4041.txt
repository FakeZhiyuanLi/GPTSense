Sigmund Freud argued that emotional responses compete with instinct and reason. In his psychoanalytic theory, he believed that the psyche had three parts: the id (instinctual desires), the ego (reason and logic), and the superego (morality and ethics). He argued that these three parts are in constant conflict with one another, and that emotional responses can sometimes override reason and instinct.
