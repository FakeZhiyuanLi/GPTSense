One example of a non-motor device that demonstrates why a commutator is needed is the electric generator. In an electric generator, a coil of wire is rotated within a magnetic field to produce an electric current. However, if the coil is not connected to a commutator, the direction of the current will change each time the coil rotates 180 degrees. This would result in an inconsistent and fluctuating output of electricity. By using a commutator, the direction of the current is maintained and the output of electricity becomes a steady and reliable current.
