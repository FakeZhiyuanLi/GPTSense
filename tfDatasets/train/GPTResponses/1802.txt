Scientists might add components to wood in order to create new and innovative products, such as:1) Adding resin or polymer to wood to create composite materials, such as wood-plastic composites or engineered wood products.2) Adding fire retardant materials to wood to make it more resistant to fire and improve its safety.3) Adding natural oils or chemicals to wood to make it more resistant to insect infestations or fungal decay.4) Adding nanoparticles or other materials to wood to improve its strength, durability, and other properties.5) Adding dyes or pigments to wood to change its color or appearance, and create new design possibilities.6) Adding coatings or finishes to wood to make it more water-resistant, scratch-resistant or UV-resistant, and increase its lifespan.
