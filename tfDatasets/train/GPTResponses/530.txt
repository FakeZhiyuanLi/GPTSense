Hizb ut-Tahrir aims to establish an Islamic caliphate or state based on Islamic sharia law, which would unite all Muslim lands under a single ruler, with the ultimate goal of achieving global domination. The group advocates for the overthrow of existing governments and the establishment of their own caliphate, promoting a puritanical and conservative interpretation of Islam.
