In the 19th century, the majority of science believed that humans were superior to animals and that there was a clear distinction between them. This view was influenced by the philosophy of the Enlightenment and the idea of a rational, self-determining human being. Scientists of the time believed that humans possessed unique qualities such as reason, consciousness, and the ability to use language and tools, which set them apart from the rest of the animal kingdom.This belief was reinforced by the work of Charles Darwin, who saw human beings as the most evolved species on earth, with specialized cognitive and physical adaptations that allowed them to thrive in their environment. However, some scientists also saw similarities between humans and animals, and believed in the possibility of evolutionary links between them. This became more accepted in the latter half of the 19th century as scientists began to explore genetics and the biological origins of species.
