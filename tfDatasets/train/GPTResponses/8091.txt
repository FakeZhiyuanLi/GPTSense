One specific circumstance where the digestive system is not the first system involved in nutrient processing is during intravenous (IV) feeding. In this method, nutrients are delivered directly into the bloodstream through an IV, bypassing the digestive system altogether. This is often done in cases where a person's digestive system is unable to properly process nutrients, such as in cases of severe gastrointestinal disorders or after certain surgeries.
