African states began to gain independence from European colonial powers in the 1950s and 1960s. The first African country to achieve independence was Ghana on March 6th, 1957. Over the next two decades, several other African nations followed suit, culminating in the wave of decolonization that swept across the continent in the 1960s. By the end of that decade, almost all African states had gained independence, with the exception of a handful of territories that remained under European control until the 1970s.
