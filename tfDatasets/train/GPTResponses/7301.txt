Civitas terrena is a Latin phrase that translates to "earthly city" or "city of man." It is used in philosophy and theology to refer to the temporal and material world, as opposed to the spiritual and eternal world of heaven. The concept was first introduced by St. Augustine in his work "City of God," where he contrasted the civitas terrena with the civitas Dei or the "City of God."
