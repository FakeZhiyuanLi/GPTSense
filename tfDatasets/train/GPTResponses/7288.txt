Plants develop bulbs as a storage organ to survive during adverse conditions such as drought, extreme temperatures, and low light intensity. The bulbs store nutrients such as carbohydrates and proteins that are needed for the plant to grow during the next growing season. For example, bulbs of tulips, daffodils, and onions store nutrients that help the plant to grow when the soil becomes dry or the temperature drops. The bulb also protects the plant from animals that might eat the leaves or stems, as the nutrients are stored underground, away from the surface where the plant is visible.
