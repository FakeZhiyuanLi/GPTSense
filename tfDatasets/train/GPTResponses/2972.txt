Acts such as genocide and piracy are considered to be grave breaches of treaty law. They are prohibited under international law and are subject to prosecution by international criminal tribunals. In the case of piracy, there are specific treaties, such as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, that address the issue and provide for measures to prevent and combat piracy. Similarly, there are specific treaties, such as the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, that prohibit genocide and provide for measures to prevent and punish the crime.
