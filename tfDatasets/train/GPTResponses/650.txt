The type of anthology that deals with patterns of shared knowledge is called a cultural or social anthology. It collects texts, images, and other materials that illustrate the practices, beliefs, values, and customs of a particular group of people or society. It aims to provide insights into how people in different times and places understand and shape their world and how they pass on their knowledge and traditions to future generations. Cultural anthologies can focus on a variety of themes, such as religion, politics, art, literature, folklore, language, gender, ethnicity, and identity.
