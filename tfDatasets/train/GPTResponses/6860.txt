Digital infringement is a social issue in many countries around the world. It affects people and industries that rely on intellectual property rights, such as content creators, musicians, artists, and inventors. However, the severity and prevalence of digital infringement can vary from country to country depending on their economic, political, and cultural factors. Some countries, like the United States and Japan, have strong legal systems and strict Copyright laws that aim to protect intellectual property rights. In contrast, developing countries may have weaker legal systems and less strict enforcement measures, making digital infringement more prevalent.
