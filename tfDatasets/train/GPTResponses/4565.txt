Escort carriers were developed during World War II to provide air support to convoys of ships that were transporting troops, supplies, and materials across the ocean. They were smaller and less expensive than larger aircraft carriers, but still had the ability to deploy planes for reconnaissance, anti-submarine patrols, and air defense. Escort carriers played a significant role in the Battle of the Atlantic, helping to protect ships from German U-boat attacks and providing air cover during amphibious operations in the Pacific Theater.
