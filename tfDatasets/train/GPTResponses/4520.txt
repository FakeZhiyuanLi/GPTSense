One of the most important Old English religious poems is "Beowulf," an epic poem set in Scandinavia about a heroic warrior battling monsters and defending his people. The poem is steeped in religious and mythological imagery, with themes of Christian morality and pagan beliefs intertwined. Beowulf is often considered a cornerstone of English literature and the earliest epic poem in the English language.
