A court hierarchy is established by law. The specifics may vary depending on the jurisdiction, but generally speaking, the hierarchy is created by the constitution, statutes, or other laws that govern the court system. The hierarchy typically consists of different levels of courts with different jurisdictions and powers. The highest court in the hierarchy is typically the Supreme Court, which is the court of last resort for appeals from lower courts. The specific steps in the hierarchy, including the number of levels and the types of courts at each level, varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
