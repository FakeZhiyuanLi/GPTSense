There is no such instrument called "wata" in Eritrean traditional music. However, there are several instruments that are commonly used in Eritrean music, such as the krar, a six-stringed lyre the begena, a large harp-like instrument the kabaro, a wooden trumpet the ebbata, a hand-held drum and the masinko, a one-stringed bowed instrument.
