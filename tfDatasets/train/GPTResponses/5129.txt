Antarctica is located at the South Pole, which means it is situated at a high latitude and experiences long periods of darkness during the winter months. Additionally, due to the tilt of the Earth's axis, the angle at which the sun's rays hit Antarctica is much lower than at lower latitudes, resulting in less solar radiation. This combination of factors results in Antarctica receiving very little solar radiation.
