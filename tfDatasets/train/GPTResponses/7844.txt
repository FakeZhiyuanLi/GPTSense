Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is an example of a gastrointestinal problem. It is a chronic digestive disorder in which stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, causing symptoms like heartburn, indigestion, and difficulty swallowing. Other examples include irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and celiac disease.
