Sacha Baron Cohen was originally chosen to play Freddie Mercury in the movie "Bohemian Rhapsody" bearing his name. However, he later dropped out due to creative differences with the surviving members of Queen who were producing the film. Rami Malek was eventually cast in the role and went on to win an Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance.
