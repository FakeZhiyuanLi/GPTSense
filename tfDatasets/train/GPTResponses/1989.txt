Different sects came about within Shiism due to differences in beliefs and interpretations of Islamic theology and principles. These differences became apparent after the death of Prophet Muhammad and the disagreements over who should succeed him as the leader of the Muslim community. One group believed that the Prophet's son-in-law, Ali, should be the rightful successor, while others believed that the leadership should be determined through a consensus of the community.Over time, different theological and political views emerged within the Shi'a community, leading to the development of various sects, each with their own distinct beliefs and practices. Some of the major Shi'a sects include the Twelvers, Ismaili, and Zaidiyyah, each of which developed their own unique approach to religious interpretation and governance. These sects also have their own religious leaders, religious practices, and religious sites, which further distinguish them from each other.
