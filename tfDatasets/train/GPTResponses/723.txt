The Carnation Revolution was a nonviolent military coup that took place in Portugal on April 25, 1974. The coup was led by a group of Portuguese military officers who were dissatisfied with the authoritarian regime of Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar and his successor Marcelo Caetano. The revolution was unique because it was largely bloodless, and the military junta that took power immediately set about implementing democratic and social reforms. The coup was named after the red carnations that people placed in the muzzles of soldiers' guns to show their support for the revolution. The Carnation Revolution led to a pluralistic and democratic Portugal, and the country experienced significant changes in its political, social, and economic life.
