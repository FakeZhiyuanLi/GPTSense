The field of ideas that latched onto The Origin of Species when it became a widespread success was Darwinism, which is the theory that all species of organisms descend from a common ancestor and have diverged over time due to natural selection. This theory had a profound impact on fields such as biology, ecology, genetics, and anthropology, and challenged traditional beliefs about the origins of life and humanity. Darwinism also sparked controversy and debates, particularly regarding its implications for religion and ethics.
