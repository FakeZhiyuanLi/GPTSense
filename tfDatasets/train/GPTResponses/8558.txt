The term that describes the basic symmetries of the laws of mechanics is "Lorentz symmetry" or "Galilean symmetry," depending on the context. Lorentz symmetry refers to the invariance of the laws of physics under Lorentz transformations, whereas Galilean symmetry refers to the invariance of the laws of physics under Galilean transformations. Both of these symmetries are fundamental to the laws of mechanics.
