In a federalist government, the division of power among different levels of government is not necessarily equal. This is because federalism involves the sharing of power between a central government and regional governments or states. The central government may have more power over certain issues such as foreign policy, defense, and overall economic management, while the state governments may have more power over issues like education, health care, and transportation. The specific distribution of power varies depending on the constitution and laws of each federalist country.
