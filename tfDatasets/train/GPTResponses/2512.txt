Prior to the establishment of a centralized state, the Polish tribes were governed by various tribal leaders known as "knights" or "warriors" who were responsible for leading their communities and controlling their territories. These leaders maintained their power through alliances with neighboring tribes, military prowess, and loyalty of their subjects. The overarching governance structure was based on small, tightly-knit clans with a shared language and culture, which over time coalesced into larger, more homogeneous groupings. However, it was not until the late 10th century that the first Polish state emerged under the guidance of Mieszko I, who united the disparate tribes and created the foundations of modern-day Poland.
