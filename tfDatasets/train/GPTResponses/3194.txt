The most common source of new genes in eukaryotic lineages is gene duplication. Gene duplication is a process in which the entire DNA sequence of a gene is replicated, resulting in two copies of the same gene. These duplicated genes can then evolve independently, acquire new mutations, and eventually diverge in function, leading to the evolution of new genes. Gene duplication can occur through various mechanisms, including whole genome duplication events (polyploidization) or through smaller-scale duplication events within a chromosome. Other sources of new genes in eukaryotic lineages include horizontal gene transfer and de novo gene origination (the emergence of completely new genes from non-coding DNA sequences).
