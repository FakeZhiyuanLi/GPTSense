In the mid-1960s, Martin Luther King Jr. began criticizing the Vietnam War and the American government's foreign policy. He believed that money spent on the war effort was taking away resources that could be used to address poverty and inequality at home. He also criticized the government for not doing enough to protect and support black Americans in the face of continued discrimination and violence.
