granting permissions and restricting access to resources based on user roles and privileges. Both models are designed to ensure that only authorized individuals have access to certain resources and information, and they use different mechanisms to achieve this goal. ACLs allow administrators to define permissions for individual users or groups and grant or revoke access to specific resources based on those permissions, while capability-based security operates on the principle of giving users specific capabilities or tokens that allow them to access certain resources or perform specific actions. Both models are important in maintaining the security of systems and protecting sensitive information.
