Europeans attempted to sign treaties with indigenous peoples during colonization in order to legitimize their sovereignty. However, these treaties were often one-sided and did not fully acknowledge or respect the rights and autonomy of indigenous peoples. Many treaties were also violated by Europeans as they continued to expand their settlements and assert their dominance.
