The largest extinction of species in Earth's history is known as the Permian-Triassic extinction event or the Great Dying. It occurred around 252 million years ago and is estimated to have wiped out 90% of all marine species and 70% of all terrestrial species. The cause of the extinction event is still debated, but it is believed to have been caused by a combination of volcanic activity, global warming, and ocean acidification.
