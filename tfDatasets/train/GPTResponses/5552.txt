There is no clear answer to this question as rulers and civilizations across the world have developed their own concepts of divinity throughout human history. However, some ancient civilizations such as the Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, and Mesopotamians believed in multiple gods and goddesses that controlled different aspects of life. In the case of monotheistic religions such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, their concept of divinity was brought forth through prophets and religious figures. Thus, the concept of divinity has been developed and explored by various cultures and civilizations throughout history.
