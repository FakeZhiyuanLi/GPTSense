Pure copper has been replaced with other metal alloys, such as copper-nickel alloys, aluminum-bronze alloys, and stainless steel, in the building of ships. These alloys have superior properties such as corrosion resistance, durability, and strength, making them more suitable for marine environments. Additionally, the use of antifouling coatings has also reduced the need for pure copper in shipbuilding.
