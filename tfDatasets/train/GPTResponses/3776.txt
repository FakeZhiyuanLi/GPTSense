Older computer systems and typewriters used carriage return (CR) alone as a line terminator. This means that when a user typed a sentence, pressing the "Enter" button would only move the cursor to the beginning of the next line without also moving it to the leftmost position. The CR command would then move the cursor back to the leftmost position so that typing could continue from the beginning of the line. This method was later replaced by the combination of both carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF) commands as a line terminator.
