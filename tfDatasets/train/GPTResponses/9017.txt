Federalism is a political system in which power is divided between a central government and various constituent political units, such as states or provinces. In a federal system, the central government shares power with the constituent units and each level of government has its own set of responsibilities and powers. This system allows for both a strong central government and local autonomy, as well as a balance of power between the two levels of government. The United States, Canada, and Australia are all examples of federal countries.
