The first postal service in Umayyad lands was established by the second Umayyad Caliph, Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz, in the 8th century CE. He introduced a postal system to facilitate communication and the movement of goods across the vast Umayyad Empire, which spanned from Spain to India. The system was initially run by the state, with government officials responsible for delivering messages and correspondence between different parts of the empire. Over time, private carriers and merchant networks emerged, contributing to the growth and sophistication of the postal system.
