One cathedral in which simple cylindrical columns stand out more than the gothic features is the Basilica di San Lorenzo in Florence, Italy. The basilica is an early Renaissance church designed by Filippo Brunelleschi, who emphasized the simplicity and purity of classical forms. The columns in San Lorenzo are made of grey stone and have clean, unadorned surfaces that contrast with the ornate ribbed vaults and pointed arches of the gothic architecture. The columns create a sense of order and balance in the spacious interior, and they highlight the geometric proportions and symmetry of the building.
