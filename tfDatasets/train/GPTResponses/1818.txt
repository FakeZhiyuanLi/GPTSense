The 1967 referendum also included a second question related to the representation of Aboriginal people in the Australian Constitution. This second question asked voters if they agreed to allow the federal government to make laws specifically for Aboriginal people and to include them in the national census. The referendum passed with an overwhelming majority, with over 90% of voters in favor of the changes. This was a significant moment for Aboriginal rights in Australia and helped pave the way for further progress in the following decades.
