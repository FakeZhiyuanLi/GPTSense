A solar chimney, also known as a thermal chimney, is a passive solar ventilation system that uses natural convection created by the sun's energy to generate airflow through a building or structure. It typically consists of a vertical shaft or chimney, which is usually made of a dark material that absorbs solar radiation and heats the air inside. This heated air rises and creates a suction effect that pulls cooler air into the building through openings at the base of the chimney. The resulting airflow can be used to ventilate or cool a building, and can help to improve indoor air quality and reduce the energy consumption required for cooling or air conditioning.
