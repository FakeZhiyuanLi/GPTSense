Yes, children and adolescents do define themselves based on their values, thoughts, and opinions. As they grow and develop, they form their own sense of identity and self-esteem, which can be influenced by their beliefs and the values they have been exposed to. They may initially adopt the values and opinions of their parents or peers, but as they gain more life experience and exposure to different perspectives, they may modify or adopt new beliefs that better align with their personal values and worldview.
