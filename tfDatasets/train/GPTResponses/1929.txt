Birds migrate south in the winter to escape the harsh winter conditions and lack of food that occur in their breeding ranges. The warmer climate and availability of food in the south provide better conditions for survival and future reproduction. Additionally, some bird species migrate to take advantage of specific feeding or nesting opportunities that are only available in the winter months in their wintering ranges.
