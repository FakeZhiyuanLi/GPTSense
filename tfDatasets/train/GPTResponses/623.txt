The amount of usable solar energy differs from the amount near the planet's surface due to various factors such as atmospheric conditions, latitude, time of day, and season.The Earth's atmosphere absorbs and scatters some of the incoming solar radiation, reducing the amount of energy that reaches the Earth's surface. Therefore, the further away from the equator a location is, the more atmosphere the solar rays must pass through, resulting in less solar radiation reaching the surface.Additionally, the angle of the sun's rays changes throughout the day and seasons, affecting the amount of solar radiation that hits the surface. During sunrise and sunset, the sun's rays have to pass through more of the atmosphere, reducing the amount of energy that reaches the surface. In contrast, during midday when the sun is directly overhead, the energy that hits the surface is more concentrated.Overall, the amount of usable solar energy that reaches the Earth's surface is affected by a combination of factors, making it different from the amount of energy available near the planet's surface.
