The identity status paradigm that emerged due to the work of James Marcia is known as the Marcia's identity status model. This model proposes four different identity statuses that individuals may go through during their development:1. Identity diffusion: This is the period when individuals have not yet made a commitment to any particular role or identity. They may be exploring different possibilities but have not yet made any decisions.2. Identity foreclosure: This is when individuals have made a commitment to a particular identity or role without exploring other possibilities. They may have adopted the identity or role that their parents or society expects of them.3. Identity moratorium: This is when individuals are actively exploring different possibilities and have not yet made a commitment to any particular identity or role. This is a period of experimentation and discovery.4. Identity achievement: This is when individuals have explored different possibilities and have made a commitment to a particular identity or role. This is a period of stability and self-confidence.The Marcia's identity status model is commonly used in research on adolescent development and has been influential in helping individuals understand the process of identity formation.
