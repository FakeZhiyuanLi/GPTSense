There is no specific act that sets the term for judging the boundaries of sanity for individuals wishing to sit on the SP (Supreme Court). However, the Constitution and various judicial opinions provide guidance on the qualifications for SP justices, including the requirement of "good behavior" and the expectation that they have the necessary mental and moral capacity to serve on the Court.
