Horizontal gene transfer is rare in eukaryotic organisms, as their DNA is compartmentalized within the nucleus and there are significant barriers for foreign DNA to enter and integrate into the genome. However, some examples of horizontal gene transfer have been reported in eukaryotes, such as in plants and fungi. Horizontal gene transfer is more prevalent in prokaryotes such as bacteria, where it occurs through mechanisms such as conjugation, transformation, and transduction.
