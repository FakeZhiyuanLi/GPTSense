It is believed that the Liangzhu culture, which existed in the lower Yangtze region of China, including present-day Zhejiang province, was inhabited by the early ancestors of the modern-day Han Chinese. The Liangzhu culture is considered to have emerged around 3300-2300 BC, during the Neolithic Age in China. The people of this culture were known for their sophisticated pottery, jade carvings, and urban planning. They are also believed to have practiced ancestor worship and had a complex social hierarchy.
