The book that is often touted for establishing regulations for church and government is the Bible. Various parts of the Bible provide guidance and instructions for both religious and political leaders, which continue to influence and shape laws and regulations in many countries today. Additionally, some religious texts, such as the Quran and the Torah, also provide guidance on governance and legal systems.
