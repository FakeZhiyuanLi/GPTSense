Current research attempts to explain the neurological and physiological basis of emotion, including the brain regions and neural pathways involved in processing emotions, the role of hormones and neurotransmitters in regulating emotions, and the ways in which emotions influence or are influenced by bodily processes such as heart rate, breathing, and immune function. Researchers also aim to explore how cultural and social factors shape emotions, and how emotions can be regulated or controlled through various psychological and behavioral interventions.
