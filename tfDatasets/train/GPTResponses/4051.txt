The principal sense of night-active mammals is usually their sense of hearing and smell, as their vision is often limited in the dark. They rely on these senses to locate prey, avoid predators, and navigate their environment in the darkness. Additionally, some species of night-active mammals, such as bats, have the ability to use echolocation to navigate and locate insects in the dark.
