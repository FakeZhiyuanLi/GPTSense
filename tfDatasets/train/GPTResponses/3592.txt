The Green Revolution of the mid-20th century popularized the use of conventional hybridization to increase yield. The Green Revolution was a period of time when new farming techniques and crop varieties were developed to increase agricultural productivity and reduce hunger around the world. Conventional hybridization was one of the techniques developed during this time that allowed for the creation of high-yielding crop varieties that could resist pests and disease. This practice involved cross-breeding different strains of plants to create hybrids that had desirable traits such as increased yield, disease resistance, and faster growth. The resulting crops were more productive and able to meet the growing demand for food around the world.
