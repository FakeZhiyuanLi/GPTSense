The ancient Greeks had already developed various theories of evolution or natural selection, including Anaximander, Empedocles, and Aristotle, who believed that species were not fixed but could change over time. Additionally, in the 18th and 19th centuries, various European scientists had already begun to explore the concept of evolution, including Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in France, and Erasmus Darwin and Robert Chambers in England.
