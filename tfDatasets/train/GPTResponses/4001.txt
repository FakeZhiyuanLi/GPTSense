analyzed in terms of its fundamental frequency and its harmonics, or multiples of the fundamental frequency. The fundamental frequency is the lowest frequency present in a complex tone and determines its perceived pitch. The harmonics, which are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency, contribute to the timbre, or quality, of the tone. The overall pitch of a complex tone is influenced by both the fundamental frequency and the relative strengths and frequencies of its harmonics.
