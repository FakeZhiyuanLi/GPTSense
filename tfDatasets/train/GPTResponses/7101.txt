Chloroplasts are believed to be descendants of ancient cyanobacteria, which were the first organisms on Earth to undergo photosynthesis and produce oxygen. Through a process called endosymbiosis, cyanobacteria were assimilated into the cells of early eukaryotic organisms and evolved into the chloroplasts we see today in plants and algae.
