Birds from high northern latitudes like the Arctic tundra usually migrate southward to warmer areas during the winter months. Some may migrate to neighboring areas with milder climates such as the northern United States, Europe, or Asia, while others may travel as far south as Central and South America, Africa, Australia, or New Zealand. The exact migration destinations vary depending on the species of the bird and their preferred habitat and food sources.
