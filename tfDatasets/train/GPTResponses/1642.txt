A quasi-independent agency is a government agency that has some degree of independence from the executive branch but is still ultimately accountable to Congress and the president. Examples include the Federal Reserve System, Federal Communications Commission (FCC), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
