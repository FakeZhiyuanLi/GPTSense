European art music is typically distinguished from many other musical forms by its emphasis on traditional Western tonalities and structures, its use of classical instrumentation such as the orchestra, and its focus on complex compositional techniques such as counterpoint and harmony. Additionally, European art music often emphasizes formal structures such as sonata form, and an interest in musical development and evolution over time. European art music also often places a strong emphasis on written notation and can be highly structured and formalized in its presentation.
