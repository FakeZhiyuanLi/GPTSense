Some loanwords in Czech language come from German, especially in the fields of science, technology, and industry. Words such as autobus, kapitán, or dálnice (bus, captain, highway) have been borrowed from German. There are also many loanwords from French, particularly in the fields of art, culture, and everyday life, such as restaurace, hotel, or parfém (restaurant, hotel, perfume). Another important source of loanwords is English, especially in recent years, particularly in the areas of business, computer technology, and popular culture. Examples of English loanwords in Czech include supermarkety, smartphone, or hashtag. Finally, there are also loanwords from Slavic languages, particularly Russian, which are used in specialized fields such as politics or academics, such as komunismus or sputnik.
