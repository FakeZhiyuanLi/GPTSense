Many historians and scholars have stated that the Greco-Bactrians had connections through the Silk Road. The Silk Road was an extensive network of trade routes that connected China, Central Asia, and the Mediterranean world. The exchange of goods, ideas, and technologies between these regions allowed for a significant cultural exchange between the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom and the rest of the world. Some notable scholars who have written about the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom and its connections to the Silk Road include David Christian, Romila Thapar, and Valerie Hansen.
