"P-roads" refer to primary roads in Eritrea that are part of the national highway network and connect major towns and cities. These are generally well-maintained, tarred roads that are designed to handle heavy traffic volumes and long-distance travel. Some examples of major P-roads in Eritrea include the Asmara-Massawa highway, the Asmara-Addis Ababa highway, and the Barentu-Keren road. These roads are crucial for the country's economic development and provide vital links to neighboring countries such as Ethiopia and Sudan.
