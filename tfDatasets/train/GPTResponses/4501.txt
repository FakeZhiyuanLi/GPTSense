The language that had the greatest influence on English is Old French. After the Norman Conquest in 1066, French became the language of the English court and government for almost 300 years, leading to the adoption of many French words, phrases, and grammar into the English language. This period is also known as the Norman Conquest and it had a lasting impact on the development of English.
