During the boom of the 1970s and 1980s, there was a significant increase in the construction of high-rise apartment buildings. These buildings were typically built with concrete and steel structures, and featured amenities such as balconies, swimming pools, and fitness centers. Many also included retail or commercial space on their ground floors, such as grocery stores, restaurants or banks. The apartments themselves were often spacious and designed to appeal to a range of tenants, from young professionals to families, with larger units featuring multiple bedrooms and bathrooms. Other popular types of apartments during this period included garden-style apartments, which featured lower density and lower-rise buildings, often situated in suburban areas. These apartments were characterized by their landscaped gardens, playgrounds and communal spaces.
