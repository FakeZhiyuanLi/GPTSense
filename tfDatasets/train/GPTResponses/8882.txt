Louis Agassiz was a staunch advocate of the idea of special creation and therefore, he rejected Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by means of natural selection as presented in his book "On the Origin of Species." Agassiz believed in the immutability of species and argued that each type of organism was created individually by God and could not have evolved from a common ancestor. He felt that the complexity and diversity of life were evidence of design and the work of a creator, rather than the result of natural processes.
