Studying politics has roots that go back to ancient Greece, where philosophers such as Aristotle and Plato explored the nature of political institutions, structures, and power. The study of politics continued through the medieval period, with thinkers such as St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas grappling with questions of governance and justice.In the modern era, the study of politics became more institutionalized, leading to the emergence of political science as a distinct academic discipline. This discipline grew in prominence during the 19th and 20th centuries, particularly with the rise of modern democratic states and the expansion of the state's role in society.Today, the study of politics encompasses a broad range of topics and approaches, including political theory, international relations, comparative politics, public policy, and more.
