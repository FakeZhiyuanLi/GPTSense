The earliest colloquial stratum can be traced back to the vernacular languages that emerged in various regions during the early Middle Ages. For example, Old English, Old High German, Old Norse, and Old French were all vernacular languages that developed alongside Latin during this time. These early colloquialisms were often influenced by regional dialects and were not standardized, making communication between speakers of different dialects challenging. However, these colloquialisms laid the foundation for the development of modern European languages, and many of their elements can still be found in contemporary speech.
