The world responded with condemnation and concern for the human rights violations committed by the Burmese military during the revolution of 2007. Government officials and human rights organizations around the world called for an end to the violence and for Myanmar's military leaders to respect the rights of their citizens. The United Nations Security Council issued a statement expressing deep concern over the situation and calling for an immediate end to the violence. Several Western governments imposed economic sanctions on Myanmar in response to the violence, and international news outlets covered the crisis extensively. Despite these efforts, the violence continued, and it took several years before the situation in Myanmar began to improve.
