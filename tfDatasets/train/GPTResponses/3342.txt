The common definition of dialect refers to a variation of a language that is specific to a particular region or social group and differs from standard or official language in terms of pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. It is often characterized by unique vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation patterns that distinguish it from the standard language. Dialects can help to form identities and cultural affiliations and can vary significantly even within a single language community.
