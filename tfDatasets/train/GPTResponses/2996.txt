The directional selection of beneficial mutations leads to a gradual change in the genetic makeup of a population over time, favoring the increased frequency and spread of the beneficial trait. This can lead to the evolution of new species or the adaptation of existing species to changing environmental conditions. Additionally, in some cases, the directional selection of beneficial mutations can lead to the fixation of the beneficial trait, where it becomes the norm for the entire population.
