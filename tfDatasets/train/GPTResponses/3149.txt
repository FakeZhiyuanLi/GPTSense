Some insect larvae leave evidence in a tree forever, such as:1. Gall formations - some insect larvae induce the formation of galls on the leaves or twigs of the tree, which remain on the tree even after the larvae have completed their life cycle.2. Tunnels or galleries - some insect larvae tunnel under the bark or into the wood of the tree, leaving behind distinctive patterns or galleries that can be seen for years.3. Frass - insect larvae produce waste or excrement that can accumulate around their feeding sites, forming distinctive piles or patterns that can remain on the tree for a long time.4. Damage to leaves or bark - some insect larvae feed on the leaves or bark of the tree, leaving behind scars or marks that can be visible for years.5. Webbing or silk - some insect larvae spin webs or silk that can remain attached to the tree, often appearing as thick strands or mats that can persist for a long time.
