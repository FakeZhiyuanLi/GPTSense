The two factors focused on when explaining an individual's actions within a group are:1. Group influence: This refers to how much the individual is influenced by the group's norms, values, and behaviors. The individual may conform to group norms to fit in, be liked, or avoid rejection.2. Personal attributes: This refers to the individual's personality, attitudes, beliefs, and goals that may explain why they behave differently from others in the group. These personal attributes could make the individual more or less susceptible to group influence.
