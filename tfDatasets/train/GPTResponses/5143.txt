Several animals were greatly hunted during the 18th and 19th centuries, but one prominent example is the American bison, also known as buffalo. Bison were hunted to near extinction by European settlers for their meat, hide, and bones. It is estimated that there were around 60 million bison in North America before the arrival of Europeans, but this number dwindled to less than 1000 by the late 1800s. Other animals that were heavily hunted during this time period include beavers, otters, wolves, and various species of whales.
