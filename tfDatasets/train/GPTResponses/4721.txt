The Homestead Act of 1862 mainly opened the Great Plains for settlement. This act offered 160 acres of land to anyone willing to live on and cultivate the land for at least five years. Many people took advantage of this opportunity and moved westward to start a new life. The expansion of the railroads in the late 1800s also facilitated the settlement of the Great Plains.
