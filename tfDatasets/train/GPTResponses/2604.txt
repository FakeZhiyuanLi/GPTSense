There are several ancient architectures that were influenced by Egypt:1. Minoan Architecture: The Minoan civilization on the island of Crete (c. 2700-1420 BCE) showed evidence of Egyptian influence in their use of columns with bulbous bases and capitals resembling palm leaves.2. Mycenaean Architecture: The Mycenaean civilization (c. 1600-1100 BCE) in Greece had tomb structures with flat roofs and corbelled arches which were similar to those found in Egyptian tombs.3. Persian Architecture: The Persian empire (c. 550-330 BCE) had a monumental architecture inspired by ancient Egypt. Persian palaces and temples used symmetrical plans, long columns with lotus-shaped capitals, and decorated reliefs.4. Hittite Architecture: The Hittite civilization (c. 1600-1200 BCE) in Anatolia (modern-day Turkey) borrowed features from the Egyptian temples such as hypostyle halls with columns and massive stone gateways.5. Greek Architecture: Ancient Greek architecture (c. 850 BCE-AD 476) was influenced by Egyptian architecture in the use of columns with capitals and friezes with animal or human figures. The Greek-style Ptolemaic temples in Egypt also incorporated features from both Greek and Egyptian architecture.6. Roman Architecture: The Roman empire (c. 27 BCE-AD 476) inherited the architectural traditions of Greece and Egypt, which it blended into a unique style of Roman architecture. Roman temples and public buildings had elements like columns, pediments, and friezes borrowed from the ancient Egyptians.
