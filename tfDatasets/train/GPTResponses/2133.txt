Historians argue that human rights were suppressed under the rule of Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito. Despite his efforts to promote social equality, political freedom was limited and dissent was punished. Tito's regime was often accused of censorship, suppression of free speech, and human rights abuses against political opponents, ethnic minorities, and religious groups.
