The nervous system was examined to develop the neurobiological explanation of human emotion. Specifically, the structures and functions of the brain, such as the amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and limbic system, were studied in relation to emotional processing and regulation. Hormones, neurotransmitters, and other biological factors were also considered in understanding the underlying mechanisms of emotion.
