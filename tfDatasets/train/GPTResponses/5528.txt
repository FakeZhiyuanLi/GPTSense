There is no specific theism that advocates for putting oneself on the level of gods. In fact, most theistic religions emphasize the importance of humbling oneself before a higher power or deity. This concept is seen in Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and many other faiths. The idea of worshiping and serving a higher power is a fundamental aspect of theism, and it is generally not compatible with the practice of elevating oneself to the level of a god.
