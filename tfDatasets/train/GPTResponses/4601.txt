The current standards for the classification of race and ethnicity in federal data in the United States were developed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in 1997. The OMB is a government agency responsible for overseeing federal agencies' policies and practices, including data collection and classification. The guidelines establish five racial categories: American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and White. The standards also include a separate ethnicity category for Hispanic or Latino.
