In July 2004, the Federal Reserve began to gradually increase the federal funds rate, which is the rate at which banks lend money to each other overnight. This increase in the federal funds rate caused other interest rates to rise, including adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs). ARMs are tied to a benchmark interest rate, such as the prime rate or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), and as these benchmark rates rose, so did ARM rates. This made ARMs more expensive for homeowners, who may have initially been attracted to the lower introductory rate of an ARM.
