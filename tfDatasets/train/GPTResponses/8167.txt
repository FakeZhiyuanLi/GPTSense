The symmetry groups utilized in the standard model particle physics are:1) SU(3) color symmetry: This symmetry group describes the strong force that binds quarks together to form protons, neutrons, and other mesons and baryons.2) SU(2) weak isospin symmetry: This symmetry group describes the weak force that mediates nuclear decay processes, such as beta decay.3) U(1) hypercharge symmetry: This symmetry group describes the electromagnetic force that interacts with electrically charged particles.Together, these three symmetry groups form the gauge group of the standard model, which governs the behavior of elementary particles and their interactions.
