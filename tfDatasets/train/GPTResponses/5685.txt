As the monarchy under Queen Victoria shifted from political to symbolic, the most important aspect was the maintenance and enhancement of the monarch's public image and reputation. The monarchy had to adapt to the changing times and focus on connecting with the people and building a sense of national identity. This involved the creation of ceremonial duties, such as opening Parliament, attending state occasions, and patronizing charities, as well as maintaining a dignified and respectful public presence. Additionally, the role of the monarchy became more focused on promoting national unity and stability, rather than influencing political decisions. Therefore, the importance of the monarch's symbolic presence and representation of the nation became essential in maintaining a positive relationship between the monarch and the people.
