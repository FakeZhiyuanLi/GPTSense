The Oxford calculators were a group of mathematicians who worked at the University of Oxford in the 14th century. They developed a method of calculation that relied on a series of mnemonic devices, known as the "calculators' method," which enabled them to perform complex calculations without the use of paper and pencil. The method was designed to measure and calculate things such as trigonometric functions, algebraic equations, and geometric shapes.
