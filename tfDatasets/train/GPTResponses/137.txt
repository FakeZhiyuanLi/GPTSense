Europe slowly began to warm up from the last ice age around 18,000 years ago. However, the process of deglaciation and warming was gradual and spanned over several thousand years. The last glacial maximum occurred around 26,000 years ago, and the ice sheets began to retreat around 18,000 years ago. By 11,000 years ago, the glaciers had melted, and the Earth reached the interglacial period, known as the Holocene.
