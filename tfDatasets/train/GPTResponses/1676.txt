Mauretania was an ancient kingdom located in North Africa, roughly corresponding to modern-day Morocco and Western Sahara. The kingdom was inhabited by Berber peoples, who established a powerful, centralized state with a strong military and a rich culture. The name "Mauretania" is thought to derive from the ancient Greek term for "dark-skinned," referring to the Berbers' typically swarthy complexion.The history of Mauretania is complex and varied, with the kingdom experiencing periods of strength and expansion as well as decline and fragmentation. Among the notable rulers of Mauretania were King Bocchus I, who allied with Rome against Jugurtha of Numidia Juba II, who reformed the kingdom's administration and wrote extensive histories of North Africa and Queen Cleopatra Selene II, who was married to Juba II and became a powerful figure in her own right.
