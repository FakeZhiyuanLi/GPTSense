The ancient Greek physician Galen is often attributed with theorizing that blood travels through the veins. Galen believed that the liver was the source of blood production and that it was distributed to the body through arteries and veins. However, it is important to note that Galen's understanding of the circulatory system was based on a model of bodily fluids that was later proven to be inaccurate by the work of William Harvey and others during the Scientific Revolution.
