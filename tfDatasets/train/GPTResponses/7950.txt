"Exhibition match" and "friendly match" are not synonymous in sports where there is a difference in the purpose of the game.An exhibition match is a game played for entertainment purposes, often featuring retired or guest players. The game does not count towards the team's standings, and there is no pressure to win or perform well. Exhibition matches are often used as promotional events for the sport or to raise money for charity.On the other hand, a friendly match is a game played between teams as a warm-up or practice game, usually in preparation for a major tournament or competition. Although the game does not count towards the team's standings, there is an expectation to perform well and treat it as a competitive game. The result of a friendly match can be used to measure the team's strength, tactics, and readiness for the upcoming competition.
