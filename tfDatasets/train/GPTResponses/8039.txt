Muslim mathematicians contributed several significant innovations to Arabic numerals. These include:1. The introduction of the decimal point system which allowed for efficient and accurate arithmetic computations.2. The use of zero as a placeholder, which was crucial for positional notation and greatly improved the ability to perform complex calculations.3. The development of algebraic concepts and equations, allowing for the solving of complex problems that previously were not possible using traditional arithmetic methods.4. The refinement of trigonometric functions, which were utilized extensively in astronomy and navigation.Overall, Muslim mathematicians played a pivotal role in the development and dissemination of Arabic numerals, which ultimately revolutionized mathematics and science worldwide.
