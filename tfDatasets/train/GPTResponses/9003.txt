This belief is commonly associated with the theological doctrine of "limited atonement," which is a key tenet of Calvinism. Calvinists hold that the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross was only intended to pay the penalty for the sins of the elect (i.e., those whom God has chosen for salvation), and not for the sins of all humanity. This view is based on the idea that God's sovereignty and predestination are central to Christian salvation, and that those who are not included in God's elect are not able to be saved through Christ's atonement. However, not all Christians hold to this view of limited atonement, and there is ongoing debate and disagreement within the church about the extent and nature of Christ's saving work.
