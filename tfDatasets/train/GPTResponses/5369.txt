Charlemagne's expansion of the Frankish Empire in the 8th and 9th centuries created opportunities for Jewish merchants to settle in various regions, including the Rhineland, Bavaria, and Lombardy. These areas were important trade centers and Jewish merchants played a significant role in facilitating commerce and cultural exchange. Charlemagne also issued protective edicts, called capitularies, which granted Jews legal protections and allowed them to participate in various economic and social activities. However, these protections were not always consistently enforced and Jewish communities were still subject to periodic persecution and discrimination.
