Deviations in the epics are thought to be the influence of various factors such as regional customs and traditions, political conditions, and individual authorship. For example, the Ramayana has several versions that differ in certain aspects based on regional variations. Similarly, the Mahabharata underwent several additions and modifications by different authors and scribes as it was passed down through generations. Some deviations may also occur due to the influence of external cultures or religions. However, despite these variations, the fundamental themes and teachings of the epics remain unchanged and highly revered by devotees.
