Nigeria gained independence from the UK on October 1, 1960, becoming a sovereign nation with its own government and constitution. However, the country faced enormous challenges in building a stable democracy and managing various ethnic, linguistic, and regional divisions. Nigeria's first post-independence government was led by Prime Minister Tafawa Balewa, but his government was overthrown by a military coup in 1966, leading to a series of military regimes that lasted until the country's return to civilian rule in 1999. Despite its struggles, Nigeria has emerged as Africa's largest economy and a major player on the global stage.
