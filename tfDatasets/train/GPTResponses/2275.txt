Hiking or walking on mountainous trails or slopes can be treacherous even in summer due to their steep inclinations. These trails may not be properly marked, and the terrain can be challenging to navigate, leading to falls and injuries. Additionally, rocky surfaces and loose gravel can make footing unpredictable and dangerous, even for experienced hikers. Therefore, it is essential to be well-prepared, wear proper hiking boots and equipment, and always stay alert while traversing mountainous terrain.
