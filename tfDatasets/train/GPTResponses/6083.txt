The meat of geese is considered fatty because geese naturally store large amounts of fat in their bodies to survive through long migrations and periods of low food availability. This fat is distributed throughout the bird's muscles and tissues, leading to meat that is significantly higher in fat content than other poultry such as chicken or turkey. In addition, geese raised for foie gras production are force-fed a high-fat diet to increase liver size, which also results in fatty meat.
