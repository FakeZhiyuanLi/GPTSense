The technologies used to capture solar energy can be characterized as follows:1. Solar photovoltaic (PV) cells: These cells use the photoelectric effect to convert sunlight directly into electrical energy. They are commonly used in solar panels and can be used to power homes, businesses, and even vehicles.2. Solar thermal systems: These systems use the sun's energy to heat a fluid, such as water or air, which is then used to generate electricity or provide heating and cooling for buildings.3. Concentrated solar power (CSP) systems: These systems use mirrors or lenses to concentrate sunlight onto a small area, which is then used to heat a fluid and generate electricity.4. Thin-film solar cells: These cells are made using a thin layer of a semiconductor material, which is overlaid onto a substrate. They are lightweight, flexible, and can be integrated into a wide range of applications.5. Solar-powered water heaters: These systems use the sun's energy to heat water, which can then be used for domestic hot water or space heating applications.6. Solar-powered fans and ventilation systems: These systems use the sun's energy to power fans and ventilation systems that can be used to cool buildings or circulate air.
