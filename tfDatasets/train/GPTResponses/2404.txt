New Delhi is not located on any geographical feature that is responsible for frequent earthquakes. The city is situated on the Indo-Gangetic plain, which is a relatively stable region. However, India is located on a tectonic plate boundary, making the country prone to earthquakes. The Indian plate subducts under the Eurasian plate, causing frequent seismic activity throughout the region. However, New Delhi is not considered a high-risk seismic zone, and earthquakes are not a common occurrence in the city.
