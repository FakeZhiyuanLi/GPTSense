Oliver Cromwell did not begin burying national figures in the Abbey. In fact, he opposed the idea of using the Abbey for burials and no one was buried there during the Commonwealth period when he was in power. It wasn't until the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 that the practice of burying national figures in the Abbey was resumed. The first person to be buried in Westminster Abbey after the restoration was Admiral Robert Blake.
