The Ottoman slave trade flourished in the Ottoman Empire, which was mainly located in the Middle East, North Africa, and Southeast Europe, from the 14th to the early 20th century. Slaves were mainly acquired through military campaigns, piracy, and trading with African and European merchants. The Ottomans also established slave markets, called "bazaars," in major cities such as Istanbul and Cairo, where slaves were bought and sold.
