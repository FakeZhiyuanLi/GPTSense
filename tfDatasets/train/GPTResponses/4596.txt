None of the US presidents have explicitly stated that they wanted to treat Hispanic people as white by the federal government. However, there have been policies and practices throughout history that have marginalized Hispanic communities and denied them access to resources and opportunities. These include discriminatory immigration policies, such as the Bracero Program and Operation Wetback, and discriminatory housing and education policies. It is important to acknowledge and address these injustices in order to achieve equity and justice for all communities.
