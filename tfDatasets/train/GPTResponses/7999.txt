USB 2.0 High-Speed Inter-Chip (HSIC) is a type of interface standard that allows high-speed digital communication between integrated circuits (ICs) within a computer system. It is commonly used in mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, to connect the system-on-a-chip (SoC) to the USB controller. HSIC provides faster transfer rates and lower power consumption compared to traditional USB 2.0 connections.
