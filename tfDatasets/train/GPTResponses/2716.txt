Generally, contracts include specific provisions that define what constitutes a material breach and the consequences of such a breach. These provisions may include a determination process or a dispute resolution mechanism to assess the seriousness of the breach. Parties can also rely on legal precedent or industry standards to determine the severity of a breach. It is important for parties to follow the defined process or seek legal advice before taking any action, such as suspending or terminating obligations, to avoid premature or unjustified actions.
