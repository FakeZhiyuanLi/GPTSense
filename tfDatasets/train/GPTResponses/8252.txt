Lyell did not ask Darwin to publish his theory in order to give it priority. In fact, Darwin had been working on his theory of evolution by natural selection for over twenty years before he received a letter from Alfred Russel Wallace in 1858, which presented a very similar idea. It was Wallace's letter that prompted Darwin to finally publish his theory in 1859 in his book "On the Origin of Species". However, Lyell did play a role in encouraging Darwin to publish his theory and providing critical feedback on his ideas.
