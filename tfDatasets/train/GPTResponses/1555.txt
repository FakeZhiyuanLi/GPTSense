There are several things that needed to be separated from the terrain of the Ottoman Empire, including:1. National identity: The Ottoman Empire was a multi-ethnic and multi-religious state, encompassing a wide variety of cultures and identities. As nationalism grew in the 19th century, many people began to identify more with their ethnic or religious background than with the Ottoman state. This led to demands for greater autonomy and independence for various regions and communities within the empire.2. Military control: The Ottoman Empire had a large and powerful military, but in the late 19th and early 20th centuries it struggled to maintain control over its far-flung territories. Separatist movements, rebellions, and foreign invasions all tested the Ottoman army's ability to maintain order and defend the empire's borders.3. Economic interests: The Ottoman Empire was an important center of trade and commerce, but its economy was based largely on agriculture and traditional crafts. As industrialization swept across Europe and other parts of the world, the Ottoman Empire struggled to keep pace. Foreign powers and local elites often controlled key industries and resources, leading to economic inequality and instability.4. Political power: The Ottoman Empire was ruled by a central government based in Istanbul, but power was also decentralized to some extent. Local leaders, tribal chiefs, and religious authorities all had significant influence over their respective regions. As the empire began to decline and lose control over its territories, various groups vied for political power and influence.
