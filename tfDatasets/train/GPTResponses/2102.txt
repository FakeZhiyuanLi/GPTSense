There are numerous scientists, researchers, and organizations that study the impact of climate change and water use. Here are a few examples:1. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC): The IPCC is the leading international body for assessing the science related to climate change. It provides regular assessments of the state of knowledge on climate change, including the impact of climate change on water resources.2. World Meteorological Organization (WMO): The WMO is an intergovernmental organization that focuses on the scientific and technical aspects of weather, climate, and water. It works to improve our understanding of the impact of climate change on water resources and to develop solutions to mitigate the impacts.3. United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP): The UNEP is the leading global environmental authority that sets the global environmental agenda, promotes sustainable development, and supports the implementation of environmentally sound policies. It works on issues related to water scarcity, water pollution, and the impact of climate change on water resources.4. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA): NASA is a United States agency responsible for the civilian space program and for aeronautics and aerospace research. It has conducted numerous studies on the impact of climate change on water availability and quality, using satellite data to monitor changes in global water resources.5. Universities: Many universities around the world have departments and research centers dedicated to studying the impact of climate change on water resources. Examples include the University of California, Santa Barbara's Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, the Water Institute at the University of Waterloo, and the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions at Columbia University.
