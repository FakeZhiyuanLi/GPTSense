The Gospel of John is not always said at the end of Catholic Mass. However, when it is, it is usually the reading of the last chapter of John's Gospel (chapter 21), which recounts the appearance of the risen Christ to his disciples on the shores of the Sea of Galilee. This is often read as a reminder of Christ's victory over death and as a call to discipleship. Additionally, John's Gospel is filled with rich theological themes and profound insights into Christ's identity and mission, and it is often taught and meditated upon as part of the Church's ongoing catechesis and spiritual formation.
