Handshake packets are generally sent during the connection setup phase of a network communication, such as when establishing a TCP connection. The exact timing of handshake packets can vary depending on the protocol being used and the specific implementation of that protocol. In some cases, handshake packets may be sent only at the beginning of a communication session, while in other cases they may be sent periodically or whenever certain conditions are met.
