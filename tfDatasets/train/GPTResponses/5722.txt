The first example of a Hellenistic period royal palace is believed to be the Pergamon Palace in Pergamon (modern-day Turkey), built by King Eumenes II in the 2nd century BCE. The palace was known for its lavish architecture, impressive theater, and extensive library, which housed more than 200,000 parchment scrolls. It was also home to an altar dedicated to Zeus and Athena, as well as various other temples and shrines.
