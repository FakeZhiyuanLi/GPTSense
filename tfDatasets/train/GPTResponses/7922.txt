is that the slower usb device will end up slowing down the data transfer rate for all other usb devices connected to the same bus. This is because the high-bandwidth usb bus shares its resources amongst all the devices connected to it, and as such, any device occupying a significant portion of the available bandwidth will impact the overall data transfer rate for all other devices. As a result, it is generally recommended to connect slower usb devices to their own dedicated usb ports, or to use a usb hub with its own dedicated power source to avoid these types of issues.
