It is unclear which virus-induced flu is being referred to, as outbreaks of various viral strains have been reported throughout history. One of the earliest recorded outbreaks was the Spanish flu in 1918, caused by the H1N1 virus. Other notable flu outbreaks include the Asian flu in 1957, the Hong Kong flu in 1968, and the H1N1 swine flu pandemic in 2009.
