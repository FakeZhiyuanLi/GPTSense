are known as rounding errors or inaccuracies. HD (high-definition) video formats often require higher frame rates than traditional video formats, which can result in fractions when expressing the frame rate. For example, a typical HD video format may have a frame rate of 59.94 frames per second, which includes a fraction. If this fraction is not expressed in strict notation (such as 59.94 fps instead of 59.9333 fps), it can lead to inaccuracies in playback and editing, as the software may incorrectly interpret the frame rate. Therefore, strict notation is required to avoid these issues and ensure accurate playback and editing of HD video.
