A strong presumption exists internationally that a head of state has acted within their authority when entering into a treaty because it is assumed that the head of state has acted in accordance with their constitutional and legal powers. This presumption is based on the principle of sovereignty, which recognizes that states have the right to determine their own internal affairs and to enter into agreements with other states. Additionally, the presumption is reinforced by the doctrine of state responsibility, which holds that a state is responsible for the actions of its representatives, including its head of state, in relation to international law. As such, unless there is clear evidence to the contrary, it is generally assumed that a head of state has acted lawfully when entering into a treaty.
