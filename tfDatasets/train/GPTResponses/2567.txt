The smallest number of protein coding genes that a virus can have varies depending on the type of virus. However, some viruses such as the smallest known virus, called Pelagibacter phage HTVC010P, only has 6 protein-coding genes. While other viruses, such as the influenza virus, have around 10 protein-coding genes. Some viruses, such as adenoviruses, herpesviruses, and poxviruses, have much larger genomes and can have upwards of 100-200 protein-coding genes. So, the smallest number of protein-coding genes that a virus can have depends on the type of virus.
