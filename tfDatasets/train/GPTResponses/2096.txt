The basic MP3 decoding technology was developed by the Fraunhofer Institute in Germany and is protected by patents. However, the patents have expired in most countries, including the United States, the European Union, and Japan, which means that the basic MP3 technology is now generally considered to be patent-free. However, there are still some patents related to specific aspects of MP3 technology that may still be valid and enforceable in some countries.
