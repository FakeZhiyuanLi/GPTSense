The small wires in a light bulb's stem perform the important function of connecting the filament (the part of the bulb that glows) to the electrical circuit that powers the bulb. These wires are typically made of tungsten and must be extremely thin in order to fit within the small stem of the bulb. They are carefully twisted and wound around small pins in a way that ensures a strong electrical connection while still allowing the filament to move and flex as it heats up and cools down. Without these wires, the filament would not be able to function and the light bulb would not produce any light.
