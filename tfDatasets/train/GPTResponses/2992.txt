Corruption in any sector or industry creates weak provision of services because it diverts resources and funds away from their intended purpose. Instead, these resources and funds are used for personal gain through bribery and other corrupt practices. As a result, the quality and quantity of services provided are compromised, leading to inefficiency, ineffectiveness, and a lack of accountability.Corruption also undermines the trust and confidence that people have in public institutions and government officials. When public officials engage in corrupt practices, they lose the moral authority to provide services to the public. Citizens may perceive these officials as self-serving, dishonest, and unaccountable, which can diminish public support for their programs and initiatives.Furthermore, corruption can discourage investment and economic growth, as businesses may be deterred by the risks associated with corrupt practices. This can lead to a weaker economy overall, resulting in limited resources and funds allocated to services and infrastructure.In summary, corruption weakens the provision of services by diverting resources, undermining trust in public officials, and discouraging investment and economic growth. Reducing corruption is essential to promote efficient and effective service delivery, build trust in public institutions, and encourage economic development.
