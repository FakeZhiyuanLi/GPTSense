Birds have a natural ability to perceive magnetic fields, which helps them navigate long distances during their migrations. The Earth has a magnetic field that varies in strength and orientation depending on the bird's location on the planet. The magnetic field helps the bird determine its position and direction by providing a sense of orientation to the bird's internal compass.At different latitudes, the Earth's magnetic field changes its inclination and intensity. Birds use this information from the magnetic field to determine their latitude and longitude. For instance, at higher latitudes, where the magnetic poles are closer to the surface, the magnetic field lines tend to be more vertical, allowing birds to navigate more accurately. In contrast, at lower latitudes, where the magnetic field is weaker, the birds may rely on other navigational cues such as landmarks and the motion of the sun and stars to navigate.Overall, the magnetic field is a critical tool for birds to navigate and orient themselves during long journeys across different latitudes.
