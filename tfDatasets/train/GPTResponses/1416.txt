is now known as Bulgaria and Macedonia. The language was gradually transformed into what is now known as Old Church Slavonic by the brothers Cyril and Methodius in the 9th century CE. Old Church Slavonic became the literary language of the Slavic Orthodox Church and was used for liturgical and other religious purposes in Bulgaria, Russia, and other Slavic countries until the mid-18th century. It also served as the basis for the development of the modern Slavic languages, including Bulgarian, Serbian, Croatian, and Russian.
