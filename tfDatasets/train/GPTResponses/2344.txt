Alleles can be located on a specific gene in a chromosome in order to be either dominant or recessive. The dominant allele is usually denoted by a capital letter, while the recessive allele is usually denoted by a lowercase letter. The dominance or recessiveness of an allele depends on its interaction with other alleles and the environment. For example, in humans, the allele for brown eyes (B) is dominant over the allele for blue eyes (b), which is recessive. Therefore, a person with two B alleles or a B and b allele will have brown eyes, while a person with two b alleles will have blue eyes.
