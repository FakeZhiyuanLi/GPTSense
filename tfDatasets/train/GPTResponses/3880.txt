The first device to help deaf people communicate through telecommunications was introduced by a company called TTY (also known as teletypewriter) in the 1960s. However, another device called the Telecommunications Device for the Deaf (TDD) was introduced by the company Minicom in the early 1970s, which became widely popular and revolutionized telecommunications for the deaf community.
