A filter bank is typically composed of multiple band-pass filters that separate an input signal into different frequency bands. Each band-pass filter has a specific cutoff frequency that determines the frequency range allowed through the filter. The output from each individual band-pass filter is then combined to generate the final output signal. The filter bank can be implemented using analog or digital circuitry, and can also be designed to be adjustable to allow for fine-tuning of individual filters.
