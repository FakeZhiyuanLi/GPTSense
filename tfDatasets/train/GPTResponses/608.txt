The four truths depict the path of practice in Buddhism, which is commonly known as the Noble Eightfold Path. It is a practical guide to living in a way that leads to the cessation of suffering and the attainment of enlightenment. The path consists of eight principles: Right Understanding, Right Intention, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, and Right Concentration. These principles are interrelated and support each other in cultivating wisdom, ethical conduct, and mental discipline, leading to the liberation from the cycle of birth and death (samsara).
