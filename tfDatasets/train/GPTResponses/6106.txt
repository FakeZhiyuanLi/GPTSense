Sigmund Freud was an Austrian neurologist who is known as the founder of psychoanalysis, a method for treating mental illness. He brought the idea of the unconscious mind and the role it plays in shaping human behavior and personality. He believed that many of our thoughts and actions are driven by unconscious desires and conflicts. He also introduced the concept of the id, ego, and superego as components of the human psyche. Freudâ€™s work has had a profound influence on modern psychology and psychotherapy.
