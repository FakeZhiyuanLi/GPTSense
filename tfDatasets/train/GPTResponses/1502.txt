The goal of the first trading companies was primarily to establish and facilitate international trade, usually between Europe and Asia. These companies were established by European countries such as England, France, and the Netherlands in the 16th and 17th centuries. They sought to acquire valuable commodities such as spices, silk, and tea from Asian markets and transport them back to Europe for trade and sale. In order to achieve this goal, these companies often established trading posts and factories in various parts of Asia and employed local labor to produce and acquire the desired goods.
