The Germanic people did not create a single unified entity in place of the Western Roman Empire. Instead, they established numerous kingdoms and territories across Europe after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD. Some of the notable Germanic kingdoms that emerged after the fall of Rome included the Visigothic Kingdom in Spain, the Ostrogothic Kingdom in Italy, the Vandals Kingdom in North Africa, the Franks Kingdom in modern-day France and Germany, and the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in England. These kingdoms differed in their political structures, cultures, and languages but they all shared a Germanic origin and played a significant role in shaping the political and cultural landscape of medieval Europe.
