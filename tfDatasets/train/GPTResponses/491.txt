Cultural anthropology has specifically emphasized the study of human cultures, societies, and behaviors. It focuses on understanding how people live, how they interact with each other, and how they create and transmit their cultural beliefs and practices. Cultural anthropologists conduct fieldwork to engage with the communities they study, and they use a variety of methods such as participant observation, interviews, and surveys to collect data about the culture they are studying. Cultural anthropology aims to help us understand how culture shapes our lives, and how we can use that knowledge to foster cross-cultural understanding and facilitate social change.
