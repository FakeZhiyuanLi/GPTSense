The nobility was traditionally protected from various forms of punishment or persecution by their status and title in society. They were exempted from paying certain taxes, had access to better education, healthcare, and living facilities, and had political influence over decision-making processes. In some cases, they were also shielded from legal consequences of their actions or crimes. This protection was the result of the social hierarchy that existed in many societies, with the noble class deemed to be superior to the commoners.
