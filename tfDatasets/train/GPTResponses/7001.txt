The armature is another important element of a DC motor. It is the rotating component of the motor that is connected to the shaft and contains the conductors that produce the electromagnetic field. The armature is typically made up of a core (often made of iron) and insulated conductive wires that are wound around the core in a specified pattern. When an electric current is applied to the armature, the interaction between the magnetic field produced by the stator and the conductors in the armature causes the rotation of the shaft.
