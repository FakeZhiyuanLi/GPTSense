The Duchy of Lancaster is a royal duchy, which is a personal property of the reigning monarch of the United Kingdom. It is an ancient inheritance that has been passed down from monarch to monarch since 1399, when Henry IV created it as a source of private income for the reigning monarch. The Duchy owns land, property, and other assets across England and Wales, and its income is used to fund the activities of the reigning monarch and to support charitable causes. The Duchy is managed by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, who is appointed by the reigning monarch.
