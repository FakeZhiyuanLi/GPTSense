The ruling in Hopwood v. Texas set a precedent for affirmative action policies in college admissions. The court ruled that using race as a factor in admissions decisions was unconstitutional, which effectively ended affirmative action at public universities in Texas. This ruling established a precedent for other courts to follow in cases related to affirmative action in college admissions.
