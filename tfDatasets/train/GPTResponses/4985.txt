Habitat destruction refers to the permanent modification or destruction of a natural environment. This can occur as a result of human activities like deforestation, urbanization, or farming. It can also be caused by natural disasters like fires, floods, or storms.Overkill is a hunting practice where a species is killed at such high rates that it can no longer sustain its population. This often occurs when a species is hunted for its skin, meat, or other valuable products. Overkill can lead to the extinction of species, which can have cascading effects on other species in the ecosystem.Introduced species are non-native species that are intentionally or unintentionally introduced into an ecosystem. These species can cause harm to the native species living in that ecosystem by competing for resources or preying on them. They can also introduce diseases or parasites that the native species are vulnerable to.Secondary extinctions occur when the disappearance of one species triggers the extinction of other species that rely on it for food or habitat. For example, if a predator species goes extinct, the prey species it used to hunt may overpopulate and deplete their own food source. This can cause a chain reaction of extinctions throughout the ecosystem.
