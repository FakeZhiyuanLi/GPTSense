The performance of classical music requires proficiency in principles such as melody, harmony, rhythm, dynamics, expression, phrasing, articulation, tempo, and musical form. Additionally, musicians must have a deep understanding of the composer's intention and style, as well as a mastery of their instrument or voice.
