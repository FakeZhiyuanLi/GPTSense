The Soviet Union put pressure on Czechoslovakia to conduct purges. In 1968, Soviet tanks invaded Czechoslovakia to quell the "Prague Spring" and ensure that the country remained under Soviet control. After the invasion, the Soviet-backed Czechoslovak government purged thousands of reform-minded officials and intellectuals from the government, military, and media. The purges were intended to eliminate any remaining dissent or opposition to Soviet domination.
