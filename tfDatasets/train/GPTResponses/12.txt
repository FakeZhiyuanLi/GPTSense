The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an algorithm that is used to find all prime numbers up to a given limit. The algorithm works by creating a list of all numbers up to the limit and then eliminating all multiples of the primes found so far, as they cannot be prime themselves. This process continues until all remaining numbers on the list are prime. The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a simple and efficient method for generating a list of primes and has been used for many centuries.
