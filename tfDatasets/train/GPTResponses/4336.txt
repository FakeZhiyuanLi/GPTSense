This includes areas responsible for processing social cues like facial expressions and body language, as well as regions involved in decision-making, impulse control, and self-awareness. Additionally, the brain's reward system undergoes significant changes, leading to heightened sensitivity to positive social feedback and increased risk-taking behavior.
