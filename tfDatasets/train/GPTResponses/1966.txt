When a state withdraws from a treaty, it essentially terminates its participation in the agreed-upon obligations and rights under the treaty. The state is no longer bound by the terms of the treaty and is free to act in accordance with its own interests.However, the withdrawal from a treaty does not automatically release a state from the obligations it incurred prior to the withdrawal. The state is still responsible for any actions or commitments it made under the treaty before it withdrew. Therefore, the termination of the treaty does not relieve the state of any responsibility for actions taken or promises made while it was a party to the treaty.Furthermore, a state's withdrawal from a treaty could have potential legal and diplomatic consequences, including damage to its reputation and relationships with other countries. Some treaties also have provisions for resolving disputes that may arise from a state's withdrawal.In summary, a state's withdrawal from a treaty could release it from future obligations, but it cannot undo any obligations or commitments already incurred, and it could have legal and diplomatic consequences.
