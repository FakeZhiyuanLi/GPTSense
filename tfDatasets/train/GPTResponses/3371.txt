Students who experience a significant leap in their academic performance are those who have made significant improvements in their grades or test scores. These improvements may be the result of a variety of factors, such as hard work, increased motivation, improved study habits, effective tutoring or support, or simply a better understanding of the material. The leap in academic performance is typically measured by a significant increase in the student's GPA or standardized test scores.
