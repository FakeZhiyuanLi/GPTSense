A drug's owner can recover R&D (research and development) costs through various means:1. Patent protection: The owner can obtain a patent for the drug, which grants exclusive rights to manufacture and sell the drug for a certain period, usually 20 years. This allows the owner to charge a high price for the drug to recoup their R&D costs.2. Market exclusivity: The owner can also obtain market exclusivity for a certain period, which allows them to be the only manufacturer and seller of the drug in the market during that period. This can be granted by regulatory agencies for drugs with special characteristics or for drugs that treat rare diseases.3. Pricing strategy: The owner can use pricing strategies that take into account the cost of R&D, such as setting a high price initially and then gradually lowering it as the drug becomes more established in the market.4. Government grants and partnerships: The owner can receive government grants or partner with organizations to help fund the R&D costs.Overall, a combination of these factors enables the drug's owner to recover their R&D costs and generate profits from the drug.
