The genetic code specifies the correspondence between codons and amino acids during protein translation. The genetic code is a set of rules that determines how the nucleotide sequence of DNA and RNA encodes the sequence of amino acids in a protein. The genetic code is a triplet code, meaning that each codon consists of three nucleotides. There are 64 possible codons, but only 20 amino acids used to build proteins. This means that most amino acids are specified by more than one codon. For example, the amino acid alanine can be specified by the codons GCU, GCC, GCA, or GCG. The genetic code is universal, meaning that it is the same for all organisms, from bacteria to humans.
