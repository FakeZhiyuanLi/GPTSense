According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), vaccination has led to significant decreases in rubella, measles, and mumps infections.- Rubella: Before the rubella vaccine was introduced in 1969, there were large rubella epidemics every 6 to 9 years in the United States, causing thousands of miscarriages and birth defects in newborns. Since the introduction of the vaccine, the number of rubella cases has dropped by more than 99% in the United States.- Measles: Before the measles vaccine was introduced in 1963, there were 3 to 4 million cases of measles every year in the United States, with hundreds of deaths and thousands of hospitalizations. Since then, there has been a 99.9% decrease in the number of measles cases in the United States.- Mumps: Before the mumps vaccine was introduced in 1967, there were about 186,000 cases of mumps every year in the United States, with many cases leading to complications such as meningitis and deafness. Since the introduction of the vaccine, the number of mumps cases has dropped by more than 99% in the United States.
