François Bozizé, former President of the Central African Republic, has been indicted for war crimes and crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, Netherlands. The charges stem from alleged crimes committed during the country's ongoing conflict, including torture, murder, rape, and forced displacement of civilians. Bozizé is currently living in exile in Uganda and has denied the charges against him.
