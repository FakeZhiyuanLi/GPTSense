A unit load is defined as a standardized quantity or volume of materials or products that can be handled, transported, and stored as a single entity. It is typically a palletized load that is designed to fit and be transported by standard equipment, such as forklifts and pallet jacks. Unit loads are used to streamline the logistics process, optimize space utilization, reduce handling costs and improve efficiency in supply chain management.
