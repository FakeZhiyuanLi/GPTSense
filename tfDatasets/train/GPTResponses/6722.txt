The Constitution and various federal statutes and case law are used to determine whether federal judicial power extends to formulating binding precedent. The Supreme Court, as the highest court in the federal system, has the authority to establish binding precedent that lower courts must follow. Additionally, federal courts are guided by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and other legal principles and procedures that help determine when they have the authority to formulate binding precedent.
