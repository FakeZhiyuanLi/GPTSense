Many psychologists and social theorists have built on Erikson's ideas of identity development, but one scholar whose definition of identity closely follows Erikson's is James Marcia. Marcia extended Erikson's model and proposed four different identity statuses that an individual may experience during adolescence and young adulthood - identity achievement, foreclosure, moratorium, and identity diffusion. Marcia's theory emphasizes the importance of engaging in exploration and committing to a sense of self, much like Erikson's ideas of achieving a sense of identity during adolescence.
