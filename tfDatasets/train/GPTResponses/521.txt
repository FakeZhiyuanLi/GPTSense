In 2007, national governments implemented a variety of measures to prevent the collapse of large financial institutions. One of the most notable actions was the implementation of massive bailouts and rescue packages. Governments injected billions of dollars into struggling banks to help stabilize them and restore confidence in financial markets. Additionally, regulators imposed stricter rules on banks and financial institutions to prevent excessive risk-taking and improve transparency. These measures helped to prevent a total collapse of the banking system, although the financial crisis still had significant impacts on many people and economies around the world.
