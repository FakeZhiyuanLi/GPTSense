Adam Smith disagreed with the idea of mercantilism, which held that a country's wealth is determined by the amount of precious metals it possesses and that a government should strive to export more than it imports in order to accumulate wealth. Smith believed that a nation's wealth is determined by the productivity and innovation of its people and that free trade and competition would lead to better outcomes than government intervention in markets.
