Showing that two groups are isomorphic means that they have the same structure, even though the elements and operations may be different. In order to prove that two groups are isomorphic, it is often useful to find a function, called an isomorphism, that maps elements and operations from one group to another.The second equality in the question likely refers to an equation between elements and operations in one group and the corresponding elements and operations in another group. By showing that this equation holds for all elements and operations in both groups, we are demonstrating that the two groups have the same structure and are therefore isomorphic.In other words, the fact that the two groups can be mapped onto each other in a way that preserves the group operations and structures is evidence that they are isomorphic. This mapping represents an isomorphism between the two groups, which provides a formal proof that the groups are indeed isomorphic.
