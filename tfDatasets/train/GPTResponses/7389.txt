Pancake motors are commonly used in various servo-controlled systems such as robotics, industrial automation, medical equipment, aerospace, and defense systems. These motors are preferred for their compact and low-profile design, high torque output, precise speed control, and smooth operation. Some of the specific applications of pancake motors in servo-controlled systems include robotic arms and grippers, precision motion control systems, rotary tables, and linear actuators.
