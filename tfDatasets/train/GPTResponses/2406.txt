to the parties was not evident at the time of the conclusion of the treaty. This means that if one or both parties did not have knowledge of a fact or circumstance that would have influenced their decision to enter into the treaty, their consent to the treaty is still considered valid. However, if it is later discovered that one or both parties were aware of the fact or circumstance but chose to conceal it, the treaty may be invalidated due to fraudulent or deceptive conduct. Additionally, if the fact or circumstance becomes evident after the conclusion of the treaty and it fundamentally alters the nature of the obligations of the parties, they may agree to amend or terminate the treaty.
