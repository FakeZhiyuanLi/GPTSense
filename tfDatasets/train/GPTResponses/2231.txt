If you want wood that is easy to work with, you would want a tree that has slow, even growth with straight grain patterns. Trees that grow quickly and have irregular grain patterns tend to be harder to work with as they are more prone to splitting or warping during the wood working process. Examples of trees with easy to work with wood include cherry, maple, and walnut.
