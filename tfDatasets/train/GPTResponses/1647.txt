Transistors began to replace vacuum tubes in computers during the late 1950s and early 1960s. The invention of the transistor in 1947 was a major breakthrough in electronics and paved the way for the development of smaller, faster, and more reliable computers. By the mid-1960s, most computers and electronic devices had completely transitioned to transistor technology.
