The neurobiological explanation for behavior is applicable to all types of brains - human and non-human, healthy and diseased, young and old. The brain is a complex organ that controls all behavior, emotions, and thoughts, and therefore the brain's functioning plays a crucial role in determining behavior. Neurobiological explanations explain how the structure and function of the brain influence behavior, so they are relevant for all brains.
