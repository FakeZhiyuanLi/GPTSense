There are several mechanisms that enable the regulation of plant growth, including:1. Hormones: Plant hormones control various aspects of growth, such as cell division, elongation, differentiation, and senescence. The major plant hormones include auxins, gibberellins, cytokinins, abscisic acid, and ethylene.2. Environmental cues: Plants respond to environmental cues such as light, temperature, humidity, and nutrients. These cues trigger physiological and biochemical changes that regulate plant growth and development.3. Genetic factors: Genetic factors play a crucial role in regulating plant growth. Genes control the synthesis, transport, and sensing of various hormones and regulatory molecules, as well as the growth and development of specific organs.4. Epigenetic regulation: Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, can alter gene expression and influence plant growth and development.5. Interactions with other organisms: Plants interact with other organisms, such as insects, fungi, and bacteria, which can influence plant growth and development. For example, certain bacteria can promote plant growth by fixing nitrogen, while fungi can help plants acquire nutrients from the soil.
