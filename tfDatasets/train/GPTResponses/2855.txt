The medieval church was often portrayed as being opposed to the study of science and math. However, this is also a misconception. While there were certainly individuals within the church who opposed developments in these fields, there were also many who supported and even championed scientific and mathematical inquiry. For example, the church was responsible for establishing many of the first universities in Europe, which were centers of learning in a variety of academic disciplines, including science and math. Additionally, many important figures in the history of science and math, such as Galileo Galilei and Johannes Kepler, were devout Christians who saw their work as a way of understanding God's creation.
