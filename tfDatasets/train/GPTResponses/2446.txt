are considered reasonable satellite dishes and television antennas.The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has established guidelines for the installation of antennas, including satellite dishes and television antennas. The FCC has placed limits on the power output of antennas, their location, and their size. These guidelines are intended to ensure that antennas do not interfere with other electronic devices or communication signals.The FCC's guidelines also prevent homeowners' associations and other organizations from banning reasonable antennas. The FCC's Over-the-Air Reception Devices (OTARD) rule prohibits certain restrictions on the installation of antennas. This rule states that renters, homeowners, and businesses have the right to install antennas meant to receive video programming, subject to certain limitations.The limits include:1. Antennas must be installed on property exclusively owned or controlled by the user.2. Antennas must not exceed 12 feet in any dimension.3. Antennas must be located where they do not interfere with the property rights of others.4. Homeowners' associations cannot ban antennas, but they are allowed to place reasonable restrictions on their placement.City governments are also prohibited from banning reasonable antennas, but they may impose certain restrictions, such as requiring permits, specifying the size of antennas, and regulating the placement of antennas.  So, the laws about antennas keep homeowners' associations and city governments from banning reasonable antennas.
