International law originally recognized treaty reservations as an acceptable practice. The 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties codified the rules governing treaty reservations, recognizing that parties to a treaty may, in certain circumstances, make reservations to the treaty's provisions.Reservations are allowed if they are not incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty and if they do not affect the essential rights and obligations of other parties to the treaty. Additionally, the treaty must not prohibit reservations or must permit them with certain limitations.In contrast, the practice of objecting to treaty reservations is a more recent development in international law. It has become increasingly common for states to object to reservations made by other parties to a treaty, particularly in human rights treaties.Overall, the response of international law to treaty reservations has evolved over time and has become more nuanced as the practice has become more widespread.
