Typically, political leaders or party officials will instruct members on how to vote on a particular issue or legislation. In some cases, there may be a whip system in place where designated members, known as whips, are responsible for ensuring that members vote according to the party's position. Additionally, outside groups or lobbyists may also provide guidance or pressure to sway members' votes. Ultimately, it is up to each individual member to make their own voting decision, but party discipline and external influences can heavily influence their choice.
