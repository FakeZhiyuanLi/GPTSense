and dependent origination in Buddhism?In Buddhism, cyclic existence or Samsara refers to the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth, in which individuals are bound due to their ignorance and craving. According to dependent origination, all phenomena arise interdependently and are connected causally. Therefore, the conditions of cyclic existence are linked to dependent origination because they arise as a result of one's Karma, which is the result of previous actions performed based on craving, ignorance, and delusion.Furthermore, dependent origination explains that the twelve links or nidanas constituting the cycle of Samsara are interconnected and interdependent. The twelve links are ignorance – formation – consciousness – name and form – six senses- contact – feelings – craving – grasping – becoming – birth – age and death. Each of these links depends on the previous one and causes the next one leading individuals to remain stuck in cyclic existence.Therefore, to break the cycle of Samsara, one must break the chain of dependent origination by getting rid of ignorance, craving, and delusion. By cultivating wisdom, compassion, and right action through meditation, ethical behavior, and mindfulness, one can attain enlightenment and freedom from the cycle of Samsara.
