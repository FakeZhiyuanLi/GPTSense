Czech is recognized as one of the officially recognized minority languages in Slovakia, along with Hungarian, Ukrainian, and Romani. This means that Czech speakers in Slovakia have certain rights related to education, media, and public administration in their native language. There are also several Czech language schools and cultural institutions in Slovakia, particularly in areas with larger Czech minorities. However, the use of Czech in daily life and public discourse is generally limited in Slovakia, and most Czech speakers also speak fluent Slovak.
