A lot of programs spend time waiting for input/output (I/O) operations to complete. This can include reading from or writing to files, network communication, user input, and other similar operations. During this waiting time, the CPU is idle and cannot perform any other tasks until the I/O operation is finished. This can cause a program to appear slow or unresponsive to the user. Techniques like asynchronous programming, buffering, and caching can be used to reduce the waiting time for I/O operations and improve program performance.
