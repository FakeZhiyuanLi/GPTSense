The theories to integrate molecular genetics with Darwinian evolution developed over several decades, beginning in the mid-20th century. Some early work on this topic was done in the 1940s and 1950s, but significant progress was not made until the 1960s and 1970s, with the development of new techniques for studying DNA and the rise of the field of molecular biology. By the 1980s, researchers had developed a more complete understanding of how genetic information is transmitted and expressed, and how this information contributes to evolutionary change. Today, molecular genetics and evolutionary biology are closely intertwined, and many researchers working in these fields draw on both disciplines to understand the complexities of biological evolution.
