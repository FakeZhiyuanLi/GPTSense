One theory is that the term "buck" originates from the trade of deerskins. In the 18th century, American colonists commonly used deerskins as a form of currency, known as a "buckskin." Thus, a "buck" may have been used as slang for a dollar because it was equivalent in value to a buckskin. Another theory suggests that the term came from poker games in the Wild West, where players would use buckhorn-handled knives as markers for their bets. The person with the knife was said to be the "buck." Over time, this slang term may have been extended to refer to money in general.
