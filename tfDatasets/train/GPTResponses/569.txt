Thermal mass systems store solar energy in the form of heat. They use materials with high heat capacity, such as water and masonry, to absorb and retain solar heat during the day and release it slowly at night or during periods of low solar heating. This stored heat can then be used to provide space heating, hot water, and other thermal energy needs.
