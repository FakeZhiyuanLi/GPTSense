One important thing that should be present when countries are trading with pesticides is proper labeling and documentation of the pesticides being traded. This ensures that the pesticide being imported is of high quality and safe to use according to the intended purposes in order to protect both the environment and human health. Additionally, clear and accurate documentation helps prevent the trade of illegal or counterfeit pesticides that may contain harmful substances or not be effective in controlling pests.
