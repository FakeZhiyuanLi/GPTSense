The official end of the California Gold Rush is generally considered to be 1855, as most of the gold had been mined out and the population of California had begun to stabilize. However, there was no single event that ended the gold rush. It was a gradual decline as the easily accessible gold deposits were depleted and miners moved on to other regions or occupations.
