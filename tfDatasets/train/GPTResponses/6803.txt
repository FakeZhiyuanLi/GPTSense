Federal courts cannot just make up law because they are bound by the Constitution, statutes, and legal precedents. The Constitution outlines the powers and limitations of the federal government, including the judiciary. The statutes passed by Congress provide the framework for federal law. Legal precedents, established by previous court decisions, set the standards and interpretations of the law. Federal courts must adhere to these sources of law in order to maintain a fair and consistent legal system. If federal courts were allowed to make up law, it would undermine the rule of law and create uncertainty in the legal system.
