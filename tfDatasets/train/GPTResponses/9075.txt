John von Neumann, a mathematician and economist, is widely regarded as one of the founding figures of game theory. His major contribution to economics was the development of the theory of a non-cooperative game, which has been applied to a broad range of economic applications including the study of oligopoly, bargaining, auction theory, and financial markets. Von Neumann was also a pioneer in the development of mathematical models for economic analysis, including dynamic programming and linear programming. These contributions have had a significant impact on modern economics and have helped to establish it as a rigorous and mathematical field.
