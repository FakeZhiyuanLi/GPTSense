One classic example of passive solar design is a south-facing window that allows sunlight to enter and heat up the interior of a building, while also using thermal mass materials (such as concrete or stone floors or walls) to store and radiate that heat throughout the space. This strategy can reduce the need for artificial heating in the winter and increase comfort and natural lighting in the building.
