The Polish nobility had equal status with the Lithuanian nobility because of the Union of Lublin in 1569, which united the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania into a single state, known as the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Both nations had their own distinct legal systems, but the nobility in both countries enjoyed similar privileges and rights.
