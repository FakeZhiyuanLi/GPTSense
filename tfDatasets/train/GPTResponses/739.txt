Whitehead believed that an entity cannot be defined solely by its internal characteristics, but also by the relations it has with other entities in its environment. He emphasized the importance of external relations in defining an entity, and argued that without these relationships, an entity cannot be fully understood or accurately described. In other words, an entity is not an isolated and self-contained unit, but is rather a dynamic and interconnected part of a broader system.
