The Stoic school of thought saw emotion as an impediment to virtue. They believed that a virtuous person should be rational and in control of their emotions, as emotions could cloud judgment and lead to actions that were not in line with reason and morality. Stoics believed that true happiness and fulfillment could only be achieved by developing one's rational faculties and living in harmony with nature.
