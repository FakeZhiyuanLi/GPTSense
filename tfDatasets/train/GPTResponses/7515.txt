Torque is determined by multiplying the force applied to an object by the distance from the point of application to the axis of rotation. Mathematically, torque (T) is expressed as:T = F x rWhere T is torque, F is force and r is the perpendicular distance from the point of application of the force to the axis of rotation. The unit of torque is expressed in Newton-meters (Nm) or pound-feet (lb-ft).  Additionally, the angle between the force and the direction of the radius can also affect the torque value.
