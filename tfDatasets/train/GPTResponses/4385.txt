The major supply trail for the northern Vietnamese forces during the Vietnam War was the Ho Chi Minh Trail, which was a complex network of roads, paths, and tunnels that ran from North Vietnam through Laos and Cambodia to the southern part of Vietnam. The trail was used to supply troops, weapons, and equipment to the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army. It was a key factor in the war as it allowed the northern forces to keep fighting despite heavy bombing by the US.
