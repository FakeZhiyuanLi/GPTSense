Prussian military officers were trained to exude a type of thinking known as "Prussian militarism," which emphasized discipline, obedience, and the subordination of personal interests to the interests of the state and the military. They were also trained to emphasize esprit de corps, the importance of the chain of command, and the need for efficiency and proficiency in all aspects of military operations.
