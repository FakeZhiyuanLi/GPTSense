Carl von Voit and Max Rubner applied calorimetry to nutrition in order to receive their results. Calorimetry is the measurement of heat production by living organisms, which can be used to determine energy expenditure and nutrient utilization in the body. By measuring the energy content of food and the amount of energy expended by the body, Voit and Rubner were able to develop a better understanding of the role of nutrients in metabolism and how they impact health and disease.
