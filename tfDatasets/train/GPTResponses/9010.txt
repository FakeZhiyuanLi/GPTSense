Substances that can skew the results of an asthma test include bronchodilators (such as albuterol), which can open up airways and temporarily relieve asthma symptoms, and corticosteroids (such as prednisone), which can reduce inflammation in the airways and make them less responsive to triggers. Additionally, exposure to allergens or other environmental irritants can exacerbate asthma symptoms and affect test results.
