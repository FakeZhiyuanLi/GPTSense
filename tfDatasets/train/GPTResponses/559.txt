Since the 1980s, it has become common for social anthropologists to focus on local and global interconnectedness, cultural diversity and globalization, and the ways in which power dynamics shape social relations. They have also increasingly employed interdisciplinary approaches, incorporating insights from fields such as sociology, geography, history, and cultural studies. Additionally, many social anthropologists have developed more engaged and collaborative research practices, working closely with the communities they study and prioritizing the representation and amplification of marginalized voices.
