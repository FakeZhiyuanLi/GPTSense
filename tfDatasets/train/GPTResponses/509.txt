One purpose of a greenhouse is to provide an enclosed environment where plants can grow and thrive, with controlled temperature, humidity, and lighting conditions. This can extend growing seasons, protect plants from harsh weather conditions, and allow for the cultivation of plants that may not otherwise thrive in a particular climate. Greenhouses are commonly used for growing vegetables, herbs, flowers, and other plants, as well as for research and experimentation in plant science.
