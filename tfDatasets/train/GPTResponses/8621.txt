Under the Ottomans, non-Muslim minorities, such as Christians and Jews, were often treated as second class citizens, with limited rights and freedoms compared to Muslim citizens. Non-Muslims were subject to discriminatory taxation and were excluded from certain roles in government and the military. They were also required to adhere to certain dress codes and restrictions on religious practices. However, the level of discrimination varied depending on time and place within the Ottoman Empire.
