The United States: The US government initially granted Shell a permit to drill in the Arctic, but after several accidents and mishaps, the permit was eventually revoked in 2015. The US Department of the Interior also placed a moratorium on oil and gas drilling in the Arctic in 2016.2. Canada: The Canadian government approved Shell's drilling plans, but the company eventually withdrew from its Arctic exploration operations due to disappointing results and high costs.3. Norway: The Norwegian government allowed Shell to explore for oil in the Arctic, but the company later gave up its license due to disappointing results.4. Russia: Shell partnered with Gazprom, a Russian state-owned energy company, to explore for oil in the Arctic. However, this partnership was eventually dissolved due to geopolitical tensions and economic sanctions imposed on Russia.5. Greenpeace: The environmental organization launched protests against Shell's Arctic exploration plans, including occupying an oil rig and launching a campaign against Arctic oil drilling.
