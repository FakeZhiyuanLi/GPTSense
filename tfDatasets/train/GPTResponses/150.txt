The long term goal of French foreign policy along the Rhine was to establish a buffer zone between France and Germany to protect the French border from invasion. This was rooted in the historic rivalry and conflict between France and Germany, and became even more crucial after the devastation of World War I. The creation of the Rhineland demilitarized zone after WWI was a key step towards achieving this goal. However, this policy was challenged by Germany's rearmament during the 1930s and eventually led to the outbreak of World War II.
