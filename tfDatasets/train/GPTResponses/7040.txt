It is unclear which specific device you are referring to. However, Charles-Ã‰mile Reynaud, a French inventor and scientist, invented the praxinoscope in 1877, which was an optical device used to create moving images. It is possible that Gramme may have used this device or other optical devices to aid in his research or experiments.
