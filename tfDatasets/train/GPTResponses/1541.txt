Damage to the reticular formation can cause a range of symptoms, including changes in consciousness, attention, and alertness. Other possible effects include disruptions in sleep-wake cycles, disturbances in motor coordination and control, and difficulties with sensory perception and processing. Damage to this area of the brain can also lead to problems with balance and posture, as well as changes in autonomic functions such as heart rate and respiration. In severe cases, damage to the reticular formation may result in coma or other serious neurological conditions.
