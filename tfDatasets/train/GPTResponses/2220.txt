The set of genes that are considered crucial for the survival of an organism are often referred to as "essential genes". These are genes that are necessary for the organism to grow, develop, and carry out its basic biological functions. While the specific set of essential genes can vary between different organisms, they typically include genes involved in fundamental processes such as DNA replication, protein synthesis, energy metabolism, and cell division. In bacteria, for example, around 200-300 genes are considered essential, while in humans it is estimated to be between 1,500-2,500 essential genes. Scientists continue to study essential genes in order to understand their role in the functioning of organisms, and to develop new treatments and therapies targeting these genes.
