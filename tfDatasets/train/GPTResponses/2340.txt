The Indian Appropriations Act of March 3, 1871, ended the practice of making treaties with Native American tribes, and instead established a policy of dealing with tribes through contractual agreements. These agreements were called "Indian treaties" or "Indian contracts," and they defined the responsibilities and rights of both the federal government and the tribes. The federal government was responsible for providing tribes with certain benefits, such as education and health care, in exchange for the tribes relinquishing control of their lands and resources. These contractual relations between the federal government and Indian tribes laid the foundation for modern-day Native American policy in the United States.
