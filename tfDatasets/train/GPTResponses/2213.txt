During the Cenozoic era, the Western Alps underwent significant geological changes due to tectonic activity and erosion. The Alps began to form around 35 million years ago when the African Plate collided with the Eurasian Plate. This collision resulted in the uplift of the Alps and the creation of mountain ranges.Over time, glacial erosion and weathering have reshaped the mountains, carving out valleys, and creating jagged peaks. The presence of glaciers has also resulted in the formation of large lake systems, such as Lake Geneva and Lake Annecy, in the Western Alps.The continued tectonic activity has also led to the creation of new mountain ranges, such as the Mont Blanc massif, as well as the continued uplift of existing ranges. Overall, the Western Alps have undergone significant geological transformations during the Cenozoic era due to tectonic activity and erosion.
