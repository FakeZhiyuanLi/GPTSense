The proposal that life is a self-maintaining, infinite cycle can be attributed to the scientific theory of biogenesis. The French chemist and microbiologist, Louis Pasteur, proposed this theory in the mid-19th century. He argued that life can only arise from pre-existing life, and that it cannot be generated spontaneously from inanimate matter. This theory became widely accepted within the scientific community, and is still held as a fundamental principle of biology today.
