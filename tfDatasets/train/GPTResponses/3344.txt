Most of the space in the brain is made up of two major structures: the cerebrum and the cerebellum. The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain and is responsible for conscious thought, sensory perception, and voluntary movement. The cerebellum is located underneath the cerebrum and is responsible for coordination, balance, and posture. Together, these structures make up about 85% of the brain's total mass.
