The use of language and writing style is often prescribed by the grammar of a language or by conventions of a particular discipline. This includes rules for punctuation, sentence structure, word usage, and other aspects of written communication. Adhering to these rules and conventions is important for clarity and effective communication in both academic and professional contexts.
