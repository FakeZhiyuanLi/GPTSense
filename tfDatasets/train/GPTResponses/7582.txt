The Qing Qianlong Emperor sent a large Chinese army into Tibet in 1750 to establish control over the region and suppress an uprising by the Tibetans. The Tibetans had rebelled against the Chinese rule, and the Qianlong Emperor saw this as a threat to his authority and to the stability of the Qing dynasty. He also saw Tibet as an important strategic region for China's security and trade, as it was situated on the border with India, which was a key trading partner for China. The army was sent with the intention of restoring order and establishing Chinese dominance over Tibet.
