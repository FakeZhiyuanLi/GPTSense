Peter J. Wallison, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, argues that the financial crisis was largely caused by government policies aimed at increasing homeownership rates, including affordable housing goals and mandates for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to purchase and securitize low-quality mortgages. These policies led to an increase in subprime lending and the creation of complex financial instruments backed by such loans. When the housing market began to decline in 2006, the default rates on these mortgages rapidly increased, leading to a collapse in the value of mortgage-backed securities and threatening the solvency of major financial institutions. Wallison argues that the crisis was not caused by Wall Street greed or excessive risk-taking, but rather by government policies that distorted the market and encouraged risky lending practices.
