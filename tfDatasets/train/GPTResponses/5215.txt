Much of Elizabeth II's coronation ceremony was presented to the public through television and radio broadcasts. The event was televised live for the first time, and over 20 million people in the UK watched the ceremony. The procession from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Abbey was broadcast on television and radio, as were the religious ceremonies in the abbey itself. After the coronation, there was a procession back to Buckingham Palace, which was also broadcast. Additionally, newspapers printed detailed reports, photographs, and illustrations of the event, allowing people who couldn't attend in person to see and read about the coronation.
