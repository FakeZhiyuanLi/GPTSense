Adolf Hitler had a lifelong romantic fascination with Wagnerian opera, particularly the works of Richard Wagner. He saw Wagner’s music as a symbol of a ‘pure’ Germany and used it extensively in Nazi propaganda. Hitler himself was known to have attended Wagnerian opera performances multiple times and even had a personal relationship with Wagner’s family.
