The Kingdom of Great Zimbabwe had a strong copper production in 1000 AD. The kingdom, which was located in modern-day Zimbabwe, was known for its extensive trade networks and its production of copper and gold, which were used to make artifacts and currency. Archaeological evidence suggests that the kingdom had a sophisticated mining and smelting industry, and exported copper to other parts of Africa and beyond.
