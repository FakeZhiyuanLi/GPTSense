Many Italian cities have experienced popular revolts throughout history, but one notable example is the city of Genoa which had a popular revolt in 1746 known as the Genoese Revolt. This was a rebellion against the monarchy of the House of Savoy and was led by the Genoese merchant class. The revolt resulted in the establishment of a republican government in Genoa.
