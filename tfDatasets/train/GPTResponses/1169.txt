The first electronic digital programmable computer in the world was the Colossus, which was built in 1943 in England by a team led by Tommy Flowers. However, it was not a general-purpose computer and was designed specifically to break German codes during World War II. The first general-purpose electronic digital computer was the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC), built in the United States in 1945.
