Lucius Columella was a Roman writer on agriculture who lived in the 1st century AD. In his work "Res Rustica", he provides detailed instructions on how to domesticate ducks.According to Columella, the best time to domesticate ducks is in the spring. He recommends that the ducks be placed in a spacious pen with plenty of water for swimming and feeding. The pen should be cleaned regularly to prevent disease and infection.Columella suggests feeding the ducks a diet of barley, wheat, and corn, as well as insects and small fish. He also recommends adding some salt to their water to improve their health and productivity.In order to breed ducks, Columella advises that the males and females should be kept separate until the breeding season. Once the breeding season arrives, the males should be placed with the females in a nest or breeding box.Columella emphasizes the importance of patience in domesticating ducks, as they can take some time to get used to their new environment and to start laying eggs. He also provides advice on how to protect the ducks from predators such as foxes, hawks, and owls.Overall, Columella's approach to domesticating ducks is thorough and practical, emphasizing the importance of providing the right environment, diet, and protection in order to successfully raise and breed ducks.
