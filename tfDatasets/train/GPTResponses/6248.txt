The microorganism that can notably absorb a very high concentrate of uranium is called Deinococcus radiodurans. It is a extremophilic bacteria known for its high resistance to radiation and ability to survive in harsh environments. It has the ability to absorb and accumulate high levels of uranium without being harmed. This bacterium has potential applications in bioremediation of uranium-contaminated soil and water.
