Serbian and Croatian are often treated as distinct languages because of the political and cultural differences that emerged in the 1990s. While they are both Slavic languages, they have different literary traditions and spelling systems, as well as some differences in grammar and vocabulary. Serbian uses the Cyrillic alphabet, while Croatian uses both the Latin and Cyrillic scripts. Additionally, there are some political sensitivities surrounding the issue, as the two languages were often used as markers of national identity during the conflicts of the 1990s.
