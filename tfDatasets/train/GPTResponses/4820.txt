The view that identity is based on a political choice of characteristics is rooted in the social constructionist theory. This theory posits that identity is not innate, fixed, or universal but rather emerges through social interactions and language within a particular cultural context. According to this theory, the characteristics that define an individual's identity are not inherent or objectively determined but rather socially constructed and negotiated. Therefore, identities are not natural or predetermined, but rather reflect the political and social choices that individuals make in response to their environment.
