When a new and deadly disease is introduced into an ecosystem, it can have devastating effects on various types of species. Here are some examples:1. Endangered species: Many endangered species are more susceptible to disease because of their small population sizes and weakened genetic diversity.2. Native species: Native species that have evolved in isolation may have no resistance to the new disease and can quickly be wiped out.3. Keystone species: These are species that have a large impact on the ecosystem and their loss can have ripple effects.4. Invasive species: Invasive species can be particularly vulnerable to diseases as they often lack natural predators or diseases in their new environments.5. Host species: The species that are infected by the new pathogen could also decline or disappear.Overall, any species can be affected by a new disease depending on their ecology, evolutionary history, and previous exposure to the pathogen.
