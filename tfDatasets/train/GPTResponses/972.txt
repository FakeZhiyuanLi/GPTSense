Larger mutations can be caused by several factors including:1. Chromosomal abnormalities: Changes in the number or structure of chromosomes can lead to larger mutations. For example, an extra copy of a chromosome can cause conditions such as Down syndrome.2. Transposable elements: These are DNA fragments that can move from one location to another on the genome. When they insert in the middle of a gene, they can disrupt its function, leading to larger mutations.3. Exposure to radiation: High-energy radiation such as X-rays or gamma rays can cause severe damage to DNA, leading to larger mutations.4. Exposure to chemicals: Chemicals such as certain pesticides or industrial chemicals can damage DNA, leading to larger mutations.5. Errors during DNA replication: Mistakes made during the replication of DNA can lead to larger mutations, such as deletions or duplications of large segments of DNA.6. Viral infections: Some viruses can cause large-scale changes in the host's genome, leading to larger mutations.
