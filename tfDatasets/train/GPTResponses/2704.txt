According to a misconception, the rise of Christianity destroyed classical education and learning in general. This is a common view among some scholars and historians who believe that the Christian Church's emphasis on faith and dogma led to a decline in intellectual and academic pursuits. However, this view is not entirely accurate, as the Christian Church played a significant role in preserving and promoting classical learning during the medieval period. In fact, many important works of literature, philosophy, and science were translated and preserved by Christian scholars and monks during this time.
