The self-equated with the Buddha is the concept of "anatta" or "non-self." In Buddhism, the Buddha taught that there is no permanent, unchanging, and independent self or soul. The self is seen as a constantly changing entity that is dependent on various causes and conditions. Therefore, the Buddha's self is not identified with any fixed or essential identity but is seen as inherently empty and lacking inherent existence.
