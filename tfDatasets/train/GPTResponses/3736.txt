The nervous system is related to emotion's physiology. Specifically, emotions are regulated by the limbic system, which is a network of structures in the brain associated with emotional processing and regulation. The autonomic nervous system, which controls bodily functions such as heart rate and breathing, also plays a role in emotional responses.
