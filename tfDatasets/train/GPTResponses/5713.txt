Subsidiary forts were established to stop or prevent attacks by hostile indigenous peoples, primarily Native Americans, on the European colonies and trading posts in North America during the colonial period. These forts were built strategically along important trade routes and near key resources such as rivers and mines, and were usually staffed by soldiers or militia. The subsidiary forts were part of a larger network of military defenses that were intended to secure the colonial frontier and protect the interests of the European powers.
