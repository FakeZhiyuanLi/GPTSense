At 6 to 9 months, an infant's immune system begins to respond to a wide range of proteins, including those found in different types of food, bacteria, viruses, and other foreign substances. This is a critical period for the development of the immune system, as it is learning to distinguish between harmless and harmful proteins and to mount appropriate responses to pathogens while tolerating non-pathogenic substances. The introduction of solid foods during this time also plays a crucial role in shaping the infant's immune system, as it exposes them to a variety of new proteins and helps to build immunity.
