This is called the "delegation doctrine" or "delegation of regulatory authority" and is based on the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which reserves powers not delegated to the federal government to the states. It allows Congress to delegate some regulatory authority to the states, as long as there is some federal oversight to ensure that state regulations are sufficient.
