The diet of cultivated ducks generally consists of a balanced commercial feed that is fortified with essential vitamins and minerals. The feed is usually made up of grains like corn, wheat, and barley, as well as soybean meal and fish meal. Ducks may also have access to fresh water for drinking and swimming. Some duck farmers may offer additional supplements, like corn or wheat bran, for added nutrition or as a treat. It is important to note that the diet of ducks may vary depending on their stage of growth and individual nutritional needs.
