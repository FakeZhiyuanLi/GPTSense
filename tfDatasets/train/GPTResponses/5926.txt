There is no one specific study that has definitively found that most homosexual people have different degrees of gender issues. However, there is research that suggests a correlation between non-heterosexual orientation and gender nonconformity, which is the extent to which an individual's gender expression deviates from societal norms. This research has been conducted by numerous researchers and organizations. Some notable studies include those conducted by the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, and the American Psychological Association.
