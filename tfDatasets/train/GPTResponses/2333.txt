Assuming a standard audio compression format such as MP3, the compression ratio would depend on the bit rate setting used for encoding. Generally, a bit rate of 128 kbit/s would correspond to a compression ratio of approximately 10:1, meaning that the original audio data is compressed by a factor of 10 before being transmitted over the internet. However, it's worth noting that compression ratio can vary depending on the specific settings and algorithms used for encoding, as well as the characteristics of the audio being compressed.
