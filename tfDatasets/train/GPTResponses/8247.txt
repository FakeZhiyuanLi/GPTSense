Wallace believed that patterns in the distribution of species could be explained through the process of evolution by natural selection. He observed that species were not distributed randomly across the globe but instead were found in certain geographical locations that suited their particular adaptations and ecological requirements.Wallace proposed that species had evolved in response to the local environmental conditions, and that over time, those that were best adapted to their particular habitats would survive and reproduce more successfully, passing on their advantageous traits to their offspring. As a result, different species would emerge in different parts of the world based on the unique environmental pressures present in each location.Wallace's theory of natural selection, which he developed independently of Charles Darwin, helped to explain the observed patterns in the distribution of species and provided a scientific basis for understanding the diversity of life on Earth.
