The high cost of research and development in the pharmaceutical industry was argued to be holding back new knowledge for treating diseases. Additionally, a lack of incentives for companies to invest in research for rare diseases or diseases affecting underprivileged populations also played a role. Patent protections for drugs also allowed companies to charge high prices, making medications unaffordable for many patients. These factors often result in a limited focus on developing new treatments for diseases that are not profitable, limiting innovation in the field of medicine.
