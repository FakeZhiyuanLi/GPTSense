Gothic buildings usually have their exteriors richly decorated with arcading or sculpture, particularly the portals, facades, and clerestory windows. The pinnacles, spires, and flying buttresses also have intricate sculptural details. The interiors of Gothic buildings also feature ornate columns, arches, and ribbed vaults, as well as stained glass windows and intricate carved details on the wall surfaces.
