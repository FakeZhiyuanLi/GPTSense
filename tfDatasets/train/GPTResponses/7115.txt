Chloroplasts are believed to be descended from ancient photosynthetic bacteria called cyanobacteria, which were engulfed by eukaryotic cells through a process called endosymbiosis. This process resulted in the formation of a symbiotic relationship between the two organisms, as the host cell provided protection and nutrients while the cyanobacteria provided photosynthetic capabilities. Over time, the cyanobacteria evolved into specialized organelles known as chloroplasts, which are responsible for the process of photosynthesis in plant and algal cells.
