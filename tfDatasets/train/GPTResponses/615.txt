The branch of anthropology that studies human behavior and the relation between primates is known as primatology. Primatology is a subfield of physical anthropology, and it focuses on the study of non-human primates and their anatomy, behavior, genetics, evolution, and ecology. This field is important because it helps us better understand our own evolutionary history and the similarities and differences between humans and non-human primates.
