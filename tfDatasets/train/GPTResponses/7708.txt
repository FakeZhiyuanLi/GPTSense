The MVA85A vaccine was developed using a genetically modified virus called Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA). MVA is a strain of the vaccinia virus, which is related to smallpox, but has been genetically altered so that it cannot replicate in human cells. This virus was used as a vector, or delivery system, for a specific antigen from the bacterium that causes tuberculosis (TB).
