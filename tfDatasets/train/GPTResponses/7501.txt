John Rawls published several influential works on political philosophy, including A Theory of Justice (1971), Political Liberalism (1993), The Law of Peoples (1999), and Justice as Fairness: A Restatement (2001). These works explore his ideas on social contract theory, distributive justice, and the role of the government in ensuring equal opportunities and outcomes for all members of society. A Theory of Justice is considered one of the most important works in political philosophy and has had a significant impact on discussions of justice and fairness in contemporary political discourse.
