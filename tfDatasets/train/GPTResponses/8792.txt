There are many companies that have promoted the integration of black workers alongside white workers, so it is difficult to attribute this to just one company. However, some notable examples include IBM, which actively recruited black employees in the 1960s and also created opportunities for them to advance into management positions. General Electric also implemented a number of diversity initiatives in the 1960s, including promoting black employees into executive-level positions. Other companies that were pioneers in the promotion of black workers include Xerox, Ford, and Coca-Cola.
