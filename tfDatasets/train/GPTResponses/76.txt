Colonialism as a policy is caused by financial and political reasons.Financial reasons include the desire for new markets for goods, as well as raw materials and resources. Colonial powers sought to obtain access to new markets to sell their goods and to secure sources of cheap labor and resources.Political reasons include the pursuit of power and prestige. Colonial powers often sought to expand their influence and authority in order to maintain their status as a major power in the world. Additionally, colonialism was often used as a means of spreading cultural and social values, including religion and language.There were also ideological reasons for colonialism. Many colonizing powers believed that they had a duty to "civilize" and "modernize" the peoples they colonized, and saw themselves as bringing progress and enlightenment to the rest of the world.
