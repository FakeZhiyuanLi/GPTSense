The exact origins of Freemasonry are unclear and debated by scholars. However, it is generally agreed that the organization arose from the stonemason guilds of medieval Europe. The earliest documented evidence of Freemasonry dates back to the late 16th or early 17th century in Scotland and England. Over time, Freemasonry evolved from a social and fraternal organization for operative stonemasons to a philosophical and charitable organization for men of all trades and professions. Today, Freemasonry has a global presence with lodges in many countries around the world.
