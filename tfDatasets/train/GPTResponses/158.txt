There is a wide spectrum of beliefs and practices between fundamentalist Islamism and reformist Islamism. Fundamentalist Islamism advocates for a strict interpretation and implementation of Islamic law and traditions, often seeking to establish an Islamic state and imposing their beliefs on others. Reformist Islamism, on the other hand, seeks to reinterpret and modernize Islamic teachings, often advocating for more democratic and egalitarian practices within Muslim societies. Some also seek to separate religion from politics and promote individual freedom and human rights. In between these two extremes, there are varying degrees of conservatism, liberalism, and moderate beliefs and practices.
