There are several other cell types that are involved in the changing of airways. These include:1. Smooth muscle cells: These cells are found in the walls of airways and can contract or relax, causing changes in airway diameter.2. Goblet cells: These cells produce and secrete mucus, which can narrow airways and make it difficult to breathe.3. Mast cells: These cells play a role in allergic reactions, releasing histamine and other inflammatory chemicals that can cause airway constriction.4. Epithelial cells: These cells line the airways and play a role in protecting the lungs from harmful pathogens and irritants.5. Macrophages: These immune cells help to clear out debris and pathogens that may be causing inflammation in the airways.6. T cells: These immune cells play a role in regulating the immune response in the airways and can contribute to asthma and other respiratory diseases if they become overactive.
