USB data is transmitted through a combination of electrical signals and digital signals. The USB cable carries four wires, two of which are used for power (positive and negative) and two for data communication (data transmit and data receive).When a device is plugged in, it establishes communication with the USB host controller by sending a signal through the data transmit wire. The host controller then sends a signal back through the data receive wire to confirm that communication has been established.Data is then transmitted using a protocol called USB protocol, which involves a series of digital signals to represent the data being transferred. The speed at which data can be transferred depends on the version of USB being used, with the latest USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 capable of speeds up to 20 Gbps.Overall, USB data transmission involves a combination of electrical and digital signals to enable devices to communicate with one another and transfer data at high speeds.
