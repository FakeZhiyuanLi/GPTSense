Dunlin (Calidris alpina) are migratory birds that breed in the Arctic tundra and winter in coastal areas around the world, including North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. Some populations travel as far as 8,000 km (5,000 mi) to reach their wintering grounds. The exact migration route and destination vary depending on the population group.
