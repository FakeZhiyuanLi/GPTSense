In 2009, Kanye West launched his clothing line called "DW by Kanye West," which stood for "Kanye West by Dirk Sch√∂nberger and Scott Wilson." The line showcased at Paris Fashion Week, but received mixed reviews from critics. It was reported that the line was not as successful financially as it was creatively. Eventually, the line was discontinued and Kanye shifted his focus to other fashion collaborations and partnerships.
