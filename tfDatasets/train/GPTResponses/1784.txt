An engineered wood product is held together by a variety of bonding agents and techniques that depend on the specific type of product. Here are some common examples:1. Plywood: layers of thin wood veneers are bonded together with glue and pressure.2. Oriented strand board (OSB): large wood strands are arranged in layers and bonded with resin and wax.3. Particleboard: tiny wood particles or chips are compressed and bonded together with resin.4. MDF (medium-density fiberboard): finely ground wood fibers are mixed with resin and pressed into sheets.5. Glulam (glue-laminated timber): layers of solid wood are glued together to form beams, columns, and other structural members.Overall, the bonding agents used in engineered wood products are designed for maximum strength and durability, and are precisely formulated for each type of product.
