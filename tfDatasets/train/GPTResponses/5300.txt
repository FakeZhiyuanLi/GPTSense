The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 regulates the manufacturing and distribution of food, drugs, and cosmetics in the United States. One of the main things the act does is require that drugs be tested for safety and efficacy before they can be marketed to consumers. It also established the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which oversees the implementation and enforcement of the law.
