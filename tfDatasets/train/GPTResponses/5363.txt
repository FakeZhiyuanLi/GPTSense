they seemHokkien is a Chinese dialect that is spoken by millions of people in Taiwan, China, and Southeast Asia. One of the interesting things about Hokkien is that its morphemes (the smallest units of meaning in a language) are not always what they appear to be. The meanings of Hokkien words can change drastically depending on the way they are combined with other morphemes.For example, the Hokkien word "tong" can mean "together" or "same", but when it is combined with other morphemes, its meaning changes. "Tong4xin1" (同心) means "together in heart", "Tong4guo4" (通過) means "to pass through", and "Tong4yi4" (同意) means "to agree". Similarly, the Hokkien word "ban" can mean "half" or "to handle", but when it is combined with other morphemes, its meaning changes. "Ban3kia3" (半夜) means "midnight", "Ban1zi3" (辦事) means "to handle affairs", and "Ban2ga2" (板嘎) means "to play music with wooden clappers".The complexity of Hokkien morphemes can make learning the language challenging, but it also makes the language rich and interesting.
