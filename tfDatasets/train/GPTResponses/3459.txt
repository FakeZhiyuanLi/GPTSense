Portugal's Carnation Revolution, a peaceful and democratic coup d'etat in 1974, brought an end to Portugal's colonial empire and colonial wars in Africa. This included Guinea-Bissau, which had been a Portuguese colony for over 400 years. The new Portuguese government recognized Guinea-Bissau's independence in September 1974, and the country became fully independent the following year.
