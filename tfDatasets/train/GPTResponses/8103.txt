Sichuan saw some communist activity because it was an important strategic location in China, with a large population, abundant natural resources and a key transportation hub. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) recognized the potential of Sichuan and began to increase its influence through propaganda and organizing peasant and worker movements. Additionally, Sichuan was also affected by the political and economic turmoil in China during the early 20th century, with issues such as corruption, inflation, and poverty that fueled social unrest and provided fertile ground for the CCP's message to resonate with the people.
