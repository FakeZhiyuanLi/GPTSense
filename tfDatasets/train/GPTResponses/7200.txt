The goal of plant ecology is to understand the interactions between plants and their environment, including other plants, animals, and abiotic factors like temperature, water, and light. This understanding can help inform conservation efforts, agriculture, and land management decisions. Plant ecologists seek to understand the processes that drive plant distribution, abundance, growth, and evolution, as well as the ways in which plants influence the ecosystem and the broader biosphere. Ultimately, the goal of plant ecology is to promote sustainable coexistence between humans and the natural world by informing policies and practices that minimize ecological harm and preserve the diversity and resilience of plant communities.
