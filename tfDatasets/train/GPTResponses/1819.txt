The first areas colonized by the Portuguese were the Madeira Islands (1419–1420) and the Azores (1427–1452) in the Atlantic Ocean. They also established trading posts and forts along the coast of Africa in the 15th century, including at Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe, and Angola. In 1498, Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama reached India, which led to the establishment of Portuguese colonies in Goa, Daman, and Diu. Later, they also established colonies in Brazil, Mozambique, Macau, and Timor.
