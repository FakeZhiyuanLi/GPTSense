Alpine plants are typically grouped based on their growing conditions and adaptations to high altitude environments. Some common groupings include:1. Cushion plants: These are low-growing, mat-forming plants that form tight clusters of small leaves to protect themselves from harsh winds and cold temperatures.2. Rosette plants: These are plants that grow in a circular formation, with leaves radiating out from a central point. They are often found in rock crevices and other areas with limited soil.3. Tussock plants: These are tall, grass-like plants that form dense clumps of leaves and stems. They often have deep roots that help them absorb moisture and nutrients from the soil.4. Dwarf shrubs: These are small, woody plants that grow low to the ground and have dense, compact foliage. They are well-adapted to harsh alpine conditions and can thrive in rocky, well-drained soil.5. Herbaceous perennials: These are flowering plants that die back to the ground each winter, but re-sprout in the spring. They often have deep taproots and are able to survive drought and cold temperatures.
