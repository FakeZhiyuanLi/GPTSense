According to Buddhist texts, the first thing Gautama did on his spiritual quest was leave his privileged life as a prince and venture out into the world to seek enlightenment. He first sought guidance from two prominent spiritual teachers who taught him meditation techniques and philosophical concepts. However, he ultimately found their teachings lacking and continued on his own spiritual journey.
