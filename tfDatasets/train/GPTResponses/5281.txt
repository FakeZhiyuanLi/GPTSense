Mary's diminished role in Protestantism can be traced back to the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, which rejected many of the Catholic Church's teachings and practices, including the veneration of Mary as a co-redeemer with Christ and the idea of praying to her as an intercessor.Protestants believe that salvation comes through faith in Christ alone and that Mary, while highly revered for her role in giving birth to Jesus, is not necessary for salvation. In fact, some Protestant denominations do not even recognize the perpetual virginity of Mary or her assumption into heaven.Additionally, the Protestant Reformation saw a rejection of many Catholic traditions and ceremonies, including the veneration of saints like Mary. As a result, Mary's role in Protestantism became increasingly diminished and focused primarily on her historical role as the mother of Jesus, rather than as a divine intercessor.Overall, the basis for Mary's diminished role in Protestantism is rooted in the rejection of Catholic teachings and practices during the Protestant Reformation, which shifted the focus of Christianity towards a more individualistic and faith-based approach to salvation.
