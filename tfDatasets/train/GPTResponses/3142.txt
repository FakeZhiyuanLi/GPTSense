The evidence of the stubs of the limbs a tree loses can always be seen in the wood in the form of knots or growth rings. Knotted areas on a tree trunk or branch are the remnants of the tree's branches, which have fallen off or been pruned. As the tree grows, layers of new wood are added around the remnants of the old branches, forming the growth rings. The size, shape, and number of knots can give clues to the age, health, and history of the tree.
