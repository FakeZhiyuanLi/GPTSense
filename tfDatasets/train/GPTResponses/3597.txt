ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is based on a 7-bit code that assigns unique numeric values to 128 different characters, including letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and control characters. It was originally developed in the 1960s for encoding characters used in telegraphs and was later widely adopted for use in computers and other electronic devices. ASCII has since been extended to include additional characters and is now an 8-bit code known as ASCII-8 or Extended ASCII.
