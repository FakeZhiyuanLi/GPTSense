If dendrochronology cannot be used to date wood, scientists may employ radiocarbon dating, also known as carbon-14 dating. This method relies on the half-life of carbon-14, a radioactive isotope of carbon, to determine the age of organic materials such as wood. By measuring the amount of carbon-14 remaining in the sample and comparing it to the initial amount of carbon-14 in the atmosphere, scientists can estimate the age of the wood. Other methods that may be used include thermoluminescence dating and optically stimulated luminescence dating.
