The three main characters involved in a love triangle are typically two individuals who are romantically interested in the same person. This can include any combination of genders and sexual orientations. Additionally, the third person could be a close friend, a former lover returning to rekindle their relationship, or even a stranger who enters the picture and shakes things up.
