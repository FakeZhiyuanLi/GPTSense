Later on, it was realized that natural selection was not the only mechanism driving evolution, and neo-Lamarckism was embraced as an additional way to explain certain evolutionary changes. This was particularly true in the early 20th century, when genetic mechanisms were not yet fully understood and some observed traits seemed to be inherited in ways that could not be explained by traditional natural selection. Lamarckian ideas were also appealing to many because they emphasized the role of an organism's own efforts and desires, rather than simply being at the mercy of their environment. However, as more research was conducted and genetic and molecular mechanisms were discovered, the limitations of neo-Lamarckism became increasingly clear and it is now largely supplanted by a more nuanced understanding of the evolutionary process.
