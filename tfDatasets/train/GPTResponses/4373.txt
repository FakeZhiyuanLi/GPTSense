Adolescence is defined biologically as the period of transition between childhood and adulthood that is marked by rapid physical, cognitive, and emotional development. It typically begins with the onset of puberty, when hormonal changes in the body trigger physical changes such as the growth of pubic hair and breasts, the deepening of the voice, and the onset of menstruation. These physical changes are accompanied by changes in cognitive and emotional development, including increased self-awareness, the development of critical thinking skills, and the emergence of more complex emotional responses. Biologically, adolescence is characterized by a period of intense brain development and increased sensitivity to environmental stimuli, which can contribute to changes in behavior and the formation of new social relationships.
