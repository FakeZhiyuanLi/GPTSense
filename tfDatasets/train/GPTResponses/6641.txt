The pointed arch is often associated with Gothic architecture and is known for creating a more vertical and grandiose visual character. It gives the impression of height, upward movement, and grandeur. The pointed arch also creates a sense of elegance and sophistication in the overall appearance of a structure. This type of visual character is commonly found in medieval churches, cathedrals, and other Gothic-style buildings.
