The manner of DNA storage on the histone and the chemical modifications of the histone itself regulate gene expression. The DNA is wrapped around histone proteins to form chromatin, and the way in which the DNA is packed can affect how readily the genes in that region can be accessed and transcribed. Chemical modifications of the histone proteins, such as acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation, can also affect gene expression by altering the structure of the chromatin and making genes more or less accessible to transcription machinery. Thus, the manner of DNA storage on the histone and its chemical modifications can impact the regulation of genes and ultimately influence cellular function and development.
