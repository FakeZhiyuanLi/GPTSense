Incandescent lamps are very close to pure resistive loads. They have a filament made of a resistance wire that heats up and emits light when an electric current passes through it. The resistance wire is chosen to have a high resistance value so that it gets hot enough to produce light. Because the filament is made of a resistive material, it has a linear relationship between voltage and current, meaning that the lamp behaves like a pure resistor. However, there is still some reactive component due to the inductance of the filament, but it is very minimal. Therefore, incandescent lamps can be considered as nearly pure resistive loads.
