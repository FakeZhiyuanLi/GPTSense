The Gregorian calendar is a solar calendar, which means it is based on the length of time it takes for the Earth to orbit the sun. It was introduced by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582 as a reform of the Julian calendar, which had been in use since 45 BC. The Gregorian calendar is now the most widely used calendar in the world and its adoption is globally accepted as the standard for civil and international purposes.
