An active solar technique uses mechanical and electrical devices, such as solar panels and pumps, to convert sunlight into usable energy (thermal or electrical). These systems are designed to capture, store and distribute solar energy in various ways. For example, solar water heating systems use collectors to absorb sunlight, which then heats water that is circulated through pipes to provide hot water for domestic use. Photovoltaic (PV) solar panels use silicon cells to convert sunlight into electricity, which can be used to power homes, buildings, and appliances. Active solar techniques help to reduce reliance on grid-supplied energy, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and conserve natural resources.
