Jewish lawHaredi Judaism and Modern Orthodox Judaism disagree about the application of Jewish law, particularly regarding the interpretation and implementation of Halakha (Jewish law). Haredi Judaism adheres to a strict interpretation of Halakha, emphasizing separation from secular society, strict observance of religious practices, and adherence to traditional gender roles. They generally view secular culture and secular ideas as threats to Jewish identity and religious observance.In contrast, Modern Orthodox Judaism is more willing to incorporate aspects of contemporary culture and ideas while maintaining strict adherence to Halakha. They believe that Jewish law should be a guide for ethical and moral behavior in all areas of life, including the modern world. Modern Orthodox Jews often seek to balance their religious observance with active engagement with secular society and the pursuit of higher education and professional careers.Overall, the main disagreement between these two groups is the level of strictness and openness they have to outside influences in their interpretation and implementation of Jewish law.
