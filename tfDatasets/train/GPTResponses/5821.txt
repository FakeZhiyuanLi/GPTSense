Eritrea was chosen by the Italian government to be a colony during the Italian Empire. The Italians colonized Eritrea in the late 1800s and officially declared it a colony in 1890. They occupied the land and imposed their rule over the local people, exploiting resources and enforcing their culture and language upon the native population. The Italian Empire also included other territories in Africa, including Ethiopia and Somalia. However, Eritrea maintained its status as an Italian colony until the end of World War II, after which it became part of Ethiopia before gaining its independence in 1993.
