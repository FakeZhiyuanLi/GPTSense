Prussia had been discovered building forts and military installations around big north German ports. This was a part of Prussia's plan to secure its borders and protect itself from naval attacks by hostile powers. The construction of these forts also reflected Prussia's growing power and ambition in the region. By establishing a strong military presence in key strategic locations, Prussia was able to exert greater influence over neighboring countries and assert its dominance in north Germany.
