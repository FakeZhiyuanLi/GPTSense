Long distance migrants generally disperse after they reach their breeding or wintering grounds. For example, birds such as the Arctic Tern may disperse over long distances to find suitable breeding grounds after they arrive in the Arctic. Similarly, some whales and sea turtles may disperse over long distances to find suitable feeding or breeding grounds after reaching their wintering grounds. Dispersal allows long distance migrants to find suitable habitats where they can successfully reproduce, feed, and survive.
