The Kuomintang did not defeat and take over Beijing. The Kuomintang led by Chiang Kai-shek fought against the Communist Party of China led by Mao Zedong for control of China in a civil war that lasted from 1927 to 1949. In 1949, the Communist Party declared victory and established the People's Republic of China with Beijing as its capital. The Kuomintang retreated to Taiwan and continued to claim to be the legitimate government of China.
