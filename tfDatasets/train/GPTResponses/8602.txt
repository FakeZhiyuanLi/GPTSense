As an evolutionary biologist, Darwin hoped to find more evidence of fossils and geologic formations that would support his theory of evolution by natural selection. He wanted to find transitional fossils that would provide a gradual record of the development of species over time, which was crucial in confirming his theory. He also hoped to find more geological evidence of gradual changes in the earthâ€™s surface, and how these changes impacted the development and distribution of life on earth. Overall, Darwin hoped to find more evidence that supported his theory of evolution and the idea that all life on earth is interrelated and interconnected.
