Night vision devices use various technologies, depending on the type of device, but the most common technology used is image intensification. Image intensification works by collecting the available light from the environment, amplifying it, and converting it into an image that the human eye can see. Other technologies used in night vision devices include thermal imaging, which detects heat emitted by objects, and active infrared imaging, which uses an IR source to illuminate the area being viewed.
