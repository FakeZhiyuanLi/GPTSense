There is no single answer to this question, as American Baptist congregations have split for a variety of reasons over the years. Some of the main factors that have led to splits within American Baptist churches include theological differences, disagreements over governance and leadership, disputes over worship styles and practices, and tensions related to social and political issues such as race, gender, and sexuality. In some cases, these splits have been resolved through negotiation and compromise, while in other cases they have resulted in permanent divisions within the denomination.
