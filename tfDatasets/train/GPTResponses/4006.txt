perceived even if the fundamental frequency is not present in the sound signal. This is due to the phenomenon of harmonic frequencies and the way our brain processes sound information. Essentially, the brain 'fills in the gaps' in the harmonic series and creates a perceived fundamental frequency that is not actually present in the sound. This perception can be exploited in music production and audio engineering to create a fuller, richer sound without using the actual fundamental frequency of a sound source.
