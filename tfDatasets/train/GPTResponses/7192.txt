Clothing can keep toxic materials away from the skin, which is our body's largest organ and a primary pathway for the absorption of toxins. It can also prevent inhalation or ingestion of harmful substances that may be present in the environment. Additionally, protective clothing may be worn by workers in various industries to reduce their risk of exposure to hazardous materials during work activities.
