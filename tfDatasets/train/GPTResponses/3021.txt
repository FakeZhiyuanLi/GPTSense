Population density is another variable that can affect how much electricity an area uses. Higher population density generally leads to higher electricity consumption due to increased demand for lighting, heating, cooling, and electronic devices. Urban areas with large populations and high-rise buildings may consume more electricity than rural areas with dispersed populations and single-family homes.
