It depends on the specific context and time period.In ancient civilizations, such as Egypt and Mesopotamia, scribes were responsible for recording information and maintaining written records, including religious texts and ideological propaganda.During the Middle Ages in Europe, monks and clergy were often responsible for copying and preserving important documents, including religious texts, as well as producing illuminated manuscripts that conveyed religious and ideological messages.In modern times, governments, political parties, and media outlets may be responsible for disseminating ideological messages through written records, such as manifestos, speeches, and propaganda materials.
