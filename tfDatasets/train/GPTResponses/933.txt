Young trees generally grow more quickly in open stands with lots of sunlight, as they have more access to resources like light and nutrients compared to trees in a closed forest. In a closed forest, mature trees and dense underbrush can block out sunlight, limit soil nutrients, and restrict airflow, which can slow down the growth of young trees. However, some species of trees may prefer the shaded conditions of a closed forest and may grow better in those environments. Overall, the growth rate of young trees will depend on a variety of factors, including species, age, size, and environmental conditions.
