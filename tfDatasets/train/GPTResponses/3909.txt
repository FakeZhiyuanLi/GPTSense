A cyber incident response plan (CIRP) outlines the responsibilities and provides a plan for coordination during a cyber incident. The CIRP details strategies and procedures that will be followed in the event of a security breach. The plan should include key personnel and their roles and responsibilities, how to identify and classify incidents, incident response procedures, communications protocols, escalation procedures, and post-incident analysis and reporting. The CIRP should be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure it remains effective and relevant in the face of evolving cyber threats.
