The role of prime minister did not officially exist during the reign of Henry VIII. However, a prominent adviser known as the Lord Chancellor held a position of great power and influence in government. Thomas Wolsey was the Lord Chancellor during much of Henry VIII's early reign and was considered the dominant figure in government until he fell from favor in 1529. After Wolsey's fall, Thomas Cromwell emerged as Henry VIII's chief minister until his execution in 1540.
