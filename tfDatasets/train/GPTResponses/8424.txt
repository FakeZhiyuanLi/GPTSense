Darwin describes the struggle for existence within a population as being similar to a battle or competition. It is a struggle for limited resources, such as food, water, and shelter. In this battle, only the strongest, most adaptable, and most well-suited individuals survive and reproduce, passing on their favorable traits to their offspring. This process of natural selection ultimately leads to the development of new species and the extinction of others.
