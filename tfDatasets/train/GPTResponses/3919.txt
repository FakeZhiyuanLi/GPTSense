Gram-negative bacteria can also release material through outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). These are small, spherical structures that bud off from the outer membrane of the bacteria and contain various molecules such as lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. OMVs have been observed in many Gram-negative bacterial species and have been shown to play a role in intercellular communication, virulence, and antibiotic resistance. OMVs can also act as delivery vehicles for bacterial toxins, enabling them to reach host cells and cause damage.
