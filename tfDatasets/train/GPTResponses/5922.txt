The British and Americans wanted to cede most of Eritrea to the Ethiopians because they believed it would help to maintain stability and security in the region. Ethiopia was seen as a bulwark against Soviet-backed liberation movements in neighboring countries, and the United States and Britain saw it as an important ally in the Cold War. Additionally, the Ethiopians had historical and cultural ties to Eritrea, and there were concerns that an independent Eritrea could destabilize the region by fomenting secessionist movements in neighboring countries.
