The basis of inheritance of phenotypic traits is the genetic material called DNA. DNA provides the instructions for the development and maintenance of an organism's traits, including its physical characteristics, behaviors, and other traits that can be observed. DNA molecules consist of sequences of four different nucleotides (adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine) that code for specific proteins. These proteins control the expression of genes, which are segments of DNA that determine an organism's traits. Inheritance occurs when genetic material is passed down from parents to their offspring through the transmission of DNA. The precise details of how traits are inherited depend on the specific genes involved and the mode of inheritance of those genes.
