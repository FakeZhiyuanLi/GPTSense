The first written mention of immunity as it pertains to the body can be traced back to Ancient Greece, where the concept of "immunity" (immunitas) was used in legal and political contexts to refer to exemption from taxes or duties. However, the modern understanding of immunity in the medical context began to emerge in the 18th century with the pioneering work of physicians like Edward Jenner and Louis Pasteur on vaccination and disease prevention.
