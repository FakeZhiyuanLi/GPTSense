Early Chinese mathematicians used a combination of counting rods, written characters, and the abacus to perform mathematical calculations. The counting rods were used to represent numbers and perform arithmetic operations, while written characters were used to document these calculations. The abacus was used to perform more complex calculations, such as multiplication and division. The abacus was also used to perform calculations involving fractions and was a key tool in the development of Chinese mathematics. Overall, the early Chinese mathematicians employed a practical and pragmatic approach to mathematics, using only the tools and methods that were readily available to them.
