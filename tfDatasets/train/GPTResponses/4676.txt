Almost all carriers using conventional aircraft have arrested-recovery systems because these systems provide a safe and effective way to stop an aircraft on a short runway or a floating platform. The arrested-recovery system uses a cable that is stretched across the runway or platform. As the aircraft lands, a hook on the aircraft catches the cable, which slows down the aircraft and brings it to a stop. This system is particularly important for naval aircraft carriers, which have limited runway lengths and require a safe and efficient way to land and stop aircraft.
