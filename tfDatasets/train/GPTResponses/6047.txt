Before beginning human trials, a company or organization must file an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This filing provides the FDA with information about the safety and efficacy of the drug or treatment being tested, as well as details about the proposed clinical trial plan. The FDA reviews the IND application and must approve it before the company can begin human clinical trials.
