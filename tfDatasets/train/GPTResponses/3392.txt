There are different theories regarding how Virgil earned the nickname "Parthenias" or "Maiden." One theory is that it came from his association with the goddess Athena, who was also known as "Parthenos" or "Maiden." Another theory is that it was related to his physical appearance, as he was said to have been slender and delicate-looking, resembling a young girl or maiden. Additionally, some suggest that the nickname was given due to Virgil's chastity and dedication to a life of celibacy.
