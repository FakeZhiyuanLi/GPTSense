The process that causes changes in plant cells is called growth and development. This includes cell division, differentiation, and elongation, which lead to changes in size, shape, and function of the plant cells. Environmental factors such as light, temperature, humidity, and nutrients also play a significant role in the development of plant cells. Additionally, plant hormones play an essential role in regulating different physiological processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and response to stimuli, which contribute to the changes in plant cells.
