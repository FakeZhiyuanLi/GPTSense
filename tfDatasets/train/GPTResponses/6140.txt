Uranium-235 is the form most commonly used as fuel for nuclear reactors. It is a fissile isotope, which means it can sustain a chain reaction of nuclear fission when bombarded by neutrons. Uranium-238 can also be used, but it must first be converted into plutonium-239 through a process called nuclear transmutation.
