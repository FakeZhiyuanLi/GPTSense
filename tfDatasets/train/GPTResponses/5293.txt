The compound that made the diphtheria vaccine safer to use is called formaldehyde. Formaldehyde was added to the diphtheria toxin to create the toxoid that is used in the vaccine. The addition of formaldehyde inactivates the toxin while preserving its ability to stimulate an immune response. This process ensures that the vaccine is effective in preventing diphtheria while minimizing the risk of adverse reactions.
