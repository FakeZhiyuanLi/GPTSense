Yarding is a term used in the poultry industry to refer to the act of keeping birds inside an enclosed area or yard for a period of time. This can be done for a number of reasons, such as protecting the birds from predators, providing them with a consistent source of food and water, or controlling their movement and behavior. Yarding can also be used as a method of managing the spread of disease among birds by isolating infected birds from healthy ones.
