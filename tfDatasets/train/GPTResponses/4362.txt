Wisdom is generally defined as a combination of experience, knowledge, good judgment, and understanding. It is the ability to make sound decisions, the ability to comprehend complex issues, and to apply knowledge to make better choices in life. Wisdom is often characterized by a deep understanding of human nature, an acute awareness of ourselves and our environment, and an ability to appreciate the significance of the nuances of life. It is not just knowledge or intelligence, but a broader and deeper moral, ethical, and spiritual understanding of the world that is developed through experience, reflection, and the pursuit of truth.
