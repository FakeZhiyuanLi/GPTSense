The first noteworthy confrontation between Napoleon and the Archduke Charles was the Battle of Aspern-Essling on May 21-22, 1809. The battle was fought near Vienna and resulted in a tactical victory for the Austrians, although they suffered heavy casualties. Despite the setback, Napoleon ultimately emerged victorious in the subsequent Battle of Wagram in July 1809.
