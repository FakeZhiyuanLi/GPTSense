When copper compounds are treated with organolithium reagents, a copper organometallic compound is formed. The specific compound formed depends on the nature of the organolithium reagent used and the copper compound that it is reacting with. For example, reaction of ethyl lithium with copper iodide results in the formation of ethylcuprate (CuC2H5).
