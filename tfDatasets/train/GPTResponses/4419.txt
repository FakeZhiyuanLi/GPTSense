One area in which peer groups can have a positive influence on an individual is in the development of social skills and relationships. Peer groups can provide opportunities for individuals to learn communication, conflict resolution, and cooperation skills, as well as provide a sense of belonging and support. Additionally, peer relationships can help individuals develop empathy and an understanding of diversity, which can lead to stronger, more inclusive communities.
