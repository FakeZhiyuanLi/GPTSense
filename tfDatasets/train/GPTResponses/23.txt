The Rhine was regulated with an upper canal in the Netherlands, specifically in the city of Nijmegen. The canal was built in the early 20th century to control the flow of the Rhine and prevent flooding in the surrounding areas. It was later expanded and connected to the Waal river, creating a major waterway for shipping and transportation.
