between them?Historically, churches settled the date differences through councils or synods. These were meetings of church leaders from different regions who came together to discuss theological or practical issues affecting the church. In some cases, they would vote on a particular date or practice, and the decision would become binding on all churches under their authority. For example, the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD established the date for celebrating Easter, which is still followed by most Christian churches today.
