Comprehensive schools were introduced in Ireland as part of the Education Act of 1968, which was brought in by the government of the time under Taoiseach Jack Lynch. The act aimed to provide equal educational opportunities for all children, regardless of their social or economic background, and to eliminate the selective system of secondary education.
