is called industrial melanism. This means that their populations have adapted over time to survive in areas with high levels of pollution and industrialization. The darkening of their wings is the most prominent example of this adaptation. In areas with high pollution, the dark color helps the insects blend in with their surroundings and avoid predators. This is different from non-industrial areas where the insects tend to be lighter in color to blend in with trees and other vegetation.
