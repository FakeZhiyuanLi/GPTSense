The first reform concerning the calendar was the Julian calendar, introduced by Julius Caesar in 45 BC. This calendar was a modification of the previous Roman calendar and added an extra day to February every four years to account for the leap year. The Julian calendar was later replaced by the Gregorian calendar in 1582, which made further changes to correct for inaccuracies in the Julian calendar.
