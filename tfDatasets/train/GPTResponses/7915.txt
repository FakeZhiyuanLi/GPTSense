One example of a hormone that is able to control the enzyme delta-5-desaturase is estrogen. Estrogen can increase the activity of delta-5-desaturase in certain tissues, leading to an increase in the production of polyunsaturated fatty acids. This is important for maintaining proper cellular functions, including cell membrane fluidity and signaling pathways.
