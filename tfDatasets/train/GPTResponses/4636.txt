The Imperial Japanese Navy Wakamiya conducted the world's first successful naval air raid on September 22, 1914, during the First World War. The ship launched a seaplane that successfully dropped six bombs on a German-owned radio station in Qingdao, China, marking the first time in history that aircraft were used in a naval attack. This event marked a significant milestone in the history of naval aviation and demonstrated the value of aircraft in naval warfare.
