Tuberculosis (TB) was first discovered in the 19th century, and it was known to be contagious. However, it was not until the early 20th century (1900s) that the bacterial cause of tuberculosis was identified, and it became clear that the disease was primarily transmitted through airborne droplets from infected individuals. The realization of the communicability of TB led to the development of prevention and control measures such as vaccination, improved sanitation, and quarantine of patients.
