Yes, international monitors have been used in the elections of Burma in order to ensure transparency and fairness in the electoral process. In the recent 2020 general elections, for example, the Union Election Commission (UEC) of Myanmar invited a number of international observers from various organizations and countries to monitor the electoral process. These international observers included representatives from the ASEAN, the European Union, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and the Carter Center, among others. The objective of these international monitors is to verify that the electoral process is conducted in accordance with international standards and to offer recommendations for improvement if needed.
