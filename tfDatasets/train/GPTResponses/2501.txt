There are a few conditions under which a single state's withdrawal could result in the termination of a multilateral treaty, including:1. Language in the treaty itself: Some treaties include provisions that allow for automatic termination if a certain number of parties withdraw. For example, the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties states that a treaty will terminate if all parties agree to it or if the number of parties falls below the number required for its entry into force.2. Essential clauses or provisions: Some treaties include essential clauses or provisions that are necessary for their functioning. If a party withdraws from the treaty and that clause or provision is not replaceable, the treaty may no longer be viable.3. The purpose of the treaty: Some treaties are created to address specific issues or achieve certain goals. If a party withdraws and their withdrawal undermines the purpose of the treaty, it may no longer be effective.Overall, the termination of a multilateral treaty due to the withdrawal of a single state will depend on the particular treaty in question and the circumstances surrounding the withdrawal.
