Suillus luteus, commonly known as the slippery jack, is a type of fungus that forms a mutualistic association with pine trees. This fungus helps to protect the pine tree from copper toxicity by colonizing the roots of the tree and forming a mycorrhizal association. This association helps to increase the tree's uptake of essential nutrients while also detoxifying harmful elements such as copper. As a result, the pine tree is better able to withstand environmental stressors and maintain its overall health and vigor.
