The equations used to determine the index of refraction (n) and extinction coefficient (k) depend on the material being tested and the method of measurement.In general, the index of refraction can be determined using Snell's law:n1sinθ1 = n2sinθ2where n1 and n2 are the indices of refraction of the two materials (typically air and the material being tested), θ1 is the angle of incidence of the light ray, and θ2 is the angle of refraction.For materials that have a significant absorption of light (i.e. the extinction coefficient is non-zero), the reflectance and transmittance of light passing through the material can be used to determine the extinction coefficient. This can be done using the following equations:R = (|r|^2)T = (|t|^2)(n2*cosθ2)/(n1*cosθ1)A = 1 - R - Tα = -ln(A) / dwhere R is the reflectance of the material, T is the transmittance of the material, A is the absorbance of the material, α is the extinction coefficient, d is the thickness of the material, n1 and n2 are the indices of refraction of the two materials (typically air and the material being tested), θ1 is the angle of incidence of the light ray, and θ2 is the angle of refraction. The complex refractive index can then be calculated as:n + ik = (1 - R)^0.5 - 1where n is the real part of the refractive index and k is the imaginary part (i.e. the extinction coefficient).
