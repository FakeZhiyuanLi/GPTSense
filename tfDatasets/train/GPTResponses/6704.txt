There are several reasons why luminescent light sources may not be ideal for photography:1. Color Temperature: Luminescent light sources emit light at a different color temperature than natural daylight. This can result in images with unnatural color casts that are difficult to correct in post-processing.2. Difficult to Control: Luminescent light sources can be difficult to control, and the light they emit can be unpredictable. This can make it challenging for photographers to create consistent and reliable lighting setups.3. Flicker: Some types of luminescent light sources, such as fluorescent bulbs, can flicker when they are first turned on or when they are being used in low-light situations. This can result in images with visible banding or other undesirable artifacts.Overall, while luminescent light sources can be convenient and cost-effective, they may not offer the precise control and high-quality light necessary for professional photography.
