Bermuda has never gained full independence from the United Kingdom. While it has a degree of autonomy in its internal affairs under its constitution, the UK is responsible for Bermuda's external affairs, including defense and foreign policy. The strategic location of Bermuda in the Atlantic Ocean has long made it an important military base for the UK and its allies, and this has been a major factor in Bermuda's relationship with the UK. As a result, Bermuda has not sought full independence and has instead maintained its close ties with the UK.
