Following the collapse in the housing bubble, a number of commodity prices experienced a significant decline. This was due to the global financial crisis that ensued, which led to a decline in economic activity and reduced demand for commodities. The decline in demand resulted in an oversupply of commodities, which further put downward pressure on prices. Additionally, the appreciation of the US dollar during this period also contributed to the decline in commodity prices, as most commodities are priced in USD. Some of the commodities that experienced a decline in prices include oil, metals, agricultural products such as corn and wheat, and soft commodities like coffee and cocoa.
