Generally, the care and management of the pyx chamber and chapter house falls under the responsibility of the custodian or caretaker of the particular church or cathedral. In some cases, there may be a specific individual or team designated to oversee the maintenance and use of these spaces. Additionally, the dean or other clergy members of the church or cathedral may have a role in managing the use of the chapter house for meetings and other gatherings.
