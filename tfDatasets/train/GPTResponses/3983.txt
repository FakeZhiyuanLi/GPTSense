The digestion of carbohydrates begins in the mouth with the action of an enzyme called amylase, which breaks down starches into smaller molecules such as glucose. Additionally, the mechanical action of chewing and mixing the saliva with the food begins the process of breaking down food particles into smaller pieces, which aids in the digestion and absorption of nutrients in the gastrointestinal tract.
