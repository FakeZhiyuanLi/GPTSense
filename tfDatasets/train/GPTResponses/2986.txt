The international deal between the US, other countries, and Iran is not a treaty. It is officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and is a multilateral agreement reached in 2015 to limit Iran's nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. The agreement has been controversial, as some have argued that it does not go far enough in restricting Iran's nuclear program and others have objected to the fact that it was not ratified by the US Senate as a treaty.
