Men usually received their coat of arms through inheritance from their family or by obtaining it through a grant or recognition from a heraldic authority. In medieval times, coats of arms were often awarded to knights and other wealthy individuals as a symbol of their status and achievements. The design and colors of the coat of arms were often based on family history, geographic location, or personal preferences.
