Some hard rock bands in the 1980s embraced a more commercial and polished sound, often incorporating elements of pop and metal into their music. This style became known as glam metal or hair metal, characterized by flashy stage costumes, big hair, and a focus on image and theatrics. Examples of bands that embraced this style include Guns N' Roses, Motley Crue, Poison, and Bon Jovi.
