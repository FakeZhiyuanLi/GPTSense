The visible light and ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun are also responsible for heating the Earth. Visible light is absorbed by the Earth's surface, and UV radiation is absorbed by the ozone layer in the atmosphere. Both of these types of radiation transfer their energy into heat, which warms the Earth's surface and atmosphere.
