cam recordings or screen recordings are often available for piracy during the theatrical run of a movie. These recordings are made by someone using a camera or a mobile device to record the movie while it plays on the screen in the cinema. The quality of these recordings is typically poor, with low resolution, poor sound quality, and shaky or obstructed views. Additionally, these recordings often include various other distractions, such as audience members talking or moving around in their seats, which can further detract from the viewing experience. Despite these significant drawbacks, however, cam recordings remain a popular form of piracy for viewers who are unable or unwilling to wait for the release of more high-quality versions of the movie.
