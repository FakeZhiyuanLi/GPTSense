During the last ice age, Scandinavia, the Baltics, Scotland, and the Alps were covered by glaciers and ice sheets. These massive sheets of ice formed as a result of lower global temperatures and expanded over vast areas of land, reshaping the landscape and leaving behind evidence of their presence such as moraines, drumlins, and glacial erratics. This period lasted from approximately 110,000 to 12,000 years ago, with the ice covering reaching its maximum extent about 20,000 years ago.
