The band named after an animal that was inspired by Queen is "Def Leppard". Their lead singer, Joe Elliott, has mentioned in interviews that Queen was a big influence on the band's sound and that they were impressed by Queen's ability to combine different styles of music into their own unique sound. The band's name was inspired by a drawing that Elliott had done of a leopard, which he then modified to include the word "def" to make it sound more aggressive.
