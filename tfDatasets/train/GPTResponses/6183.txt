There is no single answer to this question because the time it takes for a chicken to reach its optimal broiler size depends on many factors, such as the breed of the chicken, the quality of its feed, the availability of clean water, the amount of space it has to move around, and the environmental conditions in which it is raised. On average, however, it can take anywhere from 8 to 14 weeks for a chicken to reach its optimal broiler size. Chickens raised in a less intensive environment may take longer to reach their optimal size because they are not being given growth hormones or antibiotics that are often used in commercial poultry operations. However, their meat is generally considered to be of higher quality because they are able to move around more freely and have a more varied diet.
