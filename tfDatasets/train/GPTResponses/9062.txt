The pastor of the earliest Baptist Church is not known with certainty as there were multiple individuals involved in the formation of the first Baptist church. However, one notable leader was Thomas Helwys who founded the first Baptist congregation in Amsterdam, Netherlands in 1611. John Smyth is also considered a founder of the Baptist movement, having been baptized by immersion and then baptizing others in 1609 in Amsterdam.
