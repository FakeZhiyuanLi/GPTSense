One example of improvisation in an opera is Beverly Sills' variation of the aria "Se piet√† di me non senti" from Handel's Giulio Cesare. In her performance, Sills added trills and embellishments to the aria, showcasing her vocal virtuosity and adding her personal touch to the music. This type of improvisation was common in Baroque opera, as singers were expected to embellish and vary their melodic lines to showcase their skills and individual interpretation of the music.
