In most countries, the power to grant degrees is held by the government or a recognized regulatory body such as a ministry of education or a quality assurance agency. In some cases, this power may also be delegated to a university or other higher education institution by the government or regulatory body. The specific authority that grants imperial degree-awarding powers may depend on the country and the institution in question.
