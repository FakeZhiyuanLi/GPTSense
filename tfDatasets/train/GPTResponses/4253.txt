is called "co-evolution," where both predator and prey have adapted to better survive and catch/escape, respectively. For example, predators have developed sharper teeth, stronger jaws, and faster speeds to catch prey, while prey have developed camouflage, warning coloration, and defensive mechanisms like spines, venom, or running faster. This race has led to a balance of nature, where no species has a complete advantage over the other.
