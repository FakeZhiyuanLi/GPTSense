The fermentation process in brewing beer typically takes about 1-2 weeks, although it can vary depending on the type of beer and the specific recipe. Yeast consumes the sugars in the wort and converts them into alcohol and carbon dioxide, creating the characteristic flavor and alcohol content of the beer. After fermentation is complete, the beer is usually aged for a period of time before it is bottled or kegged for distribution.
