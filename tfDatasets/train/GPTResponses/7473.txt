One of the key figures in publishing Greek documents promoting Greek independence was the Greek politician and scholar, Adamantios Korais. He wrote extensively on Greek history, language, and culture, advocating for a revival of Hellenic identity and independence from Ottoman rule. Korais' ideas and writings helped inspire the Greek War of Independence in 1821.
