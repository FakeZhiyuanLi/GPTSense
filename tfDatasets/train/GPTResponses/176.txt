Western governments have supported fledgling Islamists at various times and in various forms throughout the 20th century. Some examples include:1. 1950s-1960s: The US and UK supported Islamists in Egypt, Syria, and Iran as a way to counter Soviet influence in the region.2. 1980s-1990s: The US and UK supported the Mujahideen in Afghanistan, many of whom were Islamists, to fight against Soviet forces.3. 2011: Western governments supported Islamist groups during the Arab Spring, including the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and various rebel groups in Libya and Syria.It is important to note that these relationships have been complex and often fraught with unintended consequences. For example, the support for the Mujahideen in Afghanistan eventually led to the rise of the Taliban, and the support for Islamist groups during the Arab Spring has contributed to the ongoing conflicts in Libya and Syria.
