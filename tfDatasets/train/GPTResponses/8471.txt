Darwin expected that with the addition of artificial selection, there would be an increased rate of variation and high level of divergence between species. He believed that the process of artificial selection would mimic natural selection but with greater intensity, resulting in the emergence of new and distinct species. Furthermore, Darwin anticipated that some species might become dependent on humans for their survival, resulting in a close relationship between humans and certain species.
