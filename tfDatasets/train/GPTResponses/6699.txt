Kurent is also recognized as a symbol of fertility, youth, and rebirth in Slovenian tradition. He is often associated with the celebration of spring, the awakening of nature, and the end of winter. Kurent is believed to have the power to scare away evil spirits, bring good luck, and ensure a bountiful harvest. Therefore, his appearance may be intimidating, but his purpose is benevolent.
