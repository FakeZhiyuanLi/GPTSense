The reintroduction of divorced Catholics into the church was considered by the council as a pastoral issue that required careful consideration and pastoral care. The council recognized that divorce was a complex issue that affected many families and needed a pastoral approach that acknowledged the complexity of the situation. The council emphasized the importance of respecting the dignity of the individual and the need to provide pastoral care that reflects the compassion and mercy of Christ. However, the council reaffirmed the church's teaching on the indissolubility of marriage and the importance of upholding the sanctity of marriage as an institution ordained by God.
