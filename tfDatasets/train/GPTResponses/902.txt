The development of solar technologies in the early 20th century was slowed down by several factors, including:1. Lack of understanding: There was still limited understanding of the technology and its applications at the time, which hindered the pace of its development.2. High costs: In the early 20th century, solar technologies were expensive to produce and maintain, making them unaffordable for many individuals and companies.3. Limited availability of materials: The raw materials used in the manufacture of solar cells were not widely available, which made the production process slow and inefficient.4. Competition from other energy sources: At the time, other energy sources like coal, gas, and oil dominated the market, making it difficult for solar technologies to compete.5. Limited government support: Governments did not provide significant funding or incentives for the development of solar technologies, which also hindered its progress.
