Malnutrition can be found in both developing and developed countries due to different reasons. In many developing countries, malnutrition is often found as a result of inadequate access to food or a lack of variety in the diet. In contrast, in developed countries, malnutrition is often found as a result of excessive consumption of unhealthy foods or a nutritional imbalance due to poor dietary habits. Factors such as poverty, lack of education, and limited access to healthcare also contribute to the prevalence of malnutrition in both developing and developed countries.
