The old converted cruiser aircraft carriers have evolved into aircraft carriers that are specifically designed and built for the purpose of carrying and deploying aircraft. These modern carriers feature advanced technologies and military capabilities that allow them to launch and recover multiple types of aircraft, including fighter jets, surveillance planes, and helicopters. They also have extensive command and control capabilities, allowing them to coordinate military operations in real-time. Some modern aircraft carriers also incorporate stealth technology or advanced defenses to protect against enemy threats.
