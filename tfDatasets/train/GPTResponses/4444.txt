Bottle conditioned beers are typically stored in glass bottles with a resealable crown cap to keep the carbonation in the beer. Some specialty beers may also be stored in corked bottles or ceramic bottles. Regardless of the type of container, the important factor is that it is able to withstand the pressure of the carbonation and ensure that the beer is properly carbonated during the conditioning process.
