The German translation of Charles Darwin's "On the Origin of Species" by Ludwig BÃ¼chner and Ernst Haeckel had already caused controversy within the conservative scientific community when it was published in 1860. However, when Heinrich Georg Bronn's translation was published in 1863, it added to the misgivings of conservative scientists.Bronn was a renowned German paleontologist and a firm believer in the biblical account of creation. He added footnotes to the translation, expressing his own doubts and criticisms of Darwin's theory of evolution. This was seen as a betrayal by many of his colleagues who had hoped he would offer a more objective and scientific perspective on the work.Furthermore, the publication of the translation coincided with a surge in popularity of Haeckel's more radical interpretation of Darwinism, which included the controversial idea of recapitulation theory. This theory suggested that a developing embryo goes through all the stages of evolution, and caused further alarm among conservative scientists who saw it as an attack on the traditional biblical view of human creation.Overall, Bronn's translation added to the misgivings of conservative scientists because it provided a platform for the promotion of more radical interpretations of Darwin's theory, and represented a significant departure from the traditional biblical account of creation.
