Levels of pesticides can accumulate in organisms as they move up the food chain. This process is called biomagnification. When an animal eats another animal that has been exposed to pesticides, the pesticides will accumulate in the body of the predator. This is because the predator will consume many prey organisms, each with a small amount of pesticides in their body. Over time, the pesticides will become more concentrated in the predator's body. As a result, levels of pesticides tend to be higher in animals at the top of the food chain.
