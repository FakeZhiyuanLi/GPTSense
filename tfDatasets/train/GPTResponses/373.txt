Greenhouses use solar energy to provide the necessary warmth and light for plants to grow. The glass walls of a greenhouse allow sunlight to enter and heat up the inside. The heat is then trapped inside the greenhouse, creating a warm environment for plants that is insulated from external weather fluctuations. Some greenhouses also have solar panels installed to generate additional electricity for heating or lighting. This use of solar energy helps to make greenhouse production more sustainable and energy-efficient.
