To support metadata and obviate the need for tags, the following would be needed:1. Standardized metadata schema: A standardized metadata schema would be required to ensure that metadata values are consistent across different platforms and applications.2. Consistent use of metadata: Users would need to consistently use the metadata schema and provide accurate metadata values for their content.3. Automated metadata extraction: Technology would need to be developed to automatically extract relevant metadata from content, reducing the need for users to manually enter metadata.4. Robust metadata search capabilities: Search engines and other applications would need to be able to search and filter content based on metadata values.5. Integration with existing systems and platforms: Metadata support would need to be integrated with existing platforms and systems to ensure ease of use and compatibility.6. Education and training: Users would need to be educated and trained on the importance of metadata and how to use metadata schemas to ensure effective metadata management.
