It is difficult for me to provide an exact answer as a language model AI, as there is no single definitive source confirming when bushranger films were banned by Victorian politicians. However, it is known that the 1912 Bushrangers Act prohibited the "glorification" of bushrangers in any form, including films, and gave police the power to censor and ban any material they deemed "offensive" or "improper." Some historians argue that this act effectively put an end to bushranger films in Victoria, while others point to the 1920s and 1930s as the peak period of bushranger films in Australia.
