The urinary system controls urination, which includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra, working together to produce and eliminate urine from the body. The process of urination is regulated by the nervous system, specifically the somatic and autonomic nervous systems, which control voluntary and involuntary muscle movements involved in the process of urination. Hormones also play a role in regulating urinary function, including antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and aldosterone, which help control the amount of fluids and electrolytes in the body.
