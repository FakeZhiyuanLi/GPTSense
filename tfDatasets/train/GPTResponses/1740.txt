The different versions of a treaty executed in multiple languages are typically considered to have equal legal validity and significance. This means that each version is considered to be an official and binding document, regardless of any minor variations in wording or phrasing that may appear between different language versions. However, in the event of any discrepancies or conflicting interpretations between different versions, international law generally requires that the terms of the treaty be interpreted in good faith and in accordance with the intentions of the parties involved. In practice, this often requires careful consideration of the context and broader legal principles underlying the agreement, as well as close cooperation between different language-speaking negotiators and translators to ensure that all versions are as consistent and accurate as possible.
