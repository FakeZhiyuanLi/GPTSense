During the Portuguese First Republic (1910-1926), several factors contributed to creating a fertile ground for chaos and unrest, including:1. Political instability: The First Republic was characterized by frequent changes of government and political parties, weak coalition governments, and a lack of stability in the political system.2. Economic crisis: Portugal suffered from a severe economic crisis during this period, which led to high inflation, unemployment, and social inequality. The government's inability to address these issues effectively further contributed to the unrest.3. Colonial tensions: Portugal's colonial empire was also a source of tensions during this period, as there were growing nationalist movements in its African colonies that challenged Portuguese rule. This led to a series of armed rebellions and uprisings, which further destabilized the country.4. Military interventions: The military played a significant role in Portuguese politics during this period, often intervening in government affairs and engaging in coups and counter-coups. This further contributed to the instability and lack of political continuity.All of these factors combined created a volatile and unpredictable environment that made it difficult for the First Republic to establish itself and maintain stability.
