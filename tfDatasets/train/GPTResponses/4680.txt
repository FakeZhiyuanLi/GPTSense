Aircraft use several methods to stop quickly when landing on a short distance:1. Reverse thrust: Many modern aircraft have engines that can be adjusted so they push air forward, slowing down the aircraft upon landing.2. Braking: Aircraft use wheel brakes to slow down upon landing. These brakes can be highly effective and allow planes to stop in a short distance.3. Spoilers: When certain aircraft land, they deploy spoilers to create additional drag which helps to slow the plane down.4. Flaps: Upon landing, aircraft will typically lower their flaps. This increases the amount of drag and lift, allowing the aircraft to slow down more quickly.5. Parachutes: In some cases, aircraft may use parachutes to help slow down upon landing. These can be especially useful for military aircraft that need to land quickly to avoid enemy fire.
