There are a few recommended methods to help in the diagnosis of asthma, including:1. Medical history and physical examination: A doctor will ask about your symptoms and medical history, as well as perform a physical exam to look for signs of asthma, such as wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath.2. Lung function tests: These tests measure how well your lungs are working and how much air you can exhale. The most common test is spirometry, which involves breathing into a device called a spirometer.3. Bronchoprovocation testing: This test involves inhaling a substance (such as methacholine) that can cause airway constriction in people with asthma.4. Exhaled nitric oxide test: This test measures the amount of nitric oxide in your breath, which can be elevated in people with asthma.5. Allergy testing: Allergies can sometimes trigger asthma symptoms, so testing for allergies (such as skin prick tests or blood tests) can be helpful in diagnosing asthma.
