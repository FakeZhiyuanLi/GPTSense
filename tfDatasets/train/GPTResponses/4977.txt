The type of diversity that showed an overall exponential trend is genetic diversity. This refers to the variability of genes within a population, and it has been observed that genetic diversity tends to increase exponentially over time. This is because genetic mutations and recombination events can generate new gene variants, which accumulate in the population over successive generations.
