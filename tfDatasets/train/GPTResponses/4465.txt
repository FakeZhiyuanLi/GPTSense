The legislation passed to discourage the country from getting involved in a foreign war was the Neutrality Acts. The Neutrality Acts were a series of laws passed by the United States Congress in the 1930s aimed at keeping the country out of the growing conflicts in Europe and Asia. They prohibited the sale of weapons or loans to nations at war and prohibited American citizens from traveling on belligerent ships or carrying weapons on them. The Neutrality Acts were enacted to keep the United States out of another world war, in light of the high casualties and destruction of World War I.
