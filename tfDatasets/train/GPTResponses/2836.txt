they have, essentially assuming that all end rules are the same. This could work in cases where the time zone is relatively simple and only involves one type of daylight saving time adjustment. However, it would not be sufficient for more complex time zones that involve multiple types of adjustments or historical changes to the rules. A more sophisticated system would support multiple start and end rules for each time zone, as well as the ability to handle historical changes to those rules. This would allow for more accurate and comprehensive handling of time zones, ensuring that all relevant data is captured and accounted for.
