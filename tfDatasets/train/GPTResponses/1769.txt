DNA also consists of phosphate groups and nucleotides, which are the building blocks of DNA. The phosphate groups form the backbone of DNA, connecting the sugar molecules and the nucleotides. Additionally, DNA may have associated proteins, such as histones, which help to compact and organize the DNA inside the cell nucleus.
