The term "political elite" refers to a specific group of people who occupy the institutions of the state, usually holding positions of power and influence in government, politics, and other key sectors of society. This group is often characterized by their wealth, education, and social status, and they are often seen as having a disproportionate influence over the decisions and policies that affect the rest of society. Political elites may include elected officials, political appointees, civil servants, lobbyists, and other individuals who hold significant power and influence in the political arena.
