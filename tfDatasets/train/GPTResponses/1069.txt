Max Vasmer, a Russian-German linguist, argued that the old East Slavic word Slavuta for the Dnieper River was derived from the ancient Slavic word Slova, meaning "word" or "speech." He believed that the river was named by the ancient Slavs who believed that the Dnieper was the source of sacred knowledge and wisdom. However, this theory is still debated among linguists and historians.
