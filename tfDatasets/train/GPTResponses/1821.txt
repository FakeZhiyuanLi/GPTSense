It depends on the specific product and the marketing strategy of the manufacturer. However, some possible things that are typically dropped or simplified for commercial naming of HDTV products include:- Technical specifications and features: Most consumers are not interested in detailed technical specifications of HDTV products. Therefore, manufacturers may simplify or abbreviate complex terms and numbers to make them sound more consumer-friendly. For example, instead of saying "3840x2160 resolution with 120Hz refresh rate and HDR10 support", they may simply say "4K Ultra HD TV with stunning picture quality and smooth motion".- Model numbers or codes: Manufacturers usually assign unique model numbers or codes to their HDTV products to differentiate them from each other and track their inventory. However, these codes can be confusing and hard to remember for consumers. Therefore, manufacturers may use simpler names or series names instead. For example, instead of saying "LG OLED77GXPUA", they may say "LG OLED GX series".- Brand or logo: The brand or logo of the manufacturer is usually prominent in the commercial naming of HDTV products. However, some manufacturers may choose to emphasize a specific feature or benefit of their products instead. For example, Samsung may name their 8K TVs as "Samsung QLED 8K" to highlight their proprietary quantum-dot technology and ultra-high resolution.- Size or screen type: The size and screen type (e.g. LED, OLED, QLED, etc.) are important factors that consumers consider when buying HDTVs. Therefore, manufacturers may use them as descriptors in the commercial naming of their products. For example, Sony may name their 65-inch OLED TV as "Sony A8H 4K HDR OLED TV" to indicate its size, technology, and picture quality.
