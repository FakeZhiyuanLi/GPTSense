The primary source of income in Tajikistan is agriculture, which contributes to more than half of the country's GDP and employs over 70% of the population. However, Tajikistan also relies heavily on migrant workers who send remittances back home, as well as on revenue from the mining industry (particularly aluminum and gold).
