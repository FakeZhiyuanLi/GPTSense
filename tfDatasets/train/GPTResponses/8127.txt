In 1885, the Football Association (FA) changed the rules of the game by introducing free kicks for fouls and removing the practice of "hacking" or tripping an opponent. These changes made the game safer and more enjoyable to play, as players could focus on skill instead of relying on violent tactics. The new rules also resulted in a more strategic and tactical game, as teams had to adapt their playing styles to accommodate the new regulations. Additionally, the introduction of referees with the power to enforce the new rules helped to standardize the game across different regions and teams.
