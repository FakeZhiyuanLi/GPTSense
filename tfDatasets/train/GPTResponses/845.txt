In the years leading up to the financial crisis, there was a significant increase in the usage of financial innovation products, such as mortgage-backed securities (MBS), collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), credit default swaps (CDS), and other complex derivatives. These products allowed financial institutions to package and sell mortgages and other loans to investors, spreading the risk across a larger group of people.However, the lax lending standards and aggressive marketing of subprime mortgages led to a rapid growth in the number of high-risk loans being packaged into securities. The lack of transparency and complexity of these products also made it difficult for investors to understand the true risks they were taking on.As the housing market began to decline and foreclosures rose, the value of many of these complex financial instruments also declined, leading to massive losses for many investors and financial institutions. The collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 triggered a global financial crisis, as the interconnections between financial institutions and the widespread use of these complex financial products led to a domino effect of instability and risk.
