The European country that is a leader in providing VRS (Video Relay Services) to its citizens is Sweden. Sweden has a well-established and widely used VRS system, which enables deaf and hard-of-hearing people to communicate with hearing people through sign language over a video call. This system is free for all Swedish citizens and provides accessibility and equal opportunities for the deaf community. Other European countries such as the UK, Finland, and Norway also provide VRS services to their citizens, but Sweden is considered one of the most advanced and efficient in this area.
