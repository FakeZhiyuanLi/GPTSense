Most naturalists in the 19th century were initially skeptical of the concept of transmutation of species, which later became known as evolution. The prevailing belief at the time was that species were fixed and unchanging, and this view was rooted in the religious and philosophical beliefs of the time, which held that the natural world was immutable and had been created by a divine being.However, as evidence began to accumulate in favor of evolution, many naturalists began to accept the idea. Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection, which he published in his book "On the Origin of Species" in 1859, provided a compelling explanation for how evolution could occur. Over time, as more and more evidence became available, the scientific community gradually came to accept that evolution was a real and fundamental process that had shaped the diversity of life on Earth.
