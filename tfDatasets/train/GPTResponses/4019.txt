One case that centered around a bootlegger caught through phone tapping was the case of Roy Olmstead. Olmstead was a prominent bootlegger during the Prohibition era in the United States. In 1924, federal agents initiated a phone tapping operation against Olmstead, which allowed them to intercept and record his phone conversations.The recordings of Olmstead's conversations revealed that he was still involved in bootlegging, despite his claims to have gone straight. The federal agents used the intercepted conversations to obtain enough evidence to convict Olmstead on charges of violating the National Prohibition Act.Olmstead challenged his conviction on the grounds that the admission of the intercepted phone conversations as evidence violated his Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights. However, the Supreme Court upheld the conviction, ruling that the Fourth and Fifth Amendments did not apply to private conversations overheard by police using unauthorized electronic surveillance. The case of Olmstead v. United States set a precedent for the legality of wiretapping in criminal investigations.
