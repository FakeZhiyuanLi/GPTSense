HIV/AIDS has a similar relationship as TB does between reactivation and immunosuppression. HIV attacks the immune system and weakens it, making the person more susceptible to infections and diseases. When the immune system is severely compromised, opportunistic infections can occur, leading to the reactivation of latent infections such as tuberculosis. Therefore, persons with HIV/AIDS are more likely to develop active TB, as their immune system cannot effectively control the TB bacteria.
