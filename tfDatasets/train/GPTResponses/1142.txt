Birds use a combination of navigation strategies during migration, including celestial cues, geomagnetic cues, visual landscapes, olfactory cues, and cognitive maps.Celestial cues:Birds use the position of the sun and stars to navigate during the day and at night. They can detect the polarization pattern of sunlight and use this to orient themselves.Geomagnetic cues:Birds have special iron-containing cells in their beaks that are believed to act as a compass. They can sense the Earth's magnetic field and use this to orient themselves.Visual landscapes:Birds also use landmarks, such as coastlines, mountains, and rivers, to orient themselves. They have been observed to use a combination of visual cues and memory to navigate over familiar landscapes.Olfactory cues:Some birds use their sense of smell to help them navigate. They can detect odor molecules in the air and use this to locate breeding or feeding sites.Cognitive maps:Birds are believed to have an internal map of the places they have been, which allows them to navigate over long distances. Studies have shown that birds can navigate by using cognitive maps even when the landscape has been altered.Overall, birds use a combination of different cues to navigate and orient themselves during migration, allowing them to cover vast distances with remarkable accuracy.
