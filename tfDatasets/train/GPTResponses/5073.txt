Antarctica has an extremely harsh and inhospitable climate, which inhibits many forms of life and human activity. The continent is the coldest, driest, and windiest place on Earth, with temperatures dropping as low as -128.6°F (-89.2°C) and wind speeds of up to 200 mph (320 km/h). The cold temperatures and lack of sunlight also mean that the growth of most plants is impossible. Human settlement is extremely difficult due to the extreme conditions, making it difficult for researchers to survive for long periods without specialized equipment and supplies. The harsh climate also presents challenges for transportation, communication, and infrastructure development.
