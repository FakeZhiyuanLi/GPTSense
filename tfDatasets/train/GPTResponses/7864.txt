Exhibition games are typically played for entertainment or promotional purposes and do not have a direct impact on the standings or rankings of teams or players. However, an exhibition game can help settle personal or team rivalries, give players an opportunity to showcase their skills or experiment with new strategies, and provide a chance for fans to see their favorite players in action. Additionally, exhibition games can serve as a warm-up before the start of a season or a tournament and allow teams to evaluate their performance and make necessary adjustments.
