A tiered system is a hierarchical structure used to classify things or people based on their level of importance, performance, or contribution. In a tiered system, each level has a different set of privileges, responsibilities, and objectives. The higher the level, the more significant the role or function it plays. The tiers are usually ordered in descending order, with the highest level at the top and the lowest one at the bottom. Tiered systems are common in many areas, including business organizations, government, education, and sports.
