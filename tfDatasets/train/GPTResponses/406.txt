The goal of Theravada Buddhism is to achieve enlightenment (nirvana) through the realization and understanding of the Four Noble Truths, the Eightfold Path, and the Three Universal Truths. In Theravada Buddhism, the emphasis is on personal spiritual development and the attainment of individual liberation from the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. This path to enlightenment is achieved primarily through the practice of meditation, moral living, and the study of Buddhist scriptures.
