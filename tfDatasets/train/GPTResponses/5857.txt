The Port Phillip Channel Deepening Project was subject to controversy and strict regulations due to concerns about its potential impact on the environment and the surrounding communities. Environmentalists and local residents raised concerns about the dredging process, which involved removing large amounts of sediment from the sea bed to deepen the channel, arguing that it could harm marine life, damage habitats, and disrupt the natural flow of sediment and water in the bay. In response, the project was subject to strict monitoring and mitigation measures, including the establishment of a Marine Mammal Observers Program, a Sediment Management Plan, and a Comprehensive Environmental Effects Monitoring Program. The project was also subject to public consultation and scrutiny from a range of government and community groups, which contributed to the controversy and the rigorous regulatory framework.
