The spread of grasslands and grazing animals have been strongly linked. Grazing animals such as bison and antelopes have coevolved with grasslands over millions of years. The grazing animals promote the growth of new grass by eating old and dead grass, which helps prevent the buildup of litter and decay. Grazing animals also help fertilize grasslands by excreting nitrogen-rich waste, which helps promote plant growth. The grazing animals also help maintain the structure of grasslands by trampling the soil, which helps to prevent soil erosion and promote the infiltration of rainfall. The spread of grasslands has been linked to the migration and grazing patterns of these animals, which have helped shape the landscape of many regions around the world.
