The first station launched after the original BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation) was the BBC Regional Programme. It started broadcasting on 9 March 1930 and was designed to provide local news, information and entertainment to listeners in different regions of the country. The BBC Regional Programme was later replaced by the Home Service in 1939, which became known as BBC Radio 4 in 1967.
