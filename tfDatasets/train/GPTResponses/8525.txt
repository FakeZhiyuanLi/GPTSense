The Niger Delta Nembe Creek oil field is located in a geologic province known as the Niger Delta Basin. The geology of the region is characterized by sedimentary formations including sandstones, shales, and siltstones that were deposited during the Cretaceous period. The oil and gas deposits in the area are primarily found in these sedimentary rocks that have been buried and subjected to heat and pressure, leading to the formation of hydrocarbons.
