Panini, an ancient Indian grammatical scholar, believed that Sanskrit evolved from the language of the gods, called "Sanskritam," which was considered to be the purest and most perfect language. He also believed that Sanskrit was a refined form of the Vedic language, which was used by the ancient Aryans in India.
