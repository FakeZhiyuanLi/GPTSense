Gustav Mahler's Symphony No. 8, also known as the "Symphony of a Thousand," requires a massive ensemble. The work calls for a minimum of eight soloists, double adult choir, children's choir, and orchestra, with some performances incorporating up to 1,000 performers. The number of singers in the adult choir typically ranges from 250 to 500, while the children's choir can include up to 100 singers.
