is required by the treaty. For example, if a treaty requires a certain level of environmental protection, but the state's legislature fails to pass the necessary laws to implement and enforce that protection, the state could be in default of its obligations under the treaty. Additionally, if a treaty creates certain rights for individuals or groups, but the state's legislature fails to pass laws to protect and ensure those rights, the state could also be in default of its obligations under the treaty.
