The disease that took the heaviest toll on Napoleon's army was Typhus. It spread rapidly through overcrowded and unsanitary conditions, causing fever, rashes, and sometimes death. It affected soldiers on both sides of the Napoleonic Wars, but it was particularly widespread in the Grande Arm√©e during the invasion of Russia in 1812. It is estimated that more than 100,000 soldiers died from disease during this campaign, with Typhus being the most deadly.
