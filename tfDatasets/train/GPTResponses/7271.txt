Arabidopsis thaliana is another plant commonly used in the discovery of different genes. It is a small flowering plant that has a small genome and a relatively simple structure, making it an ideal candidate for genetic research. Arabidopsis has been used extensively for the study of plant development and response to environmental stress.
