The United States Constitution is the document that gives Congress limited power to enact statutes. Specifically, the Constitution outlines the powers that Congress has been granted, as well as the powers that are withheld from Congress and are reserved for the states or the people themselves. This system of shared powers is known as federalism, which means that the central government and state governments share power and authority. Additionally, the Constitution includes the Bill of Rights, which limits the power of Congress by protecting individual rights such as the freedom of speech, religion, and due process. Courts can also limit the power of Congress by striking down laws that violate the Constitution or other laws.
