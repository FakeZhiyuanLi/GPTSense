Clausentum, a Roman town located in present-day Southampton, had a number of defenses to protect it from invaders. In addition to the two ditches that surrounded the town, Clausentum had a rampart made of timber and earth to provide a physical barrier to anyone attempting to breach the outer defenses. The rampart was reinforced with palisades, or sharpened wooden stakes, which acted as a deterrent to enemy forces. The town also had a gatehouse, which made it easier to control entry and exit into the town, and helped in securing the town's defenses. Finally, Clausentum had a garrison of Roman troops that were stationed there to provide additional protection and defense in case of an attack.
