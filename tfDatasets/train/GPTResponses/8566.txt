Hybrids may have characteristics that keep them from being fertile because they usually result from the mating of two different species, which can result in the offspring having an uneven number of chromosomes. This uneven number of chromosomes can make it challenging for the hybrid to produce viable gametes during meiosis, which is necessary for sexual reproduction, leading to infertility. Additionally, the hybrid may have significant genetic differences from either parent, making it challenging to find a compatible mate for successful reproduction. Finally, hormonal and physiological differences between the hybrid and its parent species can also contribute to infertility.
