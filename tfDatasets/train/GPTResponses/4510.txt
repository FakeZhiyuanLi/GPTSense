Hospitals hope to prevent the spread of infections, specifically healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), by installing copper doorknobs. Copper has natural antimicrobial properties that can kill bacteria, viruses, and fungi on its surface within a few hours, reducing the risk of transmission from contaminated surfaces. Copper surfaces can also supplement standard cleaning protocols, which can reduce the survival of pathogens on touch surfaces. Therefore, copper doorknobs can help decrease the transmission of diseases in healthcare facilities.
