Federal agencies have the authority to enforce their regulations because they derive their power from statutes enacted by Congress. Congress establishes the rules and guidelines for federal agencies to carry out their respective duties, and these agencies work to implement and enforce regulations consistent with their statutory authority. Additionally, the judiciary also plays a role in ensuring the validity and interpretation of federal regulations through review of agency actions and decisions.
