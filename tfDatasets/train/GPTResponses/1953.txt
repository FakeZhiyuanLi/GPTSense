Implementing legislation refers to the laws and regulations that a country must enact or modify to comply with the terms and obligations of a treaty that it has signed. This legislation ensures that the treaty is enforced domestically and that it becomes part of the country's legal system. Implementing legislation can include changes to existing laws, regulations or the creation of new laws, as deemed necessary. It is a crucial step for any country that wishes to fully and effectively participate in the international treaty system.
