The altitude at which snowfall begins in November can vary depending on location and local weather conditions. In some areas, snow may start falling at elevations as low as 1,000 feet, while in other areas, snowfall may not occur until elevations reach 5,000 feet or higher. Factors such as temperature, moisture, and atmospheric pressure can also influence when and where snow begins to fall.
