Catobar (Catapult Assisted Take-Off Barrier Arrested Recovery) allows for the launch and recovery of fixed-wing aircraft from an aircraft carrier. It features a catapult system to launch the aircraft and an arrestor system to recover them during landing. This system allows heavier and more advanced aircraft to be used on carriers, as well as enabling faster takeoff and shorter landing distances.
