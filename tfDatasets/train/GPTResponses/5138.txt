Some researchers believe that the primary cause of warming is the increase in greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide, from human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and agriculture. This buildup of gases traps more heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to rising temperatures and changes in weather patterns.
