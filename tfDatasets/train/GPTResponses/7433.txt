The evolution of flowering plants (angiosperms) led to the diversification of seed plants. This occurred around 140 million years ago, during the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous periods, and quickly led to the dominance of angiosperms as the most diverse and widespread group of plants on Earth. The development of flowers allowed for a more efficient and specialized mode of pollination, which helped angiosperms to rapidly colonize new habitats and compete with other plant groups. The diversity of seed plants also continued to expand through adaptations to new environmental conditions, such as the evolution of gymnosperms with cone-like structures and adaptations that allowed for seed dispersal by wind or animals.
