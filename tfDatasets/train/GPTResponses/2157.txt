Prokaryotes are unicellular organisms that lack a nucleus and other membrane-bound cellular organelles. They are typically small in size, measuring only about 0.2-2 micrometers in diameter. Prokaryotes can be divided into two groups: bacteria and archaea. They are found in almost every habitat on Earth, including soil, water, and living organisms. Some prokaryotes are beneficial to humans, such as those that live in the digestive system and help with digestion, while others can cause disease.
