If a treaty is meant to be only temporarily binding, it may include a provision for termination or expiration. This provision would specify when the treaty would end or how it could be terminated before the specified end date. It could also include a provision for review or renewal, allowing the parties to reassess the terms and decide whether to continue or modify the treaty at a later date. Additionally, the treaty may include specific conditions or requirements that must be met for the treaty to remain in force, such as financial contributions or the achievement of certain objectives.
