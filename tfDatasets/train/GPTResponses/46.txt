Margaret Thatcher's control of the UK's government in the 1980s helped fuel a desire for a Scottish parliament. Thatcher's policies of privatization, deregulation, and cuts to public spending were deeply unpopular in Scotland and led to increased calls for greater autonomy and democratic control over Scottish affairs. In response, the Scottish National Party (SNP) campaigned for a devolved parliament and won a majority in the first Scottish parliamentary elections in 1999.
