The concept of "Regularity" recognizes only one grand lodge in a given geographical area. Regularity refers to the adherence to a set of standards and principles by a grand lodge or a constituent lodge in order to be recognized as legitimate and in good standing within the larger Masonic community. These standards include a belief in a Supreme Being, the use of the Holy Bible as the Volume of the Sacred Law, and the prohibition of discussions on religion and politics within the lodge. In order to maintain Regularity, a grand lodge must maintain fraternal relations with other recognized grand lodges and not recognize any group or organization that does not meet these standards.
