The decline of the Aboriginal population in 1863 was due to a combination of factors, including:1. Diseases brought by European settlers: Aboriginal communities had little immunity to European diseases like smallpox, measles and influenza. When these diseases were introduced, they had devastating effects on the population.2. Forced removals: The British government had a policy of forcibly removing Aboriginal children from their families and placing them in residential schools, which caused trauma and disrupted family structures. This policy continued until as late as the 1970s.3. Violence: There were numerous instances of violence perpetrated against Aboriginal people by European settlers, including massacres and forced relocations.4. Dispossession of land: The British colonisation of Australia resulted in the stealing of Aboriginal land and resources, which disrupted traditional ways of life and made it difficult for Aboriginal communities to survive.5. Dislocation from cultural practices: The British attempted to "civilise" Aboriginal people by imposing European customs and laws on them, which resulted in the loss of traditional cultural practices and languages.
