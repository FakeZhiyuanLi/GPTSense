The ribosome binding site, terminator, start codon, and stop codon are not located on transcribed pre-mRNA.The ribosome binding site is typically located on the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of a mature mRNA molecule, which is generated by processing the pre-mRNA transcript.The terminator sequence is located at the end of a transcriptional unit, following the coding region.The start codon (typically AUG in eukaryotes) is found within the coding sequence of the mature mRNA molecule and serves as the signal for the initiation of translation.The stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) is also located within the coding sequence of the mRNA molecule and signals the termination of translation.
