Napoleon's favorite strategy was the "envelopment" or "double envelopment" maneuver, which involved surrounding and attacking the enemy from multiple directions, cutting off their ability to retreat or maneuver. He used this strategy to great effect in many of his successful battles, including Austerlitz, Friedland, and Jena-Auerstedt.
