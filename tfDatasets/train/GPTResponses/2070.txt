When a gene has more than one promoter, it can be transcribed in different ways, resulting in alternative transcripts or different isoforms of the protein encoded by that gene. This can lead to differences in protein function, expression levels, or regulation, which may have important consequences for development, physiology, and disease. In some cases, one promoter may be more active than the others, or expression may be tissue-specific or developmentally regulated. The complexity of gene expression can be enhanced by the presence of multiple promoters, allowing for fine-tuning of gene regulation and diversity of protein isoforms.
