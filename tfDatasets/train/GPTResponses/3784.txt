The continuing event that began in the middle Triassic is the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea. This process of continental fragmentation and the opening of new ocean basins continued throughout the Triassic period, leading to the formation of new continents and shaping the modern geography of the Earth. It also had significant impacts on the evolution and diversification of life on land and in marine environments.
