There were several factors that dramatically changed naval combat in World War II:1. Aircraft carriers: Aircraft carriers replaced battleships as the dominant capital ship of navies. They allowed for air power to be projected over long distances and gave navies greater flexibility in their tactics.2. Radar: The development of radar technology allowed ships to detect enemy vessels from greater distances and in poor visibility conditions. This gave navies an edge in detecting and avoiding enemy ships.3. Submarines: Submarines became a more significant threat to surface ships, as they could operate undetected and launch torpedo attacks from afar.4. Amphibious warfare: The use of troops and equipment to launch attacks from sea to land became a major tactic in the war. This relied on the use of landing craft and amphibious vehicles to transport troops and equipment ashore.Overall, World War II saw a shift towards more mobile, flexible, and technologically advanced naval warfare, with a greater emphasis on air power and amphibious operations.
