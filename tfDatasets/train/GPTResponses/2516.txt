Marmots build their colonies in high altitude areas such as mountaintops or alpine meadows. They prefer to live in areas with rocky outcroppings, where they can dig their burrows and create underground dens. Marmot colonies can consist of up to 20 individuals and they typically hibernate for several months during the winter.
