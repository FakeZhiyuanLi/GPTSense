other genre?One of the key differences between British house music and other genres was the use of samples and montages. British house music drew heavily on the tradition of electronic dance music and the use of samples and sound bites from a vast array of sources. These sources ranged from classic disco tracks and funk grooves to obscure vocal and instrumental samples from old soul, jazz, and electronic music records. This sampling and remixing process allowed British house music producers to create a style that was both innovative and forward-looking, while still rooted in the traditions of dance music. This approach contrasted with other genres, such as hip-hop and techno, which often relied more heavily on synthesized sounds and minimalistic beats.
