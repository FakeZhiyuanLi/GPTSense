After the 1990s recession, Houston focused on diversifying its economy to reduce its dependence on the oil and gas industry. The city invested in infrastructure, such as improving its port facilities and expanding its airport, to attract businesses and industries from outside its traditional energy sector. The city also invested in higher education, research and development, and technology to create new job opportunities in fields like biotechnology, healthcare, and alternative energy. Additionally, Houston worked to improve its quality of life by investing in public safety, parks, and cultural amenities to attract and retain residents and businesses.
