The period in history when anatomical studies of nerves greatly increased was during the Renaissance, specifically in the 16th century. Scientists such as Andreas Vesalius, Bartolomeo Eustachio, and Realdo Colombo pioneered the study of anatomy and made significant discoveries about the structure and function of the nervous system. Their work paved the way for later scientists, such as William Harvey and Thomas Willis, who furthered our understanding of the nervous system in the 17th century.
