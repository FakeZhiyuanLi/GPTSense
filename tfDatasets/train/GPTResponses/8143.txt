European mysticism tended to focus more on contemplation and direct experience of God or the divine, often through ascetic practices and meditation. English mysticism, on the other hand, placed more emphasis on the role of love and the heart in the mystical experience, and emphasized the need for practical action and service to others as an expression of divine love. Additionally, English mysticism tended to have a more communal and social aspect, with groups such as the Beguines and the Friends of God emphasizing the importance of community in the spiritual life.
