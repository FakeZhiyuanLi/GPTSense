The association between knightly genealogiae and heraldic devices began in the 12th century. The first recorded use of a coat of arms as a heraldic device was by Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou, in the 1120s. The use of coats of arms became more widespread and standardized in the 13th and 14th centuries, as heraldry became an essential part of knightly culture and identity. Knights would display their coats of arms on their shields, banners, and other items to show their lineage and status.
