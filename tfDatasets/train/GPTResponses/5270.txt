Many Jews used the language of their local community in their secular lives. For example, in Europe, many Jews spoke Yiddish as their everyday language, while in Middle Eastern and North African countries, Jews often spoke Arabic or other local languages. Additionally, some Jewish communities in Europe and North Africa also spoke Ladino, a language based on medieval Spanish.
