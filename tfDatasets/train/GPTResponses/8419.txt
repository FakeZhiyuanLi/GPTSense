Nigeria has had one major secession movement, which is the secession of Biafra in 1967. It was a declaration of independence by the Igbo ethnic group in the southeastern region of Nigeria. The secession resulted in a civil war that lasted for three years and claimed the lives of an estimated 1-3 million people. The secession was ultimately unsuccessful, and Biafra was reintegrated into Nigeria in 1970.
