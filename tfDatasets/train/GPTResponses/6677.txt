Activists controlled their appearance at the 2013 ceremony with various means, including clothing, makeup, hairstyles, and accessories, to convey their message and create visual impact. Some of the key symbolic elements used by activists at the event included pins, badges, and ribbons that represented different causes and issues, such as gender equality, LGBTQ+ rights, environmental sustainability, and anti-war movements. Many activists also used body art and face painting to express their ideas and gain attention, often incorporating striking motifs and colours that reflected the themes and values of their movements. Additionally, some activists modified their outfits to include slogans, logos, or emblems that identified them as part of a particular group or movement, or to challenge conventional gender roles and expectations.
