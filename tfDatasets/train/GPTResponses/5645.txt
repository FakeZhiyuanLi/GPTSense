The Protestant Reformation, led by figures such as Martin Luther and John Calvin, challenged the authority and practices of the Catholic Church. In England, King Henry VIII broke away from the Catholic Church and established the Church of England, also known as the Anglican Church. The Anglican Church gradually removed Catholic rituals and practices from its services, including the elimination of the Latin Mass, the use of English instead of Latin in liturgy, the rejection of the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation, and the removal of images of saints and the Virgin Mary from church interiors. The Anglican Church developed its own distinctive liturgical and theological traditions, blending elements of Catholicism and Protestantism.
