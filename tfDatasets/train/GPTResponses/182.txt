Western imperialism divided the globe according to the theory of colonialism. This theory supposes that one country or civilization has the right to dominate and subjugate another country or group of people. This often involved exploiting the resources and labor of the colonized people for the benefit of the colonizing power. The practice of colonialism had a significant impact on the world, leading to the creation of new nations, the exploitation of natural resources, and the spread of Western culture and values.
