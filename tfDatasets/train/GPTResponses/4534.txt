Canned beer is generally considered better for the environment than bottled beer. This is because cans are more easily and efficiently recycled than glass bottles, and they are lighter to transport which reduces carbon emissions during transportation. Additionally, aluminum cans have a higher recycling rate than glass bottles, meaning they are more likely to be recycled and reused.
