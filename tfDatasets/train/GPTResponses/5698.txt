Parque Rodó was originally conceived as an amusement park, designed to provide entertainment to the residents of Montevideo, Uruguay. It was inaugurated in 1917 and named after the Uruguayan writer and politician José Enrique Rodó. The park has since become a popular recreational area, featuring gardens, lakes, playgrounds, a Ferris wheel, an antique carousel, and a cultural center.
