Modern font technology addresses the issue of depicting a han character in alternate glyph representations through the use of OpenType. OpenType is a digital font technology that includes features such as glyph substitution or glyph alternates, which allow multiple versions of a character to be stored within a single font file.For Han characters, OpenType allows for the storage of alternate glyphs, such as simplified or traditional versions of the same character. This is particularly useful in Chinese, where simplified and traditional versions of characters are both used.Additionally, OpenType also includes support for vertical writing, which is commonly used in Chinese and Japanese. This allows the font to be designed to appear correctly when written vertically or horizontally.Overall, modern font technology with OpenType features allows for greater flexibility and accuracy in depicting Han characters with alternate glyph representations.
