One primary role of the Canberra-class LDH (Landing Helicopter Dock) is to provide a platform for the transportation and deployment of military personnel, vehicles, and equipment in support of amphibious operations. The ship is capable of carrying helicopters and other naval vessels, and has a well deck for launching and recovering amphibious craft. It can also provide medical facilities, command and control capabilities, and logistical support for a range of military operations.
