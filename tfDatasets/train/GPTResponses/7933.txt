Friendlies allow managers to experiment with different tactics, formations, and player combinations without the pressure of the competitive environment. They can try out new players, test out different strategies, and make adjustments to their team's game plan. Additionally, friendlies provide an opportunity for managers to assess their team's fitness levels and identify areas of weakness that need to be addressed before the start of the season.
