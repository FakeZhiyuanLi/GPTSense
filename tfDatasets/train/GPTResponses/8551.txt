Charles Darwin theorized that the instinct of slave-making ants has evolved through natural selection. He proposed that the behavior of slave-making ants, where they capture and enslave other ants, arose as a result of competition for resources among ants. Those ants that developed the ability to capture and enslave other ants had a greater chance of survival and reproduction than those that did not. Over time, this trait became more common in the population, leading to the evolution of the slave-making instinct in these ants.
