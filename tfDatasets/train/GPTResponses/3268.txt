One example of what can happen when audio is compressed is a loss of dynamic range. This means that the difference between the loudest and softest parts of the audio is reduced, resulting in a less dynamic and less exciting sound. This can happen because compression works by reducing the volume of the louder parts of the audio, which can make the overall level more consistent but can also make the quiet parts of the audio louder in relation to the rest. This can reduce the impact of loud parts and make the overall sound less engaging.
