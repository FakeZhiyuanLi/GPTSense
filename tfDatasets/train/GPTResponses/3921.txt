The Stuxnet worm targeted specific industrial control systems developed by Siemens AG, which were used in a certain type of centrifuge used to enrich uranium. The worm was designed to exploit four zero-day vulnerabilities in the Windows operating system and was spread through infected USB drives. It first infected Windows machines which were connected to the internet and then spread to other computers on the same network. Once it infected the target system, it used its own code to manipulate the industrial process and ultimately cause physical damage to the centrifuges. The worm was specifically designed to evade detection and spread undetected, making it difficult to identify and remove.
