The stage is called Identity Confusion or Identity Diffusion, and it typically occurs during adolescence. It is during this stage that youth may experience confusion and inner turmoil regarding their sexual orientation, as well as other aspects of their identity. They may struggle to reconcile their feelings with societal norms and expectations, and may feel isolated or misunderstood. It is important for those going through this stage to receive support and guidance from trusted adults and peers, as well as access to resources and information about sexuality and gender identity.
