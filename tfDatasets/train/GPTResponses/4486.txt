The property of copper that increases the efficiency of electrical motors is its high electrical conductivity. This means that it can conduct electricity with minimal resistance, allowing for the efficient transfer of electrical energy from the power source to the motor's components. Copper conductors are often used in motor windings to ensure that the motor operates at maximum efficiency.
