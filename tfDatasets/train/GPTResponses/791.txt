This concept refers to the Buddhist school of Mahayana, specifically the philosophy of the "Bodhisattva path" which emphasizes the development of compassion and wisdom as the means to attain enlightenment for the benefit of all sentient beings. The innate qualities of the mind referred to in this context are the "Buddha nature" or "Tathagatagarbha" which is present in all beings and is seen as the potential for awakening to one's true nature as a Buddha. This includes the quality of omniscience or the ability to see and understand all things as they truly are.
