A stepper motor is a type of motor that rotates through a series of small steps or increments. It uses a series of magnetic fields to rotate the shaft of the motor, and each step is precisely controlled by the motor's controller. Stepper motors are commonly used in applications where precise positioning or control is required, such as in printers, CNC machines, and robotics.On the other hand, a synchronous motor operates at a constant speed and is typically used in applications that require continuous rotation, such as fans and pumps. It operates with a magnetic field that rotates at the same speed as the AC current that powers the motor. The speed of the synchronous motor is determined by the frequency of the AC current, and it operates in synchronization with the power source.The main difference between a stepper motor and a synchronous motor is the way they operate. While a stepper motor rotates in small, precise increments, a synchronous motor rotates continuously at a constant speed. Additionally, a stepper motor requires a controller to precisely control its operation, while a synchronous motor operates in synchronization with the power source.
