The early history of Shell Oil Company's business in the United States is described as being focused primarily on exploration and production of oil and gas. In the early 20th century, the company established itself as a major player in the industry, with significant operations in Texas and the Gulf of Mexico region. Shell also invested heavily in research and development, including the development of new refining and petrochemical technologies. The company expanded its operations through acquisitions and partnerships, and by the mid-20th century had become one of the largest oil companies in the world.
