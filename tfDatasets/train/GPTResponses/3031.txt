Early records of migration were recorded by various European explorers and colonizers, such as Christopher Columbus, Amerigo Vespucci, John Cabot, and Hernán Cortés. They documented their travels to the Americas and interactions with the indigenous populations they encountered. Additionally, many Native American tribes in North America passed down oral histories of their migration stories through generations.
