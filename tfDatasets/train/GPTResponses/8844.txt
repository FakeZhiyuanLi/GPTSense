The extreme weather conditions during winter, such as heavy snow, freezing temperatures, and icy roads, made it nearly impossible for ground operations to continue. The harsh weather conditions posed a threat to the safety of soldiers and equipment, making it difficult to maneuver and operate effectively. As a result, many military operations were halted or slowed down during winter to wait for more favorable weather conditions.
