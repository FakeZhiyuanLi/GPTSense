One philosopher who currently promotes process philosophy and pragmatism is John Dewey. Dewey was an American philosopher, psychologist, and educational reformer who lived from 1859 to 1952. He is considered one of the founders of pragmatism and is known for his work in process philosophy, which emphasizes the interconnectedness of all things and the dynamic nature of reality. Dewey believed that knowledge is not something static, but rather something that is constantly evolving and changing through experience and interaction with the world. His ideas continue to influence education, politics, and philosophy to this day.
