The disagreements following the Eritrean War resulted in tensions between Ethiopia and Eritrea and the escalation of a border conflict in 1998, known as the Eritrean-Ethiopian War. The war caused significant loss of life and displacement of people on both sides of the border, with estimates of 70,000-100,000 people killed and over 600,000 people displaced. It also caused economic damage to both countries, disrupted social and cultural ties between the people, and strained diplomatic relations with neighboring countries. The conflict ended in 2000 with a peace agreement, but sporadic skirmishes, border disputes, and tensions have continued to occur.
