The logistic growth model, also known as the Verhulst model, implies a second-order positive feedback. This model is a mathematical representation of population growth using differential equations, and it incorporates the concept of carrying capacity, which is the maximum population size that an environment can sustain. As the population approaches the carrying capacity, the rate of growth slows down, but the positive feedback loop remains, as a larger population leads to an even higher rate of growth.
