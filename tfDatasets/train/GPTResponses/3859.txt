crops can be grown, soil types, rainfall patterns, and climate zones. In the Central Valley, which encompasses much of the agricultural heartland of California, large-scale farming of a wide range of crops including almonds, grapes, citrus fruits, and vegetables is possible because of the fertile soil and reliable irrigation systems. In the northern coastal region, dairy farms and apple orchards thrive, while in the south, avocados and other subtropical fruits are grown in abundance. Coastal fisheries and aquaculture operations also play a major role in sustaining local economies. Additionally, the availability of labor and infrastructure, as well as market demand, can also impact the types of crops that are grown and the methods used to produce them.
