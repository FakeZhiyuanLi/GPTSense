Napoleon's wife, Empress Josephine, had previously died in 1814, before his exile to Elba in 1815. However, his son, Napoleon II (also known as the Duke of Reichstadt), was not with him during his exile to Elba. After Napoleon's defeat at the Battle of Waterloo, his son was claimed by the Austrian Empire, which had agreed to take care of him as part of a peace agreement. He was taken to live in Austria, where he remained until his death in 1832.
