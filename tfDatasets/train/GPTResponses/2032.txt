Eleonora's falcons primarily feed their young on small birds and insects. They typically hunt and catch prey in midair and will bring it back to the nest to feed their young. They have been known to catch a variety of prey, including songbirds, shorebirds, dragonflies, and butterflies. They may also occasionally consume small mammals such as bats. Overall, their diet varies depending on the availability of prey in their habitat.
