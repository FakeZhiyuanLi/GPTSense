There is no definitive answer as there were several mayors involved in the proclamation of independence for Alsace-Lorraine. However, one of the most prominent figures was Auguste Bartholdi, who served as the mayor of Colmar from 1887 to 1889 and played a key role in the establishment of the Ligue Alsace-Lorraine, a political organization advocating for regional autonomy.
