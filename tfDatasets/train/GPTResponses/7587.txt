The centrifugal switch in a motor disconnects the starting capacitor from the motor circuit when the rotor achieves operating speed. This is because the starting capacitor is only needed to provide an extra boost of energy to the motor during start-up, and once the motor is up to operating speed, it no longer needs the extra energy. By disconnecting the starting capacitor, the motor can run more efficiently without excess energy being wasted.
