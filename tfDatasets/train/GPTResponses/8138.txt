There is no article in the Spanish Constitution that gives the monarch the right to ask for a referendum. The Constitution sets out the procedures for calling a referendum, which can only be initiated by the government, the Congress of Deputies, or by a petition signed by at least 10% of the electorate. The king has a symbolic role in the Spanish political system and does not have any direct powers to call for a referendum.
