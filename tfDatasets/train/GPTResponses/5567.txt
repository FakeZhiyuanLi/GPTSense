There are several types of drugs that can reduce the risk of strokes and heart disease for people with high blood pressure:1. ACE inhibitors: These drugs relax blood vessels by blocking the production of a hormone that narrows blood vessels, helping to lower blood pressure.2. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs): These drugs block the effects of a hormone that narrows blood vessels, helping to lower blood pressure.3. Calcium channel blockers: These drugs relax blood vessels by preventing calcium from entering cells in the heart and blood vessel walls, thus lowering blood pressure.4. Diuretics: These drugs help to reduce excess fluid in the body, which can help lower blood pressure.5. Beta blockers: These drugs reduce the workload on the heart by slowing down the heart rate and reducing the force of the heartâ€™s contractions, thus lowering blood pressure.
