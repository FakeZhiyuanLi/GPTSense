Both adolescents and adults weigh the potential rewards and consequences of an action. However, research suggests that adolescents may be more likely to take risks and prioritize immediate rewards over long-term consequences compared to adults. This is due to the fact that the prefrontal cortex, responsible for decision-making and impulse control, is not fully developed until early adulthood. Nevertheless, both age groups consider the potential outcomes of their actions and make decisions accordingly.
