There is no specific number of governments that are a part of federalism as it can vary between countries. However, in the United States, there are 50 state governments and one national (federal) government that operate under a federal system. Other countries such as Australia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, and India also have federal systems with their own unique structures and number of governments.
