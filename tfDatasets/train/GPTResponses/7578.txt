The territory given to Israel is a complex issue as it has evolved over time.In 1947, the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine proposed dividing the region into two states: one Jewish and one Arab. Jerusalem was to be placed under international control. Israel accepted the plan, but the Arab countries did not, leading to the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.Following the war, Israel expanded its territory beyond the borders envisioned in the partition plan, occupying areas including West Jerusalem, the Golan Heights, the Gaza Strip, parts of the West Bank, and the Sinai Peninsula.In 1979, Israel signed a peace agreement with Egypt, returning the Sinai Peninsula to Egyptian control. In the 1990s, Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization signed several agreements, including the Oslo Accords, which established the Palestinian Authority over parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.Today, Israel claims sovereignty over all of Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, and has established settlements in the West Bank, which is still occupied by Israel despite international condemnation. The exact territory under Israeli control remains a subject of ongoing conflict and negotiation.
