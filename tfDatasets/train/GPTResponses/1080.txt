This statement is not entirely true. While the Russian Empire, Serbia, and Montenegro were independent Slavic states in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, there were other Slavic states that were also free during this time, such as Bulgaria and Romania. Additionally, there were Slavic-majority regions within the Austro-Hungarian Empire that had some degree of autonomy, such as Croatia-Slavonia. It is also important to note that the concept of "freedom" is subjective and can be interpreted in different ways.
