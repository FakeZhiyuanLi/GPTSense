There were contrary opinions expressed about the nature of kingship in many centuries, but some notable examples include:- 5th century BCE: In ancient Greece, the concept of the "tyrant" emerged as a negative view of kingship, with some philosophers arguing that it was better to have a government of the people (democracy) or of the few (oligarchy) than to entrust power to a single ruler.- 16th century CE: During the Renaissance, thinkers like Machiavelli and Bodin wrote influential treatises on political power that challenged the divine right of kings and emphasized the importance of a ruler's practical abilities and the consent of the governed.- 17th century CE: The English Civil War and Glorious Revolution saw a period of intense debate over the proper role and limitations of the monarchy, with some arguing for absolute monarchy and others advocating for parliamentary supremacy or even republicanism.- 18th century CE: The Enlightenment brought many new ideas about individual rights, democracy, and human reason that challenged traditional notions of monarchy as an inherently superior form of government. This led to the American and French Revolutions, which overthrew monarchies and established new republican regimes.- 20th century CE: Many countries that had previously been ruled by monarchs moved toward democracy or other forms of government, but monarchies still exist in many parts of the world and continue to be debated and criticized for their cost, legitimacy, and effectiveness.
