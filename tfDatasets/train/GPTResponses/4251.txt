Parasitic species lay their eggs on their prey because their offspring require a living host to survive and grow. By laying their eggs on the prey, the young offspring have immediate access to a source of nutrients and protection, ensuring their survival. Additionally, by utilizing a living host, the parasites can conserve energy that would otherwise be necessary for their offspring to search for their own prey. Finally, by laying their eggs on their prey, the parasites can ensure that their young will have favorable conditions for growth and development since the host will provide a suitable microenvironment.
