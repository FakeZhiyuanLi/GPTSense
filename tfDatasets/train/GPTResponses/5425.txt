The story about Panthera is not found in traditional Jewish literature such as the Hebrew Bible, the Talmud, or the Midrash. It first appears in a medieval Jewish text called the Toledot Yeshu, which is a collection of legends and stories about Jesus and his disciples. However, it is important to note that the Toledot Yeshu is not considered a reliable source of information by most Jewish scholars and is often viewed as anti-Christian propaganda.
