It is not known who specifically discovered that inert gas could slow evaporation. However, it is known that the use of inert gas to create an oxygen-free environment to prevent oxidation and slow down chemical reactions dates back to the early 1900s. Inert gases like nitrogen and argon are often used in industrial processes to prevent unwanted reactions and preserve products.
