Jamming: This involves transmitting signals on the same frequency as the opponent's communication equipment in order to disrupt or block their ability to communicate.2. Electronic Warfare: This refers to the use of electronic devices and technologies to disrupt or disable an opponent's communication systems, radar, and other electronic equipment.3. Anti-aircraft Weapons: These include surface-to-air missiles, anti-aircraft guns, and other weapons designed to shoot down enemy aircraft.4. Denial of Airspace: This involves denying an opponent access to a particular airspace, or using air and ground assets to interdict their aircraft, either by physically blocking them or by attacking them.5. Cyber Attacks: These are attacks on an opponent's computer systems or network infrastructure to disrupt their ability to operate aircraft or other equipment.6. Psychological Operations: These are strategies designed to influence the behavior of an opponent by using propaganda, disinformation, and other tactics to create confusion and undermine their confidence.
