The Latin alphabet has been used to transcribe Sanskrit since the 19th century when Europeans began studying and documenting the language. Prior to this, Sanskrit was primarily written in its native script, Devanagari. However, the use of the Latin alphabet for Sanskrit transcription began to gain popularity and is now widely used in academic and scholarly contexts.
