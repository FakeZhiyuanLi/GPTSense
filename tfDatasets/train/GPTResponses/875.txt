Protests in front of Carrefour's stores occurred in China in April and May 2008, during the lead-up to the Summer Olympics in Beijing. The protests were largely organized and led by Chinese nationalists who were angry about perceived bias in Western media coverage of the Olympic torch relay and other issues related to China's international image. Many protesters called for a boycott of Carrefour and other Western retailers, accusing them of supporting Tibetan independence and other perceived Western agendas.
