There is no clear answer to this question as the Land of Put is a biblical reference that is not clearly defined geographically or historically. Some scholars suggest it may have been a region in North Africa, while others believe it was a region closer to the Middle East. Therefore, it is difficult to determine which nation had a close relationship with the Land of Put.
