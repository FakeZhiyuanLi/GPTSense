In order for a set to form a group under a certain operation, the following conditions must be satisfied:1. Closure: For any two elements a and b in the set, their composition under the operation must also belong to the set.2. Associativity: For any three elements a, b, and c in the set, the order in which we perform the operation on them does not matter (i.e., a * (b * c) = (a * b) * c)3. Identity: There exists an element e in the set such that for any element a in the set, e * a = a * e = a. This element is known as the identity element.4. Inverse: For any element a in the set, there exists another element b in the set such that a * b = b * a = e. This element b is known as the inverse of a.Thus, any group operation must be compatible with these four conditions in order for the set to form a group.
