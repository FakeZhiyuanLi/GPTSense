The English Order, also known as the Order of Preachers or the Dominican Order, aimed to gain knowledge of Christ through preaching and teaching. They believed that by spreading the teachings of Christianity to the masses, people would be inspired to live their lives according to the teachings of Christ. The Dominicans also emphasized the importance of study and scholarship, and they established universities and schools to educate the people about the Bible and Christian doctrine. Through these efforts, the English Order hoped to deepen people's understanding of Christ and inspire them to live more virtuous lives.
