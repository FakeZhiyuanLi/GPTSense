Oklahoma has several types of prairie grasslands including tallgrass prairie in the eastern part of the state, mixed-grass prairie in the central part of the state, and shortgrass prairie in the western part of the state. There are also transitional areas between these different types of prairies. Additionally, wetland prairies can be found in areas with high water tables, such as the Arkansas River Valley.
