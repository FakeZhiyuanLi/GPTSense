is considered a significant life event, the nature of the event, and the individual's personality and personal values. For example, a person may define their past self based on their high school years if they felt those years were formative and defined their social identity. Another person may define their past self based on when they got their first job as it marked their entry into adulthood and independence. Some people might identify significant life events such as getting married, having children, or experiencing a major illness, as the most salient experiential markers of their past self. Additionally, one's personal values and beliefs can influence the salience of certain experiences - someone who values education highly may define their past self based on their academic achievements, while someone who prioritizes travel and adventure may focus on their experiences exploring the world.
