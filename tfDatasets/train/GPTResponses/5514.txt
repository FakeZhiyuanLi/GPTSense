It is difficult to provide a precise estimate as the population data available for Aboriginal peoples in the 19th century is limited and often unreliable. However, it is estimated that the Aboriginal population in Australia declined by around 90% between 1788 (when the British first arrived) and 1900. By 1863, it is likely that the decline had already reached a significant percentage.
