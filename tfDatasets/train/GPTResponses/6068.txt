When a uranium (VI) cation binds to two terminal oxides and three or more carbonates, it forms a complex anion called uranyl carbonate complex. The uranyl carbonate complex has a pentagonal bipyramidal geometry with the uranium at the center and the five oxygens of the oxides and carbonate ligands arranged around it. The uranyl carbonate complex is a common species in the aqueous environment and plays an important role in the behavior of uranium and its mobility in the environment.
