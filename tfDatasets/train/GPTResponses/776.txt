Hermit crabs are omnivores, which means that they eat both plants and animals. In the wild, they feed on a variety of foods such as algae, plankton, shells of dead animals, leaves, fruits, and occasionally small insects and other animals.As pets, hermit crabs should be fed a well-balanced diet that includes commercial hermit crab food, fresh fruits and vegetables, and a source of protein such as boiled eggs, cooked fish, or commercial shrimp pellets. It is also important to provide them with a source of calcium, such as crushed eggshells or cuttlebone, to keep their shells strong and healthy. It is recommended that hermit crabs are fed in the evening, as this is when they are most active and likely to eat.
