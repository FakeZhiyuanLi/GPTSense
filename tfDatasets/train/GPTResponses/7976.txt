Lactating women need to consume approximately 13 cups (3.1 liters) of water per day, which is about 3 cups (0.7 liters) more than the average woman. This extra water is necessary to replace the fluids that are lost through breastfeeding and to ensure that the mother stays hydrated. However, it's important to note that the specific amount of water needed may vary depending on factors such as a mother's body weight, age, and activity level, as well as environmental conditions such as heat and humidity.
