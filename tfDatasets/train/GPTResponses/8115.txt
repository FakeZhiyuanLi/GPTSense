It is important to examine both the feces and urine when studying absorption. Urine contains waste products that have been filtered out by the kidneys, while feces contains undigested food and other waste products that were not absorbed by the body. By examining both of these excrements, one can gain a better understanding of the digestive and absorptive processes in the body, as well as detect any potential health issues or abnormalities.
