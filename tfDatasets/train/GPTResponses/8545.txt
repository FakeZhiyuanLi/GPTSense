The group that uses infinite field extensions with topology is algebraic geometry. In algebraic geometry, one studies geometric objects, such as sets of solutions to polynomial equations, over fields that are typically algebraically closed. Such fields are infinite and have a rich structure, and one often studies their topology to understand the properties of the geometric objects. For example, the algebraic closure of the field of complex numbers is an infinite field extension with a topology that is closely related to the topology of complex analytic functions.
