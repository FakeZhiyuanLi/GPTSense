States that enter into a treaty are bound by its terms and obligations. This means that they must comply with the provisions of the treaty and perform the obligations that they have agreed to undertake. The obligations may include things like opening up their markets to trade or reducing carbon emissions. States also have a duty to refrain from actions that would breach the treaty, and they must take measures to enforce the treaty within their own jurisdiction. In the event of a dispute, the states that entered into the treaty may resort to diplomatic means, mediation or arbitration to resolve the issue. Ultimately, the United Nations may also be called upon to intervene and enforce the treaty.
