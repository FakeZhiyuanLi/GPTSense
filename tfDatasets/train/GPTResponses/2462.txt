If a growth ring has differences over one season, the part nearest the tree's center would be narrower. This is because growth rings are formed by the growth of a tree during a growing season, and the width of each ring corresponds to the amount of growth in that season. If there are fluctuations in growth during a single growing season, this would result in a narrower ring, since there was less growth during that period. The outer part of the growth ring would be wider, indicating a period of more rapid growth.
