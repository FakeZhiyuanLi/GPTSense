The military junta takeover in Uruguay in 1973 resulted in the suffering of many people and the country as a whole. The government was overthrown by the military, and constitutional rights were suspended. Political opposition was not tolerated, and many left-wing activists were tortured, killed, or disappeared. Press freedom was curtailed, and censorship was imposed. The economy suffered, and poverty increased due to skyrocketing inflation and unemployment. The dictatorship also resulted in Uruguay being isolated from the rest of the world, causing economic and social development to lag behind its neighboring countries. Life became uncertain for many citizens of Uruguay, and fear became a constant reality for those who opposed the military junta.
