Strasbourg was never declared a Soviet government by insurgents. The closest event that may have been referred to is the Strasbourg insurrection of 1918, when left-wing elements, including Socialists, Communists, and Anarchists, attempted to seize power in the city. However, they were eventually suppressed by French troops and the central government in Paris.
