The Cossacks historically had a mix of various religious affiliations, including Eastern Orthodox Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. The majority of Cossacks were Eastern Orthodox Christians. However, during the period of the Hetmanate (1648-1782), many Cossacks converted to Judaism, as it was seen as a way to gain financial stability and protection from persecution. Additionally, some Cossacks converted to Islam during the Ottoman period.
