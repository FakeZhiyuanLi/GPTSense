The properties and characteristics of chemical compounds and molecules are usually analyzed by associating groups to them and studying the elements of the corresponding groups. This approach is based on the periodic table of elements, which organizes the elements based on their atomic structure and properties. By grouping elements according to their similar properties, it becomes possible to predict the behavior and properties of chemical compounds and molecules that are composed of these elements. Common groups that are studied in chemistry include the alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, transition metals, halogens, and noble gases.
