The earliest known American lodges were located in the Eastern Woodlands region, particularly along the Atlantic coast and in the Great Lakes area. They were constructed by various indigenous tribes, such as the Iroquois, Algonquin and Powhatan. These lodges were typically longhouses made of wood and bark, and were used for communal living, ceremonies, and gatherings.
