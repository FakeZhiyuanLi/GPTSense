Conifers use rosin to protect themselves from insects, fungi, and other pathogens. The sticky substance, which is produced in specialized cells, can trap and kill or repel insects like aphids and scale insects that may otherwise feed on the tree's sap or needles. Rosin also contains antimicrobial compounds that can inhibit the growth of fungi and bacteria that may cause disease in the tree. Additionally, rosin helps to seal wounds and cracks in the bark, preventing moisture loss and further damage from pests and environmental stressors.
