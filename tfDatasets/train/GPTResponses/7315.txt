If these new plants are able to reproduce, they will pass on their genetic traits to their offspring. Over time, if these offspring survive and reproduce themselves, the new traits introduced by the mutation may become more common in the population. This could result in a new species or subspecies of plant evolving. However, whether or not the plants thrive and successfully reproduce will depend on a variety of factors, including their environment, competition with other plants, and the availability of resources like water and nutrients.
