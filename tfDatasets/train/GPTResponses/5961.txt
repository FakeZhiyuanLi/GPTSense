There is no specific writing that mentions the Arian accusation that Athanasius was underage. However, it is possible that this accusation was made orally during the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD, as Athanasius was a young man at the time and had only recently become Bishop of Alexandria. The accusation was likely an attempt to discredit Athanasius and undermine his authority, as the Arians disagreed with his views on the nature of Jesus Christ.
