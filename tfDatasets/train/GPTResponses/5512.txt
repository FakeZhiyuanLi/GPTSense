It is difficult to determine the exact answer as there have been several large-scale fraud settlement cases. However, some of the biggest fraud case settlements include:1. Bernard Madoff: A Ponzi scheme orchestrated by Bernie Madoff that caused investors to lose an estimated $65 billion dollars. In 2009, Madoff was sentenced to 150 years in prison and ordered to pay $17.3 billion in restitution to his victims.2. Enron: The energy company's financial fraud scandal in 2001 led to its bankruptcy and the loss of $74 billion in shareholder value. In 2008, Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen, paid a $7 billion settlement for its role in the scandal.3. WorldCom: The telecommunications company's accounting fraud in 2002 led to its bankruptcy and the loss of $180 billion in shareholder value. In 2005, WorldCom agreed to pay $500 million to settle with the SEC and $2 billion to settle with its investors.4. Volkswagen: The German automaker's diesel emissions scandal in 2015 cost the company billions of dollars in fines, settlements, and legal fees. In 2019, Volkswagen agreed to pay $10 billion to settle claims from U.S. consumers who owned or leased affected vehicles.5. Wells Fargo: The bank's fake account scandal in 2016 resulted in a $185 million settlement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the largest fine in the agency's history at the time. The bank has since paid billions in additional settlements related to various other scandals.
