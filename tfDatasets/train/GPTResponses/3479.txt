Written musical notation is effective because it offers a standard way to represent and communicate musical ideas across different cultures, languages, and time periods. It allows composers to write down their musical ideas and share them with performers, who can then reproduce the music accurately. Notation also provides a way to preserve music for future generations, and facilitates the study and analysis of music. Additionally, notation allows performers to interpret the composer's intentions while adding their own personal expression, resulting in a shared artistic experience between composer and performer.
