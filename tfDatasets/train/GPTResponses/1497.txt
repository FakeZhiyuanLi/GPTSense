The basal ganglia is thought to be the central location at which several important functions are controlled, including movement, reward processing, decision-making, and learning. It is a group of interconnected structures located deep within the brain, and it plays a critical role in a wide range of both voluntary and involuntary motor behaviors. In addition, the basal ganglia is also involved in emotional processing and cognitive functions such as working memory and attention. Dysfunction of the basal ganglia has been associated with a range of neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Tourette's syndrome, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, among others.
