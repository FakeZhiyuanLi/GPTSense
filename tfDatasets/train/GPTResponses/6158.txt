The national event during WWII that left Seattle without Japanese businessmen was the forced internment and relocation of Japanese Americans in 1942 through Executive Order 9066. Over 120,000 Japanese Americans on the West coast, including many businessmen, were forcibly removed from their homes and businesses and placed in internment camps throughout the country. The majority of these individuals were American citizens, and the internment was later acknowledged to be a grave injustice.
