The federalism model in Canada is similar to the federalism model in Australia. Both countries have a federal system of government where power is divided between the central or federal government and the regional or state/provincial governments. In both countries, the federal government has powers over national issues such as defense, foreign affairs, and immigration, while the state/provincial governments have powers over local issues such as education, healthcare, and transportation. Additionally, both countries have a high court that is responsible for interpreting their respective constitutions and resolving disputes between the federal and state/provincial governments.
