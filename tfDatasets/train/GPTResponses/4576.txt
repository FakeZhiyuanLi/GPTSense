Racial categories for the U.S. census were declared prior to 1997. The first time the U.S. census included racial categories was in 1790, which included only three categories: "Free white," "All other free persons," and "Slaves." Over the years, the racial categories included in the census have changed and evolved to reflect the changing social and political landscape of the United States.
