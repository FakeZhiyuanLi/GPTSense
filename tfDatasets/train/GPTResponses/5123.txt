Gymnasts normally mount the uneven bars by running up to the springboard, placing their hands on the bar, and swinging their legs up and over the bar to straddle it. They may also perform a jump onto the springboard followed by a kip up to the bar, or a back handspring onto the mat followed by a jump to the bar. The specific mount used by a gymnast will depend on their skill level, personal preference, and the requirements of their routine.
