To provide mappings between characters in existing legacy character sets and those in Unicode, one must provide a mapping table that lists the corresponding Unicode code points for each character in the legacy character set. This table must specify the code point for each character so that it can be properly encoded in Unicode. The process of mapping legacy character sets to Unicode can be complex and may require the identification of equivalent characters that have different codes in the two systems. In some cases, it may be necessary to create new characters to represent previously unsupported characters.
