The oldest bronze art made by the Igbo-Ukwu culture was created using the lost-wax casting process. This technique involves creating a wax model, coating it in clay, and then heating it to melt away the wax, leaving a cavity in the clay mold. Molten metal is then poured into the mold and allowed to solidify before the clay is broken away to reveal the finished bronze object.
