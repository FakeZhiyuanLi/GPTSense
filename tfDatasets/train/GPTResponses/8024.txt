Bacteria in the gut play a crucial role in digestion by breaking down certain types of carbohydrates, such as from fiber, that the human body cannot digest on its own. Additionally, they produce enzymes that aid in the digestion of proteins and fats. They also produce vitamins, such as vitamin K, that the human body needs for various physiological processes. Overall, the presence of beneficial bacteria in the gut helps maintain a healthy digestive system and supports overall health.
