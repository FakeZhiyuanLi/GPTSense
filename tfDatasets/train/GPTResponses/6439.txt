Between 1910 and 1935, judges and police officers were required to disclose their membership in the Freemasons in England. This was due to concerns about the potential for conflicts of interest and favouritism within the justice system. However, this policy was later abandoned and Freemason membership is no longer required to be disclosed by judges or police officers in the UK.
