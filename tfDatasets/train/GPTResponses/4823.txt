spectroscopy?One important physical mechanism used to define near-infrared spectroscopy is the absorption of light by molecular vibrations, specifically overtones and combinations of fundamental vibrational modes. In the near-infrared region, this absorption occurs due to the stretching and bending vibrations of chemical bonds within molecules, such as C-H, N-H, and O-H bonds. These vibrations occur at higher energy levels than the fundamental vibrations, resulting in the absorption of photons with wavelengths in the near-infrared range. These overtones and combinations of fundamental vibrations can be used to identify and quantify various chemical species in a sample.
