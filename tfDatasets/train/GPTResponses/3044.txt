There were several new threats that arose after the end of the Cold War, including:1. Terrorism: With the collapse of the Soviet Union, extremist groups that had previously received support from Moscow turned to other sources of funding and began targeting the West with terrorist attacks.2. Ethnic Conflicts: The break-up of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union led to numerous ethnic and nationalistic conflicts that continue to this day.3. Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction: The collapse of the Soviet Union also led to uncertainty about the security of nuclear weapons and materials, and the possibility that they could fall into the hands of rogue states or terrorist organizations.4. Cybersecurity: The rise of the internet and digital technologies has created new vulnerabilities and threats, such as cyber attacks and cyber espionage.5. Environmental Degradation: The end of the Cold War brought attention to environmental issues such as climate change, pollution, and depletion of natural resources, which pose significant threats to global security and stability.
