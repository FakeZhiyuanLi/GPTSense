Both Ethiopia and Qing Dynasty China were able to prevent European powers from violating their agreements and encroaching on their sovereignty. They used military strength and diplomatic tactics to resist European imperialism and maintain their independence. For example, Ethiopia defeated Italy in the Battle of Adwa in 1896, preserving its autonomy and thwarts of Italian expansion into the country. Similarly, the Qing Dynasty China resisted foreign pressures through policies such as the self-strengthening movement and the Boxer Rebellion, which aimed to improve the country's military and economic power while also driving out European influences. Despite facing significant challenges, both Ethiopia and Qing China were able to uphold their agreements and defend their sovereignty against external threats.
