The Unicode 2.0 codespace was increased to accommodate the increasing number of characters and symbols that were not covered by the original codespace. As more languages and scripts were added to Unicode, the need for additional code points became apparent. This was necessary to represent a wider range of characters, including those used in historical scripts, mathematical symbols, and technical symbols. The increase in codespace allowed Unicode to continue expanding and supporting a diverse range of writing systems and languages around the world.
