IANA or zoneinfo updates are installed as a part of the regular operating system updates when changes to DST (Daylight Saving Time) policy are made. Operating system vendors release updates to ensure that their systems stay up-to-date with the latest DST policy changes. These updates include new time zone data files that reflect the changes in DST policy, allowing the system to adjust the time correctly. Users can typically install these updates through their regular system update process.
