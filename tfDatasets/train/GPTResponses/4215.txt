Orthodox Jews turn to halakha for guidance and practical application of Jewish Law. Halakha refers to the collective body of Jewish religious law, including biblical law and later talmudic and rabbinic interpretation and extension of biblical law. It includes a wide range of topics, from personal ethics and interpersonal relationships to ritual practices and the laws of the Sabbath and festivals, and is viewed as a comprehensive and binding legal system that governs every aspect of Jewish life. Orthodox Jewish communities are governed by halakhic authorities and rabbinic courts that provide interpretation and guidance on the application of halakha to contemporary issues and situations.
