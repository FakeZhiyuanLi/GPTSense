The first treatment for tuberculosis was fresh air and rest. Patients were advised to spend time in sanatoriums or in open-air tents to get fresh air and sunlight. This method was proposed by German physician Hermann Brehmer in 1854, who found that high altitude and fresh air could improve the health of tuberculosis patients. However, this treatment was not very effective and many patients died from the disease. It wasn't until the discovery of streptomycin in 1944, that an effective antibiotic was found to treat tuberculosis.
