The cellular structures of the immune system are housed in the lymphatic system, which includes lymph nodes, lymphatic vessels, and lymphoid tissues such as the spleen and thymus. The lymphatic system helps filter and remove foreign substances, waste, and toxins from the body and plays an important role in the body's immune response.
