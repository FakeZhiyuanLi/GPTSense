Control rods are used to slow down or stop a chain reaction in a nuclear reactor. Control rods are made up of materials like boron or cadmium, which are effective at absorbing neutrons. By lowering the control rods into the reactor core, they absorb the extra neutrons and slow down or stop the chain reaction.
