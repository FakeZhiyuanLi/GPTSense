The integration of the model of heredity with the model of variation began in the early 20th century with the work of geneticists such as Gregor Mendel, Thomas Hunt Morgan, and Ronald A. Fisher. These researchers helped to establish the principles of inheritance and genetic variability, which laid the foundation for the modern understanding of genetics. Their work led to the development of the modern synthesis of evolutionary biology in the mid-20th century, which integrated the principles of genetics and evolution into a single theoretical framework.
