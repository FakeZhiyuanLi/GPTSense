The United States wants to limit the power of the federal government under the federalist model, while giving more power to the states. This is often referred to as a system of federalism, where there is a division of powers between the federal and state governments. The federal government is limited in its power to specific areas like defense, foreign relations, printing money, and regulating commerce. All other powers are reserved for the states.
