Changes in DNA markers within a plant species can result in different phenotypic traits being expressed, which can affect the plant's ability to survive and reproduce in its environment. These changes can also lead to the development of new plant varieties or subspecies, which may have different uses or applications. Additionally, changes in DNA markers can provide valuable information for plant breeding programs, allowing for the selection of desirable traits and the creation of more productive, disease-resistant or climate-tolerant plant varieties.
