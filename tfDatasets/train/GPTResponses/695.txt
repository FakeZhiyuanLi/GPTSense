As increasing distance from underlying assets occurred, institutions relied more on financial intermediation and financial engineering to manage and mitigate risk. They also relied on the development of derivative instruments, such as swaps and options, to hedge against risk and improve liquidity. In addition, they relied on the use of securitization, which involves pooling together assets and issuing securities that are backed by those assets, to transfer risk to third-party investors. These practices allowed institutions to expand their operations and increase their profitability, but they also created complex and opaque financial structures that contributed to the global financial crisis in 2008.
