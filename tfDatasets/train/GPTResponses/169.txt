Colonies were a sign of prestige and power amongst European countries, as they allowed for the accumulation of resources and wealth, as well as the projection of power and influence over other nations. European powers were able to establish and expand their empires through the exploitation of resources and the establishment of trade networks, which led to economic growth and increased political influence. The acquisition of colonies was a key factor in the competition between European powers during the colonial era.
