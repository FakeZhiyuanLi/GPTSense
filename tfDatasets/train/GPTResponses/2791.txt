There is no conclusive evidence to suggest that Western classical music is directly rooted to ancient Egyptian art music. While there may be some influences and similarities between the two, the development of Western classical music is a complex and multi-layered process that draws from various different cultures and musical traditions. Some scholars have suggested that ancient Greek music may have had a more direct influence on the development of Western classical music, but this is also a contested area of research.
