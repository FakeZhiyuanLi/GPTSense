The highest levels of precipitation occur in the tropical rainforests near the equator, as well as in areas with high altitude and near coastlines where oceanic moisture is prevalent. Other areas with higher precipitation include the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, parts of Southeast Asia, and some coastal areas of South America. Additionally, mountainous areas can experience higher precipitation due to orographic lifting, which occurs when moist air is forced upwards over mountain ranges and condenses into precipitation.
