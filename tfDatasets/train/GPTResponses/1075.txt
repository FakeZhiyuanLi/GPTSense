Genes evolve through a process of natural selection, mutation, genetic drift, and gene flow. Natural selection occurs when certain traits confer a selective advantage, leading to their increased frequency in a population over time. Mutations, or changes in the DNA sequence of a gene, can introduce new variation into a population. Genetic drift occurs when chance events lead to the loss of certain alleles in a population, while gene flow occurs when individuals migrate between populations, introducing new alleles into the gene pool. All of these processes contribute to the gradual evolution of genes over time.
