The constituents of class 1 transposable elements, also known as retrotransposons, include:1. Long Terminal Repeats (LTRs): These are sequences that are repeated at either end of the retrotransposon and contain promoter and regulatory regions.2. Open Reading Frames (ORFs): These are regions that encode proteins involved in retrotransposition such as reverse transcriptase, integrase, and sometimes protease.3. Poly-A tail: This is a stretch of adenine nucleotides at the 3' end of the retrotransposon that is required for its transcription and insertion.4. Primer binding site: This is a sequence that is necessary for the initiation of reverse transcription.5. Target site duplication: This is a short sequence that is duplicated upon retrotransposon insertion into the genome.6. RNA intermediate: Retrotransposons replicate via an RNA intermediate, which is transcribed from the retrotransposon DNA and then reverse transcribed back into DNA for insertion into a new site in the genome.
