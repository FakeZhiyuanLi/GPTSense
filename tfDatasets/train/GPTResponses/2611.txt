Recent systems can record a broadcast HD program in various formats, including MPEG-2, MPEG-4, and H.264. These formats offer high-quality video recordings with minimal file size, making them ideal for storage and playback on various devices. Some systems may also support additional formats, such as AVI, WMV, or Quicktime, depending on the hardware and software features available. Ultimately, the choice of format will depend on the user's specific needs, such as playback compatibility, file size, and image quality.
