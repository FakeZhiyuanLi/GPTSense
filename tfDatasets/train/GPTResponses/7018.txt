The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) used molecular data, particularly DNA sequence data, to determine a phylogeny of flowering plants. Specifically, they analyzed the sequences of several different genes, such as the ribosomal 18S and 26S genes, as well as chloroplast genes like rbcL, matK, and ndhF. By comparing the genetic differences between different angiosperm species, the APG was able to construct a family tree of flowering plants that reflects their evolutionary relationships. This has provided a more accurate and detailed understanding of the patterns of diversification and evolution of flowering plants.
