The emphasis is on building strong, ethical communities that are grounded in tradition and are dedicated to serving God and one another. Orthodox Jews believe that by living according to the commandments and teachings of the Torah, they can bring about a world that is more just, more peaceful, and more loving. They are committed to creating a society that reflects the values of Torah and that promotes human dignity and respect for all people.
