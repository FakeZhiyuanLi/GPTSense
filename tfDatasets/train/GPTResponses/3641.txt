The first code in Europe is considered to be the Code of Hammurabi, which was a set of laws enacted by King Hammurabi of Babylon around 1754 BCE. However, if you are specifically referring to the modern-day legal code, the first known codification of European law was the Justinian Code, created in the 6th century by the Eastern Roman Emperor Justinian I.
