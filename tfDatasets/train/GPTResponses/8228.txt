Darwin studied various species of finches on the Galapagos Islands. These finches had physical characteristics that varied depending on their environment and diet. He also studied species of tortoises and iguanas on the same islands, which displayed variations in their physical characteristics. These observations led Darwin to believe that variation was a constant process that occurred within species and that over time, certain variations could be selected for or against, leading to the evolution of new species.
