Lamarckianism or Lamarckism is the theory that is based on acquired characteristics within a species. According to this theory, individuals can acquire traits during their lifetime through their interactions with the environment or as a response to their needs. These acquired traits can be passed on to their offspring, leading to evolutionary change over time. However, Lamarckianism has been largely discredited by modern evolutionary theory, which emphasizes the role of genetic variations and natural selection in shaping the evolution of species.
