The tourism industry can be traced back to ancient civilizations such as the Greeks and Romans who traveled to other cities for leisure and entertainment, as well as for trade and religious purposes. However, modern tourism as we know it today, with the rise of mass tourism and travel agencies, began in the late 19th century and early 20th century. The invention of new modes of transportation such as trains, automobiles, and airplanes made it easier and more affordable for people to travel long distances for leisure and exploration.
