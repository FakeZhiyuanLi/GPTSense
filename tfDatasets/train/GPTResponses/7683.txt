One way to show that Black Bermudians are of different heritage than African Americans is to explore their genetic ancestry. Both groups may share some genetic markers that are common among people with African descent, but they may also have different mutations that reflect their unique histories and migrations. For example, Black Bermudians may have genetic links to West Africa, the Caribbean, and the UK, while African Americans may have more diverse African ancestry with connections to different regions of the African continent, such as Ghana, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, or Angola. By studying the DNA of Black Bermudians and African Americans, we can gain insights into their distinct genetic histories and identities.
