Examples of classes of eukaryotes where genome only refers to the information found in chromosomes are:1. Vertebrates: This class of animals includes mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, and amphibians. In vertebrates, the genome is primarily composed of chromosomes containing DNA, with some mitochondrial DNA present.2. Plants: Plants have a genome that is mostly contained within chromosomes. The size of a plant genome varies widely between different species, with some having small genomes of just a few hundred million base pairs, while others have genomes several times larger.3. Fungi: Most fungi have a single, haploid nucleus containing their genetic information. This genome is contained within chromosomes in the nucleus, which are typically linear and may vary in number between different fungal species.4. Protists: Protists are a diverse group of eukaryotic organisms that do not fit into any other classification. They may have one or more nuclei containing their genetic information, which is contained within chromosomes. However, some protists may have additional genetic material outside of their nuclei, such as in plastids or mitochondria.
