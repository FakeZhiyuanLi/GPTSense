Bitumen is the usual term for refined residue from crude oils in the petroleum industry. It is commonly found in areas where crude oil deposits have been formed and extracted, such as the Middle East, Canada, Venezuela, and the United States. Bitumen is usually produced by the refining process of crude oil and can be found in various forms such as asphalt, tar, or pitch. The largest global producers of bitumen are Canada and Venezuela, which together account for around 60% of the world's total production.
