The development of the anti-aircraft missile caused a major shift in anti-aircraft strategy. Prior to the missile, anti-aircraft defense relied mainly on anti-aircraft guns, which were less effective against fast-moving aircraft. The missile, with its ability to track and hit targets at high altitude and speed, made it possible to defend against modern air attacks. This led to the development of integrated air defense systems to counter the missile threat, which remains a key element of modern military strategy.
