The major reason why the Latin-based regional romance languages of Italy should be regarded as independent languages rather than dialects of each other is that they have significant differences in phonology, vocabulary, and grammar. Additionally, they have distinct literature and cultural traditions, and many are not mutually intelligible. This suggests that they have developed independently over time, rather than simply being dialectical variations of a single language.
