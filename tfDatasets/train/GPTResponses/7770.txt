Some notable examples include:- The samurai rebellion led by Saig≈ç Takamori in 1877, which was sparked by opposition to the government's modernization policies- The Aum Shinrikyo cult, which carried out a deadly sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995- The student protests of the 1960s and 1970s, which challenged the government's economic policies and Japan's relationship with the United States- The Ryukyu independence movement, which seeks autonomy or independence for the Okinawa prefecture and has challenged the Japanese government's policies towards the region.
