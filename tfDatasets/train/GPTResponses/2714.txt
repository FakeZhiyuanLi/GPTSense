was originally recorded or shot. This means that the transmitted field ratio, lines, and frame rate should match the specifications used during the recording or shooting of the content. Any deviation from these specifications can result in a loss of quality or fidelity in the transmitted content. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the transmission equipment and protocols used are compatible with the original recording or shooting specifications to achieve the best possible fidelity.
