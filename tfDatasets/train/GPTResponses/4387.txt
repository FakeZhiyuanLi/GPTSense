Fighting between Palestinians and Lebanese began in the 1970s during the Lebanese Civil War, when Palestinian factions established bases and conducted operations in various parts of Lebanon. The conflict intensified in the 1980s, leading to a number of clashes and military campaigns, and continued sporadically in the following years.
