Friendlies help international teams prepare for major competitions such as the World Cup, Olympics, or continental championships. They offer an opportunity to evaluate players' performance, test team tactics and strategies against other national teams, and get familiar with the playing style of other countries. Friendlies also help managers to identify their strengths and weaknesses, adjust their game plan and improve their team's performance before these major competitions.
