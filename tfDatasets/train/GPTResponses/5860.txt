Mevastatin was initially discovered as a natural product produced by the fungus Penicillium citrinum in the 1970s. However, it was found to cause severe muscle toxicity and rhabdomyolysis, a condition that can lead to kidney failure. Due to its adverse side effects, the drug was withdrawn from the market in the 1980s.Later, other statins were developed, which were found to be more effective and safer than mevastatin. As a result, there was no need to market mevastatin as a therapeutic drug. Today, mevastatin is mainly used as a research tool in the laboratory, rather than as a clinical treatment for high cholesterol.
