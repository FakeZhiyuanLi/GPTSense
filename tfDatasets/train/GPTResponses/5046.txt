Imperial College London was founded in 1907 by Royal Charter, merging the Royal College of Science, the Royal School of Mines, and the City and Guilds College. The driving force behind the formation of Imperial College was Sir Henry Acland, a physician and educator who recognized the need for a new institution that would specialize in scientific and technical education.
