The victorious uprising celebrated in the Jewish festival Hanukkah is the Maccabean Revolt against the Seleucid Empire in the 2nd century BCE. The festival commemorates the rededication of the Second Temple in Jerusalem after it was reclaimed from the Greeks by the Jewish rebels known as the Maccabees. The miracle of the oil, where a small amount of oil lasted for eight days and nights in the temple lamp, is also celebrated during Hanukkah.
