Man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS) were first introduced in the 1950s, initially by the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The first widely used SAM (surface-to-air missile) by the Soviet Union was called the SA-7 Strela-2 (Arrow). Since then, many other countries have developed their own versions of MANPADS.
