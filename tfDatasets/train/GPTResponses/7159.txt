the de stijl movement took part in the aesthetic principles of neoplasticism, which focused on pure abstraction and a reduction of forms to their basic geometric shapes and primary colors. The goal was to create a universal visual language that could be used to create functional objects, architecture, and art. The movement had a strong influence on modern design, and its emphasis on simplicity, geometric forms, and functionalism is still influential today.
