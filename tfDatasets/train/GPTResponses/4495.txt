Early American leaders, such as George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, worried that a large standing army would involve America in foreign wars and entanglements. They believed that a powerful military could be used to oppress the people, and could potential lead to tyranny or a dictatorship. Additionally, maintaining a large army required significant funding and resources, which could lead to an increase in taxes and a strain on the country's economy. Therefore, they advocated for a small, well-trained military that could defend the nation when necessary, but would not threaten its democratic institutions or its people's liberties.
