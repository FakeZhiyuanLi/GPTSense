Cytokinins are responsible for promoting cell division and differentiation in plants. They also play a role in regulating plant growth and development, promoting the growth of lateral buds, delaying senescence, and regulating nutrient transport. Cytokinins also promote the development of chloroplasts, and help plants resist stress and disease.
