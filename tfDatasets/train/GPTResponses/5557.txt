The mechanical computer that used automation was called the Jacquard loom, invented by Joseph Marie Jacquard in the early 19th century. It used punch cards to control the weaving of complex patterns in textiles. It was one of the earliest examples of automated machinery and is considered a forerunner of modern computer technology.
