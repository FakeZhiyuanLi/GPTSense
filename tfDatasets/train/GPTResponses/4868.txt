The reflectance measured from a semiconductor wafer's surface in order to determine the index of refraction is called ellipsometry. Ellipsometry is a non-destructive optical technique that measures the change in polarization state of light reflected from a surface. By analyzing the polarization change, the refractive index, thickness, and optical properties of the material can be determined. Ellipsometry is commonly used in the semiconductor industry for measuring the thickness and refractive index of thin films and coatings on wafers.
