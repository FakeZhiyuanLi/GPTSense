The Victorian era, roughly from the 1830s to the early 1900s, saw Southampton become popular for sea bathing despite not having a good beach. Sophisticated and wealthy visitors came to the town and used the facilities of luxurious hotels to venture into the sea on the end of long wooden staging which was erected at low tide, known as a 'swimming machine.'
