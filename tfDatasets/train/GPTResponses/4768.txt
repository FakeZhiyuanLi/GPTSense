The technique that involves imaging with terahertz radiation is called terahertz imaging or terahertz spectroscopy. Terahertz radiation lies between millimeter wave and infrared radiation on the electromagnetic spectrum and has unique properties that make it ideal for imaging and spectroscopic analysis. It can penetrate many non-conducting materials such as clothing, paper, and plastic, and can also distinguish between different types of materials based on their unique spectral response. Applications of terahertz imaging include medical imaging, security screening, and materials characterization.
