Another popular activity that families are doing centered around their pet is hiking or walking together in nature. This allows both the pet and the family to get some exercise and spend quality time together outdoors. Some families even take their dogs on camping or backpacking trips. Additionally, some families are involved in pet therapy programs where their pets visit hospitals or nursing homes to provide comfort to patients.
