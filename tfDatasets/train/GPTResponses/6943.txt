Committing serious and/or violent crimes such as murder, manslaughter, rape, aggravated assault, armed robbery, kidnapping, human trafficking, drug trafficking, fraud, embezzlement, cybercrime, and terrorism can result in lengthy prison sentences as well as subsequent probation, large fines, and orders to pay restitution directly to victims. Repeat offenders and those who use weapons, cause bodily harm or death, or violate the trust of their positions (such as public officials, doctors, lawyers, or clergy) may receive harsher penalties. Factors such as the severity of the offense, the criminal history of the defendant, the degree of premeditation or cooperation, and the impact on the victims or society as a whole also influence the sentencing outcome. The court may impose mandatory minimum sentences, enhanced sentences, or alternative sanctions depending on the applicable laws and the discretion of the judge.
