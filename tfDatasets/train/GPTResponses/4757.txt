If an oscillation results in a dipole being changed, the molecule will experience a change in its electric dipole moment. This means that the molecule will become polarized and can potentially interact with other charged molecules or electromagnetic fields. In terms of chemical reactivity, the polarization can affect intermolecular forces, such as Van der Waals forces, and may impact the kinetics and thermodynamics of chemical reactions. Overall, the change in dipole moment can have significant consequences for the behavior and properties of the molecule.
