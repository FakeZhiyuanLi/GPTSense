The most notable vow sworn by the mendicant orders, such as the Franciscans and Dominicans, was the vow of poverty. This vow required that members of these orders give up all personal possessions and live a life of absolute simplicity and detachment from worldly goods. It was believed that by living in poverty, the members of the mendicant orders could more fully focus on serving God and helping those in need. This vow of poverty has remained a defining characteristic of these orders throughout their history.
