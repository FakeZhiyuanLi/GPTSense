There is no individual who holds a Republican position that some consider to be the monarch of Britain. The concept of a republican position is in direct opposition to the idea of a monarch. In a republic, the head of state is typically either an elected president or a ceremonial figurehead, such as a governor-general, who represents the country's sovereignty.
