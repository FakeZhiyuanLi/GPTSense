There is no act passed by Disraeli that allowed him to alter the Anglican liturgy. Disraeli was a prominent Conservative politician and served as Prime Minister twice, but he did not have any direct involvement in religious matters or the Church of England. The Anglican liturgy is governed by the Church of England and any changes must be approved by the General Synod, which is the governing body of the Church.
