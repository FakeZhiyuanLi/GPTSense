Edgar Allan Poe is considered a pioneer of the genre in America, particularly in the sub-genres of horror and detective fiction. His works such as "The Fall of the House of Usher," "The Raven," and "The Murders in the Rue Morgue" helped to establish the conventions of these genres in American literature.
