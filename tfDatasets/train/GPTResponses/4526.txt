The Latin language was brought to Britain by the Roman Empire during their occupation of the region, which lasted from 43 AD until the early 5th century. Latin was the official language of the Roman Empire, and it became the language of administration and governance in Roman Britain. Latin was taught to the local population and became widely spoken, especially among the elite and educated classes. The influence of Latin continued after the withdrawal of the Roman legions, and it remained the language of the church and of scholarship until the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons in the 5th and 6th centuries.
