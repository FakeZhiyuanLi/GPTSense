It is not accurate to say that any Nigerian political party is "mostly Christian". Nigeria is a secular country, and political parties are not religious organizations. Political parties in Nigeria are made up of people from different religions, including Christianity, Islam, traditional religions, and others. Christians are known to be members of various political parties, including the All Progressives Congress (APC), Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), and Social Democratic Party (SDP), among others.
