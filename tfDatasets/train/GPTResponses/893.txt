In around 100 CE, schisms were being caused by disagreements over various theological and doctrinal issues, such as the nature of Christ, the role of the Church, and the interpretation of scripture. These disagreements led to the emergence of various sects and factions within Christianity, such as Gnosticism, Marcionism, and Montanism, among others. These divisions ultimately laid the foundation for the later split between Eastern Orthodox and Western Catholic Christianity.
