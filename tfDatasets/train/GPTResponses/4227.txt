This means that Jews should strive to participate in and make positive contributions to the communities in which they are located, while also maintaining their distinct religious and cultural identity.

Ultimately, the goal of the Torah im Derech Eretz was to encourage Jews to reconcile their religious commitments with their obligations as citizens and members of society.
