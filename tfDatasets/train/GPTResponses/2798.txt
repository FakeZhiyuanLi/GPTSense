There are many applications for which organisms have been modified, including:1. Agriculture: Genetically modified crops have been created to increase yield, improve resistance to pests and diseases, and enhance nutritional content.2. Medicine: Genetic engineering has enabled the production of human insulin, growth hormone, and other drugs used in the treatment of diseases.3. Environmental remediation: Organisms have been modified to clean up contaminated soil and water.4. Bioremediation: Certain bacteria have been engineered to break down toxins and pollutants in soil and water.5. Industrial production: Modified organisms can produce valuable products such as biofuels and chemicals more efficiently and sustainably.
