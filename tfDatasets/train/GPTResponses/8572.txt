Modern sociology began to surface in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with the work of key sociologists such as Auguste Comte, Emile Durkheim, Max Weber, and Karl Marx. The discipline has since developed and expanded through various schools of thought, including structural functionalism, conflict theory, symbolic interactionism, and postmodernism.
