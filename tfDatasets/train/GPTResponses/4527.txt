Several countries served as American forward bases to wage war with Japan during World World II, including:1. Australia: The Australian mainland and its neighboring islands, particularly Papua New Guinea, served as critical American bases from which to launch attacks against Japanese forces in the Pacific.2. Philippines: The Philippines, then an American colony, was a strategically important location for the U.S. military during the war. U.S. forces stationed in the Philippines fought some of the earliest battles of the conflict against Japanese invaders.3. Guam: The island of Guam, in the western Pacific, was captured by the Japanese in the early days of the war. U.S. forces eventually regained control of the island and used it as a military base to launch further offensives.4. Hawaii: Of course, Hawaii was also a key American forward base, particularly after the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941.5. China: Although the U.S. was not at war with China, American military advisors and supplies were sent to China to fight against the Japanese invasion of that country. Americans operating with Chinese troops waged a guerrilla war against Japanese occupation forces.
