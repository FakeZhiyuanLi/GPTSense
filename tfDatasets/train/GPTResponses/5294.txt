The Treaty of Rome was signed by six European countries in 1957 and established the European Economic Community (EEC), which aimed to create a common market and eliminate trade barriers between its member countries. It also created new institutions, such as the European Commission and the European Parliament, to oversee and regulate the common market. The treaty is considered a major step in the process of European integration and the formation of the European Union.
