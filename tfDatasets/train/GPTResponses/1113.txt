The test used to determine whether the brain is active during sleep is called an electroencephalogram (EEG). This test measures the electrical activity in the brain by placing electrodes on the scalp. EEG recordings show that the brain remains active during sleep, and different stages of sleep can be identified based on characteristic patterns of brain waves.
