The first day selected to be the first day using the new calendar varied depending on the culture or society that adopted it. However, in the Gregorian calendar (which is the most widely used calendar today), the first day of the year was fixed as January 1st. The adoption of this date as the first day of the year was decreed by the Roman Senate in 153 BC.
