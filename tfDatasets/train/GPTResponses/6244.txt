The most common complex formed by the UO2+2 ion with organic chelating agents is the uranyl ion complex. This complex typically involves the bonding of the uranyl ion (UO2+2) with ligands such as ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) or diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), which contain multiple binding sites for the uranyl ion. The resulting complex is typically stable in acidic solutions and can be used for a range of applications such as analytical chemistry and nuclear waste disposal.
