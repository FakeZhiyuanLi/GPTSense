Bacteria can use a variety of substances as carbon and energy sources, including:1. Carbohydrates: such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose.2. Proteins: such as amino acids and peptides.3. Fatty acids: which can be broken down through beta-oxidation.4. Organic acids: such as acetic acid, lactic acid, and citric acid.5. Methane, carbon dioxide, and other gases: some bacteria can use gases as their sole carbon source.6. Inorganic compounds: such as ammonium or nitrate as a source of nitrogen, and sulfur dioxide or hydrogen sulfide as a source of sulfur.7. Photosynthesis: some bacterial species can use light as an energy source for photosynthesis, such as cyanobacteria, purple bacteria, and green sulfur bacteria.
