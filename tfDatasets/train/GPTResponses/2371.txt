When water content increases within certain limits in wood, it has a greater softening effect. This is because water molecules are able to penetrate the cell walls of the wood, causing them to swell and become more pliable. However, if the water content exceeds a certain point, the wood can become saturated and begin to lose some of its strength and rigidity. Therefore, it is important to maintain an appropriate level of moisture content in wood to ensure its structural integrity over time.
