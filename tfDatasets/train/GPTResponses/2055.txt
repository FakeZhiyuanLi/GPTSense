The Treaty of Waitangi is internationally considered to be an important document in the history of New Zealand and a significant precedent for subsequent treaties between European colonial powers and indigenous peoples. It is seen as a symbol of the relationship between Māori and the Crown, and a unique agreement between two cultures. The treaty has been used as a legal framework for addressing historical grievances and ensuring that Māori have rights and protections under the law. The treaty has also been recognized as a model for resolving conflicts and promoting reconciliation in other parts of the world.
