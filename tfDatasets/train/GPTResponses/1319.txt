Neurotransmitters attach to receptors on the surface of target neurons. These receptors are specialized proteins that are designed to recognize specific neurotransmitters and trigger specific responses in the neuron. When a neurotransmitter binds to its receptor, it can either excite or inhibit the target neuron, depending on the type of neurotransmitter and the specific receptor involved.
