Nassim Nicholas Taleb warned about the potential dangers of the buildup of complex financial products and the reliance on mathematical models in the financial industry. He argued that these products and models were inherently flawed and did not account for the possibility of rare but catastrophic events, known as "black swan" events. He also cautioned against excessive leverage, where companies and individuals borrowed large amounts of money to invest in these products without fully understanding the risks involved. Taleb's warnings were ultimately proven correct during the financial crisis of 2007-2008, where complex financial products, excessive leverage, and a lack of understanding of risk contributed to the collapse of several financial institutions and a severe global recession.
