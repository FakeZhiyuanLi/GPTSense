The szlachta (Polish nobility) began to lose legal and social status during the partitions of Poland in the late 18th century. After the partitions, the szlachta lost political power and their legal privileges were gradually abolished. They also faced economic difficulties as many of their lands were confiscated or sold to foreign powers. The social status of the szlachta declined as well, as they were no longer the ruling elite in Poland. This decline continued throughout the 19th century as Poland remained divided and occupied by foreign powers.
