Darwin believed that all living things had evolved through natural selection, but he also recognized that there were limitations to the process. In response to claims that certain animals could not have evolved through natural selection, Darwin argued that these animals may have evolved through other mechanisms, such as sexual selection or genetic drift. He also acknowledged that there may be gaps in our understanding of the evolutionary process and that new discoveries could shed light on how seemingly complex structures or behaviors could have evolved over time. Ultimately, Darwin maintained that the theory of evolution through natural selection offered the best explanation for the diversity of life on Earth.
