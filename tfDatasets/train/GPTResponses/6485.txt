There have been many regimes throughout history that have prohibited political parties, so it is difficult to provide a specific answer. However, some examples of regimes that have done so include the military dictatorship in Burma (Myanmar) in the mid-20th century and the socialist government of Albania from 1946 to 1991. In addition, some authoritarian dictatorships and monarchies around the world have also banned political opposition or severely restricted opposition parties.
