Calculating the days of the Gregorian calendar is not simple because it involves several factors, such as leap years, the length of the solar year, and changes made to the calendar over time. The length of the solar year is roughly 365.24 days, which is why an extra day is added every four years in a leap year. However, this system can become complicated when other factors are considered, such as those related to the introduction of the Gregorian calendar and the shift from Julian to Gregorian calendars in different parts of the world. Additionally, there have been adjustments made to the calendar over time to account for discrepancies between the solar year and the calendar year, which further complicates calculations.
