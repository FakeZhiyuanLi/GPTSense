Training for classical music is often required at a highly advanced level. This typically involves years of dedicated study and practice, often starting from a young age. Many professional classical musicians have obtained a Bachelor's or Master's degree in music and have completed additional training programs, such as conservatory programs or apprenticeships with renowned musicians. Additionally, ongoing training and practice are necessary to maintain proficiency and stay competitive in the field.
