Ethiopians supported the Allied Powers in World War II, primarily because Italy, under the rule of Benito Mussolini, had occupied and colonized Ethiopia in 1936. Ethiopian forces fought against Italy and its Axis allies throughout the war, and Emperor Haile Selassie actively worked to enlist support for the war effort from other African nations.
