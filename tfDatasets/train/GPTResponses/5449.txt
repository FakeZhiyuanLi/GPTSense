After the uprising of the provinces of Rio de la Plata, the Spanish colonial government moved its capital from Buenos Aires to Montevideo, Uruguay, in 1776. This was done in an attempt to better control the region and prevent future rebellions. However, the move proved ineffective as the region continued to resist Spanish rule and eventually gained independence in the early 19th century.
