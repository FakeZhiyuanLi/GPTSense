The words bitumen and asphalt are frequently used interchangeably to refer to a sticky, black, and viscous substance that is commonly used in road construction and maintenance. However, bitumen is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons that is extracted from crude oil, while asphalt is a mixture of bitumen and aggregates such as sand, gravel, and crushed stone. In general usage, both terms are often used to describe the substance used to pave roads, but technically speaking, asphalt is a specific form of bitumen that has been mixed with aggregates to form a more durable material.
