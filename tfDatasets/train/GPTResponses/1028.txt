The agricultural policy favored the production of food crops over industrial and cash crops. This was done to ensure food security and promote self-sufficiency in the country. The policy encouraged farmers to grow crops such as grains, vegetables, and fruits, which were considered essential for human consumption, rather than cash crops such as coffee, tea, and cotton. The focus was on increasing productivity and improving the quality and quantity of food crops to meet the growing needs of the population.
