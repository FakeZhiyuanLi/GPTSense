There are various kinds of experiments that require over four times the bandwidth of an SDTV broadcast. Here are a few examples:1. High-definition video streaming: Streaming high-definition video content, such as movies or sports events, requires more than four times the bandwidth of an SDTV broadcast. This is because HD video has a higher resolution and frame rate, which results in larger file sizes and more data to transmit.2. Virtual reality: Virtual reality (VR) systems require a lot of bandwidth to provide users with an immersive experience. To create a realistic virtual environment, VR systems need to transmit large amounts of data (such as 3D models, textures, and audio) in real-time. This requires significantly more bandwidth than a standard TV broadcast.3. Remote surgery: Remote surgery (also known as telesurgery) uses advanced robotics and communication technologies to allow surgeons to perform surgeries from a remote location. This requires extremely high-speed data transfer to ensure that the surgeon has real-time control over the surgical tools and equipment.4. Large-scale scientific experiments: Certain types of scientific experiments, such as particle accelerators or telescopes, generate massive amounts of data that need to be transmitted and processed in real-time. These experiments can require petabytes of data storage and bandwidth, which is far beyond what is needed for a standard TV broadcast.
