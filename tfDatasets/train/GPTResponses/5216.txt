The document that teaches that Jesus' brothers and sisters were older children of Joseph from a previous marriage is not found in the Bible. This idea is a traditional interpretation of the Bible based on passages such as Matthew 13:55-56 and Mark 6:3, which mention Jesus' brothers and sisters. However, the Greek word used for "brothers" (adelphoi) can also mean "brothers and sisters" or even "close relatives." Thus, it is unclear from these passages whether Jesus had biological brothers and sisters or simply close relatives. The idea of Joseph having children from a previous marriage comes from early Christian tradition and is not directly supported by the biblical text.
