of the age of the Earth?William Thomson, also known as Lord Kelvin, disputed Darwin's estimate of the age of the Earth for several reasons:1. He believed that the Earth could not have existed for millions of years because it would have cooled down and become a solid sphere by now. He argued that the Earth could not be older than 100 million years.2. Kelvin also believed that the amount of salt in the oceans could only have accumulated over a few thousand years. He argued that if the Earth was older than that, the salt content in the oceans should have been much higher.3. He also based his estimate of the Earth's age on the rate of cooling of the Sun, assuming that the Earth and the Sun were formed at the same time. He calculated that the Sun could not have been burning for more than 20 million years, which meant that the Earth could not be older than that.Overall, Kelvin's estimate of the age of the Earth was based on the principles of thermodynamics and his belief that the Earth was a cooling orb. His arguments were later proven incorrect, and with more advanced technology and scientific methods, it was determined that the Earth is around 4.5 billion years old.
