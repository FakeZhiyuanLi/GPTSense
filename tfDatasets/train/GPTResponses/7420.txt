Mosses are different from other land plants in the following ways:1. Lack of vascular tissue: They lack vascular tissue like xylem and phloem, which transport water and nutrients through the plant. This means they do not have true roots, stems, or leaves.2. Reproduction: Mosses produce spores instead of seeds to reproduce, unlike most other land plants.3. Water dependence: Mosses are found in moist environments as they lack a waxy cuticle and stomata to reduce water loss through transpiration.4. Small size: Mosses are typically small and low-growing, usually less than 10 cm in height.5. Habitat: They are commonly found in damp, shady places such as forests, bogs, swamps, and the sides of rocks or trees.6. No flowers: Mosses do not produce flowers or fruits like flowering plants do.7. Primitive features: Mosses are considered one of the most primitive groups of land plants and have remained relatively unchanged for millions of years.
