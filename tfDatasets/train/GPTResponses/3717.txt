ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) was first commercialized in the 1960s when it was used by telegraph companies for transmitting messages. However, it was primarily used for computer communication and became standard for digital communication by the 1970s. Its use in computers allowed for the exchange of data between different systems, making it a fundamental component of computing.
