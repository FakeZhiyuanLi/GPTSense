The use of higher value bills, specifically the $500, $1,000, $5,000, and $10,000 bills, prompted Nixon to halt their use in 1969 due to concerns over their use in illegal activities such as money laundering, tax evasion, and organized crime. The larger denominations made it easier to move and conceal large sums of money, and the government was finding it difficult to track and monitor the movement of cash in the economy. Additionally, other countries were also phasing out their high-denomination bills, making it easier for counterfeiters to produce fake US bills of similar value. By discontinuing the use of these higher value bills, the government hoped to reduce the incidence of financial crimes and make it easier to monitor financial activities.
