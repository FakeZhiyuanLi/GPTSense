The Ottoman Empire officially ended on November 1, 1922, when the Turkish Republic was established and the last Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, Mehmed VI, was deposed. However, the Treaty of Lausanne, signed on July 24, 1923, recognized the end of Ottoman rule and finalized the borders of modern-day Turkey.
