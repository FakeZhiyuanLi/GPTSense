Charles Darwin's views on the role of God in his theory of evolution were complex and evolved over time. In his early life, Darwin was deeply religious and saw his scientific discoveries as a way of further understanding God's creation. However, as he developed his ideas on evolution, he began to question the traditional biblical account of creation and the idea of a literal interpretation of the Bible.Darwin believed that evolution occurred through natural selection, a process that did not require the intervention of a divine being. He also saw the natural world as being full of imperfections and flaws, which did not align with the traditional view of a perfect creation by an all-knowing God.As he wrote in his book, The Origin of Species: "There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved."
