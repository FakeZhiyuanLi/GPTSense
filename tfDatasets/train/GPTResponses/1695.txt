redundancy or overlapping functions in the organism's genome, such that the loss or mutation of the essential gene would have a lethal or severely detrimental effect on the organism's survival or function. This assumption implies that the essential gene is a critical component of a biological pathway or process that cannot be compensated for by alternative or backup mechanisms.
