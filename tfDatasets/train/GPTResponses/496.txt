Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT) evolved independently of the regional technical college system in Ireland. DIT was established in 1992 as a result of the merger of several technical colleges and other institutes of technology in Dublin. It became a university in 2019 and is now known as Technological University Dublin (TU Dublin).
