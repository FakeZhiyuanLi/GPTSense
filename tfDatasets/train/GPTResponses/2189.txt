A material breach may lead to the suspension or termination of treaty relations. However, it is not an automatic outcome and depends on the terms of the specific treaty and the actions taken by the parties involved. The aggrieved party may choose to take other measures, such as seeking compensation or attempting to renegotiate the terms of the treaty before resorting to suspension or termination. Furthermore, some treaties may include dispute resolution mechanisms that must be exhausted before either party can take such drastic steps.
