is now known as the Protestant Reformation. This movement was led by figures such as John Smyth and Thomas Helwys, who rejected the idea of a state church and advocated for a separation of church and state.In 1609, Smyth founded the first Baptist church in Amsterdam, where he baptized himself and a group of his followers. This group essentially became the first Baptist congregation, and its teachings would spread throughout England and eventually to the American colonies.Baptists believe in the authority of the Bible, the priesthood of all believers, and believer's baptism (as opposed to infant baptism). They also stress the importance of individual responsibility and the need for a personal relationship with God.Today, Baptist churches can be found all over the world, and there are many different denominations within the larger Baptist tradition. Some well-known Baptist organizations include the Southern Baptist Convention in the United States and the Baptist World Alliance, which unites Baptists from around the globe.
