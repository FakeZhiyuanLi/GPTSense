The responsibility for mitigating and responding to threats to Canada's critical infrastructure lies with various government agencies and departments, including the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, Public Safety Canada, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). These agencies work together in partnership with critical infrastructure owners and operators to identify and respond to threats and to develop strategies for protecting and securing Canada's critical infrastructure.
