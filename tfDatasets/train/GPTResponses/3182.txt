A promoter sequence is recognized by RNA polymerase, which is the enzyme responsible for transcription. The promoter sequence is usually located upstream of the gene and contains specific DNA sequences that allow RNA polymerase to recognize and bind to the promoter. The RNA polymerase scans the DNA for a specific sequence called the TATA box, which is recognized by the TATA-binding protein (TBP). Once the RNA polymerase and TBP complex bind to the promoter sequence and the DNA forms a complex, the RNA polymerase initiates transcription of the gene. The specific recognition of the promoter sequence is essential for the proper initiation of transcription and gene expression. Different promoter sequences have different affinities for RNA polymerase and other transcription factors, thereby regulating gene expression at the transcriptional level.
