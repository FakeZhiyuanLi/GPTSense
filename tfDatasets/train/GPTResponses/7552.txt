In the United States, education policy is primarily made at the state level. Each state has a state board of education that sets policies for the state's schools. Additionally, the federal government plays a role in education policy through the U.S. Department of Education and federal legislation such as the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). As such, both state and federal governments hold legal authority for making education policy.
