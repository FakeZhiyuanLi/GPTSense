It is unclear what will happen after the 5-year embargo. It depends on the specific terms of the agreement between ancestry.com and the organizations that hold the digitized records.One possibility is that ancestry.com may negotiate to renew the exclusive use of the records for another period of time. Alternatively, the organizations may decide to make the digitized records available to other genealogy websites or platforms.It is also possible that the digitized records may become part of the public domain, which would allow anyone to access and use them for free. However, this would depend on factors such as copyright laws and any agreements made between the organizations and ancestry.com.
