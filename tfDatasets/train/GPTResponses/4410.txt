The first step of brewing when malted barley is mixed with hot water is called "mashing." During this process, the hot water and malted barley are mixed together to create a mash, which helps to activate enzymes in the barley and convert its starches into sugars. This is a critical step in the brewing process, as the sugars created during mashing are what ultimately ferment to create alcohol in the finished product.
