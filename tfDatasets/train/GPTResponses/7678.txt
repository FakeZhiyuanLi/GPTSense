The event that led to the decision for Parliament to meet on a regular basis was the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215. The Magna Carta established the principle that the monarch should consult with the barons (representatives of the people) before making decisions that affected their rights and freedoms. This led to the establishment of Parliament as the forum for such consultations, and regular meetings of Parliament became a key feature of the English political system.
