Parliament evolved from the Great Councils of feudal times in England, which advised the king and had some legislative functions. Over time, the composition and powers of these Great Councils changed, leading to the formation of Parliament as we know it today. The development of representative government and the growth of political parties also played a significant role in shaping the modern-day Parliament.
