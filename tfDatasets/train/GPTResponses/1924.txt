Corrupt people may manipulate their circumstances, such as exaggerating their need or concealing their actual financial status, to receive more assistance than they are entitled to. They may also bribe or influence individuals responsible for distributing aid to prioritize them over others. In some cases, they may team up with other corrupt individuals to establish a network of fraud and abuse in the distribution of assistance. This kind of manipulation in aid distribution not only deprives those who are genuinely in need but also undermines trust in aid systems and hinders the effectiveness of aid delivery.
