As a coastal city, New Haven experiences several effects on its weather. Some of the main effects include:1. Temperatures: Coastal cities tend to have milder temperatures than inland areas. This is because the ocean has a moderating effect on temperatures, keeping them cooler in summer and warmer in winter. In New Haven, this means that temperatures rarely get too hot or too cold, with average temperatures ranging from the mid-20s in winter to the mid-70s in summer.2. Humidity: Coastal cities can also be more humid than inland areas. This is because the ocean provides a source of moisture, which can lead to increased humidity levels. In New Haven, this means that summer days can sometimes feel sticky and oppressive.3. Precipitation: Coastal cities can experience more precipitation than inland areas, particularly during storm events. This is because ocean storms can gather strength over the water and bring heavier rain or snow to coastal areas. In New Haven, this means that the city may experience more rain or snow than nearby inland cities.4. Wind: Coastal cities can be windier than inland areas due to the influence of ocean breezes. In New Haven, this means that wind speeds may be higher near the coast, particularly during storms or other weather events.
