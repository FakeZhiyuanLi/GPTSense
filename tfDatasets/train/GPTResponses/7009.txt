Jedlik's improved device, also known as the dynamo, eliminated the need for a battery in electrical generators. This allowed for a continuous supply of electrical power to be generated without the need for recharging or replacing batteries. The dynamo converted mechanical energy into electrical energy, which made it possible to power a wide range of devices including electric motors and lights. The invention of the dynamo was a significant development in the field of electricity and helped pave the way for the widespread use of electrical power in modern society.
