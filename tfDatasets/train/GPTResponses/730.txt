The third strict precept on sexual misconduct is to abstain from sexual misconduct, which includes not engaging in any sexual activity that causes harm or violates the consent of another person. This includes avoiding adultery, sexual harassment, sexual abuse, and any other forms of sexual behavior that are not consensual, respectful, and responsible.
