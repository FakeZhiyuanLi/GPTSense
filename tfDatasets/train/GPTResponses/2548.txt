Before the 19th century, musical institutions were generally controlled by the church or wealthy nobility. In medieval times, the Catholic Church played a dominant role in European music, with monasteries and convents being centers of music education and performance. In the Renaissance and Baroque eras, wealthy nobles and royal courts also established musical institutions, such as court chapels and opera companies, to showcase their wealth, power, and cultural sophistication.
