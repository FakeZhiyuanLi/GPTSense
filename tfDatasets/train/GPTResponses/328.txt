Solar hot water systems use the energy from the sun to heat water. They typically have a solar thermal collector, which is a flat or curved panel that absorbs sunlight and converts it to heat. The collector is usually mounted on the roof or on a ground-mounted frame. The heated water is then stored in a tank for later use. Some systems may also have a backup heating source, such as an electric or gas booster, to ensure hot water is available even during periods of low sunlight or high demand.
