Radium was first used as a luminescent pigment in the manufacture of watch and clock dials in the early 1900s. The paint, known as radium paint, was made by mixing radium salts with a phosphorescent material like zinc sulfide. This created a paint that would glow in the dark without the need for any external light source. Unfortunately, the dangers of radium were not yet fully understood, and many of the workers who applied the paint to the dials developed serious health problems, including cancer and bone decay.
