The opposition of affirmative action believes that acceptance in employment or education should be based solely on merit and qualifications, with no consideration given to race, gender, or any other protected characteristic. They argue that affirmative action policies discriminate against individuals who are more qualified and deserving of a position or opportunity simply because of their race or gender. They suggest that an equal playing field can only be achieved through a system that is blind to such factors and focuses only on the abilities and achievements of each individual.
