During the medieval and early modern period in Europe, different ethnic groups were often lumped together based on their religious affiliation, rather than their ethnicity or nationality. Jews, Muslims, and Romani people were often seen as a single group, collectively referred to as "outsiders" or "foreigners". Additionally, people from different regions of Europe were sometimes grouped together, such as the "Germans" or the "Slavs". However, it is important to note that the concept of ethnicity as we understand it today did not exist in the same way during this time period.
