Courts may require software to pass various tests to determine if it is protected or infringing. Some possible tests include:1. Literal infringement test: This test compares the accused software's source code or object code to the plaintiff's code to see if it contains identical or substantially similar elements.2. Similarities test: This involves a comparison of the functionality and features of the accused software to the plaintiff's software to see if they are substantially similar.3. Reverse engineering test: This involves analyzing the accused software to determine if it was created by copying and modifying the plaintiff's software.4. Non-literal infringement test: This test evaluates whether the accused software performs substantially similar functions as the plaintiff's software, even if there is no direct copying.5. Sui generis test: Some jurisdictions have specific laws or tests for determining software protection and infringement, such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in the United States.
