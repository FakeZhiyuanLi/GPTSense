The migration of ospreys and honey buzzards is typically tracked using satellite telemetry. These birds are fitted with small GPS transmitters that allow researchers to track their movements and monitor their behavior during migration. The transmitters send regular updates on the bird's location and altitude, allowing scientists to identify key migration routes, stopover sites, and other important information about the bird's behavior. This information can be used to protect vulnerable bird populations, develop conservation strategies, and better understand the dynamics of bird migration.
