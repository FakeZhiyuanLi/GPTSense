A gene is a segment of DNA that contains the instructions for the production of a particular protein or RNA molecule. Genes are the basic units of heredity, and they determine the traits and characteristics of an organism. Each organism has a unique set of genes that determine its physical and biochemical traits. Genes are transmitted from one generation to the next through the process of reproduction.
