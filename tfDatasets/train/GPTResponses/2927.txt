One process that can discolor wood and make it look like heartwood is fungal decay. As fungi grow on and inside the wood, they produce pigments that can cause discoloration. These pigments can resemble the natural coloration of heartwood. Additionally, fungal decay can break down the wood's cell walls, which can alter its texture and cause it to lose its original coloration. Over time, fungi can also cause the wood to lose its structural integrity and decay completely.
