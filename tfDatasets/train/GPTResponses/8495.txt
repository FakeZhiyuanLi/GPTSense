In chapter one of "On the Origin of Species," Darwin admits that in his earlier work he had given too much importance to the inheritance of acquired characteristics. He acknowledges that there is little evidence to support the idea that acquired traits can be passed on to offspring. Instead, he proposes that natural selection acting on genetic variation is the primary mechanism for evolution.
