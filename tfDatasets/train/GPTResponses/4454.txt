The Mexican general who attacked an American city in New Mexico was General Antonio López de Santa Anna. However, it is important to note that Santa Anna did not personally lead the attack on a specific American city in New Mexico. During the Mexican-American War, Mexican forces under various commanders, including General Jose Joaquín de Herrera and Brigadier General Manuel Armijo, engaged in battles and skirmishes with American troops in New Mexico.
