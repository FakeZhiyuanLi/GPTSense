ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) and NADPH (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate) are both energy-rich molecules synthesized during photosynthesis in plants, algae, and some bacteria.The function of ATP is to serve as a universal energy currency that powers many cellular processes in living organisms, including muscle contractions, protein synthesis, and cell division. ATP molecules provide energy by the breakdown of the molecule into ADP (Adenosine Diphosphate) and phosphate groups, releasing energy that can be used to drive many cellular reactions.NADPH, on the other hand, functions as an electron carrier molecule that provides reducing power during photosynthesis. It is essential for the synthesis of sugars and other organic compounds such as amino acids and fatty acids. NADPH receives electrons from chlorophyll and other pigments during the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis and transports them to the Calvin cycle, where they are used to reduce CO2 to sugars.
