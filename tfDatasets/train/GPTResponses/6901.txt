An opt-out class action is a type of lawsuit in which a group of individuals collectively sue a defendant for damages or another legal remedy. In an opt-out class action, the individuals automatically become a part of the group unless they specifically choose to opt-out by a certain deadline. This means that all potential members of the class are bound by the outcome of the case unless they actively choose to remove themselves from it. Opt-out class actions are commonly used in cases involving consumer protection, employment discrimination, and mass torts.
