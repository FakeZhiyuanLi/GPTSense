Rebirth into the śuddhāvāsa worlds or pure abodes can only be attained by those who have achieved a high level of spiritual enlightenment and have purified their mind of all defilements. In Buddhism, it is believed that only non-returners or anāgāmins can be reborn in the pure abodes. These are individuals who have attained a high degree of spiritual advancement through their practice of the teachings of the Buddha, and have eliminated all cravings and attachments to worldly desires. They have achieved a state of consciousness that is free from all forms of suffering and are ready to attain final liberation from the cycle of birth and death.
