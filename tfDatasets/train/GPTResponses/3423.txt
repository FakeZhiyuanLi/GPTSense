Guinea peppers, also known as grains of paradise, are often used as a spice in cooking. They are commonly used in West African cuisine, particularly in stews and soups. Guinea peppers add a slightly peppery, slightly citrusy flavor to dishes and are sometimes used as a substitute for black pepper in recipes. They are also sometimes used in brewing as a botanical ingredient in gin and other spirits.
