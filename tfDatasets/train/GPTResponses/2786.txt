Classical works often exhibit a sense of balance, clarity, and order in their use of orchestration and harmony. The instruments are typically used to create a refined and elegant sound, with a focus on precise and delicate expression. The harmony tends to be built around traditional tonal structures, while also utilizing sophisticated modulations and chromaticism. Form is also a key component in classical repertoire, with a strong emphasis on well-defined and structured musical forms such as sonatas, symphonies, and concertos. These forms often consist of a set number of movements with clear thematic development and structural coherence throughout.
