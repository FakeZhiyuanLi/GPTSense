A possible product of duplications is gene amplification, which results in cells having multiple copies of a particular gene. This can lead to increased expression of that gene and potentially altered cellular function or phenotype. Additionally, whole genome duplications can also occur, where an entire set of chromosomes is duplicated, leading to polyploidy (cells containing multiple sets of chromosomes) which can have significant impacts on organismal biology and evolution.
