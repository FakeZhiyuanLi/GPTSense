Pharmaceutical companies tend to outsource drug development to contract research organizations (CROs) or contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs). These firms specialize in providing a wide range of services, including pre-clinical and clinical trials, regulatory support, and commercial manufacturing. Some of the top CROs and CDMOs include Covance, QuintilesIMS, PPD, Parexel, Catalent, Lonza, and Evonik.
