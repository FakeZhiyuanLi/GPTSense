To carry out empirical research, a researcher needs to identify the following:1. Research question or hypothesis: This serves as a guide for the research process and helps the researcher identify the specific problem they want to investigate.2. Variables: These are the factors that are being measured or manipulated in the study, and can be independent, dependent or control variables.3. Population or sample: The population is the entire group that the researcher is interested in studying, while the sample is a subset of the population that is used for the actual study.4. Data collection methods: This includes the instruments that will be used to collect data such as surveys, experiments, observational studies, or interviews.5. Data analysis techniques: This involves determining how the data collected will be analyzed, whether through statistical tests, content analysis, or qualitative analysis.6. Ethical considerations: This includes ensuring that the study design and procedures align with ethical standards, such as obtaining informed consent from study participants and protecting their privacy.7. Time and resources: The researcher also needs to identify the time required to complete the study and the resources required to carry out the research effectively.
