The most threatened ecosystems are found in tropical rainforests, coral reefs, wetlands, and mangroves. These ecosystems are being threatened by habitat destruction, climate change, pollution, and unsustainable land use practices. Deforestation for agriculture and mining, overfishing, and coral bleaching due to rising ocean temperatures are some of the major threats to these ecosystems. These threats have led to a decline in biodiversity, loss of habitat, and the extinction of many plant and animal species.
