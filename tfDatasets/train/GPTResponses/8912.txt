Dialects of Czech are commonly found throughout the Czech Republic, but they may vary by region. Some of the most well-known dialects include Moravian dialects, Slovácko dialects, Haná dialects, and Silesian dialects. These dialects are often associated with specific areas and communities within the Czech Republic. Additionally, Czech is spoken by minority populations in neighboring countries, such as Slovak Republic, Poland, and Ukraine, and these communities may also have their own dialects of Czech.
