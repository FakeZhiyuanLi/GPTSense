Some scientists believe that ozone depletion may have a role in influencing climate change and increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Ozone depletion can lead to changes in air circulation patterns, which in turn can affect global weather patterns and lead to changes in rainfall patterns. Additionally, increased UV radiation caused by ozone depletion can affect plant growth and decrease their ability to absorb carbon dioxide, contributing to the increase of greenhouse gases.
