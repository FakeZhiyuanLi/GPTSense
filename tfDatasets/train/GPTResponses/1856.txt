Legend says that Bern, the capital city of Switzerland, is named after a bear. According to the legend, the city was founded in the 12th century by Duke Berchtold V of ZÃ¤hringen, who killed a bear in the nearby forest and decided to name the city after it. Today, bears are still a symbol of the city, and there is a bear park in Bern where visitors can see live bears.
