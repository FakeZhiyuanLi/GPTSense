In Whitehead's view, philosophers engage in the activity of conceptual clarification and development. They strive to identify and articulate fundamental concepts and principles that underpin our understanding of the world, and to construct conceptual frameworks that enable us to make sense of our experiences and observations. Philosophers also seek to critically examine and refine existing theories and beliefs, and to generate new insights and perspectives that can help us to better understand the nature of reality and our place within it. Ultimately, Whitehead saw philosophy as a vital and ongoing process of inquiry and exploration, aimed at deepening our understanding of ourselves and the world around us.
