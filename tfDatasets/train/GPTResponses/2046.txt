The institution that must act to fulfill the party's obligations under a non-self-executing treaty is typically the legislative or executive branch of the government of the party to the treaty. The precise division of responsibilities between these branches may vary depending on the specific legal and political framework of the country in question. In general, however, the legislative branch will be responsible for passing any necessary laws or regulations to implement the treaty's provisions, while the executive branch will be responsible for enforcing those obligations and ensuring compliance with the treaty's requirements.
