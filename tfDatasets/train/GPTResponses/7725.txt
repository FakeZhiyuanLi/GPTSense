Tryptophan is an amino acid that can assist with the well-being of mice but not necessarily their growth. Tryptophan is important for the production of serotonin, which is a neurotransmitter that regulates mood, appetite, and sleep. Studies have shown that dietary tryptophan can improve the well-being and behavior of mice, but it does not appear to have a significant impact on their growth.
