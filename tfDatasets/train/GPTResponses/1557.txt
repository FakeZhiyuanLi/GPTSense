The use of "African" became an issue because it is often used as a broad label to refer to the diverse group of people and cultures across the African continent. This can perpetuate stereotypes and neglect the unique experiences and identities of individuals from different regions and countries within Africa. Using more specific labels, such as Nigerian or Ethiopian, acknowledges and celebrates the diversity within the African continent. Additionally, the use of "African" as a label can sometimes be used to imply inferiority or suggest that all people from Africa are the same, which is incorrect and harmful.
