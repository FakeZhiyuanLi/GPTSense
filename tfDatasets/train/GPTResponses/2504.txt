The Quran does not mention any specific person as being from a pious family. However, it does highlight the importance of maintaining piety within one's family and upbringing.One example can be found in Surah Al-Imran (3:33-34), where Allah praises the family of Imran (the father of Maryam, the mother of Prophet Isa) for their piety and devotion to worship. The Quran states:"Allah chose Adam and Nuh, and the family of Ibrahim, and the family of Imran over all people. They were of one lineage and of one tongue, and Allah knows and hears all things." (3:33)"Behold! a woman of Imran said: "O my Lord! I do dedicate unto Thee what is in my womb for Thy special service: so accept this of me: for Thou hearest and knowest all things." (3:34)This shows that being from a pious family is valued in Islam, and can contribute to the development of one's own piety and devotion to Allah.
