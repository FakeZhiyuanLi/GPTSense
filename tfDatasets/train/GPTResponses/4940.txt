Biodiversity plays a vital role in harbouring floral and faunal species. Biodiversity refers to the variety of life forms and ecosystems found on Earth. The higher the biodiversity of an area, the greater the number and variety of species of plants, animals, and other organisms that can be supported. Biodiversity is important for many reasons, including providing ecosystem services such as nutrient cycling, climate regulation, and water purification, as well as offering aesthetic, cultural, and recreational benefits. Maintaining high levels of biodiversity is crucial for preserving the world's ecosystems and the many species that depend on them, including humans.
