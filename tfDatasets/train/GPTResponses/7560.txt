Power factor correction capacitors are sometimes installed in parallel with the load. They are connected in circuit between the mains supply and the reactive power consumer. This allows the reactive power to be partially compensated, causing the apparent power to be reduced and the power factor to be improved. The capacitors draw leading reactive power, which opposes the lagging reactive power drawn by the load, resulting in improved power factor. The capacitors are rated in kilovolt-ampere reactive (kVAR) units, and the capacitance value of the capacitors varies based on the load requirements. The installation of power factor correction capacitors can help reduce electricity consumption and cut down on the cost of electricity bills.
