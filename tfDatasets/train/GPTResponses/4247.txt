Cells in plants and fungi are held in place by cell walls. Plant cells have rigid cell walls composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, and other materials that provide structural support and protect the cell. Fungal cells also have cell walls, which are made up of chitin and other polysaccharides. These cell walls help to maintain the shape of the cell and provide protection against environmental stressors. Additionally, in plants, cells are often interconnected by plasmodesmata, which are small channels that allow for communication and transport of materials between adjacent cells. In fungi, cells may also be interconnected by hyphae, which are thin, thread-like structures that form a network of interconnected cells.
