Many groups and individuals demanded drastic reforms after the war, including labor unions, women's suffrage movements, civil rights activists, anti-war protesters, and pacifists. Some of the specific demands included measures to address inequality, such as the right to vote for women and minorities, protections for workers through labor laws and regulations, and an end to imperialist foreign policies. Others called for the disbanding of the military-industrial complex and a focus on peace and diplomacy.
