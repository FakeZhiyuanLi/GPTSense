Asphalt is often reclaimed during road resurfacing or reconstruction. During this process, the existing asphalt is milled or ground up and then mixed with new materials to create a new road surface. This process is known as "asphalt recycling" or "asphalt reclamation." It is a cost-effective and sustainable way to reuse existing materials and reduce waste.
