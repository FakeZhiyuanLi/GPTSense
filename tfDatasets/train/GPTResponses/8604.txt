The science that is based on linguistics, mathematics, and engineering is called Natural Language Processing (NLP). NLP involves the use of computational methods to analyze, model, and understand human language. It combines techniques from linguistics, computer science, mathematics, and engineering to develop algorithms and models that can process and interpret natural language data. Applications of NLP include machine translation, sentiment analysis, text classification, speech recognition, and information extraction.
