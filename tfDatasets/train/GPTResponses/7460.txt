The exposure of film is changed by adjusting the amount of light that enters the camera lens and strikes the film. This is typically done by adjusting the combination of the aperture (the size of the opening through which light enters) and the shutter speed (the amount of time the shutter stays open to allow light in). Increasing the size of the aperture or the length of the shutter speed will allow more light to reach the film and result in a brighter and potentially overexposed image. Decreasing the size of the aperture or the length of the shutter speed will allow less light to reach the film and result in a darker and potentially underexposed image.
