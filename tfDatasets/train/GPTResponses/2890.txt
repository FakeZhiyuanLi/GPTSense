Symbols are preferred to be kept consistent with their intended meaning or representation. This means that the symbols should accurately convey the concept or idea they are meant to represent and should not be altered or changed in a way that would confuse or mislead the reader. In addition, symbols should also be consistent within a particular context or system, ensuring that they are used consistently and uniformly throughout a given set of materials, such as a document or collection of related data.
