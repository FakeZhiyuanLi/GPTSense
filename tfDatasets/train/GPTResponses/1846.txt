The Frankish expansion introduced the Frankish Kingdom to regions that are now France and Germany, including Gaul, Burgundy, and the Rhineland. They also expanded into northern Italy and the Low Countries. With this expansion, the Franks established themselves as a dominant power in Western Europe and laid the foundation for the Holy Roman Empire.The Bavarian expansion, on the other hand, introduced Bavaria as a significant regional power in central Europe. The Bavarians expanded their territory eastward towards the Carpathian Mountains and made alliances with neighboring Slavic tribes. This expansion allowed them to control important trading routes and establish themselves as a formidable force. They also played a significant role in shaping the future of the Holy Roman Empire.
