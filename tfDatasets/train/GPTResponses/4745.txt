Infrared (IR) lasers generate light that is not visible to the naked eye as it falls outside the spectrum of visible light. It emits electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths longer than visible light but shorter than radio waves. IR lasers are used in a variety of applications such as laser rangefinders, remote controls, and in medical procedures such as skin resurfacing and hair removal.
