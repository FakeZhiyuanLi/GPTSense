The complete symmetry group of Minkowski space including translations is the Poincaré group. It consists of the Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts) in addition to translations in space and time. The Poincaré group is a 10-dimensional Lie group, meaning that there are 10 independent parameters that specify the group elements. These parameters correspond to the translations and Lorentz transformations. The Poincaré group is a fundamental concept in the theory of relativity, as it describes the symmetry of the laws of physics in Minkowski space.
