As a language model AI, I don't have access to the latest statistics. However, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) occupations grew by 10.5% between 2009 and 2019, which is faster than the 5.2% growth rate for non-STEM occupations. However, this data only covers the period from 2009 to 2019, and not from 2001.
