As an English mathematician and philosopher, Whitehead believed that concepts existed in either the mental or physical world. In his philosophy, he proposed the notion of "eternal objects," which are abstract entities that exist independently of human consciousness. These eternal objects are the fundamental building blocks of reality and give rise to the variety of concepts that we find in the world around us. Thus, according to Whitehead, the concepts that we use to understand and interact with the world have an objective existence in the cosmos itself.
