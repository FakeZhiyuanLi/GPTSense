Collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) place their payments from mortgages into a pool. This pool is typically a special purpose vehicle (SPV), which is created to hold and manage the assets (in this case, mortgages or other types of debt). The SPV issues bonds or other securities that are backed by the assets in the pool. The payments made on these securities are derived from the cash flows generated by the underlying assets in the pool.
