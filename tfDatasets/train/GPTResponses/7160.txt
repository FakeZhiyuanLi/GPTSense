The Portuguese were expelled from Myanmar (formerly known as Burma) in the 17th century due to their involvement in the local power struggles and conflicts among the ruling factions. They were seen as a destabilizing force, and their trading practices were viewed as exploitative. The Burmese emperor, King Narai, also became suspicious of their influence and ordered their expulsion in 1639. The Portuguese were forcibly removed from the country and never regained a significant presence in Myanmar.
