The MP3 format uses a lossy audio compression algorithm to reduce the file size without significantly affecting the audio quality. This compression algorithm is based on the psychoacoustic model of human hearing, which identifies and removes the sounds that are less audible or masked by other sounds in the audio signal. The resulting compressed audio data is stored in the MP3 file format.
