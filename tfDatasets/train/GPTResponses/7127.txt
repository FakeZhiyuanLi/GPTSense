The Presbyterian government is known as "presbyterianism." It is a system of church government characterized by the rule of elders or presbyters, who are elected representatives of the congregation. This form of government originated in the Reformed tradition of Protestantism and is used by various denominations, including the Presbyterian Church (USA), the Presbyterian Church in America, and the Church of Scotland.
