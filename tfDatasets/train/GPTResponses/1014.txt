The Marshall Islands do not claim any territory within the United States. They are a sovereign nation with their own territory in the Pacific Ocean. However, the United States did administer the Marshall Islands as part of a UN Trust Territory between 1947 and 1990, and continues to maintain a military presence in the country through the Kwajalein Atoll.
