The number of nuclear warheads that can be made with 540 metric tons of highly enriched weapons grade uranium (HEU) depends on the level of enrichment of the HEU and the design of the warheads.Typically, a single warhead requires about 25 kilograms (55 pounds) of HEU, but some designs may require more or less. Assuming an average of 25 kg per warhead, 540 metric tons of HEU could potentially produce approximately 21,600 nuclear warheads.It is important to note that this number is theoretical and highly dependent on various factors, including the level of enrichment, the design of the warheads, and the efficiency of the enrichment process. Additionally, the international community is working to prevent the production and proliferation of nuclear weapons, including reducing the amount of highly enriched uranium in circulation.
