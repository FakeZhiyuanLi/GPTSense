Kampong (or kampung) is a Malay word used to describe a traditional village community in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei. It is typically characterized by wooden houses with thatched roofs, surrounded by lush greenery and surrounded by farmland or forest. The term has come to symbolize traditional rural lifestyle and communal living, often associated with strong community ties, cooperation, and mutual support. In urban areas, the term has also been used to describe informal settlements or slums.
