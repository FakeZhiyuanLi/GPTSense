As time went on during Queen Victoria's reign, Great Britain evolved into a constitutional monarchy, meaning that while the monarch still held ceremonial and symbolic power, the real power fell to elected officials and representatives in Parliament. This transition occurred gradually, with the passage of key legislative reforms such as the Great Reform Act of 1832 and the Representation of the People Acts of 1867 and 1884. By the end of Victoria's reign, the monarchy had become largely a figurehead, with limited political influence.
