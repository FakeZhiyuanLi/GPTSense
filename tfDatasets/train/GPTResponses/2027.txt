The strength and stiffness of the timber can be affected by the placement and size of a knot. Large knots in critical areas can weaken the timber and reduce its load-bearing capacity, while knots located in non-critical areas may have little effect on the structural properties of the timber. Additionally, knots can affect the appearance and durability of the timber.
