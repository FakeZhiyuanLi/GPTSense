Detractors used the idea of Mary's virginity and the virgin conception of Jesus to discredit Christianity and the divinity of Jesus. They argued that the story of the virgin birth was a mythical or fabricated account that had no basis in reality. They also suggested that the idea of a divine birth was a common motif in ancient religions, and that Christianity borrowed this idea rather than it being a unique and miraculous event. Additionally, some detractors used the idea of Mary's virginity to question her purity and morality, arguing that she could not belong to the same category of respectable women as other religious figures. Overall, the detractors used this idea to undermine the authority and legitimacy of Christianity and its teachings.
