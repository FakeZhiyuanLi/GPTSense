The income from petroleum allowed the government to fund various developmental projects and programs in the early '80s. Some of the areas that benefited from this income include infrastructure development, education, healthcare, and social welfare programs. The government was able to invest in road construction, build schools and hospitals, and provide subsidies to farmers and low-income households. Additionally, the increased revenue from petroleum exports allowed the government to invest in diversifying the economy and reducing its reliance on oil exports.
