King's Scholars get their name from the fact that they are scholars (students) at schools that were founded or endowed by royal or noble benefactors, and who are chosen for their academic excellence and potential. The term "King's" specifically refers to the royal patronage of the school, and may have been originally used to denote the students' status as wards of the monarch. King's Scholars are often given various privileges and benefits, such as financial support, exemption from tuition or fees, and preferential admission to prestigious colleges or universities.
