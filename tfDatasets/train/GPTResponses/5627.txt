Human Rights Watch has reported that Eritrea has one of the worst human rights records in the world. The country is known for its lack of political freedoms, freedom of expression, press freedom, and religious freedom. Eritrea also has a compulsory and indefinite military service program, which has been criticized for its forced labor practices, abuse, and torture. The United Nations has repeatedly expressed concerns about the human rights situation in the country. Therefore, the human rights in Eritrea are significantly worse than most nations in the world.
