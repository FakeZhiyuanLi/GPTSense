Many Ashkenazi Jews study secular subjects outside of the yeshiva framework, including math, science, history, English, and computer programming. Some pursue higher education at universities or colleges, while others attend specialized vocational schools or pursue professional training in fields such as law or medicine. Additionally, many Ashkenazi Jews engage in philanthropy, community service, and religious activities, including synagogue attendance and Torah study groups outside of the yeshiva setting.
