Most studies on Ashkenazi genetics have researched both paternal and maternal lineages. These studies have utilized various genetic markers, including mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to examine maternal lineages, and Y-chromosome DNA (Y-DNA) to study paternal lineages. However, newer studies often use whole-genome sequencing or genotyping arrays, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of genetic variation in the Ashkenazi population.
