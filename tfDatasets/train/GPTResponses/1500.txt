The Siddi are an ethnic group of African descent who live in various parts of South Asia, including India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. They are believed to be descended from Bantu peoples who were brought to the region as slaves or laborers in the 7th century by Arab and Portuguese traders. Many Siddi are now Hindu or Muslim, and they have assimilated to varying degrees into the surrounding societies in which they live. However, the Siddi continue to be recognized as a distinct cultural and ethnic group with a unique history and heritage.
