During the Triassic period, there were several important periods:1. Early Triassic period (251â€“247 million years ago) - This period was marked by a mass extinction event that wiped out approximately 90% of marine and terrestrial species.2. Middle Triassic period (247-237 million years ago) - This period was marked by the diversification of reptiles, including the emergence of the first crocodiles and the rise of dinosaurs.3. Late Triassic period (237-201 million years ago) - This period was marked by a significant increase in biodiversity, including the first mammals, the first turtles, and the first modern corals.Overall, the Triassic period was a time of significant geological and biological changes, laying the foundation for the evolution and diversification of life during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.
