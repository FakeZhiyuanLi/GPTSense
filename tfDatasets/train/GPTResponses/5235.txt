Most Protestant churches do not actively honor Mary, as many consider the Catholic veneration of her to be too close to worship. However, some Anglican, Lutheran, and Methodist churches may recognize Mary as an important figure in Christianity and may offer some degree of honor or recognition. Individual members of other Protestant denominations may also hold a personal devotion to Mary.
