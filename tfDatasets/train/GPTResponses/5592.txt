After expulsions from England and France, Jewish migration headed towards Eastern Europe and the Ottoman Empire. Many of them settled in Poland, Lithuania, Ukraine, and Belarus. Some also migrated to Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands. Later, during the 19th and 20th centuries, many Jews migrated to the United States, Israel, and other parts of the world.
