DRM (Digital Rights Management) is a technology used by content creators, publishers, and distributors to control the use and distribution of their digital products such as software, eBooks, music, and movies. It is designed to prevent unauthorized access, copying, sharing, or modification of digital content.Anti-circumvention laws, on the other hand, are legal measures aimed at preventing the circumvention of technological measures used to protect copyrighted digital content. These laws prohibit individuals from circumventing or providing tools and services that allow others to circumvent DRM technologies.Together, DRM and anti-circumvention laws aim to protect the intellectual property rights of content creators and prevent the unauthorized distribution and sharing of digital content. However, these measures have also been criticized for limiting user rights and impeding access to legal and legitimate uses of digital content.
