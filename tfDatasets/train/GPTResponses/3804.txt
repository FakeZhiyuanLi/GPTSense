Endorphins are another neurotransmitter or hormone that influences emotion. They are often referred to as "feel-good" chemicals and are associated with feelings of pleasure and euphoria. Endorphins are released during activities such as exercise, laughter, and sexual activity, and can act as natural painkillers. They can also influence mood and contribute to a sense of well-being.
