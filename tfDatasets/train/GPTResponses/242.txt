As per Buddhist tradition, Śuddhodana did a lot to ensure that his son, Siddhartha, became a king instead of a holy man. Here are a few ways he ensured that:1. Encouraged him to get married: As the only son of Śuddhodana, Siddhartha was expected to get married and produce heirs to the throne. To ensure that he did just that, his father arranged for him to marry a beautiful princess named Yasodhara at the age of 16.2. Sheltered him from the outside world: Śuddhodana was determined to keep Siddhartha away from any outside influences that might distract him from his duties as a prince. To this end, he surrounded Siddhartha with every luxury and comfort imaginable and forbade him from leaving the palace grounds.3. Hired the best tutors: Despite sheltering his son, Śuddhodana wanted Siddhartha to be well-educated and intelligent. He hired some of the best tutors in the land to teach his son the ways of the world, politics, and the art of warfare.4. Made him the heir apparent: Śuddhodana declared Siddhartha the heir apparent to the throne and groomed him accordingly. He taught him everything he needed to know to be a successful king, from diplomacy and statecraft to military strategy.5. Discouraged any religious pursuits: Finally, Śuddhodana strongly discouraged Siddhartha from pursuing any religious pursuits, believing that such practices would distract him from his duties as a prince and future king. Despite these efforts, Siddhartha eventually left the palace and became the Buddha.
