The most well-documented Cushitic language is Somali, which has a long history of written literature and script dating back to the 19th century. It is the only Cushitic language with a standardized orthography and has been used extensively in government publications, newspapers, and education. Other Cushitic languages, such as Oromo, have also been studied and documented to varying degrees, but not to the same extent as Somali.
