The biggest part of an immunologist's job is to study the immune system and how it functions in the body. Immunologists also work to find ways to prevent and treat diseases related to the immune system, such as autoimmune disorders, allergies, and cancer. They design and conduct research studies, analyze data, and develop treatments and vaccines. They also work with patients, diagnose and treat immune-related disorders, and educate the public on immune system health.
