Mild persistent asthma: Symptoms occur more than twice a week, but not daily, and nighttime symptoms occur more than twice a month.3. Moderate persistent asthma: Symptoms occur daily, and nighttime symptoms occur more than once a week.4. Severe persistent asthma: Symptoms occur throughout the day, and nighttime symptoms occur frequently.Asthma can also be classified based on lung function, such as mild, moderate, or severe asthma based on the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1).
