volume levels.MP3 files don't have a consistent volume level, so some parts of the audio may be too loud or too quiet. Without mp3gain, players that don't have the ability to adjust the volume of the audio would either have to play the audio at a consistent volume level, which could be uncomfortably loud or soft depending on the part of the audio, or the user would need to constantly adjust the volume manually.Mp3gain normalizes the audio by adjusting the volume of the audio file to a consistent level, making it easier for players without this capability to play the audio at an optimal volume level. This ensures consistent and comfortable listening, without any fluctuations in volume that could be jarring or uncomfortable for the listener.
