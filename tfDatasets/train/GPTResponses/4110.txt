The FBI increased its focus on counter-terrorism following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States. This event highlighted the urgent need for a more targeted and coordinated effort to prevent terrorist attacks and protect national security. The FBI has since worked to build its intelligence capabilities, strengthen partnerships with other agencies and organizations, and enhance its ability to disrupt and to dismantle terrorist networks within the United States and abroad. In recent years, the threat posed by foreign terrorist organizations and domestic extremist groups has continued to evolve, leading the FBI to maintain a high priority on counter-terrorism efforts.
