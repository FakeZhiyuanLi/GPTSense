Immunology is the study of the immune system, which includes biological structures and processes that protect against disease and infection. This includes the function, development, and regulation of the immune system, as well as the physiological and pathological processes that occur when the immune system is activated or fights against pathogens. Immunology also studies the interactions between the immune system and other biological systems such as the microbiome, the nervous system, and the endocrine system.
