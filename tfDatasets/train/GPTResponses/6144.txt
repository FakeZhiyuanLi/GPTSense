Psychologists recognize that sexual orientation can also encompass a person's emotional, romantic, and affectional attractions to other people. This means that a person's sexual orientation is not just focused on their sexual behaviors or preferences, but also on their overall attraction and desire for both physical and emotional intimacy with others. Psychologists also recognize that sexual orientation is a complex and multi-dimensional aspect of a person's identity, which can be influenced by a range of biological, genetic, social, and cultural factors.
