Migrating birds navigate using a variety of different techniques. Some birds use the position of the sun to determine direction, while others use the stars. Birds also use the earth's magnetic field to navigate, with many species possessing a magnetic compass that allows them to sense north and south. Some birds can also use visual landmarks such as rivers, coastlines, and mountains to navigate. Birds may also use olfactory cues to guide their migration, detecting changes in wind patterns that can direct them towards their destination. Finally, some birds rely on instinct and memory, using their previous experience and knowledge of migratory routes to guide them.
