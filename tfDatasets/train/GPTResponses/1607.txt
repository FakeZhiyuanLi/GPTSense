One aspect of immunology that is becoming more specialized is the study of immunotherapy, which focuses on the development of therapies that enhance the immune system's ability to fight diseases, such as cancer and autoimmune disorders. This field includes the study of various types of immune cells, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and targeted antigen-specific therapies that can modulate immune responses. Immunotherapy has shown great promise in recent years and is a rapidly evolving and expanding field of research within immunology.
