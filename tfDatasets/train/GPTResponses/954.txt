When RNA molecules are the actual functional products, the synthesis that occurs is called transcription. During transcription, a DNA template is used to create an RNA molecule with a complementary sequence. The RNA molecule can then perform a variety of functions, such as serving as a messenger RNA (mRNA) for translation into protein, acting as a catalyst (ribozyme), or regulating gene expression (microRNA).
