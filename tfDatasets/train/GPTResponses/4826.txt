President Franklin D. Roosevelt confiscated gold coins through Executive Order 6102 in 1933. The order required citizens to turn in their gold coins, bullion, and certificates to the Federal Reserve in exchange for paper currency. The confiscation was part of Roosevelt's plan to stabilize the economy during the Great Depression by preventing hoarding of gold and promoting spending. The order remained in effect until 1974.
