If 1 were considered as a prime number, the sieve of Eratosthenes would yield all the natural numbers as prime numbers, as there would be no criteria to exclude any number from being a prime. However, traditionally, 1 is not considered as a prime number, as it does not satisfy the two fundamental properties of primes, i.e., being divisible by only 1 and itself and having an infinite number of multiples.
