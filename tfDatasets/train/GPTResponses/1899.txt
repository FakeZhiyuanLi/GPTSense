Castles were originally built out of stone or wood, or a combination of both. In medieval times, stone was the preferred material for building castles because it was stronger and more durable than wood. However, wooden palisades and motte-and-bailey castles were also commonly used during the early medieval period. Later, more advanced castles were built using stone walls, towers, and fortifications.
