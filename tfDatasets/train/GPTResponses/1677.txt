Mauretania was also known for its rich natural resources, including minerals like gold, silver, and copper, as well as agricultural products such as wheat, olives, and dates. The kingdom's location on the coast of the Mediterranean made it an important hub for trade and commerce, with goods passing through its ports to Rome and other major cities in the region.In the later centuries of the Roman Empire, Mauretania became a province of the Empire and was gradually absorbed into the broader Roman culture. This period saw the construction of numerous impressive public works, including amphitheaters, aqueducts, and roads. However, the arrival of Arab and Berber invaders in the 7th and 8th centuries led to the eventual collapse of the kingdom and the emergence of new states in the region.
