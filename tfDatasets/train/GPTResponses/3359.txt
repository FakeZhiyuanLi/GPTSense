The polyphonic vocal genre began to develop in the medieval period, specifically in the 12th century. Polyphony is the use of multiple independent melodic lines in vocal or instrumental music, and it was first developed in the schools of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. The earliest known manuscript containing polyphonic music is the Magnus Liber Organi, which dates back to the late 12th century. Polyphony continued to evolve and develop into the Renaissance period and beyond.
