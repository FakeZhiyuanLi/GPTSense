There are several factors that can trigger a destructive immune response in CST (Central Sensitization Syndrome) including:1. Infections: An immune response to infections can sometimes become overactive and trigger widespread inflammation and tissue damage.2. Autoimmune disorders: Autoimmune disorders are conditions in which the immune system attacks healthy tissues and organs, leading to chronic inflammation.3. Trauma: Trauma or injury to the body can cause an immune response that leads to inflammation and tissue damage.4. Allergies: Allergic reactions can cause an immune response that triggers inflammation and tissue damage.5. Chronic stress: Chronic stress can weaken the immune system and make it more likely to trigger an overactive immune response.6. Environmental factors: Exposure to pollutants or toxins can trigger an immune response that leads to chronic inflammation and tissue damage.
