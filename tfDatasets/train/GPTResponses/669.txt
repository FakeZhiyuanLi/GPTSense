The first of the Four Noble Truths in Buddhism explains that suffering (dukkha) exists in the world. It suggests that life is inherently unsatisfactory, and that all living beings will experience pain, illness, aging, and death. This suffering is not limited to physical pain, but also includes emotional and mental pain such as anxiety, stress, and dissatisfaction. The first noble truth encourages individuals to recognize the reality of suffering and to seek a path towards liberation from it.
