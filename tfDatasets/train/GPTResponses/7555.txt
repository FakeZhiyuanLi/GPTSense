The use of combinations of antibiotics for active TB prevents the development of drug-resistant strains of TB bacteria. TB bacteria have the ability to mutate and develop resistance to antibiotics, particularly when they are exposed to only one type of antibiotic. Combination therapy, which involves the use of multiple antibiotics simultaneously, minimizes the risk of bacterial resistance by attacking TB bacteria from multiple angles. This helps improve treatment outcomes and prevent the spread of drug-resistant TB strains.
