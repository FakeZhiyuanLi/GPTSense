The primary causes of light loss include:1. Absorption: When light travels through a medium like air, water, or glass, it can be absorbed by the medium, causing it to lose intensity.2. Reflection: Light can be reflected off surfaces, leading to a loss of light intensity. This can be particularly problematic in areas with highly reflective surfaces or poor room design.3. Refraction: When light passes through a medium with a different refractive index (such as from air to water), it can bend and lose intensity.4. Scattering: Light can be scattered by particles in the air, causing it to spread out and lose intensity.5. Dispersion: Different wavelengths of light can be separated or dispersed, causing a loss of intensity.6. Distance: As light travels further away from its source, it becomes less intense due to spreading out over a larger area.7. Obstruction: Physical barriers such as walls, pillars, or furniture can block the path of light, leading to a loss of intensity.
