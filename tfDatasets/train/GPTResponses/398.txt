Between 1996 and 2004, the U.S. borrowed money from several emerging economies to finance its imports. Some of these countries include:1. China2. Japan3. South Korea4. Taiwan5. Singapore6. Thailand7. Malaysia8. Brazil9. Mexico10. RussiaThese countries provided financing in the form of loans or by buying U.S. government bonds. This allowed the U.S. to continue importing goods without having to reduce consumption or increase interest rates. However, this also contributed to the growing trade deficit and increasing debt levels of the U.S. during this period.
