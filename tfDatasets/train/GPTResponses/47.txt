The Constitution Act of 1982, which included the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, provided much of the basis for the structure of the parliament in 1995. The act established the Parliament of Canada as a bicameral legislature, with the Senate and the House of Commons. It also outlined the powers and responsibilities of each branch of government and established provisions for the election of Members of Parliament and Senators. Additionally, the act recognized the importance of minority language rights and representation in parliament.
