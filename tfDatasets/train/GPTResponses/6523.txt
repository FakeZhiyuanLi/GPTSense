During World War I, valuable items from Buckingham Palace were taken and moved to a safer location. Some items were taken to Windsor Castle, Sandringham House, and other royal residences. Precious jewels, such as the Koh-i-Noor diamond, were kept in the Tower of London. The Palace was also used as a convalescent home for wounded soldiers during the war.
