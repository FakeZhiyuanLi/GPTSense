The period of division in China was primarily caused by the collapse of the Tang dynasty in the 10th century. This led to a power vacuum in which regional warlords, ethnic minorities, and foreign powers all vied for control. Additionally, a series of rebellions, natural disasters, and economic difficulties also contributed to the fragmentation of China into smaller states. The result was a period of division and instability that lasted from the 10th century until the reunification of China under the Song dynasty in the 12th century.
