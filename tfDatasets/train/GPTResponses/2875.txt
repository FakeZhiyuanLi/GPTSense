Johann Sebastian Bach's Brandenburg Concertos were written in the Baroque era, which pre-dated the invention of recording technology. The first recording of the Brandenburg Concertos were made in the 1920s, using mechanical recording techniques that captured the performance onto a wax cylinder or disc. In modern times, recordings of the Brandenburg Concertos have been made using a variety of technologies, including analog tape, digital recording, and high-resolution formats such as SACD and Blu-Ray.
