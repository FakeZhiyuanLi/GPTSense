The cabildo is a Spanish term that refers to the town council or municipal government in Latin American countries, particularly those with a colonial history. It was established during the Spanish colonial period as a form of local government in which local officials were appointed by the Spanish crown to administer municipal affairs. Today, the term is still used in many Latin American countries to refer to the local government in smaller towns and cities.
