A tree increases its diameter through a process called secondary growth, which involves the formation of new tissue in the cambium layer. The cambium layer is a thin layer of living cells located just below the bark that produces new cells which divide and differentiate into two types of tissues: xylem and phloem.Xylem is responsible for transporting water and nutrients from the roots to the rest of the tree, while phloem transports sugars and other organic molecules to the parts of the tree that need them. As these new cells are produced, they gradually expand and harden, forming a ring of wood around the outside of the trunk. Each year, a new layer of wood is added, causing the tree's diameter to increase.Over time, the annual growth rings become visible as concentric circles on the cut surface of the tree trunk. The age of the tree can be estimated by counting the number of rings, as each ring represents one year of growth.
