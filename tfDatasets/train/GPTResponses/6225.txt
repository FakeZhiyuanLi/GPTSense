Sexual identity would be the most accurate in determining the number of homosexuals in a population. This is because sexual identity refers to a person's self-identification as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or heterosexual. It is a more reliable indicator of sexual orientation as it reflects how individuals perceive and identify themselves. In contrast, sexual attraction and behavior may fluctuate over time, and individuals may not always act or express their sexual desires. Furthermore, there may be individuals who experience same-sex attraction or engage in same-sex behavior but do not identify as homosexual. Therefore, sexual identity provides a more accurate measure of the number of individuals who identify as homosexual.
