One aircraft design feature that improves launch and recovery cycle flexibility is a retractable landing gear. This allows the aircraft to take off and land on different types of surfaces and in different conditions, making it more adaptable to changing environments and mission requirements. Additionally, a retractable landing gear can reduce drag and improve the aircraft's performance in flight.
