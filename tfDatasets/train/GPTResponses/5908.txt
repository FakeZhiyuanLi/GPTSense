The development of advanced sensors and detection technology continues to grow along with stealth technology. As stealth technology improves, so does the ability to detect it. To maintain their effectiveness, stealth technologies must constantly evolve and adapt to stay ahead of detection methods. This leads to a constant arms race between developing stealth technology and improving the ability to detect it. Additionally, the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in both stealth and detection technologies is also rapidly advancing.
