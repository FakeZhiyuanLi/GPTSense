Many anthropologists served in academia, conducting research, teaching at universities and colleges, and publishing their findings in academic journals and books. Some anthropologists also worked for government agencies, international organizations, or non-governmental organizations, conducting research and providing expertise on issues related to culture, human behavior, and social development. Additionally, some anthropologists worked as consultants for businesses or corporations, helping them to understand and navigate different cultural contexts in order to develop effective marketing strategies or improve employee relations.
