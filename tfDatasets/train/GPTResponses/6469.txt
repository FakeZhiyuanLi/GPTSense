Arsenal wore dark red shirts in their last season at Highbury as a tribute to the club's original colours when they were founded in 1886. The colour was known as "Blood-Red" and was a nod to the name of the club's first ground, located on the site of what is now a tube station called Gillespie Road. The dark red kit was a way to pay homage to the club's history and heritage as they said goodbye to their long-time home at Highbury.
