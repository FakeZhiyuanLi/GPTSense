The Paris Agreement on Climate Change is an example of a treaty from which it is not possible to withdraw for a period of three years after its entry into force. This means that a country that wishes to withdraw from the agreement must wait for three years before their withdrawal becomes effective. The three-year waiting period is intended to discourage countries from withdrawing and to encourage continued participation in global efforts to mitigate climate change.
