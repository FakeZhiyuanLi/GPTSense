There have been several incidents where activists or protesters have climbed the Eiffel Tower to hang banners, so it's hard to pinpoint one specific person. Some notable instances include:- In 2008, Greenpeace activists climbed the tower to hang a banner calling for action against climate change.- In 2013, a Russian protester climbed the tower to unfurl a banner calling for the release of political prisoners in Russia.- In 2019, a man climbed the tower without ropes and unfurled a banner calling for the resignation of the French president Emmanuel Macron.It's worth noting that climbing the Eiffel Tower without permission is illegal and can result in fines and legal action.
