Infrared radiation is also used in several other applications such as:1. Security: Infrared cameras are used for surveillance and security purposes as they can detect body heat and movements in low light conditions.2. Heating: Infrared heaters are used to warm up spaces as they emit energy in the form of heat and are more energy efficient than traditional heaters.3. Food industry: Infrared technology is used to cook, bake, and grill food as it offers quicker heating, better control over temperature, and an even cooking process.4. Astronomy: Infrared telescopes are used to study the universe as they can detect radiation emitted by stars, planets, and other celestial bodies.5. Agriculture: Infrared sensors are used to monitor crops and soil temperature, moisture levels, and nutrient content to optimize crop growth.6. Automotive: Infrared sensors are used in cars to detect objects and obstacles, providing drivers with warnings and safety alerts.7. Medical imaging: Infrared technology is used in medical imaging to detect and diagnose health problems as it can penetrate tissues and produce detailed images.
