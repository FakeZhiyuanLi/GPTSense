Corruption can lower compliance with environmental regulations. When corrupt practices such as bribery, nepotism, and embezzlement are rampant in regulatory agencies, companies can obtain permits or exemptions through illegal means. This leads to non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations, which can result in environmental degradation, pollution, and health risks for the population. Furthermore, corruption can inhibit the enforcement of environmental regulations, as inspectors and regulators may turn a blind eye or receive incentives for overlooking violations. Overall, corruption undermines the effectiveness of environmental regulations and weakens their ability to protect the environment and public health.
