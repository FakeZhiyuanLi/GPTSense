Adolescents develop a more sophisticated understanding of mathematical concepts thanks to their increased hypothetical thinking abilities. This allows them to grasp more abstract concepts, see relationships between mathematical concepts and apply them in real-world contexts, and use logic and reasoning to solve complex mathematical problems. They are able to abstract, generalize, and formalize mathematical concepts, which enables them to think more deeply about math and develop more complex mathematical reasoning skills. Additionally, their increased ability to think critically allows them to approach mathematical problems from different angles and creatively solve problems using novel and innovative methods.
