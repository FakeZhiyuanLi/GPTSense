Saint Jerome, a prominent churchman and theologian in the 4th century, was influential in the development of the Winchester standard. He was responsible for translating the Bible into Latin, which became the standard version of the Bible in Western Christianity for centuries. The Winchester standard, also known as the Wycliffe Bible, was a later English translation of the Bible based on the Latin Vulgate that was completed in the late 14th century.
