When reduced carbon compounds in food are broken down, they release stored solar energy in the form of chemical energy in the bonds between atoms. This chemical energy is released through a series of metabolic reactions, which break down the molecules into simpler compounds that can then be used by cells to produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the energy currency of cells.The breakdown of glucose, for example, releases energy through a process called cellular respiration, which involves a series of biochemical reactions that convert glucose into ATP. During this process, glucose is broken down into smaller molecules such as pyruvate, which is then converted into acetyl-CoA and enters the Krebs cycle. The Krebs cycle produces ATP as well as other energy-rich compounds such as NADH and FADH2, which are used by the electron transport chain to produce additional ATP.Overall, the process of breaking down reduced carbon compounds in food releases stored energy in the form of ATP, which can then be used by cells to power a range of cellular processes, including muscle contraction, nerve impulse transmission, and biosynthesis.
