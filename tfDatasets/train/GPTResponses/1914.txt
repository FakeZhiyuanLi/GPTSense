There are several distinguishing factors between horses and oxen:1. Speed and agility: Horses are much faster and more agile than oxen. They can run at high speeds and change direction quickly, making them more suitable for tasks that require speed and precision.2. Size and weight: Horses are smaller and lighter than oxen, making them more suitable for tasks that require less brute force.3. Temperament: Horses are generally more high-strung and energetic than oxen, which can make them more difficult to handle.4. Breeding: Horses have been selectively bred for thousands of years for their speed, agility, and other desirable traits, while oxen are usually bred for their strength and ability to pull heavy loads.5. Training: Horses are typically trained for riding or harness work, while oxen are trained only for pulling carts, plows, or other heavy objects.Overall, horses are better suited for tasks that require speed, agility, and less brute force, while oxen are better suited for tasks that require heavy pulling and hauling.
