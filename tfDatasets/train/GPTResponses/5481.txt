The Doha Declaration is a document adopted by the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001. It sets out the principles for the use of intellectual property (IP) rights in trade and development, particularly in relation to public health. The declaration reaffirmed the flexibilities contained in the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) to promote access to medicines, to protect public health, and to promote the transfer of technology to developing countries. The declaration allowed the least developed countries to continue producing generic versions of patented essential medicines without fear of being penalized under TRIPS. Overall, the Doha Declaration aims to ensure that trade policies do not undermine global health goals or the right to universal access to medicines.
