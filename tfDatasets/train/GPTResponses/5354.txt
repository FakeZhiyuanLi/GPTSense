The Scythians of Central Asia were believed to have discovered Hellenistic culture through the conquests of Alexander the Great in the 4th century BC. Alexander's conquests brought Greek influence and culture to the regions he conquered, which included Central Asia. After his death, the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire controlled much of the region, further spreading Greek culture and philosophy. The Scythians, who were nomadic people, likely interacted with and adopted elements of Hellenistic culture through trade and commerce with settled communities in the region.
