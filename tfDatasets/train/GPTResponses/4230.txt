The FBI may work with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in cases where an aircraft accident or incident involves criminal activity or terrorism. The NTSB is responsible for investigating civil aviation accidents, while the FBI has jurisdiction over criminal investigations. If an aircraft accident or incident is deemed to have been caused by criminal or terrorist activity, the FBI may work with the NTSB to gather evidence and conduct an investigation.
