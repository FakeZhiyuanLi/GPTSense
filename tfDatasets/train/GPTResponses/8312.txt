Darwin's contemporaries had varying opinions on the long delays of his publishing. Some criticized him for being slow and not fully committing to his work, while others sympathized with him and recognized the immense amount of work and research required for his theories. Many of his supporters urged him to publish his findings as soon as possible, fearing that someone else may publish similar findings and take credit for his work. Overall, Darwin's delays were seen as a source of frustration for some and admiration for others, but his eventual publication of On the Origin of Species solidified his position as one of the most influential scientists in history.
