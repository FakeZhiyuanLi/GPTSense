After receiving assent, laws are usually published in the official government gazette or official gazette, which is the official public record of the government's decisions and activities. These gazettes are published periodically (daily, weekly, or monthly) and contain information on new laws, regulations, executive orders, and other official announcements. In some countries, laws may also be published online on official government websites. The purpose of publishing laws is to ensure that they are easily accessible to the public and can be enforced by the relevant authorities.
