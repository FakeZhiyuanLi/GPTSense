Old English, also known as Anglo-Saxon, was brought to Britain by the Germanic tribes, primarily the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes. They started migrating to Britain in the 5th century AD and established several kingdoms, including Mercia, Northumbria, and Wessex, among others. These tribes brought with them their language, which eventually evolved into what we now know as Old English.
