The First Council of Nicaea was convened by the Roman Emperor Constantine I in 325 AD to settle a theological dispute within the Christian Church. The main issue at hand was the nature of the relationship between Jesus Christ and God the Father. Some believed that Jesus was a created being or of a lower rank than God, while others believed that he was of the same substance as God the Father. The council was called to settle this dispute and establish a standard of belief for all Christians. The council resulted in the drafting of the Nicene Creed, which stated that Jesus was of the same substance as God the Father, and that this was the official Christian doctrine.
