Ozone depletion in the southern atmosphere leads to the formation of an ozone hole. This is caused by the accumulation of ozone-depleting substances, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), in the atmosphere. These substances break down the ozone molecules, leading to a decrease in the amount of ozone in the atmosphere. The resulting depletion of the ozone layer allows more harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun to penetrate the Earth's atmosphere, which can cause skin cancer, cataracts and other health issues in humans, and can also harm marine life and affect ecosystems.
