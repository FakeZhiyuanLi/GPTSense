The M1 haplogroup is commonly found among populations from South Asia, particularly among Dravidian-speaking populations in India and Sri Lanka. It is also found among certain populations in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Eastern Africa. However, it is important to note that haplogroup distributions can vary widely even within a single country or region.
