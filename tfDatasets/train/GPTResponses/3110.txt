It is not accurate to assume that the National Symphony Orchestra is led by a violinist of a certain gender. The conductor and music director of the orchestra, Gianandrea Noseda, is male, but he does not play the violin. The concertmaster, or principal first violinist, of the orchestra is Nurit Bar-Josef, who is a woman. However, it is important to note that the leadership and talent of any orchestra should not be limited by gender or any other demographic characteristic.
