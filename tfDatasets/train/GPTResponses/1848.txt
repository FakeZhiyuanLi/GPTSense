There are several factors that can trigger migration in species that move short distances, including:1. Seasonal changes: As days get shorter and temperatures drop, many animals begin to prepare for migration.2. Changes in food availability: Some species migrate in search of food, and will move to areas where their preferred food sources are more abundant.3. Hormonal changes: Environmental cues, such as changes in light or temperature, can trigger hormonal changes that are associated with migration.4. Genetic programming: In some cases, migration may be genetically programmed in certain species, allowing them to know when to migrate without needing external cues.Overall, the specific triggers for migration can vary depending on the species and the environmental cues that are most important for their survival.
