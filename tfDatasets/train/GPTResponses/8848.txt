The majority of scientists accepted the validity of evolution by the 1870s due to the accumulation of evidence from different fields of science, including geology, comparative anatomy, embryology, and biogeography. The discovery of the fossil record provided strong evidence of the gradual changes in species over time, while comparative anatomy and embryology showed similarities between different species, indicating that they shared a common ancestor.However, natural selection was considered a minor part of evolution by many scientists of that time because the concept was still in its early stages of understanding. Charles Darwin had proposed natural selection as the mechanism through which evolution occurred, but it was not until later that researchers fully understood the processes of genetic inheritance and mutation that underlie natural selection. Moreover, the identification of DNA as the genetic material and the development of molecular biology in the mid-20th century validated and emphasized the role of natural selection.
