There were several factors that led to a spike in difficulties between settlers and indigenous peoples on the western plains after the Civil War. Some of the major causes include:1. Expansion of Settlements: After the Civil War, there was a significant increase in the number of people moving westward in search of new opportunities. This led to the expansion of settlements into traditional indigenous lands, which often resulted in clashes between settlers and indigenous peoples.2. Natural Resources: The western plains were rich in natural resources, including oil, gold, and water. As settlers moved in, they often took control of these resources, which reduced the resources available to indigenous peoples and led to tensions between the groups.3. Broken Treaties: The US government had signed numerous treaties with indigenous groups, promising them specific lands and protections. However, many of these treaties were broken or ignored, leading to frustration and anger among indigenous peoples.4. Railroad Development: The construction of railroads across the western plains further accelerated settlement and caused more conflict between settlers and indigenous peoples as railroad companies often obtained land through dubious means.5. Buffalo Hunting: Buffalo hunting was an integral part of the culture and livelihood of many indigenous peoples in the western plains. However, the mass killing of buffalo by settlers for sport and market value led to ecological devastation and disrupted the traditional way of life for many indigenous groups.Overall, the combination of these factors contributed to a spike in difficulties between settlers and indigenous peoples on the western plains after the Civil War. The conflict finally culminated in the Indian Wars, which lasted from 1866 to 1890.
