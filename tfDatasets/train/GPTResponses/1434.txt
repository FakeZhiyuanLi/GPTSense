The most common test subjects for the study of the brain are animals such as rats, mice, and monkeys. Human subjects are also used in research studies, but ethical considerations and limitations on invasive procedures make it difficult to use them extensively for brain research. Non-invasive neuroimaging techniques such as MRI and fMRI are commonly used to study the human brain.
