Essential genes are expressed at various stages of development, and their expression levels may vary depending on the tissue or organ they are associated with. Many essential genes are expressed during early embryonic development and play a critical role in the establishment of basic body plan and tissue differentiation. Other essential genes are expressed throughout the lifespan of an organism, and their proper functioning is necessary for the maintenance of vital physiological functions, such as energy metabolism, DNA replication, and cell division. Some essential genes are expressed only under specific conditions or in response to certain stimuli, such as stress, injury or infection. Overall, the expression of essential genes is tightly regulated and necessary for the survival and proper functioning of the organism.
