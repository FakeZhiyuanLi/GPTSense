Britain tried to get people to stop spitting in public to reduce the spread of TB. This was a major campaign in the early 20th century, and spitting was seen as not only unsanitary but also a potential carrier of the disease. The campaign was successful in introducing social norms against spitting, leading to a reduction in its prevalence.
