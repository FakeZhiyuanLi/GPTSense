Darwin concluded that the ability to create variations easily was an important factor in the process of natural selection. He observed that species that were able to create variations easily were more adaptable to changes in their environment, and therefore more likely to survive and reproduce. On the other hand, species that had difficulty creating variations were more likely to become extinct because they were unable to adapt to changes in their environment. This led Darwin to propose that the ability to create variations was a key factor in the evolution of species.
