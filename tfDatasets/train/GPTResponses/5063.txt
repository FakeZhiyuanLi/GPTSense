The area with the most collapsing ice shelves is the Antarctic Peninsula, located in the western side of Antarctica, where temperatures have been rising rapidly in recent decades. In particular, the Larsen Ice Shelf has experienced significant collapses and retreats due to rising temperatures, with the Larsen B collapsing entirely in 2002.
