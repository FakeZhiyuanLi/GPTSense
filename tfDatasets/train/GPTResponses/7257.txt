Unfortunately, there is no accurate or up-to-date data available on the exact number of workers in agriculture who die each year from severe pesticide poisoning in developing countries. However, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), around 200,000 people die from acute pesticide poisoning each year worldwide, and the vast majority of these deaths occur in developing countries. Many of these deaths are believed to be among agricultural workers who often lack proper protective equipment and training on how to use pesticides safely. Additionally, many cases of pesticide poisoning also go unreported or misdiagnosed.
