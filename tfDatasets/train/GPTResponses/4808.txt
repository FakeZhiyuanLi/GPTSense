There are several factors that limit the sensitivity of infrared telescopes on earth, including:1. Atmospheric absorption: Earth's atmosphere absorbs much of the infrared radiation, making it difficult for telescopes on the ground to capture clear and precise images.2. Thermal emission: The heat emitted by the earth's surface and atmosphere can interfere with the infrared observations taken by ground telescopes.3. Sky background: Infrared telescopes also have to deal with the interference caused by light from other celestial objects, like stars and galaxies.4. Instrumental limitations: The sensitivity of infrared detectors used in telescopes and the amount of noise introduced by the readout electronics can also limit the sensitivity of the telescope.To alleviate these issues, many modern infrared telescopes are placed in space to avoid atmospheric interference, and advanced cooling systems are used to keep the telescope and its detectors at extremely low temperatures to reduce their own thermal emission.
