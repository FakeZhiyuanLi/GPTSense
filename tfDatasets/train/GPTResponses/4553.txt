J.R.R. Tolkien was not the only modern scholar to make use of Old English. Another notable scholar who made use of Old English was Seamus Heaney. Heaney was an Irish poet and writer who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1995. He translated Beowulf, an Old English epic poem, into modern English, making it accessible to contemporary readers. Heaney's translation is considered a masterful work, and is often cited as one of the best translations of Beowulf into modern English.
