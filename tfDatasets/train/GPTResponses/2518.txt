Most of the problems that might result in an otherwise valid treaty being rejected as a binding international agreement are created during the negotiation and ratification phases. Negotiations can break down if parties have differing interests, priorities, or values. Additionally, issues such as power imbalances, lack of trust or transparency, and disputes over the interpretation of treaty provisions can also hinder successful negotiations. During the ratification phase, some states may have internal political opposition to the treaty or may require significant changes to the text. If a large number of states decide not to ratify the treaty, it may be difficult or impossible to ensure its enforcement or implementation.
