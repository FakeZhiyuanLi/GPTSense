William James identified emotion as having both physiological and subjective components. He believed that emotions are a result of changes in bodily sensations, such as heart rate, breathing, and muscle tension, as well as the cognitive interpretation and evaluation of these bodily responses. James also emphasized the subjective experience of emotion, including the feeling of happiness, sadness, anger, or fear. Overall, James emphasized that emotions involve an interplay between bodily sensations, cognitive appraisal, and subjective experience.
