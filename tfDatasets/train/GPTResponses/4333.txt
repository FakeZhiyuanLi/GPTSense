No, a person's brain is not fully developed by the time they reach puberty. The brain continues to develop throughout adolescence and into early adulthood. The prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for decision-making and impulse control, is one of the last regions of the brain to fully mature, and this process may not be complete until the mid-20s.
