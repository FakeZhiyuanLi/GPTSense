The US President may enter into executive agreements without Senate approval. These agreements are agreements between the US and a foreign country that are negotiated and signed by the President as the head of the executive branch, without requiring the approval of the Senate. These agreements are binding on the US and may cover a wide range of issues, including trade, environmental protection, and military cooperation. However, the President cannot unilaterally enter into treaties that require Senate approval.
