One ancient cultural activity that still dominates Somalia today is animal husbandry, particularly the raising and herding of camels, goats, and sheep. Somalia has a pastoral economy and many Somalis still rely on these animals for their livelihoods. The traditional practices of caring for and using these animals are deeply ingrained in Somali society and culture.
