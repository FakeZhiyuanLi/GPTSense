The mutinies caused several effects on the country, including:1. Political instability: The mutinies caused political instability as they were seen as a direct challenge to the ruling government. The government had to use force to suppress the mutinies, which led to the loss of several lives.2. Economic disruption: The mutinies disrupted economic activities, particularly in the affected regions. This led to a decline in economic growth as investors were hesitant to invest in a country with such instability.3. Loss of morale: The mutinies caused a loss of morale among the military, leading to a decline in discipline and effectiveness. This made the country vulnerable to external attacks and internal conflicts.4. Heightened ethnic tensions: The mutinies were often driven by ethnic grievances, and their suppression led to heightened ethnic tensions between different groups. This made it difficult to build a united and cohesive nation.5. Increase in human rights violations: The use of force to suppress the mutinies led to a rise in human rights violations. The military was accused of using excessive force and committing atrocities against civilians, leading to a further loss of trust in the government.
