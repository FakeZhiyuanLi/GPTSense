The Antarctic Peninsula was formed through a combination of tectonic activity and volcanic eruptions. About 150 million years ago, the supercontinent Gondwana began to break apart. As the South American Plate and the Antarctic Plate separated, magma from the mantle rose to the surface, creating a chain of volcanic islands along the continental shelf. Over time, this activity led to the formation of a narrow strip of land that became the Antarctic Peninsula. The peninsula has since been shaped by glacial erosion and is still experiencing tectonic activity.
