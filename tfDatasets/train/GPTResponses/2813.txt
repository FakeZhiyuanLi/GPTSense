The danger of not correctly patenting products is that others can copy or infringe on the intellectual property rights of the inventor or company that developed the product. This can lead to lost profits, decreased market share, and hinder innovation. Additionally, without patent protection, there is no legal recourse for the owner of the intellectual property to enforce their rights and prevent others from using or selling their product.
