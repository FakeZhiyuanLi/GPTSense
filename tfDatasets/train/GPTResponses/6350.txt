Seattle implemented the Downtown Seattle Height and Density (DSHD) zoning policy in 2010 to increase population density in its downtown. The DSHD policy allowed for taller buildings and greater building density in the downtown area, including allowing some areas to increase their height limits from 400 feet to 660 feet. This change in building heights allowed for more residential and commercial units to be built in the same amount of land area, increasing population density within the downtown core.
