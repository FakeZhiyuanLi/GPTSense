are considered to be the four highest emotions in Buddhism: love (metta), compassion (karuna), joy (mudita), and equanimity (upekkha). The goal of these meditations is to develop these qualities within oneself, and then to extend them outward towards all beings, without discrimination or bias. By practicing the four immeasurables, one can cultivate a more positive and compassionate perspective towards oneself and others, leading to greater emotional stability, kindness, and happiness.
