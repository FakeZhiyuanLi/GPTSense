Most grand lodges require a candidate to declare a belief in a supreme being (or a higher power), but the specific requirements may vary depending on the jurisdiction and the Grand Lodge. This belief is considered to be a fundamental requirement for joining a Masonic lodge, as it forms the basis of the moral and ethical principles that are central to the Masonic teachings. However, the exact nature of this belief is not prescribed in any particular way and is left to the individual's interpretation.
