New Haven was laid out using a grid plan, similar to the layout of many other New England towns during the time period. The grid plan consisted of a series of streets intersecting at right angles, with regular and uniform block sizes for buildings and lots. The plan was designed to maximize the use of available land and to make the town easy to navigate for residents and visitors alike.
