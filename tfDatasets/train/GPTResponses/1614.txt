During ancient times, to set foot on most of the shores of the southern and central Mediterranean, people would need to have navigation skills, a seaworthy vessel, appropriate resources for a sea voyage, local knowledge of the weather, and coastal access points. They would also need to have a clear understanding of the region's prevailing trade winds and currents, as well as the geography of the coastline. Additionally, they would require the necessary documents and permissions to enter and exit foreign ports, as well as protection from potential pirates and other maritime hazards along the way.
