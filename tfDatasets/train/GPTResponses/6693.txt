is necessary to protect the public interest. Regulations must be rooted in the authority granted by legislation and should be designed to achieve a clear purpose. They should be clear and concise, allowing individuals and businesses to understand and comply with them.

Ultimately, the goal of regulations is to promote safety, protect individuals and the environment, and promote fairness and transparency in business practices.
