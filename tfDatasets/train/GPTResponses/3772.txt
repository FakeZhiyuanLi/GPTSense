Access Control: This involves limiting access to sensitive data and systems to authorized personnel only through the use of passwords, biometric authentication, access cards, or other methods.2. Encryption: This involves converting data into a coded format that can only be deciphered by authorized individuals.3. Firewall and Network Security: This involves using firewalls and intrusion detection systems to prevent unauthorized access to a network.4. Backup and Recovery: This involves creating backups of critical data and systems to ensure that they can be restored in case of any disaster or data loss.5. Physical Security: This involves securing data centers and other physical spaces where sensitive data and equipment are stored.6. Policies and Procedures: This involves creating written policies and procedures that address data security, access control, and other related issues. Regular employee training on these policies and procedures is also essential.7. Monitoring and Auditing: This involves monitoring the system for any suspicious activity and conducting regular audits to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the system.
