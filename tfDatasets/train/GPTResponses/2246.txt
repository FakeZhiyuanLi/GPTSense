One classic example of what happens when a temperate area at lower altitude gives way to higher-elevation terrain is the gradual transition from a deciduous forest to coniferous forest. At lower altitudes, temperate deciduous forests are characterized by trees that shed their leaves in the winter, such as maple, oak, and beech trees. As the elevation increases, the climate becomes cooler and wetter, and the forest begins to transition to evergreen coniferous trees like spruces and firs. The higher altitude areas also tend to have colder temperatures, shorter growing seasons, and more precipitation, which can impact the types of plants and animals that can survive.
