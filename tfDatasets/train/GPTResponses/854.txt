One example of Whitehead's ideas being counter-intuitive is his notion of "process philosophy," which posits that the world is in a constant state of flux and change, rather than being made up of stable, enduring substances. This idea challenges our intuitive understanding of the world as being made up of fixed objects with clearly defined boundaries and properties. Additionally, Whitehead's concept of "prehension," which describes how entities are affected by and incorporate aspects of their environment, can also be difficult to grasp for those accustomed to thinking of objects as discrete and independent of their surroundings.
