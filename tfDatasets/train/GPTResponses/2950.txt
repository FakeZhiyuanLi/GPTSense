Junk DNA, also known as non-coding DNA or non-functional DNA, refers to the sections of DNA sequences that do not code for proteins or have any known biological functions. These sections were previously considered to be "vestiges of the evolutionary process" and were believed to be useless or even harmful, however, recent research suggests that some of these regions may play a role in regulating gene expression or have other functions that are not yet fully understood.
