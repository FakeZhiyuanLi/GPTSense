In general, a utility patent (which covers new inventions or discoveries, excluding plant or design patents) filed on or after June 8, 1995, is granted for a term that begins on the date of issuance and ends 20 years from the date of filing. Design patents have a shorter term of 15 years. Plant patents also have a term of 20 years from the date of filing. However, there are some exceptions and extensions to patent terms that can extend the expiration date.
