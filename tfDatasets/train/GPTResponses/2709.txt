The structure of wood cells determines whether it is hardwood or softwood. Hardwoods come from deciduous trees (trees that shed their leaves) and have complex structures with dense wood cells. Softwoods come from coniferous trees (evergreen trees with needles) and have simple structures with fewer wood cells.
