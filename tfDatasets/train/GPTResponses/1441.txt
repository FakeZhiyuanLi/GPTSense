The rise of nationalism and the weakening of Ottoman empire saw the independence of Greece, Serbia, the Danubian principalities (Moldavia and Wallachia, which later became Romania), and Bulgaria in the 19th century. These regions had their own ethnic and cultural identities and sought to break free from Ottoman rule and assert their independence. The struggle for independence was often accompanied by armed conflict and popular uprisings, and it was only with significant international pressure and intervention that these regions were eventually recognized as independent states.
