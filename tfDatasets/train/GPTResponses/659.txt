The division of human time on Earth has been primarily divided into three major periods: the Paleolithic, Neolithic, and Modern era (also referred to as the Holocene epoch). These periods are defined by significant shifts in human development, technology, and lifestyle.1. Paleolithic Era: This period started around 2.6 million years ago and lasted until 10,000 BCE. Humans during this time were nomadic hunters and gatherers, relying on stone tools and fire for survival.2. Neolithic Era: This period, which began around 10,000 BCE, saw humans embracing agriculture and domesticating animals. This allowed for the establishment of permanent settlements and the development of complex societies.3. Modern Era/Holocene Epoch: This period, which began around 11,700 years ago, is characterized by the significant impact humans have had on the planet. The development of technology and industrialization has led to exponential population growth, environmental degradation, and other significant changes.
