1. Health risks for humans and animals: Pesticides contain toxic chemicals that can be harmful to human health and can cause long-term health problems such as cancer, birth defects, and developmental disorders. They can also harm wildlife, pets, and beneficial insects, leading to biodiversity loss.2. Environmental pollution: Pesticides residues can contaminate water, soil, and air, which can have negative effects on the environment. They can also persist for long periods of time, leading to long-term pollution and potential damage to the ecosystem.3. Resistance and resurgence of pests: Overuse of pesticides can lead to the development of pest resistance, making it harder to control their populations. In addition, some pests can bounce back stronger as their natural enemies are also eliminated along with them.4. Negative impact on non-target organisms: Pesticides can harm non-target organisms such as bees, butterflies, and other beneficial insects. This can disrupt the natural balance of ecosystems and cause long-term ecological damage.5. Economic costs: Pesticides can be expensive and require significant expenses on application, storage, and disposal by farmers. In addition, pesticide residue and the potential for contamination can lead to economic losses in the food industry.
