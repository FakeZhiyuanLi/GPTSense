French Republicans were not typically in favor of building the French Empire. However, there were some exceptions. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a faction of Republicans known as the "colonial lobby" advocated for increasing France's colonial holdings in Africa and Asia for economic and strategic reasons. This group included politicians such as Jules Ferry and Georges Clemenceau, but they were not representative of the broader Republican movement. Additionally, during World War II, Free French leader Charles de Gaulle sought to preserve France's imperial holdings and even sought to expand them following the war, which was not universally supported by French Republicans.
