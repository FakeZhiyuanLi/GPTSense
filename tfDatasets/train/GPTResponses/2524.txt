There is no clear evidence of what music followed ancient Egyptian art music, as there is little surviving music from that era. However, some scholars believe that ancient Greek and Roman music may have been influenced by Egyptian music, as the Greeks and Romans were exposed to Egyptian culture through trade and conquest. Additionally, some elements of Islamic music, which developed in the centuries after ancient Egypt, may have influenced later Egyptian music.
