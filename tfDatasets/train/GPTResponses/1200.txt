Negrito is a term used to refer to certain indigenous populations of Southeast Asia and the Andaman Islands who are characterized by short stature, dark skin, and curly or kinky hair. However, the term is considered derogatory by some as it was used historically to racialize and discriminate against these populations. Nowadays, it is preferred to refer to these populations by their specific ethnic names or as Austronesian or Austroasiatic populations.
