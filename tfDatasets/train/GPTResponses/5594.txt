The US military's counterpart to the British stooge to counter the attacks by kamikazes was the P-61 Black Widow night fighter plane. The plane was equipped with radar technology that allowed it to detect incoming enemy planes, including kamikazes, in the dark or in low visibility conditions. The P-61 Black Widow proved to be highly effective in intercepting and shooting down enemy planes, including kamikazes, during World War II.
