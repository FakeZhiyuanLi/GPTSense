The first modern textbook is often credited to Johannes Ganzevoort, who published "Introduction to Mathematics" in 1658. This book was the first to use a systematic approach to teaching math, with clear explanations and step-by-step instructions. It became very popular in Dutch schools and was widely used throughout Europe. Since then, many other textbooks have been published and have become crucial tools for education across a wide range of subjects.
