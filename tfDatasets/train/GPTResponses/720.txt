In the United States, the law that enables parents full control over their child's education is the concept of parental rights which are protected under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution. Additionally, the federal law called the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) gives parents the right to participate in the decision-making process for their child's education, including the development of an Individualized Education Plan (IEP). Finally, many states have laws that allow parents to homeschool their children and have full control over their education.
