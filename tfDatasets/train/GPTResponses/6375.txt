During colonial rule, the British considered Indians to be inferior and uncivilized. They viewed themselves as superior in terms of culture, education, and technology. The British also believed that it was their duty to "civilize" and modernize India, which led to the implementation of policies like the introduction of English language, western education, and modern infrastructure. They also often stereotyped and generalized Indians as lazy, exotic, and backward.
