Some people have argued that time shifts from daylight savings may correlate with:1. Increased risk of heart attacks: Studies have suggested that the disruption of the body's natural clock due to time shifts can result in increased stress on the cardiovascular system, leading to an increased risk of heart attacks.2. Reduced workplace productivity: The loss of an hour of sleep due to the time shift can result in decreased productivity and efficiency at work.3. Higher incidence of traffic accidents: Studies have shown that the risk of traffic accidents is higher in the days following the spring time shift due to the disruption of the body's circadian rhythm.4. Increased incidence of depression: The disruption of the body's natural clock can result in feelings of irritability, depression, and anxiety.5. Increased energy consumption: The need for artificial lighting during the longer winter nights can lead to increased energy consumption, resulting in higher energy bills and increased carbon emissions.
