The Shia believe that Ali ibn Abi Talib, the cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad, and his descendants are the rightful successors of Muhammad. They consider Ali to be the first Imam or leader of the Shia and believe that leadership of the Muslim community should have remained within Muhammad's family through his descendants.
