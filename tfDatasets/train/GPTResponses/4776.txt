When HMS Illustrious launched a strike on an Italian fleet in 1940, it signaled the entry of Britain into the Mediterranean theater of World War II. The strike was a part of a broader strategy to prevent the Italian Navy from controlling the Mediterranean Sea and disrupting British supply lines. It also demonstrated the effectiveness of British carriers in naval combat and their ability to project power across long distances. The attack on the Italian fleet weakened their naval power and contributed to the eventual Allied victory in North Africa.
