There were several factors that contributed to the severity of the financial crisis of 2007:1. Housing Bubble: The housing market saw a rapid increase in housing prices, which led to an increase in demand for mortgage-backed securities.2. Risky Loans: Lenders were giving out risky loans such as subprime mortgages and adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which allowed borrowers to purchase homes they could not afford.3. Securitization: The bundling of these risky loans into mortgage-backed securities caused banks and other institutions to take on more risk than they could handle.4. Derivatives: The use of complex financial instruments such as credit default swaps (CDS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) further amplified the risk in the financial system.5. Leverage: Financial institutions were highly leveraged, meaning they borrowed large amounts of money to invest in these risky assets, which increased their potential for losses.6. Systemic Risk: The interconnectedness of the financial system meant that a collapse in one area could lead to a domino effect, bringing down the entire financial system, which is what ultimately happened in 2007.
