Sunyata is a Buddhist concept of emptiness or voidness, which emphasizes the idea that all phenomena are without inherent existence and therefore empty of any permanent and independent essence. It is a key concept in the Mahayana and Vajrayana traditions of Buddhism and is seen as a crucial step towards attaining enlightenment. The term "sunyata" is derived from the Sanskrit language and is translated as "emptiness" or "voidness."
