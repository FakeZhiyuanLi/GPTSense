Children are often bitten by dogs in areas such as the face, neck, and head, as they tend to approach dogs from above and may trigger a fear or defensive response. However, it is important to note that any part of the body can be bitten by a dog if the circumstances are right. It is essential to educate children on how to interact with dogs in a safe and respectful manner to avoid potential bites.
