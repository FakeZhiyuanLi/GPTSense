The plant that was mandated to be grown by the French was flax. It was made mandatory by Louis XVI in 1783 through the Edict of SÃ©ez. Flax was used to make linen, which was an essential material for clothing at the time. The cultivation of flax was seen as a way to reduce France's dependence on imported textiles and to support its domestic textile industry.
