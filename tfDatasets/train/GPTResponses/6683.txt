One of the miracles attributed to Pope Paul VI was the healing of an unborn child in the womb of his mother. The child had a serious condition that was deemed incurable by doctors, but after the mother prayed to Pope Paul VI for intercession, the child was born healthy. Another miracle attributed to Pope Paul VI was the healing of a nun who had a serious ailment that left her bedridden, but after praying to Pope Paul VI, she was suddenly cured and able to walk again. These miracles were important factors in the canonization process for Pope Paul VI.
