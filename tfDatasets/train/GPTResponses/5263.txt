Barrage balloons were initially used as an obstacle to low-flying enemy aircraft during World War II. The balloons were anchored to the ground and equipped with explosive charges that would detonate if the balloon was hit by an aircraft. The goal was to force enemy planes to fly higher in order to avoid the balloons, which made them easier targets for anti-aircraft artillery. The presence of the balloons also made it more difficult for enemy pilots to accurately drop bombs on their targets.
