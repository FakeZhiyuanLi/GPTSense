The law that regulates drug marketing in the US is the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) enforced by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The act sets forth a comprehensive system for the regulation of drugs, including requirements for drug safety, efficacy, and labeling. The FDA regulates pharmaceutical promotion through its Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (OPDP), which reviews and approves promotional materials for drugs and takes action against misleading, false, or unsubstantiated promotional claims.
