The method that formally adds inverses to elements to any monoid is called the Grothendieck group construction. This construction takes a monoid M and forms a new group called the Grothendieck group K(M), which has the property that every element of M now has an inverse in K(M). The construction process involves taking formal differences of elements in M, and equating any two formal differences that have the same "net effect" on the underlying monoid operation. This process essentially creates a new monoid in which "opposite" elements cancel each other out, allowing for the addition of inverses.
