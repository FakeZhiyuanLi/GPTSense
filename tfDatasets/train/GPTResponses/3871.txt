The confused deputy problem and the problem of not guaranteeing only one person has access are resolved through the use of access control mechanisms, such as role-based access control (RBAC) and mandatory access control (MAC). RBAC restricts access based on job functions or responsibilities, while MAC restricts access based on security labels or classifications. These mechanisms ensure that only authorized individuals can access specific resources and prevent confusion or unauthorized access by limiting access permissions. Additionally, multi-factor authentication can be used to verify a user's identity and further enhance security.
