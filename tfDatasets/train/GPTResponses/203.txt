Both the HDI (Human Development Index) and the IHDI (Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index) are used to measure potential development, but in slightly different ways.The HDI measures potential development by combining three key dimensions of human development:1. A long and healthy life (measured by life expectancy at birth),2. Access to knowledge (measured by years of education), and3. A decent standard of living (measured by gross national income per capita).The HDI does not take into account inequalities in these dimensions.On the other hand, the IHDI measures potential development by looking at the same three dimensions as the HDI, but also adjusting for inequalities in each of these dimensions. This makes the IHDI a more nuanced measure of potential development, as it takes into account the fact that not everyone has equal access to health, education, and income.In summary, both measures can be used to assess potential development, but the IHDI provides a more nuanced view by accounting for inequalities.
