The first boardwalk in Atlantic City was built in 1870 as a way for hotel owners to keep their lobbies sand-free. The idea was suggested by a train conductor named Alexander Boardman, who noticed that people were tracking sand into the hotels and thought a boardwalk would solve the problem. The first boardwalk was made of wood and was only one mile long, but it quickly became a popular attraction for visitors to Atlantic City.
