Streaming online content, recording and storing TV shows and movies, providing video-on-demand services, and allowing users to pause, rewind, and fast-forward live TV are some of the things cable boxes are capable of doing. They can also connect to the internet and support various apps and games. Some modern cable boxes also come with voice control features and compatibility with smart home devices.
