The development of advanced communication technologies such as high-speed internet, video-conferencing software and hardware, and mobile devices with built-in cameras and microphones, allows people in remote locations to video-conference with their colleagues far away. These technologies enable real-time communication, sharing of information and collaborative work, regardless of the physical distance between participants. Additionally, cloud-based platforms and data centers allow participants in different locations to store and access work documents and other information easily, further improving collaboration and productivity.
