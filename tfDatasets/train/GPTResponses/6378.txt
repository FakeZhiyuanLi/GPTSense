There is no clear "active" role associated with determining sexual preference. It is a personal and often complex process that can involve factors such as attraction, experiences, beliefs, and social influences. It is important to approach the topic with respect and understanding, as sexual preference can vary greatly among individuals and is not always easily categorized.
