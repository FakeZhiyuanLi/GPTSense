Outside the 1/1000 second to 1/second exposure range, the amount of light entering the camera either increases or decreases. A longer exposure time, such as several seconds or even minutes, allows more light to enter the camera and create a brighter image. This can be useful in low light conditions or for capturing motion blur.On the other hand, a shorter exposure time, such as 1/2000 or 1/4000 of a second, allows less light to enter the camera and freezes fast-moving subjects. This can be useful for sports or action photography.Beyond these extremes, the amount of light entering the camera becomes too little or too great to generate a usable image. Extremely long exposures can also result in overexposure or noise in the image, while extremely short exposures can result in underexposure and loss of detail.
