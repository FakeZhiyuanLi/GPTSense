Scientists measure brain activity using a variety of techniques, including:1. Electroencephalography (EEG): This method involves placing electrodes on the scalp to measure electrical patterns in the brain. EEG can be used to measure brain activity during specific tasks or while the person is at rest.2. Magnetoencephalography (MEG): Like EEG, MEG measures electrical activity in the brain. However, it uses magnetometers to measure the magnetic fields produced by this activity, which can be more precise than EEG.3. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI): This method uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create images of brain activity. It can show which areas of the brain are active during specific tasks.4. Positron Emission Tomography (PET): This method involves injecting a radioactive substance into the bloodstream that will bind to glucose in active brain regions. The radiation produced by the decay of the radioisotope can be detected using a scanner, allowing researchers to see which brain regions are using more glucose and are therefore more active.5. Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS): This method measures changes in blood oxygenation in the brain, which is an indicator of brain activity. It uses light to penetrate the scalp and skull and measure the amount of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in the brain.
