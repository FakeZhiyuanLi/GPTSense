Shia Muslims refer to the following verse from the Quran to support their belief in the succession of Imam Ali (AS) after Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him):"O Apostle! deliver that which has been revealed to thee from thy Lord and if thou do (it) not, thou hast not delivered His message. And Allah will protect thee from the people verily Allah will not guide the unbelieving people" (Quran, 5:67).
