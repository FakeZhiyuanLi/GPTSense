The Rhine Gorge was formed approximately 12 million years ago during the Oligocene epoch when the Alps were formed due to tectonic shifts. As the Alps rose, the Rhine River flowed through the newly formed mountains, causing erosion that led to the steep cliffs and narrow valley walls that we see today. Over time, glaciers also contributed to the formation of the gorge by eroding the rock and creating deep valleys. The Rhine River continues to carve the gorge today, shaping the landscape and creating the spectacular scenery that makes it a popular tourist destination.
