Proportional control of the field windings in a stepper motor achieves precise control of the motor's position and speed. By varying the current in the field windings, the magnetic field produced by the motor can be finely controlled, allowing for accurate movements of the rotor. This can be used to achieve highly precise positioning and motion control in applications like robotics, manufacturing, and automation. The ability to precisely control the field windings also allows for smoother operation and reduced noise and vibration in the motor.
