she had learned in school that day. Taking a deep breath, she began to recite the poem that she had memorized."Twinkle, twinkle, little star, How I wonder what you are! Up above the world so high, Like a diamond in the sky."As she reached the end of the first verse, her nerves began to settle and she continued to recite the rest of the poem with confidence. At the end, everyone applauded, and Ananda beamed with pride.Reciting what she had learned in school that day was always nerve-wracking for Ananda, but with practice and persistence, she had learned to overcome her fear and perform with confidence. Her dedication had paid off, and she was grateful for the opportunity to showcase her knowledge to her friends and family.
