Prince Hall Freemasonry was formed in response to the exclusion of African Americans from the mainstream Freemasonry organizations in America during the 18th century. Prince Hall, a free Black man and activist, along with 14 other Black men, were initiated into a British military lodge in Boston in 1775. However, after the revolution, they were unable to join any American lodges, as they were not recognized by the predominantly white Grand Lodges. As a result, Prince Hall and the other African American Freemasons established their own separate Masonic lodge, which became the foundation for Prince Hall Freemasonry.
