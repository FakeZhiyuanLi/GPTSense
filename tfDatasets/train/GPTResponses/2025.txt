After the signatures in a treaty, the next step is usually the ratification and/or acceptance procedure, which varies from country to country. In some cases, the treaty must be approved by the national parliament or congress, while in other cases it can simply be ratified by the head of state or the executive branch. Once the treaty is ratified or accepted by all parties, it becomes legally binding and enters into force.
