Saint Jerome is the Latin Father who described the belief that Jesus' siblings were his cousins. In his work "The Perpetual Virginity of Blessed Mary: Against Helvidius," Saint Jerome argued that Mary remained a virgin before, during, and after the birth of Jesus, and therefore, the mention of Jesus' brothers in the Gospels referred to his cousins, the children of Mary's sister or brother. This belief is known as the doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary.
