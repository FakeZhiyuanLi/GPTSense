The UTF-8 standard is a character encoding method that is widely used for representing text in electronic devices and systems. UTF-8 stands for Unicode Transformation Format 8-bit, and it is based on the Unicode standard, which assigns unique code points to every character in most of the world's writing systems.UTF-8 uses variable-length encoding to represent Unicode characters, which means that characters can be represented using one to four bytes. It is designed to be backward compatible with ASCII, which means that ASCII characters are represented using one byte, while non-ASCII characters are represented using two to four bytes.UTF-8 is widely used in web pages, email systems, and computer applications because it can represent any character from any language, making it a flexible and universal encoding standard.
