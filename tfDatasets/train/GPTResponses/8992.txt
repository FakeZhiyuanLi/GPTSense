The earliest church that was specifically labeled as “Baptist” can be traced back to 1609 in Amsterdam, Netherlands. This church was founded by English Separatist John Smyth and his followers after they were excommunicated from the Church of England. Smyth believed in the baptism of adult believers only and believed that the church should be made up of these baptized believers rather than infants who were baptized without their consent. This belief became the foundation of Baptist theology and practice.
