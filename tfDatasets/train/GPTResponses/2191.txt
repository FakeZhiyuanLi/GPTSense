The sovereignty of szlachta (the Polish nobility) ended with the partitions of Poland in the late 18th century, when Poland was divided and annexed by neighboring powers: Russia, Prussia, and Austria. This led to the loss of Poland's independence and the dissolution of the szlachta's political power.
