Copper serves as an antimicrobial agent when used in textile fibers. It helps to prevent the growth and spread of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi, reducing the risk of infections and foul odors. Copper-infused textiles can be used in various applications including clothing, bedding, and medical textiles. Additionally, copper has been found to have other beneficial properties such as being thermally conductive and having good moisture-wicking capabilities.
