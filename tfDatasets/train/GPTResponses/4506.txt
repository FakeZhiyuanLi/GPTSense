One fungus that can help to soften heavy metal sulfides is Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans. It is commonly used in biometallurgical processes for the extraction of minerals from ores containing heavy metals such as copper, zinc, and nickel. The fungus helps to catalyze the oxidation of metal sulfides, making them more soluble and easier to extract.
