Darwin believed that utilizing inherited variation was essential for the process of natural selection. He understood that individuals in a population possess varying traits, and those with traits that are best suited to their environment will be more likely to survive and reproduce than those with less advantageous traits. Therefore, he believed that natural selection acted on inherited variation to shape the evolution of species over time.
