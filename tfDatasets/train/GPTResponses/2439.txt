Muslims from the Shia sect believe that imamah is one of the principles of faith. They view imamah as the spiritual and political guidance of the Prophet Muhammad's family, specifically his cousin and son-in-law, Ali, and his descendants known as the Imams. They believe that the Imams are divinely appointed and infallible in order to guide the Muslim community towards righteous conduct and understanding of the Quran. For Shia Muslims, the belief in imamah is an essential aspect of their faith and distinguishes them from Sunni Muslims.
