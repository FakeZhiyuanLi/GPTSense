During the Middle Ages, some Jews assimilated into the dominant Greek and Latin cultures by adopting their language, dress, and customs. They also adopted Greek and Roman names, and sometimes converted to Christianity, in order to gain acceptance and avoid persecution. Some Jews even rose to positions of power and wealth, such as the famous Jewish physician, Moses Maimonides, who served as the court physician to the Muslim sultan Saladin in the 12th century. However, many Jews resisted assimilation and maintained their own cultural and religious traditions, leading to periodic tensions and outbreaks of violence between Jewish and non-Jewish communities throughout Europe.
