A person having a high fever is an example of the body's ability to maintain homeostasis being overwhelmed. In response to an infection, the body increases its internal temperature to help fight off the pathogen. However, if the fever becomes too high, it can be dangerous and potentially damaging to the body's tissues and organs. In extreme cases, the body may require medical intervention to restore normal body temperature and prevent further harm.
