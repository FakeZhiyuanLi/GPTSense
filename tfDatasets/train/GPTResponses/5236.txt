The Browning 37mm was not a firearm, but rather a shell (ammunition) used in certain types of grenade launchers. It was never replaced due to jamming issues, as there were no such issues with the ammunition itself. However, if you are referring to a specific firearm that used the Browning 37mm, please provide more information about the model and we can provide a more accurate answer.
