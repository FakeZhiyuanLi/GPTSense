Cultural anthropology is the type of anthropology that is focused on studying social organization. Cultural anthropologists study how societies are structured, including their social norms, customs, institutions, and economic systems. They investigate the way that people interact with each other, the roles they play in their communities, and the ways in which social structures shape individual behavior. Cultural anthropology is concerned with understanding both the similarities and differences between cultures around the world, and how these cultures have developed and changed over time. The goal of cultural anthropology is to develop a comprehensive understanding of human culture and social organization.
