As Freemasonry began to spread in the 18th and 19th centuries, various forms of "female Masonry" or "Masonic lodges for women" were created. These were often parallel organizations to the male-only Masonic lodges, and were associated with the broader movement for women's rights and independence. Some of the most notable forms of female Masonry included the Order of the Eastern Star (founded in 1850), the French Rite of Adoption (founded in the 1770s), and the Order of Women Freemasons (founded in 1908). However, it should be noted that these female Masonic organizations were not recognized by the mainstream, male-only Grand Lodges of Freemasonry.
