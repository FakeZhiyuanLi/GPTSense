we call "culture". One such concept is "cultural complexity", which refers to the intricate and multi-layered nature of cultural phenomena. It recognizes that cultural practices, beliefs, and values are not simple and homogeneous, but instead are dynamic and shaped by various influences, such as history, politics, economics, and technology. Cultural complexity also emphasizes that cultures cannot be reduced to a single aspect or element, but rather are made up of multiple overlapping and interrelated components. This concept encourages us to embrace the diversity and richness of cultures, and to avoid oversimplifying or stereotyping cultural differences.
