One of the regional leaders involved in the origins of the szlachta was Aleksander Jagiello≈Ñczyk, the Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland from 1506 to 1557. He was a member of the Jagiellonian dynasty, which played a significant role in the development of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the rise of the szlachta class. Under his reign, Aleksander supported the gentry's political and social power, and strengthened their position by granting them greater rights and privileges. This helped to establish the szlachta as a dominant force in Polish society for many centuries.
