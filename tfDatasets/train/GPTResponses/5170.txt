As elevation increases, the temperature decreases. This is because air at high elevations is less dense, allowing it to expand and cool as it rises. The decrease in temperature with increasing elevation is known as the lapse rate, which is approximately 1.98°C (3.56°F) per 1000 feet (305 meters) of elevation gain. Therefore, if you climb a mountain or go up to a high altitude, you can expect the temperature to drop.
