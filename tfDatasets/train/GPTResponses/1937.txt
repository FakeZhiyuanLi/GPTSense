The Swiss infantry was known for its effective use of polearms, particularly the halberd and pike. They also used crossbows and later firearms, such as muskets and arquebuses. However, their traditional and famous weapon was the long Swiss sword (often called “Zweihänder” or “two-hander”), a massive double-edged sword capable of delivering devastating blows.
