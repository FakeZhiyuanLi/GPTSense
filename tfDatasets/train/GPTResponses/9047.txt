Multi-level political forms refer to a system of government where power is distributed between different levels of government, such as state, regional, and municipal governments. It involves decentralization of power to various tiers of government to ensure efficient governance.Federalism, on the other hand, is a specific type of multi-level political form in which power is divided between a central government and constituent political units, such as states or provinces. In a federal system, the central government has limited power, and other levels of government have significant autonomy and authority.Therefore, the main difference between multi-level political forms and federalism is that federalism is a particular type of multi-level political form that involves the distribution of power between the central government and other political units, while multi-level political forms include a broader range of government structures with varying degrees of centralization and decentralization of power.
