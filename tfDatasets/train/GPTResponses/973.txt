is known as the "central executive," which is responsible for higher-order cognitive processes such as decision-making, attentional control, and working memory. These areas include the prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex. Together, the central executive and these areas implement various cognitive functions essential for complex behavior, including planning, problem-solving, decision-making, and self-regulation.
