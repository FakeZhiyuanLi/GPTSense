1. The position of the object before and after reflecting. This is because the position of the object changes when a reflection is performed.2. The size and shape of the object. The reflect object may have a different size and shape, but if the object is a mirror image of the original object, then a reflection has been performed.3. The color or texture of the object. Reflection does not change the color or texture of the object.4. The angle of incidence of the light. This is because a reflection occurs when light bounces off an object, regardless of the angle at which it hits.5. The environment around the reflected object. This is because reflection is a property of the object itself and does not depend on the surroundings.
