The Glorious Revolution of 1688 helped solidify the power of Parliament against the monarch. It was the peaceful overthrow of King James II and his replacement by William III and Mary II, who were forced to accept The Bill of Rights which established the supremacy of Parliament over the Crown. This event marked the end of absolute monarchy and the beginning of constitutional monarchy in England.
