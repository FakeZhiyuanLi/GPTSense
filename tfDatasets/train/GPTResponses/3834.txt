Bacteria are not known to have endosymbionts, as they are simple, single-celled organisms that cannot harbor other organisms within their cells. Instead, endosymbiosis is typically observed in eukaryotic cells, such as those of animals, plants, and fungi. In these cells, endosymbionts are typically other types of cells or bacteria that have been engulfed and incorporated into the host cell, forming a symbiotic relationship in which both organisms benefit. Examples of endosymbionts found in eukaryotic cells include mitochondria, which are believed to have evolved from ancient bacteria that were engulfed by eukaryotic cells, and chloroplasts, which originated from photosynthetic bacteria engulfed by plant cells.
