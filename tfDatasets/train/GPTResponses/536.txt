Turkey's Uyghur community, along with other Turkish activists and politicians, have staged protests and rallies in recent years to raise awareness of the plight of Uyghur Muslims in China's Xinjiang province. They have called for China to stop its alleged human rights abuses against Uyghurs, including arbitrary detention, forced labor, and religious and cultural oppression. In 2019, thousands of people participated in a rally in Istanbul to denounce China's treatment of Uyghurs, while the Turkish government has also criticized China's policies towards the minority group.
