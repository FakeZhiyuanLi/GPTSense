Britain's mercantilist policies, specifically the Navigation Acts of 1651, gave them dominance in world trade. These acts required all goods imported into Britain and its colonies to be carried on British vessels and sold only in the British market or their colonies, thus allowing Britain to maintain control of their trading routes and monopolize global trade. Additionally, Britain's adoption of free trade policies in the 19th century further enhanced their dominance and helped them become the world's leading superpower.
