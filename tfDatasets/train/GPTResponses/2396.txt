There were several Carthaginian generals throughout history. One of the most famous was Hannibal Barca, who famously led an army of elephants over the Alps to invade Italy during the Second Punic War. Other notable Carthaginian generals include Hamilcar Barca (Hannibal's father), Hasdrubal Barca (Hannibal's brother), and Mago Barca (Hannibal's other brother).
