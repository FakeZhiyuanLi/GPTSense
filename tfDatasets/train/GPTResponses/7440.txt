There are several countries that have attempted to better the controls of pesticide exchanges. Some examples include:1. The United States - The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates the sale and use of pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). The EPA requires that pesticide manufacturers register their products and obtain approval before they can be sold.2. European Union - The European Union has established regulations to control the use of pesticides under the Plant Protection Products Regulation. The regulation requires that all pesticides sold in the EU be registered and authorized for use.3. Brazil - Brazil has implemented the National Policy for the Reduction of Agrochemicals, which aims to reduce the use of pesticides and increase the adoption of more sustainable agricultural practices.4. China - China has established its own regulations on the production, sale, and use of pesticides under the Pesticide Administration Law. The law requires that all pesticides sold in China be registered with the government and meet certain safety and quality standards.5. India - India has established the Insecticides Act, which regulates the import, manufacture, sale, transport, distribution, and use of pesticides in the country. The Act requires that all pesticides be registered with the government and undergo safety and efficacy tests before they can be sold.
