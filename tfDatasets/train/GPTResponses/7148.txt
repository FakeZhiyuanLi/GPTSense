The process of ratifying a call for service by a pastor varies depending on the specific denomination or organization. In some cases, it may be up to the local church or congregation to ratify the call, while in other cases, it may require approval from a higher governing body, such as a regional or national denominational office. Ultimately, the decision to ratify a call for service will depend on the specific policies and practices of the particular denomination or organization involved.
