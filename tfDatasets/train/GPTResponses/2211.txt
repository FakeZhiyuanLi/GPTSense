There are several mechanisms that can create copy number variations (CNVs) of an existing gene in the genome. These include:1. Unequal crossing over: During meiosis, homologous chromosomes may exchange unequal segments, resulting in one chromosome with a deletion and the other with a duplication of the affected gene.2. Non-allelic homologous recombination: This occurs when two non-allelic (i.e. non-identical) regions of DNA that share sequence similarity undergo recombination, resulting in a deletion or duplication of the affected gene.3. Replication errors: During DNA replication, errors can occur that result in an extra copy of a gene being created.4. Mobile genetic elements: Transposable elements (TEs), such as retrotransposons and DNA transposons, can insert into or near a gene and cause a deletion or duplication of the affected gene.5. Environmental factors: Exposure to certain environmental factors, such as radiation or chemicals, can cause DNA damage that leads to CNVs.Overall, CNVs are a result of complex and multifaceted genetic and environmental factors, and understanding their underlying mechanisms is an active area of research in genomics.
