Proponents of affirmative action believe that the best way to combat exclusionary practices is by implementing policies that actively promote diversity and inclusivity. This includes practices such as recruiting and hiring individuals from underrepresented groups, providing equal access to education and employment opportunities, and offering training and support to help individuals develop the skills needed to succeed in their chosen fields. Additionally, proponents of affirmative action believe that it is necessary to address systemic barriers and biases that prevent certain groups from achieving equality in society. Through these efforts, proponents of affirmative action hope to create a more equitable and just society that values diversity and empowers individuals from all backgrounds to succeed.
