The layout of neighbourhoods is generally referred to as urban or suburban planning. The specific design and layout of a neighbourhood can vary depending on several factors, including location, cultural influences, and the age of the neighbourhood. Some common features in neighbourhood layout and design include designated areas for residential, commercial, and recreational spaces, street networks, public transportation, and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure.
