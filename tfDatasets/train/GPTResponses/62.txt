The probability that a number is composite when using a probabilistic algorithm is usually expressed as a decimal or a percentage. For example, if a probabilistic algorithm has a composite probability of 0.01 or 1%, then the probability that a number is composite is 0.01 or 1 in 100. Mathematically, this can also be expressed using the notation P(composite) = 0.01 or P(composite) = 1%.
