Sanskrit grammatical tradition refers to the various rules, principles, and guidelines that govern the correct usage and structure of the Sanskrit language. This tradition encompasses a wide range of topics, including phonetics, morphology, syntax, and semantics, and includes a vast array of texts and commentaries written over a period of more than 2,000 years.The Sanskrit grammatical tradition is considered one of the most comprehensive and sophisticated in the world, and has had a profound influence on the development of other Indian languages and cultures, as well as on the study of linguistics more broadly. Its most famous and influential text is the Ashtadhyayi, written by the ancient scholar Panini in the 4th century BCE, which lays out the core principles of Sanskrit grammar and remains a foundational work in the field to this day.
