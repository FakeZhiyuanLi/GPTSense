One tradition unique to the Creole people is the Mardi Gras celebration, which features parades, music, and colorful costumes in cities such as New Orleans, Louisiana. The Creole people have been celebrating Mardi Gras since the 1700s, and their specific version of the holiday features unique traditions such as the throwing of Mardi Gras beads, the king cake, and the selection of a Mardi Gras king and queen. Additionally, Creole cuisine, which blends elements of French, African, and Native American cuisine, is also a unique aspect of Creole culture.
