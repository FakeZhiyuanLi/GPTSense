to mainstream Christianity?Yes, the Arians were united in their opposition to mainstream Christianity. They held a different view of the nature of Jesus and his relationship to God, and their beliefs were seen as heretical by many other Christians. The Arians believed that Jesus was a created being, rather than being co-equal and co-eternal with God the Father. This belief caused a major split within the early Christian Church, leading to the Arian controversy and the development of Arianism as a separate branch of Christianity.
