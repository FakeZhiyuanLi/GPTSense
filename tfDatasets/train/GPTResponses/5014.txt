The fossil record and studies of extant species suggest that the last few million years, particularly the period of the Pleistocene epoch, featured the greatest biodiversity in history. This is evidenced by the abundance and diversity of species found in fossil deposits from this time period, as well as the diversity of living species that have evolved and persisted since then. Additionally, the rapid climate changes and geological events that occurred during this time likely contributed to the diversification and speciation of many different groups of organisms.
