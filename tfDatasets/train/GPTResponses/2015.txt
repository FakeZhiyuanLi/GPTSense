The Ostrogoths were invited to settle in the Roman Empire by the Eastern Roman Emperor Theodosius II in the early 5th century. He allowed them to live in the region of Thrace in exchange for their military support and loyalty to the Byzantine Empire. However, in the 6th century, the Ostrogoths under their king Theodoric the Great, established their own kingdom in Italy and conquered Rome in 476 AD.
