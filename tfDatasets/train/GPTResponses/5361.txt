There are several viruses that can cause tumors in mammals, but the most well-known and studied is the retrovirus called the "Rous sarcoma virus". This virus was first discovered by Peyton Rous in 1911 when he found that the virus could cause tumors in chickens. It was later found that the virus contains an oncogene that can cause uncontrolled cell growth and lead to the formation of tumors. The Rous sarcoma virus is now widely used as a research tool to study the mechanisms of oncogenesis and cancer.
