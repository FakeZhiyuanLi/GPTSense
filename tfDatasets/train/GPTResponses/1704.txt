Recently developed genome engineering techniques use a variety of enzymes including:1. CRISPR-Cas9 system: Cas9 is an enzyme which acts as a molecular scissor to cut the DNA at the desired location.2. Zinc Finger Nucleases (ZFNs): They are a type of engineered enzyme which can cut the DNA at specific locations.3. Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs): They are also a type of engineered enzyme which can cut the DNA at specific locations.4. Homing endonucleases: They are naturally occurring enzymes which can also cleave the DNA at specific sites.All these enzymes are used to make precise changes in the DNA sequence within a genome.
