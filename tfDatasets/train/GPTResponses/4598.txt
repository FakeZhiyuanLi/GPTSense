When ingested in large amounts, copper salts can produce acute toxicity symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and metallic taste in the mouth. In severe cases, it can cause liver and kidney damage, hemolysis (rupturing of red blood cells), and even death. Chronic exposure to high levels of copper can lead to Wilson's disease, a genetic disorder that causes copper to accumulate in the liver, brain, and other organs, leading to various neurological and psychiatric symptoms.
