Barth√©lemy Boganda, the first president of the Central African Republic, died in a plane crash on March 29, 1959, under suspicious circumstances. The cause of the crash is still a subject of controversy and conspiracy theories, with some suggesting foul play by colonial powers or opposition groups. As a result of his untimely death, Boganda was unable to finish his term as president, leading to his departure from his elected post.
