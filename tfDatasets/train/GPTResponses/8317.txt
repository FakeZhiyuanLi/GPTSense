Darwin's process of writing his books involved a lot of research, observation, experimentation, and revising. He would collect data from his own observations, as well as from other scientists and explorers, and analyze it to form hypotheses and conclusions. He then conducted experiments to test his ideas and revise his theories accordingly. Darwin also corresponded with other scientists and experts in various fields to gather more information and discuss his ideas. He spent years conducting these activities before publishing his findings in his two most famous books: "On the Origin of Species" and "The Descent of Man".
