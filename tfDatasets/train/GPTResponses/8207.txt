Darwin's essay, "On the Origin of Species," was based on his observations and experiments during his travels on the HMS Beagle and his study of various scientific fields, including geology, zoology, and botany. He also drew upon the works of other naturalists and scientists, such as Thomas Malthus and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. His essay presented the idea of natural selection as the mechanism for evolution and challenged the traditional understanding of species as fixed and unchanging.
