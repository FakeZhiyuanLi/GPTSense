Artificial Intelligence (AI)?The first practical implementation based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) was The Logic Theorist, developed by Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon in 1956. It was a computer program that could reason and solve mathematical problems, making it the first AI program capable of doing so. The program used symbolic logic to mimic human problem-solving abilities and was able to prove mathematical theorems mechanically.
