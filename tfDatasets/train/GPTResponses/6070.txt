The majority of definitions surrounding sexual orientation include the sex or gender to which a person is primarily attracted, as well as the emotional, romantic, and/or physical attraction that a person may have towards others. It is often described as a natural and enduring predisposition towards a particular gender, and many definitions emphasize that sexual orientation is an innate and immutable characteristic of an individual. Additionally, definitions of sexual orientation often acknowledge the existence of a spectrum, with various possible identities, including heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, asexual, and others. Some definitions may also encompass societal and cultural factors that play a role in sexual orientation, including the influence of family, religion, and social norms.
