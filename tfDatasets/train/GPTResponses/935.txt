The two strands in a double helix must be complementary to each other in terms of their sequence of nucleotide bases. Each base on one strand can only bond with a specific complementary base on the other strand (A-T and C-G), and this specificity ensures that the two strands will always come together in the correct way, allowing for accurate replication and transmission of genetic information.
