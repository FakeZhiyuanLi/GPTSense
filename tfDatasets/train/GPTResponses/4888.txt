The equator is known for having high levels of biodiversity due to its warm, humid climate and diverse habitats such as rainforests, coral reefs, and mangrove swamps. This region is home to a vast array of plant and animal species, including many endemic species that are found nowhere else in the world. The Amazon rainforest, for example, is the most biodiverse region on Earth, containing about 16,000 tree species alone. Similarly, the coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific region are among the most diverse ecosystems on the planet, housing an estimated 25% of all marine species.
