There is no record of a government committee specifically investigating Rupert Murdoch and The Times in 2007. However, there were several inquiries and investigations happening around that time that touched on Murdoch's media empire, including a regulatory review of News Corp's acquisition of Dow Jones (which owned The Wall Street Journal), and a parliamentary inquiry into media ownership and plurality.
