and 2008. This was due to a number of factors, including overleveraging (taking on too much debt), exposure to risky assets such as mortgage-backed securities, and inadequate risk management practices.As a result, many banks had to be bailed out by governments or central banks, and some even went bankrupt. This highlighted the importance of having strong financial regulations and oversight in place to prevent such crises from occurring in the future.In response, regulators have implemented a range of measures to strengthen banks' balance sheets and reduce the likelihood of another crisis. These include increasing capital requirements (i.e. the amount of funds banks must hold in reserve), better risk management practices, and stricter supervision and enforcement.While these measures have helped to make the banking system more resilient, some argue that further reforms are needed to address remaining vulnerabilities and prevent future crises.
