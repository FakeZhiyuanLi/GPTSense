Albert Pike's opinions were grounded in his extensive knowledge and understanding of various philosophical, spiritual, and occult traditions. He was a highly educated and well-read individual who had studied theology, philosophy, and the occult for many years. He was also a member of several secret societies, including the Freemasons, which gave him access to esoteric knowledge and teachings that were not available to the general public. Pike's opinions were therefore rooted in his own personal beliefs and experiences, as well as the teachings and traditions of the various groups he was associated with.
