All treaties adopted by the United Nations must undergo the process of registration with the UN Secretariat, as mandated by Article 102 of the UN Charter. This process involves the submission of the text of the treaty and other relevant information to the UN Secretariat, which then enters the treaty into the UN Treaty Series. Registration is necessary for a treaty to acquire the status of an international agreement and to be binding on the parties.
