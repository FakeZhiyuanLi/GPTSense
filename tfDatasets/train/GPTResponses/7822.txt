During the early Heian period, the concept of "shoen" or private landholding obtained legal status in Japan. This involved the transfer of state-owned land to private individuals or clans, who had the right to cultivate or use the land as their own. The shoen system became the basis of feudalism in Japan and played a crucial role in shaping Japan's political and social structure during the Middle Ages.
