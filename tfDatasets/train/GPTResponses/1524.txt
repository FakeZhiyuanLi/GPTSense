Edward the Confessor was a king of England who ruled from 1042 to 1066. He was the son of King Ethelred the Unready and his wife Emma of Normandy. Edward was born in England, but spent many years in exile in Normandy during the Danish invasions of England. When he became king, he was known for his piety and his devotion to the Christian faith, and was often called "the Confessor" because of his reputed ability to heal people by touch. During his reign, he commissioned the building of Westminster Abbey and worked to promote peace and stability in England. Edward died childless in 1066, leading to a power struggle for the English throne that ultimately resulted in the Norman Conquest of England by William the Conqueror.
