The feared self in adolescence can be described as the image of oneself that an individual fears becoming in the future. It is a negative perception of oneself that can cause anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem. Adolescents may have strong concerns about their physical appearance, social status, academic performance, and relationships, which can contribute to the development of a feared self. For example, an adolescent may fear becoming unpopular, unattractive, unsuccessful, or rejected by peers. This fear can be a driving force for their behavior and decision-making, as they try to avoid the consequences of becoming their feared self. It can also lead to a lack of confidence and engagement in various areas of life. Helping adolescents build a positive self-image and supporting them in achieving their goals can help them overcome the negative impact of a feared self.
