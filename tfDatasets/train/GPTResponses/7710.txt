St. Dominic founded the convent of Saint Sixtus in Rome for nuns converted from the Albigensian heresy, a dualistic religious movement that rejected the authority of the Catholic Church. He also converted several noble women and wealthy widows who joined his order, including Bl. Cecilia Caesarini, Bl. Diana d'Andalo, and Bl. Margaret of Hungary.
