Cyborg anthropology studies the interactions between humans and technological systems they have built. It examines how technology has become a part of human social, biological, and cultural systems, and how it changes the way humans understand themselves and their relationships with others. It explores the intersection of human and machine, and how humans use technology to enhance their cognitive, physical, and social capabilities. Additionally, cyborg anthropology investigates the power dynamics between humans and technology and how these relationships are shaped by social, economic, and political factors. Ultimately, the goal of cyborg anthropology is to understand how humans and technology co-evolve and shape each other.
