Basso continuo, also known as continuo or figured bass, is a method of musical accompaniment that was used in the Baroque era. It involves a continuously played bass line (usually played by a cello or bass instrument) with chords indicated by figures placed above or below the bass line. The keyboard player would then improvise or play written-out harmonies based on these figures.
