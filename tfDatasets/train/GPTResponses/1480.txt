Southampton supplied a large number of troops, equipment, and supplies to the Allied forces after D-Day. This included fuel, ammunition, and vehicles that were important for the rapid advance of the Allied troops across Europe. As a result, the city became a major target for German air raids, especially as it was also home to the largest port in Britain, making it a vital hub for the logistics of the war effort. The Luftwaffe conducted several heavy raids on Southampton, including the infamous "Southampton Blitz" in November 1940, which left much of the city in ruins.
