Darwin believed that emotions developed through the process of natural selection. He proposed that emotions evolved as adaptive responses to environmental challenges and opportunities. Emotions therefore have survival value, allowing individuals to respond quickly and appropriately to threats or opportunities for survival and reproduction. Over time, those individuals with more effective emotional responses would have been more likely to survive and pass on their genes, leading to the gradual evolution and refinement of emotional responses.
