The atomic bomb was created during World War II, specifically during the Manhattan Project, which was a research and development project that produced the first nuclear weapons. The project was undertaken by the United States and involved scientists from various countries. The creation of the atomic bomb was a response to the war effort and the perceived threat posed by Germany, which was also researching nuclear weapons at the time. The bombing of Pearl Harbor by Japan in 1941 also played a role in the decision to develop the atomic bomb, as it escalated the US involvement in the war.
