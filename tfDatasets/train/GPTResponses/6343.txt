Plutonium-239 is derived from uranium-238 through a process known as nuclear transmutation. When uranium-238 absorbs a neutron, it undergoes a series of radioactive decays and eventually forms plutonium-239. This process is commonly used for the production of plutonium for nuclear weapons and power reactors.
