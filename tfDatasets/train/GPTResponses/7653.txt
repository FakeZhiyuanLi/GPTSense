The group that especially benefited from the Dominican Order's mystical spirituality were laypeople who sought a deeper connection with God and a more meaningful spiritual life outside of traditional monastic settings. The Dominicans emphasized the importance of contemplation, prayer, and personal relationship with God, which resonated with many laypeople and inspired them to live a more spiritual life. Additionally, the Dominicans believed in the importance of education and intellectual inquiry, which helped to create a well-informed and spiritually awakened laity. This approach democratized spirituality, making it accessible to people from all walks of life and backgrounds.
