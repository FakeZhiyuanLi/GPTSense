Yes, there were refugees who fled from Myanmar (formerly Burma) during the conflict that occurred in 2015. The conflict was between the Myanmar Army and the Arakan Army in the Rakhine state of Myanmar. As a result of the conflict, thousands of people, mostly civilians, were displaced and forced to flee their homes. Many of them sought refuge in neighboring countries like Bangladesh, where they were accommodated in refugee camps. The conflict also resulted in increased violence against the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar, leading to a large-scale exodus of Rohingya refugees to Bangladesh.
