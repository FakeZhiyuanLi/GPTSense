Many scholars and historians believe that the Hellenistic world relied heavily on Babylonian astronomy. This is because the Babylonians were known for their advanced knowledge of astronomy and had developed sophisticated methods for observing and recording celestial events. The Greeks, who valued the study of the stars and planets, were fascinated by this knowledge and incorporated many of the Babylonian techniques into their own astronomical practices. Some notable scholars who have written about the influence of Babylonian astronomy on the Hellenistic world include Otto Neugebauer, Alexander Jones, and John M. Steele.
