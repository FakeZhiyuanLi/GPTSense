Upgraders are industrial facilities that convert heavy crude oil into higher-value synthetic crude oil (SCO) or upgraded crude oil. The synthetic product produced by upgraders is synthetic crude oil, which is a type of crude oil that has been processed to remove impurities such as sulfur, nitrogen, and metals. SCO is similar in quality to light sweet crude oil and can be refined into various petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel.
