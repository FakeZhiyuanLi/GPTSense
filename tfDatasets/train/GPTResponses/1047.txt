context the two terms are used interchangeably?The terms "Near East" and "Middle East" are often used interchangeably to refer to the same region, which includes Southwest Asia and parts of North Africa. The term "Near East" originated in the late 19th century to describe the eastern part of the Ottoman Empire, while "Middle East" became popularized in the early 20th century to describe the region between Europe and Asia.
