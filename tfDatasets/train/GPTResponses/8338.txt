Opponents to affirmative action claim that it can be discriminatory towards people who are not part of the targeted group, creates reverse discrimination, conflicts with the idea of meritocracy, contributes to the stigmatization of those who are supposed to benefit from it, and perpetuates stereotypes about certain groups. Additionally, opponents argue that affirmative action policies can lead to resentment and tension among different ethnic and racial groups, and that they do not address the underlying structural inequalities and discrimination that lead to disparities in the first place.
