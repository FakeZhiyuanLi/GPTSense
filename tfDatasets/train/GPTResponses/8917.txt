The controversy around Darwin's book that began in the 1920s was largely centered around the concept of eugenics, which was gaining popularity at the time. Eugenics refers to the belief that certain races, individuals, or traits are biologically superior to others and should be promoted through selective breeding and reproduction. Some proponents of eugenics used Darwin's theory of evolution as a justification for their beliefs, arguing that it supported the idea that some groups were inherently superior to others. This led to a heated debate over the interpretation of Darwin's work and whether or not it provided a scientific basis for eugenic policies.
