Fermatas are musical symbols that indicate a pause or hold in a piece of music. It is a symbol that looks like a dot placed above or below a note, chord or rest. Fermatas are used to indicate to the musicians that they should hold the note, chord or rest longer than its written value. The duration of the hold is up to the musician's discretion and interpretation of the piece. Fermatas are commonly used in choral and orchestral music, and are often found at the end of a section, at the end of a piece, or above a cadence to create a dramatic effect.
