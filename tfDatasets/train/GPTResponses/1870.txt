The szlachta, which refers to the Polish nobility, gained institutional privileges under the reign of King Sigismund II Augustus, who ruled from 1548 until 1572. During this time, the szlachta became the dominant force in Polish politics and society, with their privileges enshrined in laws such as the Nihil Novi Act of 1505, which restricted the power of the monarchy and gave the nobility significant political influence.
