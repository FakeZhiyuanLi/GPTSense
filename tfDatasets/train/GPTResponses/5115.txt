Many sea creatures rely on phytoplankton to live. Phytoplankton are tiny, single-celled plants that float near the surface of the water and photosynthesize to produce energy. They form the base of the marine food chain and are consumed by zooplankton, small fish, and other organisms. Without phytoplankton, many larger marine animals would have no source of food and the entire oceanic ecosystem would be affected.
