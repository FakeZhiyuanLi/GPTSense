s are involved. For example, if a minor breach occurs and the affected parties believe it can be rectified easily, then it may not affect the overall treaty relations. However, if the breach is severe, such as a violation of human rights or territorial integrity, then it can result in strained relations and even lead to the termination of the treaty. Other factors that can impact treaty relations include the level of trust between the parties, the importance of the treaty to each party, and the political and economic consequences of the breach. Ultimately, the reaction to a treaty breach will depend on the unique circumstances of the situation and the perspectives of the affected parties.
