The material within a wrestling ring typically includes a wood frame, steel support structure, plywood boards, foam padding, canvas cover, and turnbuckles. The foam padding is usually around 2-4 inches thick and helps absorb shock and impact during matches. The canvas is stretched over the padding and is where the wrestlers perform. The turnbuckles are located at each corner of the ring and are used to tighten the ropes.
