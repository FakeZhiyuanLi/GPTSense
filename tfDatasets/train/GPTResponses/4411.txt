The prefrontal cortex is the part of the brain that is involved in decision making and cognitive control. It is located in the frontal lobe and is responsible for planning, organizing, problem-solving, attention, and impulse control. The prefrontal cortex is also involved in working memory, which is the ability to remember and manipulate information in the short term. Dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex can lead to deficits in decision-making and cognitive control, such as impulsivity, distractibility, and poor planning.
