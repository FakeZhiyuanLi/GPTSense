The beginning of what ended the Porfiriato was the Mexican Revolution, which began in 1910 and ended in 1920. This revolution rose up against the dictatorship of President Porfirio Diaz, who had been in power for over 30 years. The revolution was fought by various groups, including peasants, workers, intellectuals, and politicians, who sought to bring about political, social, and economic reforms in Mexico. The revolution was marked by fierce battles, political turmoil, and international intervention, ultimately leading to the downfall of the Porfirio Diaz regime and the establishment of a new political order in Mexico.
