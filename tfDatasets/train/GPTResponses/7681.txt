Nasser wanted to handle the day-to-day operations of the Egyptian government himself. He held many high-level positions, including Prime Minister, Minister of Defense, and President, and was known for his hands-on approach to government affairs. However, he also appointed a number of trusted advisors and officials to help him manage the country, including Anwar Sadat and Gamal Abdel Nasser.
