Reverse migration typically leads to an increase in the population of the country or region where the migration is occurring. This can have both positive and negative effects, such as an increase in cultural diversity or strain on resources and infrastructure. It may also lead to the revitalization of areas and the creation of new economic opportunities. However, there may also be challenges in terms of integration and social cohesion between different groups of people.
