The French lodges promoted the idea that women were equal to men and should have the same rights and opportunities, including membership in the Freemasons. They argued that excluding women went against the principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity that the Freemasons upheld. They also pointed out that many women were already involved in charity work and social causes, which were important aspects of Freemasonry. Some French lodges even created their own women's-only branches, such as the Order of the Eastern Star.
