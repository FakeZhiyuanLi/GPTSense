When the Lord Commissioners take the Sovereign's place in the ceremony, the ceremony still takes place in the Houses of Parliament, but the focus shifts to the House of Commons where the Lord Commissioners are seated to give the Royal Assent to the Bills. The Lord Commissioners are usually members of the government and are appointed by the Sovereign to act as her representatives in giving the Royal Assent.
