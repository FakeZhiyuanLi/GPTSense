Bile from the liver helps in the digestion and absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins. It emulsifies large fat particles into smaller ones, aiding in their breakdown by enzymes in the small intestine. This allows for better absorption of the nutrients from food. Bile also helps to eliminate waste products, such as bilirubin and cholesterol, from the body.
