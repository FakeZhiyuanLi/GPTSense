Darwin discusses the theory of natural selection, which is related to the importance of homologous structures. According to this theory, organisms with similar structures are believed to have evolved from a common ancestor, and these structures have similar functions due to similar evolutionary pressures. Homologous structures indicate a shared ancestry between different species, suggesting that they have descended from a common ancestor and have evolved over time to adapt to different environments. Darwin argued that the existence of homologous structures provided evidence for the theory of evolution and the common ancestry of different species.
