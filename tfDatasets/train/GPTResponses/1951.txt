Evolutionary phonology combines the principles of evolutionary biology and linguistics to explain how sound patterns in language are formed and changed over time. It suggests that like other biological traits, language also evolves through a combination of genetic and cultural factors. The theory posits that language sounds, or phonemes, are shaped by natural selection, cultural transmission, and other factors such as the physical constraints of speech production and perception. Ultimately, the patterns observed in language sound systems are the product of a complex interplay between these various factors.
