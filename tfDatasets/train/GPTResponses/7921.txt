The enzymes in our body are primarily made up of proteins. The specific sequence of amino acids in the protein determines the enzyme's shape and ultimately, its function in catalyzing chemical reactions in the body. Some enzymes may also contain non-protein components, such as metal ions or cofactors, which assist in their function.
