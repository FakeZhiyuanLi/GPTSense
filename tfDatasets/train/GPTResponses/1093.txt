It is difficult to determine the exact historical context or location that this question is referring to. However, it is known that during the Middle Ages, many wealthy and powerful individuals (such as monarchs, nobles, and bishops) often made donations or charitable gifts to various religious institutions, including the Benedictine monasteries. These donations were often intended to support the spiritual and educational work of the monks, as well as to provide for the poor and needy within the local community. Therefore, it is possible that some individual or group may have required or requested that a particular Benedictine monastery maintain a charity school as part of their religious or philanthropic duties.
