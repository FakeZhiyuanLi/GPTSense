Haredi Jews do not share the same approach to modernity and secularism as other Jewish sects. They uphold strict adherence to traditional Jewish law and customs, often living in isolated communities and rejecting many aspects of modern culture and technology. Haredi Jews also place a strong emphasis on religious education, with many spending their entire lives studying Jewish texts and traditions. This sets them apart from other Jewish groups who may be more integrated into mainstream society and have different approaches to religious practice and interpretation.
