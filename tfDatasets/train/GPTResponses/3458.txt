The work of Virgil that was later widely interpreted to have predicted the birth of Jesus Christ is the Eclogue IV, also known as the Fourth Eclogue or the Messianic Eclogue. It is a prophetic poem that describes the return of the "great cycle of ages" and the birth of a child who will bring a new era of peace and prosperity to the world. This child is widely interpreted as a foreshadowing of Jesus Christ.
