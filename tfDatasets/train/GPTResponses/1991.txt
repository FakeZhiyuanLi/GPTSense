One notable Somali cultural tradition is the oral storytelling tradition, where stories, myths, and legends have been passed down through generations orally. This tradition is an integral part of Somali culture and has played a significant role in preserving the history, values, and beliefs of the Somali people. These stories are often recited by a special group of storytellers called the "Hees," who recite these stories through song and poetry. The storytelling tradition has also been a way to connect with others and build community, particularly in rural areas where there is limited access to mass media.
