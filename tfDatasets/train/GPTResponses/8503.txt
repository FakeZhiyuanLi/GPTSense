Processed foods are often more convenient and time-saving than whole foods. They are often pre-cooked, pre-packaged and can be easily stored, transported and prepared. This allows people to have quick and easy access to meals without having to spend a lot of time cooking and preparing food from scratch. Additionally, processed foods often have a longer shelf life, making them easier to store and use over extended periods of time.
