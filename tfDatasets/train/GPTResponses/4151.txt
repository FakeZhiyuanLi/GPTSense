After each country adopted the calendar, the weekly cycle continued according to the seven-day week. The seven-day week has been observed in many cultures throughout history and is not directly tied to any astronomical or natural cycles. Therefore, it continued to be observed even after the adoption of a new calendar system. The days of the week were named after the planets in the solar system and have been used for thousands of years. Today, the seven-day week is recognized and observed by most countries and cultures around the world.
