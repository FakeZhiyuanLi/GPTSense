The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, as well as the American Psychiatric Association, recognize that sexual orientation is a fundamental aspect of human identity and not a mental disorder, and promote the acceptance and support of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) individuals. They emphasize the importance of providing affirming and culturally competent mental health care for LGBTQ individuals, including access to evidence-based treatments and support services. They also recognize the harmful effects of discrimination and prejudice on mental health outcomes for LGBTQ individuals, and advocate for the elimination of these barriers.
