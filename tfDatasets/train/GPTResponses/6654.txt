The move is commonly known as the "four-point restraint" or "four-point hold." It is a restraint technique in which a person's hands and feet are bound together or secured to fixed objects, rendering them unable to move. It is often used by law enforcement or medical professionals in cases of physical or behavioral agitation or in situations where a person poses a danger to themselves or others.
