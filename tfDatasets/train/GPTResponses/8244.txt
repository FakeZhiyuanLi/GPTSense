Conversation: Talk to members of the group to understand their perspectives, motivations, and values. Ask open-ended questions and listen actively.3. Context: Consider the historical, cultural, and social context in which the group exists. Understand how external factors influence the group's dynamics and behavior.4. Behavior: Analyze the group's behavior, particularly in response to different situations or challenges. Look for underlying causes and motivations.5. Power dynamics: Investigate the power dynamics within the group, such as who has authority, who makes decisions, and how conflicts are resolved.6. Relationship dynamics: Examine the group's relationships, including how members relate to each other, the level of trust and cooperation, and how conflicts are handled.7. Diversity: Recognize and value the diversity within the group, including differences in background, experience, and viewpoints. Understand how this diversity contributes to the group's strength and challenges.
