Traditionally, contributions to the arts and sciences have been rewarded by monarchs, governments, and academic institutions. For example, in ancient Greece, poets, philosophers, and scientists were often financially supported by wealthy patrons. During the Renaissance era, artists, writers, and scientists were often funded and commissioned by royalty and wealthy merchants. In modern times, many governments offer grants, fellowships, and prizes to support and reward contributions to the arts and sciences. Additionally, academic institutions often offer awards, scholarships, and fellowships to recognize and advance exceptional students and researchers.
