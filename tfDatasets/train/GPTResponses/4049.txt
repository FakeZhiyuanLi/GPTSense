The Spanish colonies lagged behind in adopting the Gregorian calendar, which was introduced by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582, because of the delay in communication and transportation of information between Europe and the colonies. Additionally, some Spaniards in the colonies were resistant to change and preferred to stick to tradition, such as the Julian calendar, which was still in use in Spain at the time. The adoption of the Gregorian calendar was also linked to religious and political tensions, as the Catholic Church and monarchs were seen as imposing changes on traditional practices. It was not until the 18th century that the Gregorian calendar was fully adopted in the Spanish colonies.
