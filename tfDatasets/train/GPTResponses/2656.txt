The regulation of gene expression involves the interaction of regulatory proteins with specific DNA sequences located within the regulatory regions of a gene. These regulatory regions could be located near the coding sequence or may be located far away from it.One reason why some regulatory regions of a gene do not have to be close to the coding sequence is that the three-dimensional folding of DNA allows distant regulatory elements to contact the promoter region and influence gene expression. This is possible because DNA can form loops that bring distant regions into close proximity. Additionally, DNA is packaged in nucleosomes that can be repositioned to expose or hide regulatory sequences.Furthermore, some regulatory elements function to regulate the chromatin structure of the gene and its surrounding region. These elements can alter the accessibility of other regulatory elements, such as enhancers or promoters, and can modulate gene expression from a distance.In summary, the complex three-dimensional structure of the DNA molecule allows distant regulatory elements to interact with the promoter region of genes and influence gene expression, which is why some regulatory regions may not be close to the coding sequence.
