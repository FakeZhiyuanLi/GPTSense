The Gregorian calendar also addressed the difference between the solar year (the time it takes for the Earth to complete one orbit around the Sun) and the length of the calendar year, which was slightly shorter due to the complications of leap years. The Gregorian calendar introduced the leap year rule in order to keep the calendar year aligned with the solar year.
