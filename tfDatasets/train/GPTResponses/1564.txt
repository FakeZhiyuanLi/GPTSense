The kings of Scots are traditionally coronated upon the Stone of Scone, also known as the Stone of Destiny or the Coronation Stone. This ancient symbol of Scottish monarchy was used in the coronation ceremonies of Scottish monarchs from the ninth to the sixteenth centuries, and is still used in the current coronation ceremonies of British monarchs. It is said to have been brought from Ireland to Scotland in the early Middle Ages and was used for centuries as the seat of royal power. It is currently held in Edinburgh Castle.
