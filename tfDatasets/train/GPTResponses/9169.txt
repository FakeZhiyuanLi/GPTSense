The northeastern region of India, also known as the Seven Sister States (Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura, and Manipur) was never completely conquered by any foreign power. The region remained mostly isolated due to its rugged terrain and dense forests, and the indigenous tribes in the area fiercely defended their territories against invaders. However, over time, the region was gradually assimilated into the Indian state.
