The Catholic Church has the longest history of objection to Freemasonry, dating back to the 18th century. In 1738, Pope Clement XII issued the papal bull "In Eminenti" which declared Freemasonry to be a "pernicious society" and prohibited Catholics from joining. This prohibition has been reaffirmed by subsequent popes and remains in effect today. Other religious groups such as some Protestant denominations and Orthodox churches also have objections to Freemasonry, but none have as long of a history of opposition as the Catholic Church.
