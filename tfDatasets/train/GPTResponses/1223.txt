When a creature is awake but inattentive, the brain waves observed are alpha waves. Alpha waves are generally associated with a relaxed and calm state of mind, which is typically observed when someone is daydreaming or not engaged in any particular activity. They have a frequency of 8-12 Hz and are most commonly seen in the occipital and parietal lobes of the brain.
