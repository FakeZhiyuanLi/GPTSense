Halakha is a set of Jewish religious laws and customs that guide individuals in their daily lives. It provides guidance on how to observe Shabbat and holidays, how to keep kosher, how to conduct business ethically, how to treat others with compassion and respect, and how to live a life of holiness and integrity. Halakha is considered to be a divine commandment that reflects God's will, and its guidance is accepted by observant Jews as a way to lead a meaningful and purposeful life.
