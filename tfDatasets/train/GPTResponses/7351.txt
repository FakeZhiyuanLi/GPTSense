Flax fibers have been found in ancient textiles in many parts of the world, including Europe, Asia, and the Americas. Some notable examples include:- The Shroud of Turin, a linen cloth believed by many to be the burial shroud of Jesus, contains flax fibers and is believed to date back to the 1st century AD.- The linen wrappings of Egyptian mummies were made from flax fibers and are some of the oldest known examples of flax textiles, dating back as far as 5000 BC.- Viking graves in Scandinavia have yielded linen garments and other textiles made from flax, dating back to the 9th and 10th centuries AD.- In China, flax fibers have been found in burial garments and other textiles dating back to the Neolithic period (4000-2000 BC).- In North and South America, indigenous peoples have used flax fibers to make clothing, fishing nets, and other items for thousands of years. Flax seeds have also been found at archaeological sites in the Americas, suggesting that they were cultivated and used for fiber production.
