There is no dynasty that specifically originates from Austria and Slovenia. Austria was ruled by several dynasties throughout history, including the House of Habsburg, House of Babenberg, and House of Wittelsbach. Slovenia, on the other hand, was part of various states and empires, such as the Holy Roman Empire, Austrian Empire, and Yugoslavia, and did not have a ruling dynasty of its own.
