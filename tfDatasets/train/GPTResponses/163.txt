Imperialism often divides countries by using the technique of "divide and rule." This technique involves exploiting existing divisions within a society, such as religious, ethnic, or linguistic differences, to weaken the unity of the people and make them easier to control. Imperial powers often use this technique to create puppet governments and control the resources of the country without facing significant resistance. This method of division often leads to long-lasting conflicts, civil wars, and instability within the country.
