In a typical AC motor, if there is no current reversal, the rotor would not be able to turn because the magnetic field produced by the stator would remain in a fixed position. The alternating current in the stator windings produces a rotating magnetic field that interacts with the rotor's magnetic field, causing the rotor to rotate. Without current reversal, the magnetic field would be static, and the rotor would not rotate. Therefore, current reversal is a critical component of AC motor operation.
