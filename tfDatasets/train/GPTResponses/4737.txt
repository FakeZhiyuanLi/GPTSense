A zero inflation policy would limit the influence and ability to react of governments, central banks, and other decision-makers who use monetary policy as a tool to stimulate or stabilize the economy. With zero inflation, there would be no room to lower interest rates or increase the money supply to boost economic growth or employment, as these actions could lead to inflationary pressures. As a result, policymakers would have to rely on fiscal policy measures, such as taxes and government spending, which may be less effective or more politically challenging to implement. Additionally, zero inflation could limit the bargaining power of workers and producers in wage negotiations and contracts, leading to slower income growth and economic activity.
