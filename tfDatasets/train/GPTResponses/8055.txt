King George VI's personal assent in 1939 was noteworthy because it marked the first time in over 200 years that a British monarch had personally approved a bill passed by Parliament. This was seen as a symbolic recognition of the power of the elected Parliament over the monarchy and further cemented the constitutional monarchy system in the United Kingdom. The assent was given to the Parliament Act, which reduced the power of the House of Lords and helped establish the primacy of the House of Commons.
