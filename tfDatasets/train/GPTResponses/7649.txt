The four shielded wires in the USB 2.0 variant are used for:1. VCC (power supply) - provides +5V DC power to the USB device2. D- (data signal) - sends and receives data signals between the USB device and the host computer3. D+ (data signal) - sends and receives data signals between the USB device and the host computer4. Ground (reference voltage) - provides a reference voltage for the data signals and allows for proper grounding of the USB device.The shielding around the wires helps to prevent interference and maintain signal integrity.
