Edwin Hubble's discovery about galaxies allowed for the theory of the expanding universe by Georges Lemaitre, which became known as the Big Bang theory. Hubble discovered that galaxies were moving away from each other, and the further away they were, the faster they were moving. This provided evidence for the idea that the universe was expanding, which supported Lemaitre's theory that the universe had originated from a single, extremely hot and dense point, which had expanded rapidly in a "Big Bang" about 13.8 billion years ago.
