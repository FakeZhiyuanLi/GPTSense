During the Battle of Balaclava in the Crimean War, it was the British Heavy Brigade that countered the movement of the Russian cavalry. The brigade was led by Major-General James Yorke Scarlett, who launched a charge against the Russian cavalry that was attempting to sabre the British artillery. The British charge was successful in driving back the Russian cavalry, though they suffered heavy losses in the process.
