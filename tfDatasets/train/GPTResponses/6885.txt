Futurism had little in common with cubism. While both art movements sought to break away from traditional art techniques and representation, futurism focused more on the celebration of modern technology and speed, rather than the multiple perspectives and fragmented forms that cubism explored. Futurism often included dynamic lines, bright colors, and depictions of movement, while cubism tended to emphasize the deconstruction of forms and the use of muted colors.
