One property of wood that could be projected by looking at its density is its strength. Generally, wood with higher density tends to be stronger and more durable than wood with lower density. This is because denser wood has a tighter grain structure and is less likely to crack or split under stress. Therefore, if we know the density of a particular wood sample, we can make predictions about its strength and suitability for different applications.
