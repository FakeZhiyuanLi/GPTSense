The Porcelain Tower of Nanjing was not "decimated" by any one person or entity. Its destruction was a result of a combination of factors, including natural disasters and man-made damage. The tower was struck by lightning in 1801, and several of its layers were destroyed. In the 1850s, during the Taiping Rebellion, the tower was used as a military base and was further damaged by cannon fire. The tower was ultimately destroyed in the 1920s, when the Republican government sold off its bricks to help fund the construction of a new provincial university.
