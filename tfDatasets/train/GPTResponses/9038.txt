Asthma is usually classified based on its severity and how well it is controlled. The severity of asthma is determined by the frequency and intensity of symptoms and how they affect daily activities, as well as the results of lung function tests. Asthma can be classified as mild, moderate, or severe. The control of asthma is determined by how well symptoms are managed with medications and other treatments. Asthma can be classified as well-controlled, partly controlled, or uncontrolled.
