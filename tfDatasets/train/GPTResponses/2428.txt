The studying of rock formations in the Alps began in the late 18th century with the work of geologists such as Horace-Bénédict de Saussure and Jean-Étienne Guettard. This was followed by the development of the science of geology in the 19th century, which saw a significant increase in research activity focused on the Alps.
