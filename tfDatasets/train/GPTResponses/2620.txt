The format used to store internal time in systems that use zoneinfo is Unix time, also known as POSIX time. It is the number of seconds that have elapsed since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC. The zoneinfo database stores this time in binary format, with each file representing a different time zone. The file contains information about time transitions, such as daylight saving time changes, and is used to convert Unix time to local time in the specified time zone.
