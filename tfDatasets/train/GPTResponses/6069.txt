Pope Clement XII is considered to be the first pope to issue papal pronouncements against freemasons. In 1738, he issued the Papal Bull "In Eminenti Apostolatus Specula" which declared that freemasonry was incompatible with Christianity and that Catholics who joined the organization would be excommunicated.
