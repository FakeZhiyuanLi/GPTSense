The domesticated turkey has been used for ornamental purposes, as a source of feathers and for ceremonial and religious occasions. They have also been kept as pets and used in educational programs to teach people about agriculture and farming. In some cases, the turkey's main purpose is to provide manure for farming or to control insects in gardens. Additionally, wild turkeys have been used for hunting and wildlife conservation efforts.
