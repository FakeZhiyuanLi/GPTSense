The impressionists used the technique of "en plein air" or "painting outdoors" to capture the essence of their subjects with simple brushstrokes and colors. They also used the technique of "alla prima," or painting wet-on-wet, to create a sense of immediacy in their paintings. By emphasizing the effects of light and color, the impressionists were able to simplify their subjects and create a sense of movement and energy in their work.
