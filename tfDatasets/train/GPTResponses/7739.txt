Islamic influence in Tibet came mainly from the traders and merchants from Central Asia who used the Silk Road to reach Tibet. These traders brought with them not only goods but also their religion, Islam. Tibetan rulers also established diplomatic relations with neighboring Islamic kingdoms like the Abbasid Caliphate and the Kashmir Sultanate, which contributed to the spread of Islamic influence in Tibet. Additionally, some scholars suggest that there were also Islamic soldiers and scholars who traveled with Tibetan armies and monks to Central Asia and India, which exposed them to Islamic culture and ideas.
