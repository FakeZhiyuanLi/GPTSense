One type of pine with very dark-colored heartwood is the longleaf pine (Pinus palustris). Its heartwood can range from dark reddish-brown to almost black, while the earlywood is yellow or pale. Another pine species known for its contrast of light and dark wood is the ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), which has a reddish-brown heartwood and light yellow earlywood.
