There was no singular governing body of the Hindu states throughout history. The nature of governance varied depending on the time period and the specific kingdom or empire in question. However, generally, the rulers of Hindu states were known as kings, maharajahs, or emperors and were supported by a council of advisors and a system of local governance through smaller administrative units known as provinces or districts. The Brahmin priestly class also played a significant role in the governance of Hindu states, particularly during the Vedic period.
