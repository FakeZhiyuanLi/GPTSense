Poultry is most commonly raised in indoor environments, such as barns or sheds, where they are provided with controlled temperature, lighting, and ventilation. This type of environment is known as a "confined animal feeding operation" (CAFO). However, some poultry farmers also raise their birds in free-range or pasture-based systems, which allow the birds to have access to outdoor areas for foraging and exercise.
