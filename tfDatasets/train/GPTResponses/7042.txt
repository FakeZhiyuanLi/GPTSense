The initial purpose of the BitTorrent protocol was to provide a peer-to-peer file sharing system that allowed users to share large files more efficiently and effectively than traditional file sharing methods. It was designed to address the limitations of other file transfer protocols such as FTP and HTTP, which were becoming increasingly inefficient as file sizes increased. The protocol works by breaking down large files into smaller pieces and distributing them across multiple users, allowing for faster and more reliable downloads.
