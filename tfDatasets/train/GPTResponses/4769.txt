The percentage of silver in silver proof coins varies depending on the country and the year. In general, silver proof coins are made with 90-99.9% pure silver. For example, the American Silver Eagle coin contains 99.9% pure silver, while the Canadian Silver Maple Leaf coin contains 99.99% pure silver. The percentage of silver in silver proofs is usually printed on the coin or accompanying certificate of authenticity.
