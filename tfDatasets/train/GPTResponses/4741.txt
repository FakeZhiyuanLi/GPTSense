The human eye becomes significantly less sensitive to light at wavelengths higher than 700 nanometers (nm) and lower than 400 nm. These wavelengths are outside the visible spectrum and are referred to as infrared and ultraviolet radiation, respectively. However, the exact point at which sensitivity decreases varies among individuals and can be affected by factors like age and visual health.
