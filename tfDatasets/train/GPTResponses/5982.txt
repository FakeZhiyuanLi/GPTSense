The works of Panini and Patanjali were used to teach Sanskrit to the higher castes of India. Panini's grammar book, Ashtadhyayi, is considered one of the most important texts for understanding the Sanskrit language, while Patanjali's Mahabhashya is a commentary on Panini's work and helps to explain some of the more complex aspects of the language. These two works were studied extensively by students of Sanskrit, particularly those in the higher castes who were interested in mastering the language for religious and philosophical purposes.
