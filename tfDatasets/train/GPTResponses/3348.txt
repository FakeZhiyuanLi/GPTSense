The territory occupied by a single tribe varied depending on the size and location of the tribe. Some small tribes may have occupied only a few square miles, while larger tribes could have territory that spanned hundreds of miles. Additionally, the concept of distinct tribal territories was not always relevant to indigenous peoples, as their cultures often recognized territories and borders in different ways than European and American societies.
