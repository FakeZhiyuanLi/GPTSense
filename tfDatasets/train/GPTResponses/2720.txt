In year-round DST, the sunrise would generally happen later compared to most places. This is because DST is designed to make better use of daylight hours in the evening, which means that clocks are set an hour ahead of standard time. So, even in winter months when the days are shorter, the sun would not rise until later in the morning as the clocks remain an hour ahead.
