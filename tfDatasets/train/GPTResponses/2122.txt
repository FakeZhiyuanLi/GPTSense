House music from Chicago-based labels was considered a must-play in clubs and music venues all over the world, particularly in the United States, Europe, and Australia. However, Chicago itself was the birthplace and hub of house music, with clubs such as The Warehouse and The Music Box being instrumental in its development and promotion. House music was also widely popular in cities like Detroit, New York, and London, where it gained a dedicated following and influenced the local electronic dance music scenes.
