1. Recession: The most significant factor that hurt the auto industry was the global recession in 2008. The great recession led to higher unemployment rates and reduced consumer spending, which negatively affected the demand for cars.2. Environmental Regulations: Government regulations regarding fuel economy and emissions standards require auto manufacturers to invest heavily in research and development of new technology. These regulations also increase manufacturing costs and reduce profit margins.3. Increased Competition: The auto industry is highly competitive, and the entry of new players further intensified the competition. Domestic auto manufacturers faced tough competition from established foreign brands, which enjoyed a better image and higher-quality products.4. Rising Fuel Prices: The rise in fuel prices over the last decade has led customers to focus on fuel efficiency, smaller cars, and electric vehicles. This shift in consumer preference was not profitable for automakers that specialized in large, gas-guzzling vehicles.5. Product Recalls: Several major auto manufacturers have faced product recalls due to defects in their cars, such as ignition switches, airbags, and fuel tanks. These recalls negatively affect consumer trust and reduce the value of the brand.
