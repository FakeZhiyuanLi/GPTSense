Tsar Nicholas II did not completely ban alcohol, but he did enact several prohibition measures throughout his reign. One notable example was the edict issued in 1914 that restricted the sale and consumption of vodka to between the hours of 12pm and 2pm, and also prohibited its sale on Sundays and holidays. However, these measures were largely unsuccessful in curbing alcoholism and related social issues in Russia.
