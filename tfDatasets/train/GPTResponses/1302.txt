The Benedictines were allowed to identify with a monastic life dedicated to prayer, contemplation, and work. They followed the Rule of Saint Benedict, which emphasized obedience, humility, and simplicity, and they devoted themselves to serving God and their community through manual labor, such as farming, weaving, or hospitality. Benedictines also valued education and scholarship, and many monasteries served as centers of learning and culture. Ultimately, the Benedictine life was one of devotion to God, service to others, and a commitment to living a simple and disciplined existence.
