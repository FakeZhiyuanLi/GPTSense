The micro-AB receptacle is designed to support both USB On-The-Go (OTG) and standard USB devices. However, non-OTG compliant devices may not recognize the OTG functionality and may cause issues with the device they are connected to. This can lead to data corruption, device damage, or other issues. To prevent these problems, non-OTG compliant devices should not be connected to micro-AB receptacles.
