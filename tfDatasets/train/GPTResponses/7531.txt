Capacitors are connected in parallel with the power circuits of many devices and large systems to provide a stable and clean source of power, also known as power conditioning. This is done to reduce electrical noise and to filter out any voltage spikes or fluctuations which can cause damage to sensitive electronic components. Capacitors can also provide a backup power source in case of a sudden surge or power outage, ensuring uninterrupted operation of the device or system. Additionally, capacitors help to improve the power factor, which is a measure of the efficiency of the power system.
