The blending of Romanesque and Islamic styles occurred in parts of Spain, particularly in Andalusia, as it was under Muslim rule for centuries. The Alhambra palace in Granada is a prime example of this blending of styles. Other areas where this occurred include Sicily and southern Italy, which were also under Muslim rule for a time.
