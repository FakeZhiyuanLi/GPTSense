The elements of the fundamental group represent homotopy classes of loops in a space. More precisely, given a basepoint $p$ in a space $X$, the elements of the fundamental group $\pi_1(X,p)$ correspond to equivalence classes of loops based at $p$, where two loops $f$ and $g$ are equivalent if they can be continuously deformed into each other while keeping their endpoints fixed at $p$. This is also known as a homotopy of loops.The fundamental group measures the number of distinct ways in which one can wrap a loop around the space, up to continuous deformation. Each element of the fundamental group corresponds to a unique winding number, which represents how many times a loop wraps around a specific subloop inside the space.
