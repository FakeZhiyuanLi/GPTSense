There are several factors that limit the amount of life that can live at once on earth, such as:1. Availability of resources: The amount of food, water, and shelter available in an ecosystem limits the number of individuals that can survive and reproduce within it.2. Competition: Different species compete for resources like food and shelter, and some may outcompete others, limiting their populations.3. Predation: The presence of predators can limit the population size of prey species.4. Environmental factors: Extreme temperature fluctuations, natural disasters, and other environmental factors can limit the population size of a species.5. Disease: The spread of disease can quickly decimate a population, limiting the amount of life that can survive within an ecosystem.6. Carrying capacity: All ecosystems have a carrying capacity, which is the maximum number of organisms that can be supported by the available resources in that ecosystem. Once this carrying capacity is reached, additional individuals will not be able to survive.
