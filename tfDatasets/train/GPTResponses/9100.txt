The potential mood (potenciál) in Czech verbs indicates possible events. It expresses a hypothetical event that may or may not happen. It is formed by adding the prefix "by-" in front of the base verb and conjugating it according to the tense and person. For example:- Jít (to go) - potential mood: bych šel (I might go), bys šel (you might go), by šel (he/she/it might go), bychom šli (we might go), byste šli (you all might go), by šli (they might go).
