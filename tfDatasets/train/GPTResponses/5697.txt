The questioning of human sexual responses can be traced back to ancient Greek philosophy, where scholars like Plato and Aristotle debated the nature of desire and pleasure. However, modern scientific study of human sexual responses began in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with the work of researchers like Sigmund Freud, Havelock Ellis, and Magnus Hirschfeld. These early studies led to the development of the field of sexology, which continues to evolve and inform our understanding of human sexual behavior today.
