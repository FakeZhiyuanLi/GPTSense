Option C: Declaring Bankruptcy and Liquidating Assets.Declaring bankruptcy and liquidating assets is a last resort option for financial institutions that have failed to manage their finances effectively. This option is nearly impossible because it results in the complete closure of the institution and the loss of jobs for employees. It also damages the reputation of the institution and can lead to a loss of customer trust. Therefore, financial institutions usually try to reorganize themselves through restructuring, mergers and acquisitions, or seeking government assistance before resorting to bankruptcy and liquidation.
