Daylight Saving Time (DST) inherits the baseline time system from Standard Time. In other words, the clocks are adjusted forward or back one hour from standard time to create Daylight Saving Time. During DST, the clock is set forward one hour in the spring and set back one hour in the fall to provide more daylight during the evening hours in the summer months. While daylight saving time is used to save energy and make better use of the extra daylight, it still follows the standard time system.
