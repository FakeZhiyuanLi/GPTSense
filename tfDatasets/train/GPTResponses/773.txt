Green turtles are found in tropical and subtropical waters around the world. They can be found living in the Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean, and Indian Ocean, as well as in the Mediterranean Sea. They commonly nest on sandy beaches in warm regions, such as Florida, Costa Rica, and the Seychelles. They also inhabit coral reefs and seagrass beds, where they feed on algae and seagrasses.
