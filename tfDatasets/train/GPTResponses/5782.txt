Batteries are typically grouped based on their chemistry and voltage. Some common battery chemistries include lead-acid, lithium-ion, nickel-cadmium, and alkaline. Batteries can also be grouped by their voltage, such as 1.5V (AAA, AA, C, D), 3V (coin cell), or 12V (car battery). Additionally, batteries can be grouped by their size and shape, such as cylindrical, rectangular, or button cell.
