The discovery that more people reading newspapers resulted in higher political accountability can be attributed to different researchers and theorists. However, the concept of the press as a watchdog of the government and the importance of an informed citizenry in promoting democratic governance dates back to the 18th century, with figures such as John Milton and Thomas Jefferson advocating for freedom of speech and the press. In the 20th century, scholars such as Walter Lippmann, James Curran, and Jay Blumer expanded on these ideas and conducted empirical studies to show the link between media consumption, political knowledge, and accountability.
