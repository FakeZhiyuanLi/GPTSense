Magnetoception is the ability of certain animals to detect magnetic fields. This sense is used for navigation and orientation in space, allowing animals to navigate long distances by using the Earth's magnetic field. This ability is found in a variety of animal species including birds, turtles, fish, and some mammals. It is believed that magnetoception is based on the detection of magnetic fields by specialized cells in the animal's body, known as magnetoreceptors. However, the exact mechanism by which animals detect magnetic fields is not yet fully understood.
