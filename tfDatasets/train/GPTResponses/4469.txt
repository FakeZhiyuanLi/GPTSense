The event that led to English temporarily losing its importance as a literary language was the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. The Normans, who were French-speaking, became the ruling class and French became the dominant language in England for several centuries. As a result, literature and culture were predominantly expressed in French during this time, and English regained its status as a literary language only in the late Middle Ages.
