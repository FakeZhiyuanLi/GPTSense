The excavations at ancient Ur were carried out by a team of archaeologists led by Sir Leonard Woolley in the 1920s and 1930s. The project was funded by the British Museum and the University of Pennsylvania, and the findings from the excavation helped shape our understanding of Sumerian civilization.
