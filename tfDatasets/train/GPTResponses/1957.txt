Radial growth has a significant effect on the density of wood. Radial growth refers to the growth of the tree in width through the addition of new layers of wood around the perimeter of the trunk. As the tree grows radially, the density of the wood increases due to the compression of the wood fibers. This results in a denser and stronger wood, which is desirable for many applications, such as construction, furniture, and tools.
