As society progressed and nations became more centralized, the power of the nobility's feudal system declined. This was largely due to three key factors:1. The rise of nation-states: As nation-states emerged, centralized systems of government developed. This meant that power was increasingly concentrated in the hands of monarchs and their administrations, rather than being shared between nobles and monarchs. This meant that the nobility lost some of their power and influence.2. Changes in warfare: Changes in warfare also contributed to the decline of the nobility's power. With the rise of firearms, the feudal system of knights and armored soldiers became obsolete. This meant that the nobility's traditional role as soldiers and military leaders was diminished.3. Economic changes: Finally, economic changes also played a role in the decline of the nobility's power. As commerce and trade expanded, wealthy merchants and capitalists began to accumulate wealth and influence. This meant that nobles were no longer the only wealthy and powerful members of society.Overall, the nobility's feudal power declined as political, economic, and social changes transformed medieval Europe into the modern world.
