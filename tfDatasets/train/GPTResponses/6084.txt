1. Drought: Melbourne is prone to extended periods of low rainfall, which can result in a decrease in water levels in reservoirs.2. Population Growth: As the population grows, the demand for water increases, and this can lead to a depletion of water supplies.3. Climate Change: Changing weather patterns and higher temperatures can reduce rainfall in Melbourne, leading to less water.4. Urbanization: The expansion of urban areas can increase the demand for water resources as more water is required for domestic, industrial, and commercial purposes.5. Agricultural Activities: Agriculture requires a significant amount of water, and farmers may pump water from rivers and groundwater resources, leading to depletion.6. Industrial Processes: Manufacturing and industrial processes consume a significant amount of water, and this can contribute to the depletion of water resources.7. Overuse: Overuse of water resources, such as excessive watering of gardens, can result in the depletion of water supplies.8. Leakage: Leakage in water supply systems can result in wastage and depletion of water resources.
