During the last ice age, the source of the Rhine was located further to the east than it is today. The Rhine flowed from the Swiss Alps and was fed by glaciers and melting snow. The river followed a different course than it does today, flowing northwards through what is now the Lake Constance basin, before turning westwards towards the North Sea.
