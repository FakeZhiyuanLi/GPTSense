The canopy, or the uppermost part of a tree, opens and spreads out more as it matures. This is because as the tree grows, it produces more leaves and branches, which extend outwards and upwards to capture more sunlight and maximize photosynthesis. Additionally, the lower branches may die off as the tree grows taller, further increasing the spread of the canopy.
