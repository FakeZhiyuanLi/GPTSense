It is difficult to identify a clear winner in the balance of relationship between the church and state as a result of the Concordat. The agreement sought to allocate certain roles and responsibilities to each party, and while the Catholic Church was granted certain privileges, such as state funding and the ability to provide education, it also agreed not to interfere in political matters.However, some argue that the balance may have shifted slightly in favor of the Church, as it regained some of the influence it had lost during the French Revolution and subsequent attempts to secularize the state. The Concordat also helped to improve relations between the two institutions after years of tension.Ultimately, the relationship between church and state in France has continued to evolve over time, with various shifts in power and influence occurring at different moments in history.
