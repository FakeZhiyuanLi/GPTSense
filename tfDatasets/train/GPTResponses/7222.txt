Insensitive film is typically produced as a high-speed film, with an ISO rating of at least 800 or higher. This allows it to capture images even in low-light situations or other challenging environments where traditional film would not be able to produce a usable photograph. However, the actual speed of the film may vary depending on the specific product and manufacturer.
