Vertical ground reaction force (VGRF) is the force exerted by the ground on an object or person in a vertical direction when they come into contact with the ground. It is a measure of the force that is produced by the impact of the foot or feet hitting the ground during movement such as running, jumping, or walking. VGRF is an important metric in biomechanics, as it can impact running efficiency, injury risk, and performance.
