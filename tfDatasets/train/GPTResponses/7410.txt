For example, if someone works in construction, they may wear clothes with reflective strips that make them easily visible to drivers and heavy machinery operators. Similarly, if someone works in a job where they handle hazardous materials, they may wear protective clothing to prevent harmful exposure. In some cases, people may also wear high visibility clothing for recreational activities like running or cycling to ensure they are easily seen by drivers on the road. Ultimately, safety clothing is designed to protect the wearer and keep them visible in dangerous or low visibility conditions.
