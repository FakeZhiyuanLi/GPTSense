Any finite group can be expressed as a subgroup of a symmetric group, as a symmetric group of degree n (denoted as Sn) is the group of all permutations of n distinct objects, and any finite group can be seen as a permutation group on a finite set. However, some groups have a more natural representation as a subgroup of a symmetric group than others.Specifically, a group that has a natural action on a set of n elements (i.e. a regular action) can be realized as a subgroup of Sn, where n is the order of the group. This is because the group is naturally isomorphic to a subgroup of the group of permutations of n elements, which is the symmetric group Sn.For example, the dihedral group of order 2n (denoted as Dn), which is the symmetry group of a regular n-gon, can be realized as a subgroup of Sn, where n is the number of vertices of the n-gon. Similarly, the Klein four-group (denoted as V or K4), which is the smallest non-cyclic group, can be realized as a subgroup of S4, the symmetric group of degree 4.Therefore, any group that has a natural regular action on a finite set can be expressed as a subgroup of a symmetric group.
