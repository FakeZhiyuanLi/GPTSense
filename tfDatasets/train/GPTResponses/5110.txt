The grading structure refers to the system used to evaluate and assign grades to academic work such as quizzes, assignments, and exams. This structure varies by institution and may include letter grades (A, B, C, D, F), numerical grades (out of 100 or 4.0 GPA), or percentages. The grading structure typically includes a scale that defines the criteria for each grade level and the corresponding percentage range or point value. The grading structure is important as it helps students understand their performance and progress in a particular course or subject.
