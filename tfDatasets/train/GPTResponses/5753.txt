Another benefit of using two scales to measure sexuality is that it allows for a more comprehensive understanding of an individual's sexual orientation. The Kinsey scale only measures sexual attraction and behavior, whereas an additional scale could measure other aspects of sexuality such as romantic attraction or gender identity. This can provide more nuanced and accurate information about a person's sexual orientation.
