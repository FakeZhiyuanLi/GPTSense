The school document that had to meet the standards of the board for admittance may vary depending on the school and the level of education. However, commonly required documents include transcripts, letters of recommendation, essays or personal statements, test scores (such as standardized test scores or English proficiency exams), and application fees. These documents must meet certain standards and criteria set forth by the school's admission board in order for an applicant to be considered for admittance.
