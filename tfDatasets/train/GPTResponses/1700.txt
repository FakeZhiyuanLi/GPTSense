Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in newborns are also struggle to activate and mature properly. This is because the immune system of newborns is not fully developed, and the APCs are still immature and less effective at recognizing and presenting antigens to other immune cells. Additionally, newborns rely heavily on maternal antibodies for protection during the first few months of life, which can mask the development of their own immune responses. The process of maturation and activation of APCs in newborns occurs gradually over the first few months of life, as the immune system continues to develop and mature.
