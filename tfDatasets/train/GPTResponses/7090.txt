The Reformation began in 1517 with the publication of Martin Luther's Ninety-five Theses, but the roots of Presbyterianism can be traced back to the Scottish Reformation in the 16th century. The Scottish Reformation began with the appointment of John Knox as minister of the Church of St. Giles in Edinburgh in 1559 and continued through the 17th century.
