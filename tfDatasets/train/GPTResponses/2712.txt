Serfdom was abolished at different times in different countries. Here are some notable examples:- In Russia, serfdom was abolished by Tsar Alexander II in 1861.- In the Austrian Empire, serfdom was gradually abolished between 1781 and 1848.- In Prussia, serfdom was abolished in 1807.- In France, serfdom was abolished during the French Revolution in 1789.- In the United States, slavery (which is similar to serfdom) was abolished by the 13th Amendment to the Constitution in 1865.It is worth noting that the abolishment of serfdom was often a gradual process that took several years or even decades to be fully realized. Additionally, some forms of feudalism and indentured servitude still exist in some parts of the world today.
