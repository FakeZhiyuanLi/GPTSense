For college teams, the most important consideration is the regular season games and the postseason tournament. These games determine their ranking and eligibility for the National Championship. The performance in these games can also affect their seeding and home-court advantage in the postseason tournament. Additionally, regular season games provide more opportunities for players to develop their skills and chemistry as a team. Exhibition games, while useful for practice and player evaluation, are not as crucial as the regular season games and postseason tournament.
