Emotional episodes are defined in contrast to stable emotional states. Emotional episodes are intense and temporary experiences of a particular emotion, such as anger, fear, happiness, or sadness. These episodes can be triggered by various situations and typically involve a strong physiological response, like an increased heart rate, sweating, or changes in breathing.On the other hand, stable emotional states are more long-lasting and consistent. They reflect an individual's overall emotional tendency, such as being generally happy or pessimistic. These states are often influenced by a person's temperament, personality, and life experiences.In summary, emotional episodes refer to intense and temporary emotional experiences, while stable emotional states reflect a person's overall mood and disposition.
