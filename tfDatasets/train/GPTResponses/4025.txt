we hear, through a process called pitch perception. Pitch perception is the ability of the brain to interpret the frequency of sound waves and convert it into a perceived pitch. This means that if two sounds have different frequencies, our brain can perceive them as having different pitches. However, if the sounds are very close in frequency, it may be difficult for our brain to distinguish between them and they may be perceived as having a similar pitch. Pitch perception is an important aspect of music, as it allows us to differentiate between different notes and melodies.
