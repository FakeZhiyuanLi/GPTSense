In federalism, the division of powers is not necessarily equal, as the distribution of powers between the national government and the state governments can vary depending on the specific type of federal system in place. Some federal systems, such as the United States, have a more decentralized approach, where the states have significant powers and independence, while other federal systems, such as Germany, have a more centralized approach with greater power given to the national government. The division of powers can also be adjusted over time through constitutional amendments or judicial interpretation.
