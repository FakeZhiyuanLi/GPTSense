The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) is responsible for deciding which drugs the NHS will allow. NICE evaluates the clinical and cost-effectiveness of drugs and provides recommendations on whether they should be made available on the NHS. The decisions made by NICE are based on all available evidence and input from stakeholders, including patients and healthcare professionals. However, the final decision on whether to provide a drug on the NHS may also be influenced by the availability of funds and the priorities of the government.
