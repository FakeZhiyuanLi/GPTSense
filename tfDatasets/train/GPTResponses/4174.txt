The belief in the absolute unity and oneness of God, known as the concept of "yichud Hashem," is a core belief recognized as important by Orthodox Jews. This belief emphasizes that there is only one divine being in the universe, and it is incumbent upon individuals to love, fear, and serve God above all else. Additionally, Orthodox Jews believe in the divine origin and authority of the Torah and the importance of fulfilling its commandments as a way to connect with God and lead a righteous life.
