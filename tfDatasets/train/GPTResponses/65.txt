The property of the harmonic series that shows that there is an infinite number of primes is called the "divergence" of the series. This means that the sum of the series goes to infinity as you add more terms.One way to see this is to consider the partial sums of the series. If you add up the first n terms of the series (1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n), you get a number that gets arbitrarily large as n gets larger.Now, suppose that there were only a finite number of primes. Let p1, p2, ..., pn be all of the primes. Then we can consider the partial sum of the harmonic series up to the nth prime:1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/pnThis sum is finite because it only includes a finite number of terms. However, we just showed that the sum of the entire series goes to infinity. This is a contradiction, so our assumption that there are only a finite number of primes must be false. Therefore, there must be an infinite number of primes.
