Harper Lee based the characters in To Kill a Mockingbird on various people she knew in her life, including her father who inspired the character of Atticus Finch. Other characters such as Scout were based on Lee herself, while Jem and Dill were inspired by Lee's childhood friends. The character of Tom Robinson was likely based on several African-American men Lee observed in the small town of Monroeville, Alabama where she grew up.
