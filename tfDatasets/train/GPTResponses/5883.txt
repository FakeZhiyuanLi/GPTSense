AA mountings (Anti-Aircraft mountings) used guns or cannons that were capable of firing high-velocity, large-caliber shells to intercept and destroy enemy aircraft. These could be mounted on both land and water-based platforms, including ships, aircraft carriers, and shore installations. Some of the most common guns used in AA mountings during World War II included the Bofors 40mm and the Oerlikon 20mm.
