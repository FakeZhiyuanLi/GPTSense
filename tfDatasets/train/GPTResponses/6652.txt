The opening of the Triodion derives from the ancient Byzantine practice of fasting and repentance during the weeks leading up to Lent. The name "Triodion" refers to the three liturgical books that were used during this period, each containing hymns and readings focused on confession and penitence. The Triodion was originally created in the ninth century as a way to help the faithful prepare for Lent and the celebration of Easter. Today, it is still an important part of the liturgical calendar in Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches.
