The cost of animal feed is directly related to the poultry cost for consumers. Poultry farmers need to purchase quality animal feed to ensure the health and growth of their birds. If the cost of animal feed increases, the cost of raising poultry also increases. This translates to higher prices for consumers when they purchase poultry meat and eggs because farmers need to cover their expenses and make a profit. Therefore, the cost of animal feed has a significant impact on the production costs and market price of poultry products.
