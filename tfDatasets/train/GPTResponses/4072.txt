One notable political science subfield where emotions are analyzed is political psychology. Political psychology is an interdisciplinary field that uses theories and methods from psychology and political science to understand the psychological processes that underlie political behavior, including the role of emotions in shaping political attitudes, beliefs, and actions. It examines how emotions, such as fear, anger, or anxiety, can influence political decision-making, voting behavior, and policymaking, as well as how political events and institutions affect individuals' emotional responses. Some of the topics studied in political psychology include political polarization, social identity, and prejudice, as well as the psychological effects of media and propaganda.
