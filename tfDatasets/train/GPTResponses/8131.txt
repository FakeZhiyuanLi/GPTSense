Plants absorb essential elements from the soil through their roots. The root cells take up ionic forms of essential elements such as nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and sulfur, among others. These minerals dissolve in the water and form a solution that is absorbed by the cell walls of the root hair. The process of absorbing water and minerals from the soil is called osmosis. The roots actively transport the essential elements from the soil solution into the xylem, which is the vascular tissue that conducts water and minerals throughout the plant body. The essential elements are then transported to the different parts of the plant where they are needed for growth and development.
