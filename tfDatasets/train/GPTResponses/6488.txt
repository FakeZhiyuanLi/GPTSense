In the United Kingdom, members of the nobility and gentry use the prefix "Lady" before their first names or the names of their husbands. For example, Lady Diana Spencer (Princess Diana) or Lady Margaret Thatcher. It is important to note that this title is inherited or bestowed, and cannot be used by just anyone.
