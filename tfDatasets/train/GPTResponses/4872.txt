Infrared cleaning also involves the use of software algorithms that analyze image data and selectively remove the unwanted elements such as scratches and dust. This process involves identifying and isolating the unwanted elements and replacing them with clean and smooth areas from surrounding regions that match in color and texture. The result is a cleaner and clearer image with improved visual quality.
