The energy crisis of the 1970s led more regions of North America to use DST as a way to conserve energy. Many people believed that by changing the clocks, they could take advantage of the longer daylight hours and reduce the amount of energy used for lighting and heating. This led to more areas adopting DST on a permanent basis, and it has become a widely accepted practice across the continent.
