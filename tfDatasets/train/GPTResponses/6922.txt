Many wrestlers experience injuries from the physical and demanding nature of the sport. This can include joint and muscle strains, concussions, and other injuries. Some wrestlers also struggle with substance abuse and mental health issues, which can lead to addiction and depression. Retirement can also be challenging for wrestlers, as they may struggle to adjust to life outside of the sport and cope with the physical toll the sport has taken on their bodies.
