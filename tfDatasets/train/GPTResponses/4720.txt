The Russian Su-33 is able to launch from the carrier Admiral Kuznetsov by using a system called the ski-jump. The ski-jump is a ramp-like structure built onto the front of the carrier that helps aircraft achieve lift and take-off speed.In the case of the Su-33, pilots increase their throttle as much as possible while being restrained in place by cables attached to the carrier's deck. When the cables are released, the aircraft is thrust forward from the ski-jump and into the air.The ski-jump method is used instead of a catapult system, which is typically used by other modern aircraft carriers to help launch their planes. This is because the Admiral Kuznetsov was designed without a catapult system due to cost and design considerations, and instead relies on the ski-jump method for take-offs.
