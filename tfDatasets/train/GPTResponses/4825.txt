Common silicon detectors typically cease to be sensitive below wavelengths of around 300-400 nanometers (nm), which is equivalent to 0.3-0.4 micrometers (Î¼m) in terms of size. This is because at shorter wavelengths, the energy of the photons becomes too low to create electron-hole pairs in the silicon material, which are necessary for the detection process. However, there are specialized silicon detectors, such as those made from silicon carbide or heavily doped silicon, that can operate at shorter wavelengths down to around 200 nm.
