There is no direct equivalent group to the Agermanats in Castile during the medieval period. However, there were several rebellious groups such as the Comuneros and the Hermandad who fought for their rights and against the oppression of the nobility. The Comuneros were a group of nobles, merchants, and peasants who rebelled against the Spanish monarchy in 1520, demanding greater political representation and rights. The Hermandad, on the other hand, was a group of local militias formed by towns and businessmen to protect themselves and their property from bandits and other criminal activities. Although these groups had different motivations, they both fought against a common enemy: the oppressive power of the ruling elite.
