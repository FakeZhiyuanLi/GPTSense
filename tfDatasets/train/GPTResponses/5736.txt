The goal of a suppression of enemy air defense (SEAD) mission is to neutralize or destroy hostile air defense systems to enable friendly aircraft to attack their targets with minimal risk of being shot down. This can be achieved by using electronic warfare, jamming, or strike packages to target and destroy the enemy's radar and air defense installations. The objective of SEAD is to gain control of the airspace and establish air superiority.
