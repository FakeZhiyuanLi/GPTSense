According to theory, climate change in the late Triassic caused several ecological and evolutionary changes. The climate change led to increased aridity which caused the reduction of forests and a shift towards more open vegetation types. This, in turn, caused changes in the composition of ecosystems, with reptiles such as crocodiles and turtles becoming more dominant over amphibians. Additionally, the warming of the oceans disrupted marine ecosystems, leading to the extinction of several marine species. Finally, the climate change also created new opportunities for certain species to evolve and diversify, leading to the emergence of new groups such as the dinosaurs, mammals, and flowering plants.
