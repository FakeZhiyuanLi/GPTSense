The largest atmospheric nuclear test conducted by the United States was called "Castle Bravo". It was detonated on March 1, 1954, at Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands, and had an estimated yield of 15 megatons of TNT. The test resulted in unexpected and significant radioactive fallout, which contaminated nearby islands and caused radiation sickness in some of the local population.
