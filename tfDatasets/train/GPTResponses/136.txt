A high tide risk near lands indicates that the water level in the ocean or sea has risen significantly, and it may flood the lands near the coast. This can lead to severe consequences such as erosion of coastal areas, damage to infrastructure, homes and buildings, loss of property, and in worst cases, loss of lives. The risk of high tide is influenced by the gravitational pull of the moon and sun, as well as weather patterns such as storms and hurricanes. Understanding and managing high tide risks is critical for coastal communities to minimize the impact of flooding and protect their assets and people.
