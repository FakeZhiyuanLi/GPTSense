One of the most controversial parts of the Patriot Act was Section 215, which allowed the government to obtain "any tangible thing" for an investigation without a warrant. This included personal and business records, such as library records, medical records, and financial records. Many people argued that this violated their Fourth Amendment rights and provided the government with unchecked power to snoop on American citizens.
