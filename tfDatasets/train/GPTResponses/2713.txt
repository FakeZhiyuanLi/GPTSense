Periods have been reckoned using a standard 28-day cycle since 1900, based on the assumption that most women have a regular menstrual cycle that falls within this range. However, it is important to note that this is not always the case, and many women experience variations in length and intensity of their menstrual periods. As such, there are now many different methods for tracking and predicting menstrual cycles, including apps, wearable devices, and fertility tracking tools. Ultimately, the method that works best for each woman will depend on her individual needs, preferences, and health history.
