A movie is typically released in theaters for around 2 to 3 months. However, this can vary based on the popularity of the movie, the number of theaters showing it, and the demand from audiences. Some blockbuster movies may be shown in theaters for longer periods of time, while indie films or movies with smaller budgets may have shorter runs in theaters.
