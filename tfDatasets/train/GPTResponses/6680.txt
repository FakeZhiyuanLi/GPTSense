Congress often grants regulatory or rulemaking authority to federal agencies through laws or statutes. These laws empower federal agencies to create and enforce rules and regulations related to specific areas of policy. Some examples include the Clean Air Act, which grants the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) authority to regulate air pollution, and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which grants the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authority to regulate food, drugs, and cosmetics.
