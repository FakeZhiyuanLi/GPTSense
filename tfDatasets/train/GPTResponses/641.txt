Pure Land Buddhism is perhaps the most faith-oriented form of Buddhism. It centers around the belief that enlightenment can be achieved by rebirth in the Pure Land, a blissful realm presided over by the Buddha Amitabha. It emphasizes the importance of devotion and faith in Amitabha, and the recitation of his name, as the key to achieving rebirth in the Pure Land.
