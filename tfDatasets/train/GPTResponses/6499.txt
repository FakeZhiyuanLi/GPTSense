There are several groups of people who typically would not use the titles of Sir or Dame, including:1. Non-British citizens - the titles Sir and Dame are traditionally used in the UK and other Commonwealth realms, so individuals who are not citizens of these countries may not use them.2. Individuals who have not been knighted - The titles of Sir and Dame are often associated with knighthood, which is granted by the Queen to individuals who have made significant contributions to their field or to society. Those who have not been knighted cannot use these titles.3. Women who have not been specifically granted the title of Dame - While there are female equivalent titles to Sir (such as Dame), women who have not been specifically granted them may choose not to use them.4. Individuals who prefer not to use titles - Some people prefer to be addressed by their first name or a different title, rather than using the traditional Sir or Dame titles.
