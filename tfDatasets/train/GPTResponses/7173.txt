The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) of 1998 considers digital transmission of audio to be licensed if certain conditions are met. Specifically, the DMCA requires that online service providers (such as streaming services) obtain licenses from copyright owners if they want to transmit their copyrighted works digitally. Without licenses, these transmissions would be considered illegal and subject to legal action. The DMCA also provides a safe harbor provision that shields service providers from liability if they take certain steps to comply with copyright law, such as promptly removing infringing content when notified by the copyright owner.
