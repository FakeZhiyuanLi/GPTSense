Various philosophers and psychologists have argued that emotions are discrete. One influential theory in this regard is the basic emotions theory proposed by Paul Ekman and colleagues, which posits that there are six primary emotions that are universal and distinguishable based on their facial expressions: anger, fear, disgust, happiness, sadness, and surprise. Other researchers have proposed similar discrete emotion models with different categories and criteria, such as Robert Plutchik's wheel of emotions and Carroll Izard's differential emotions theory. However, some critics of the discrete emotion approach argue that it oversimplifies the complexity and variability of human emotions, and that emotions are better understood as dynamic and context-dependent processes.
