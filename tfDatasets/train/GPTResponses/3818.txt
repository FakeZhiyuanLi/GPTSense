The two-factor theory of emotion sees an emotional episode as consisting of two components: physiological arousal and cognitive interpretation. According to this theory, an event triggers physiological arousal, which is then interpreted cognitively to produce an emotional experience. The interpretation of the arousal determines which specific emotion is experienced, such as fear, anger, or joy.
