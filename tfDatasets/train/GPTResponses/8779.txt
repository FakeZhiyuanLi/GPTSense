Charles Darwin's most famous work, "On the Origin of Species," was first published in 1859. In this book, he proposed his theory of evolution, which included the idea that humans and apes shared a common ancestor. However, Darwin did not specifically address the question of the evolution of humans and apes until 1871 when he published "The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex." In this book, Darwin provided a detailed explanation of the theory of human evolution and the common ancestry of humans and apes.
