Many modern historians have argued that scholars in the Middle Ages were rarely coerced by the church, including Edward Grant, David Lindberg, and James K. Farge. They point to the fact that many scholars were monks, who were not under the direct control of the bishops or the pope, and that the church actually encouraged the pursuit of knowledge and learning. However, there were occasional cases of coercion, such as the trial and execution of Giordano Bruno in 1600 for his unorthodox beliefs.
