President Clinton defended affirmative action and argued that it was not the cause of middle-class white Americans' economic woes. He stated that affirmative action was intended to address historical and systemic discrimination against minorities and women and encouraged the country to address the larger issue of economic inequality. He also supported policies that would improve education and training opportunities for all Americans to help them succeed in the modern economy.
