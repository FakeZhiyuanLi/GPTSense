is now known as the humoral response, which involves the production and circulation of antibodies in the blood and other body fluids. It was believed that the immune system consisted mainly of antibodies that were produced by specialized cells called B cells in response to foreign substances such as bacteria, viruses, and toxins. This theory was first proposed by the German immunologist Paul Ehrlich in the late 19th century and provided a framework for understanding the role of the immune system in protecting the body against infectious diseases.
