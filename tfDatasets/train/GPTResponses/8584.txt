One of the objections that Darwin addressed in his new chapter in On the Origin of Species was the argument that there were no intermediate or transitional forms in the fossil record. Darwin argued that the fossil record was incomplete and that it was not reasonable to expect that every intermediate form would be preserved. He also proposed that many transitional forms may have lived in environments that were not conducive to fossilization or may have been rapidly outcompeted and replaced by other species. Additionally, Darwin argued that living organisms could also provide evidence of transitional forms, as many species exhibit traits that are intermediate between those of their ancestors and descendants.
