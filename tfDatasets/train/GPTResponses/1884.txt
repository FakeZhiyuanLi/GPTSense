The United Nations has been compared to a global government in its function and effectiveness. It serves as a platform for members to address global issues and reach global agreements, similar to how a government would work to address issues within its own country. However, the effectiveness of the United Nations in enforcing its resolutions and policies has often been criticized as there is no centralized global authority to enforce its decisions.
