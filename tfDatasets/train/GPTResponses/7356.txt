One likely problem of coreless DC motors is that they are less efficient than core-based DC motors. This is because coreless motors have lower torque and higher speed, which means they need to work harder to achieve the same level of power output. Additionally, coreless motors may have a shorter lifespan due to the lack of an iron core, which can contribute to wear and tear on the motor's components over time. Finally, coreless motors may be more expensive than traditional core-based motors due to the specialized manufacturing processes required to produce them.
