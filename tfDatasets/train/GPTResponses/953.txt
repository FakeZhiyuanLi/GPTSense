The data from input devices is sent to the central processing unit (CPU) of the computer to be processed further. The CPU then sends the processed data to the computer's memory or storage system, where it can be accessed and used by the various software programs and applications installed on the computer. Depending on the type of input device and the configuration of the computer system, the data may also be sent to other devices or peripherals, such as printers or external hard drives.
