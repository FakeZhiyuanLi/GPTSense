Small mutations can be caused by various factors such as spontaneous errors in DNA replication, exposure to mutagens such as chemicals, radiation, and viruses, as well as errors in DNA repair mechanisms. These mutations can occur at a single nucleotide level, known as point mutations, or involve the insertion or deletion of a small number of nucleotides, known as frameshift mutations.
