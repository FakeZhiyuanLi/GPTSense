Greenware ceramics were made from clay that had been shaped into the desired form, but had not yet been fired in a kiln to harden and permanently set. The term "greenware" refers to the state of the clay before firing, when it is still soft and pliable. Greenware ceramics could be carved, decorated, and glazed before firing, allowing for intricate designs and intricate patterns to be created. Once fired, greenware ceramics become hardened and durable, able to withstand use as functional objects or serving as decorative pieces for years to come.
