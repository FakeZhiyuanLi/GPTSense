The theory of Weiss and Cropanzano, also known as the Affective Events Theory (AET), pays particular attention to the emotional and affective experiences of employees in the workplace. It emphasizes the impact of emotional events on employees, including their cognitive and behavioral responses, and how these can affect their overall job satisfaction, motivation, and performance. The theory also recognizes the role of contextual factors, such as organizational culture, in shaping emotional experiences in the workplace.
