The body can get rid of excess copper through several ways:1. Excretion through the liver: The liver plays a crucial role in regulating copper levels in the body. It can produce bile, which contains excess copper, and excrete it from the body via feces.2. Excretion through sweat: Copper can also be excreted through sweat. This is why athletes who sweat a lot are less likely to experience copper toxicity.3. Chelation therapy: In cases of severe copper toxicity, chelation therapy may be necessary. This involves using medications that bind to copper and help remove it from the body.4. Nutrient balancing: Maintaining a balanced diet, rich in zinc, manganese, and molybdenum, which are known to help regulate copper levels in the body, can also aid in the removal of excess copper.5. Avoiding copper-rich environments: People who work in copper mines, factories or other copper-rich environments should take steps to limit their exposure to the metal or wear protective gear to limit their exposure.
