The highest error rate that can occur for some RNA viruses is estimated to be up to one error per every 10,000 nucleotides replicated. This is due to the lack of proofreading mechanisms in RNA replication, which can lead to frequent mutations and genetic diversity in viral populations. Examples of RNA viruses with high error rates include HIV, hepatitis C virus, and influenza virus.
