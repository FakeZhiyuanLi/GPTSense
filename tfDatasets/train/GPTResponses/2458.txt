Europe receives drinking water, irrigation, and hydroelectric power primarily from its rivers, lakes, and reservoirs. The major river systems in Europe include the Rhine, the Danube, the Seine, the Thames, and the Po, among others. These rivers feed into numerous lakes and reservoirs, which are used for water storage and hydroelectric power generation. In addition, some countries in Europe rely on groundwater sources for drinking water and irrigation.
