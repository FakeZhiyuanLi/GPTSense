In 2009, the United States Congress attempted to amend the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) to support new ways to prevent copyright infringement. The proposed amendment was called the "PROTECT IP Act" (Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property Act), which aimed to empower law enforcement to seek court orders against websites that traffic intellectual property. However, the act faced significant opposition from internet freedom advocates who argued that it would stifle free speech and innovation, and the bill was ultimately defeated.
