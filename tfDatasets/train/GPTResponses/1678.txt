Most modern computer systems, including desktops, laptops, servers, and smartphones, use an internal clock based on UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). This is because UTC is the global standard for timekeeping and is used as a reference for time synchronization across different locations and time zones. Operating systems such as Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android all have built-in features to automatically synchronize their internal clocks with UTC time servers.
