Chloroplasts and pyrenoids are organelles that are unique to algae. Chloroplasts contain chlorophyll and other pigments that enable photosynthesis, while pyrenoids are involved in the storage and synthesis of starch. Algae may also have other organelles that are found in other eukaryotic cells, such as mitochondria and nuclei.
