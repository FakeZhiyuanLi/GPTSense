It is difficult to say who precisely undermined Douglas Cooper's terms describing Cubism as there have been many art historians and critics who have challenged his ideas over the years. However, some prominent figures who have critiqued Cooper's understanding of Cubism include John Golding, Rosalind Krauss, and Leo Steinberg. These scholars have offered alternative interpretations of Cubism that emphasize the movement's conceptual and formal complexity rather than its supposed adherence to Cooper's strict notions of "Analytical" and "Synthetic" phases.
