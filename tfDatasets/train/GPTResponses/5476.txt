Victorian Aboriginal groups were largely displaced from their land during the mid-19th century, specifically from the years 1835 to 1864. This period is commonly referred to as the Victorian "frontier wars" and was marked by violent conflict between European settlers and Indigenous peoples, resulting in displacement, forced removal, and the loss of traditional lands, culture and heritage.
