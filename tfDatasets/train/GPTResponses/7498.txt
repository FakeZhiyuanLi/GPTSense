EMP stands for Electromagnetic Pulse, which is a burst of electromagnetic radiation. EMP is not proportional to anything in particular but is generated by various sources such as nuclear detonations, solar flares, and electromagnetic weapons. The strength and impact of EMP depend on the intensity and duration of the radiation, as well as the distance from the source.
