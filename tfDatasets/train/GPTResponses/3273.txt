The conquest of Western Ukraine by the Soviet Union altered the language of Ukraine. The Soviet government imposed the use of the Russian language in public life and education, leading to a decline in the use of Ukrainian in official settings. However, Ukrainian continued to be spoken by the majority of the population and was preserved through literature, folklore, and conversation in homes and communities.
