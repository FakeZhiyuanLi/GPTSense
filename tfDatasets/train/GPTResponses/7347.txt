Epigenetics studies how environmental and lifestyle factors can affect gene expression without changing the DNA sequence itself. It examines changes in gene activity or expression that occur without any alteration in the DNA sequence. These changes can be inherited by subsequent generations and have been shown to play a role in a range of health conditions such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, and obesity. Epigenetic research is critical for understanding the complex interplay between genetics and the environment in human health and disease.
