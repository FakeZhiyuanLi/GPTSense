The modern synthesis of evolutionary theory, also known as the neo-Darwinian theory, is the most unifying branching common descent theory of the life sciences. It combines the principles of Darwinian evolution with the genetic discoveries of the 20th century, such as the role of DNA and natural selection. The modern synthesis provides a comprehensive and integrated explanation for the diversity of life on earth and is widely accepted in the scientific community.
