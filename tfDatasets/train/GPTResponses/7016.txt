Halogen bulbs can actually reduce filament evaporation compared to traditional incandescent bulbs. This is because the halogen gas inside the bulb reacts with the evaporated tungsten filament, causing the tungsten particles to redeposit back onto the filament instead of accumulating on the bulb's glass surface. This process is known as the halogen cycle and results in a longer bulb life and brighter light output.
