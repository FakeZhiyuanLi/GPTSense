Wu Chinese is a group of Chinese dialects spoken in the southeastern coastal region of China, particularly in and around Shanghai. The language was greatly influenced by the Old Wu language and the Southern Tang dynasty language spoken in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, as well as neighboring regions including Fujian and Anhui. The language also borrowed from neighboring languages such as Mandarin and Min Chinese.
