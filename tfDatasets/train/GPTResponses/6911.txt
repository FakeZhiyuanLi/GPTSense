The American Rule is a legal principle in the United States that states that each party is responsible for paying their own attorney's fees, regardless of who wins or loses the case. This is in contrast to the English Rule, where the losing party has to pay the attorney's fees of the winning party. The American Rule is used in most civil cases in the United States.
