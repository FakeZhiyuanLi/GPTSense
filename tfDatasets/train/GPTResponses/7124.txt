In 1918, the French ideologies shifted towards conservatism and traditionalism which had a negative impact on the acceptance of avant-garde movements such as Cubism, which was seen as too radical and inaccessible by many critics and art collectors. This shift led to a decline in the popularity and support for Cubism in France and contributed to the rise of more conservative artistic movements such as Fauvism and the return to classical forms of art.
