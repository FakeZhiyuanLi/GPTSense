Any of the five branches of the United States military (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard) can have a full military structure. This includes all levels of command from the highest (such as the Secretary of Defense) down to individual military units and personnel. Each branch also has its own unique organizational structure specific to its mission and goals.
