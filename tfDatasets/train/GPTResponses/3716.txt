This phenomenon is known as the "French Paradox." It refers to the observation that despite consuming a diet high in saturated fats, the French have lower rates of heart disease compared to other Western countries. Researchers believe that this may be due to the additional consumption of red wine, which contains antioxidants that may help protect against heart disease. Additionally, the French tend to have a more active lifestyle and consume smaller portion sizes than other Western countries.
