Kautilya and Vishnugupta are usually grouped with the ancient Indian philosophers and political thinkers. Kautilya is known for his work on political science called the Arthashastra, while Vishnugupta is believed to be the author of the Chanakya Niti, a book on ethics and governance. Both of them have greatly contributed to Indian political thought and their ideas continue to influence contemporary Indian governance.
