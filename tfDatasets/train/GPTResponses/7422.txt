1. Shadow region: This is the region at the beginning of the curve where exposure to light has little or no effect on the photographic material.2. Toe region: This is the region where there is a small increase in density for incremental increases in exposure.3. Linear region: This is the region where the change in density is proportional to the increase in exposure.4. Shoulder region: This is the region where further increases in exposure result in a relatively smaller increase in density.5. Maximum density region: This is the region where the photographic material is at its maximum density, and further increases in exposure have no effect on the density.
