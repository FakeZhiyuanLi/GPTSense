Ancient Somali houses were traditionally made out of locally available resources such as mud, wood, and thatched roofs made from leaves or grass. The walls were constructed by mixing mud with straw or grass, which was then shaped into adobe bricks and sun-dried. The wood used in their construction was often acacia, and the roofs were either flat or sloping. These houses were well suited to the hot, dry climate of Somalia and provided protection from the intense heat and frequent sandstorms.
