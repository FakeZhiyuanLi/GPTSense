Copper is absorbed by the small intestine through two pathways: active transport and diffusion. In the active transport pathway, copper is absorbed in the duodenum and upper jejunum by a copper transporter protein that is dependent on ATP. This process is regulated by a number of factors including copper status in the body and dietary intake.In the diffusion pathway, copper ions move from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration depending on the concentration gradient in the small intestine. This process is also regulated by copper status in the body and dietary intake.Once absorbed, copper is transported in the bloodstream by proteins such as ceruloplasmin and albumin. Copper is also distributed to various tissues and organs where it is utilized for a variety of biological functions. Excess copper is excreted in the bile and eliminated in feces.
