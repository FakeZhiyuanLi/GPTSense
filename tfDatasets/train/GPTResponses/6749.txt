The New Haven Approach is a therapeutic approach that focuses on the individual's subjective experience and their unique perspective of the world. It was developed by a group of psychologists and psychiatrists at the Yale University School of Medicine in the 1950s and 1960s, including George Engel and Robert Freedman. The approach emphasizes the importance of developing a trusting and collaborative relationship between the therapist and the patient, with an emphasis on empathy, active listening, and a non-judgmental attitude. The central premise of the New Haven Approach is that mental health problems arise from a complex interaction of biological, psychological, and social factors, and that effective treatment requires addressing all of these factors in a holistic manner.
