Several companies and individuals have been sued for patent infringement on MP3 technology, but one notable case was when Alcatel-Lucent (formerly Lucent Technologies) sued Microsoft for patent infringement on the MP3 audio compression standard in 2003. The case was settled out of court in 2007, with Microsoft agreeing to pay $16 million in damages to Alcatel-Lucent.
