The human genome contains all of the genetic material necessary to create a human being. It is composed of approximately 3 billion base pairs of Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine, and Guanine nucleotides [abbreviated as A, T, C, and G]). These nucleotides are arranged in a specific order to code for proteins, which determine the physical characteristics, traits, and functions of a human. The human genome comprises of genes, regulatory elements, transposable elements, repetitive DNA, and noncoding DNA. Only a small portion of the genome, approximately 2 percent, contains genes, while the remaining portion is composed of non-coding regions that play a role in regulating gene expression and other biological processes.
