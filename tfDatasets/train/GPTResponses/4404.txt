The main cause of bitterness in beer is the presence of alpha acids, which are naturally occurring compounds in hops. When hops are added to the beer during the brewing process, their alpha acids are released and create the bitter flavor. The amount of bitterness depends on the type of hop variety used, how much is added, and how long it is boiled during the brewing process.
