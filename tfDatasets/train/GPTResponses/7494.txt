Stepper motors are used in printers and copiers to move the print head, platen and various other components with precision and accuracy. They are commonly used in the paper feed, carriage control, and image transfer mechanisms. The stepper motors have precision control over their movements, allowing them to move a specific amount of distance with each step, ensuring accurate positioning and consistent results.
