Residents were listed in the census of 1890 by name, age, gender, race, marital status, occupation, place of birth, and parents' birthplaces. The census also recorded information on whether a person was a military veteran, and if so, which war they served in. However, much of the 1890 census was destroyed in a fire in 1921, making it difficult to access detailed information from that year.
