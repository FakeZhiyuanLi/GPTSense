One of the only mainstream economists to predict the financial crisis was Nouriel Roubini, an American economist and professor at New York University's Stern School of Business. He is known for his prediction of the 2008 global financial crisis, which he made as early as 2006. Roubini is now considered a prominent figure in the field of economics and is often referred to as "Dr. Doom" for his predictions of economic downturns.
