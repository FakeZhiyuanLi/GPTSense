The process in which cells fill in the interior of the gastrula to form the mesoderm is called gastrulation. During gastrulation, the cells of the gastrula organize themselves into three germ layers: endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. The mesoderm is formed by the movement of cells from the dorsal lip of the blastopore (primitive mouth) towards the center of the embryo. This movement of cells is known as involution. The cells that move through the involution form a layer between the ectoderm and endoderm, which becomes the mesoderm. The mesoderm then differentiates into various tissues, including skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, bone, and connective tissues.
