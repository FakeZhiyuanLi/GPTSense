There is no specific Frenchman who greatly influenced Presbyterianism as an entire movement. However, there have been individual French theologians, pastors, and scholars who have made contributions to the development and shaping of Presbyterian thought and practice. These include John Calvin, who was a French theologian and pastor and is considered the father of Presbyterianism, as well as theologians Pierre Viret and Theodore Beza.
