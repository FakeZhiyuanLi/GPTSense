COPD is differentiated based on its clinical and physiological features. Some of the factors that can help differentiate COPD include:1. Smoking history: Chronic smokers are at a higher risk of developing COPD than non-smokers.2. Symptoms: COPD is characterized by symptoms like shortness of breath, coughing, and wheezing, which become progressively worse over time.3. Spirometry: Spirometry is one of the essential tests used to diagnose and differentiate COPD. It measures lung function, including how much air a person can breathe in and exhale out.4. Imaging studies: Imaging studies like CT scans and X-rays can help identify structural changes in the lung, which are typical of COPD.5. Blood tests: Blood tests can identify certain markers in the blood that are associated with COPD, such as high levels of C-reactive protein.6. History of exacerbations: Patients with COPD may experience exacerbations or flare-ups of their symptoms, usually caused by respiratory infections or environmental triggers.By considering these factors, doctors can diagnose and differentiate COPD from other lung diseases like asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema.
