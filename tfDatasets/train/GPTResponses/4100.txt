President Roosevelt created the policy of Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC) in 1941 due to the boom in defense jobs. FEPC aimed to ensure that African Americans and other minority groups were given equal opportunities for employment and were not discriminated against on the basis of race, religion, or national origin in defense industries. This policy was important as it attempted to reduce discriminatory employment practices and promoted equality of opportunities in the workplace.
