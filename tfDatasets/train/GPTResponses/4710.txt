Physical growth typically slows down by the end of adolescence, around age 18-21 for females and 20-23 for males. However, cognitive development continues throughout adulthood, with logical reasoning, abstract thinking, and metacognition continuing to improve into the 20s and even 30s. So while physical growth generally stops around the early 20s, cognitive development can continue well into adulthood.
