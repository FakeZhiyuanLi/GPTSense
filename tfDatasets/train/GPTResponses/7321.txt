An ideal feature to assist with reducing negative impacts of pesticides would be a pesticide selection tool that recommends the least toxic and most effective pesticides based on factors such as the type of pest, crop, and environmental conditions. This tool could also provide information on alternative pest management strategies such as crop rotation, biological controls, or mechanical methods. Additionally, the tool could include educational resources for farmers and pesticide applicators on safe and effective pesticide use, storage, and disposal practices.
