The digital world in which Digimon creatures live is a parallel universe made entirely of digital information and data. It exists alongside the human world but can only be accessed through electronic devices such as computers, smartphones, or other digital technology. It is a vast and complex realm with multiple layers, and is inhabited by various types of digital creatures, including Digimon. The digital world is governed by its own rules and laws, and is a place of adventure, discovery, and battles between different species of Digimon.
