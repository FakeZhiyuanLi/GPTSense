Adolescence is defined socially as the period of life between childhood and adulthood, marked by significant physical, psychological, and social changes. During this time, individuals typically undergo a transition from dependence on parents and caregivers to increasing independence and personal responsibility. Adolescents may also experience changes in their relationships with peers, romantic interests, and society as a whole, as they navigate social norms and cultural expectations. Socially defined markers of adolescence may include age-based milestones, such as puberty, first jobs, and driver's licenses, as well as participation in activities, such as school and extracurricular activities, that are relevant to their developmental stage.
