In "Du Cubisme," Metzinger and Gleizes related the sense of time to the concept of simultaneity in Cubism. They believed that Cubism represented a new way of thinking about time, where multiple perspectives and moments could coexist in a single artwork. The fragmentation of form and space allowed for a non-linear representation of time, where past, present, and future could be shown simultaneously. This approach to time challenged traditional notions of linear time and continuity in art, and reflected the changing attitudes towards time and space in the early 20th century.
