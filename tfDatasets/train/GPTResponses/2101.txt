The rollout of Freeview HD service in the UK began in 2009 and involved several steps:1. The government allocated the 700 MHz band to digital television broadcasting in 2008, creating more capacity for high-definition (HD) channels.2. Broadcasters such as the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, and Channel 5 started testing HD channels in 2009, using the DVB-T2 transmission standard that allowed more efficient use of the spectrum.3. Freeview launched its first HD channels in December 2009, including BBC One HD, ITV1 HD, and Channel 4 HD.4. Freeview continued to expand its HD offering over the following years, adding channels such as BBC Two HD, Channel 5 HD, and several high-definition versions of popular subscription-based channels like Dave and E4.5. In 2013, Freeview Play was introduced, a hybrid TV platform that combined live broadcast channels with on-demand services like BBC iPlayer and ITV Hub.6. The rollout of Freeview HD service required viewers to have a compatible HD-ready TV or set-top box and to retune their equipment to receive the new channels. The government also launched a switchover programme to help people switch from the analogue to digital TV system, which was completed in 2012.
