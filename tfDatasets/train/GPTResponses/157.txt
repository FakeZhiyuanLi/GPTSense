It varies depending on the electoral system used in each country. In a first-past-the-post system, voters typically choose one member to represent their constituency. In a proportional representation system, voters may choose multiple members to represent their constituency. For example, in Germany, voters choose multiple candidates from a party list to fill seats in their regional constituency. The number of seats each constituency is allocated is determined by the overall vote share for each party. However, this can differ between countries and even within countries, depending on the specific electoral system being used.
