Genetic pollution, also known as genetic contamination, occurs when artificially created or modified genes are introduced into the natural gene pool of a population or species. The main causes of genetic pollution are:1. Transgenic crops: Genetically modified crops can cross-pollinate with wild plants, which can lead to the spread of genetically modified traits. This can affect the biodiversity of natural ecosystems and threaten the survival of native species.2. Release of genetically modified organisms (GMOs): The release of genetically modified animals, insects, or microbes into the environment can lead to the transfer of modified genes to natural populations, leading to changes in the genetics of the local ecosystem.3. Hybridization: Crossbreeding between genetically modified organisms and native species can lead to the formation of hybrid populations that may have altered genetic traits, potentially reducing the genetic diversity of the local population.4. Accidental releases: Accidental releases of genetically modified organisms or their genetic material, such as during transportation, storage or disposal, can lead to the spread of modified genes in the environment.Overall, genetic pollution represents a risk to biodiversity and the natural balance of ecosystems, and is a major concern for scientists and environmentalists alike.
