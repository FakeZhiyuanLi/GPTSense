When St. George Mivart criticized Darwin's theory of evolution, Darwin responded by publishing a lengthy letter in the journal Nature. In this letter, Darwin argued against Mivart's understanding of natural selection and reiterated the importance of sexual selection in evolution. He also emphasized the gradual nature of evolution and the importance of intermediate forms, rather than sudden changes that might support Mivart's argument. Overall, Darwin refuted Mivart's objections to his theory and defended his perspective on the mechanisms of evolution.
