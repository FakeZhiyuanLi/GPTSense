Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) began to become popular as a legitimate sport related to wrestling in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The sport incorporates techniques from various martial arts, including wrestling, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and Muay Thai. Wrestlers often have an advantage in MMA, as their grappling skills and takedowns can be highly effective in controlling opponents and scoring points. Many successful MMA fighters, such as former UFC champions Georges St-Pierre and Daniel Cormier, have a background in wrestling.
