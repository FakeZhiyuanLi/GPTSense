There is no UN resolution that called for Eritrea and Ethiopia to be linked via a loose federal structure under sovereignty of the emperor. In fact, the opposite is true. In 1952, the UN General Assembly passed a resolution that called for Eritrea to become an autonomous unit federated with Ethiopia. However, in 1962, Emperor Haile Selassie annexed Eritrea as an Ethiopian province, which the Eritreans resisted. The Eritrean War of Independence lasted from 1961 to 1991, when Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia.
