The poultry business began to boom in the United States in the post-World War II era, particularly in the 1950s and 1960s. With the introduction of new technologies such as automated feeding and breeding, the industry was able to produce large quantities of affordable poultry that could be easily transported, stored and sold to consumers. The rise of fast food chains also contributed to the increased demand for poultry products. Today, the poultry industry is one of the largest agricultural sectors in the United States, with billions of chickens, turkeys and other birds raised for meat and eggs each year.
