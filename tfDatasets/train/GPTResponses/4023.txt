The H.323 technique is a standard communication protocol used for videoconferencing and other real-time multimedia communications over IP networks. It offers higher quality video and audio because it uses advanced compression techniques that reduce the amount of data needed to transmit and receive video and audio signals. This allows for faster and more reliable transmission of high-quality audio and video, resulting in better communication quality. Additionally, H.323 protocol uses sophisticated error correction algorithms that help to minimize packet loss and ensure that the audio and video quality remains consistent throughout the communication.
