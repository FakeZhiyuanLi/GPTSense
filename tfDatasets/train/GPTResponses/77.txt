it wants with a territory that doesn't belong to it, using that territory for its own benefit without regard for the people who live there. This can involve exploiting the resources of the territory, imposing the colonizer's own culture and way of life on the local population, and placing the colonizer's interests above the interests of the colonized people. Sometimes colonialism involves direct control over the territory, with a colonial government established, and sometimes it involves indirect control, such as through economic or political dominance. Ultimately, colonialism is about one country exerting power over another, often with the goal of profiting from the relationship.
