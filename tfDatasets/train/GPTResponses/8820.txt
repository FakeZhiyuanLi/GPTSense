After the failure of a larger regional transportation system, Detroit built a number of highways, including the Interstate 75 (I-75) and Interstate 94 (I-94), as well as a network of urban freeways, such as the Davison Freeway and the Lodge Freeway. The city also expanded its public transit system by creating the Detroit Department of Transportation (DDOT) in 1974, which operates a bus network throughout the city and surrounding suburbs. In recent years, Detroit has also invested in alternative transportation options, such as bike lanes and a streetcar system called the QLINE.
