Darwin changed his mind about the unbridgeable gap between animals and humans due to several reasons:1. The observation of behavioral similarities: Darwin noticed that animals, especially primates, exhibited behavior that resembled human behavior, such as tool use and language acquisition.2. The discovery of fossil evidence: The discovery of fossils of extinct human-like species, such as Neanderthals, suggested that humans were not entirely distinct from animals and had shared a common ancestor.3. Comparative anatomy and embryology: Darwin's studies of anatomy and embryology indicated that humans shared many physical traits with other animals, and these similarities strongly suggested common ancestry.4. Travel and cross-cultural observations: During his travels, Darwin encountered many different societies and cultures that challenged his belief in human exceptionalism, which helped to change his perspective.Overall, Darwin's observations and discoveries led him to recognize that the differences between humans and other animals were a matter of degree rather than kind.
