The noble's guarantee that his throne would be inherited by his sons was through the system of hereditary monarchy. In this system, the throne passes down from the monarch to their direct heirs, usually their sons, and is maintained within the family lineage. This guarantee is often reinforced by a formal law or succession agreement, which outlines the rules of succession and ensures that the monarch's descendants have a legitimate claim to the throne. Additionally, the noble may have also sought the support of his close allies and envoys, who would pledge their loyalty and support for the dynasty by recognizing and facilitating the inheritance of the throne by the monarch's sons.
