There is no one specific group that has shifted the focus of research in identity. Over time, various academic disciplines and sub-disciplines have contributed to the study of identity, including psychology, sociology, anthropology, philosophy, and more recently, cultural studies, gender studies, and queer studies. Each of these fields brings their own perspectives and methodologies to the study of identity, leading to a rich and multidisciplinary body of research on the topic. Some of the key researchers who have contributed to the field of identity studies include Stuart Hall, Michel Foucault, Judith Butler, Erving Goffman, and Cornel West, among many others.
