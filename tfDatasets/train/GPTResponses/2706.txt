The Chichimeca were a group of indigenous people who inhabited the areas now known as central Mexico, including parts of present-day Guanajuato, Zacatecas, and San Luis Potosi. They are considered to be the ancestors of several indigenous communities in Mexico, including the Otom√≠, Nahuatl, and Pame peoples.
