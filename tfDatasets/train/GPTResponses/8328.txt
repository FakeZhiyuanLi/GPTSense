In the 18th century, the discovery and understanding of fossils, as well as the development of the concept of uniformitarianism by James Hutton, drastically changed geology. Fossils revealed that the Earth had undergone significant changes over time and that extinct species had once existed. Uniformitarianism, the idea that geological processes occurred at a uniform rate over time, led to a greater understanding of geological formations and the history of the Earth. This marked a shift from the previous belief in catastrophism, which held that geologic events were the result of sudden, catastrophic events only.
