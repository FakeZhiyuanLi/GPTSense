This belief was held by the French painter and sculptor, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. He believed that all light, whether natural or artificial, was divine and should be used in art to create a sense of depth and luminosity. Ingres was a prominent figure in the Neoclassical and Romantic art movements of the 19th century and is best known for his portraits and historical paintings.
