The Great Plains became productive for crop growing in the late 1800s, after the government passed the Homestead Act in 1862 that provided land grants to farmers who agreed to settle and cultivate the land. The introduction of new farming technologies, such as the steel plow and windmill, also made it easier for farmers to cultivate the land. In addition, the development of railroads allowed farmers to transport their goods to markets in other parts of the country.
