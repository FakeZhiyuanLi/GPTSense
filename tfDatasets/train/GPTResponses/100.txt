After Saddam Hussein's defeat, American troops remained stationed in Iraq to help stabilize the country, prevent violence and terrorism, and support the new government. They were primarily based in Baghdad and other major cities, but also deployed in various regions of the country. American troops continued to remain in Iraq until 2011 when the U.S. and Iraq reached an agreement to withdraw all American troops from the country.
