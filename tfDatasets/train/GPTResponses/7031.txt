The cubists at the Salon d'Automne created controversy towards the traditional representation of art, which had been based on a realistic and naturalistic depiction of the world. They rejected this approach and instead introduced a new style that fragmented and abstracted the subject matter, often using geometric shapes and multiple viewpoints. This challenged the norms of the art world and sparked a debate about the purpose and meaning of art.
