Durkheim saw collective effervescence in Australian Aboriginal ceremonies such as the corroboree, where members of a tribe would gather together to dance, sing, and perform rituals. He believed that these activities led to a shared emotional experience, which created a sense of social solidarity and reinforced the group's collective identity. Durkheim saw such communal activities as a key feature of religious and cultural life, and believed that they played an important role in maintaining social order and cohesion.
