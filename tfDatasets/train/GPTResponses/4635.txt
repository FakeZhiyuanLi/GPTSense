The 1890 census divided East Asian races (Chinese, Japanese, and others) in order to track immigration patterns and enforce discriminatory policies targeting Asian immigrants. The federal government and many states used the census data to implement exclusionary laws, such as the Chinese Exclusion Act, that restricted Asian immigration and naturalization. The division of East Asian races also reflected the prevailing racist attitudes and stereotypes of the time that viewed different Asian groups as distinct and inferior races.
