is commonly referred to as "unicellular organisms," such as protists or bacteria. The exact process and timeline of animal evolution is still being studied and debated among scientists, but it is generally accepted that the first animal-like organisms emerged around 600 million years ago during the Ediacaran Period. These early creatures were mostly soft-bodied and resembled modern-day jellyfish, seaweed, and other strange forms. From there, the evolution of animals continued to diversify and adapt to various environments, leading to the vast array of species we see today.
