The bit rate of a file refers to the amount of data used to represent each second of audio or video. It is measured in bits per second (bps) and indicates the quality and size of the file. A higher bit rate means that the file will contain more data per second, resulting in better quality but also a larger file size. Conversely, a lower bit rate means less data per second, resulting in lower quality but a smaller file size. It is important to balance the desired quality with the file size when selecting the bit rate for a file.
