There are several possible explanations for the shift towards marijuana and away from cigarettes, including:1. Legalization: The legalization of marijuana in some states has made it easier and more socially acceptable to use, while cigarettes are still heavily regulated and stigmatized.2. Health concerns: There is growing awareness of the health risks associated with smoking cigarettes, including lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory problems. Marijuana use, while not without risks, is seen by some as a safer alternative.3. Social norms: There has been a shift in social norms around drug use, with marijuana becoming more accepted and cigarettes becoming less cool.4. Changes in advertising: Cigarette advertising has been heavily restricted in recent years, while marijuana advertising is still largely unregulated. This may have contributed to a decline in smoking rates among young people.Overall, the shift towards marijuana and away from cigarettes is likely the result of a complex interplay of factors, including changing attitudes, legal and policy changes, and increased awareness of health risks.
