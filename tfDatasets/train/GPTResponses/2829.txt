You are more likely to find knots in the heartwood of a very old tree. This is because knots form when a branch or limb of the tree dies and is absorbed into the trunk. Over time, as the tree grows and ages, the heartwood becomes denser and darker, and knots can be preserved and visible for many years. Sapwood, on the other hand, is the younger, outer layer of wood that is still actively transporting nutrients and water throughout the tree. It typically does not contain knots.
