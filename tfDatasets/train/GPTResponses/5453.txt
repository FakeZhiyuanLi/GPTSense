Tachymetric devices are instruments that measure speed or velocity. They can be found on various types of machinery and vehicles such as cars, boats, trains, and airplanes. Tachometers, which measure the rotation speed of an engine, are common examples of tachymetric devices. They are used to monitor the speed of the machine or vehicle and ensure that it is operating within safe and efficient parameters. In some cases, tachymetric devices may also be used to measure other parameters such as acceleration or deceleration.
