The 2000 election was a contested and controversial election between Republican candidate George W. Bush and Democrat candidate Al Gore. The election came down to the state of Florida and its electoral votes. After the polls closed, the initial results showed that Bush had won the state by a slim margin of 537 votes. However, the election results were disputed due to issues with the counting of votes, particularly the infamous "hanging chads" on punch-card ballots. The dispute ultimately ended up in the Supreme Court, which decided in favor of Bush, overturning a decision by the Florida Supreme Court to recount the votes. Bush officially won the presidency by a narrow electoral margin of 271 to 266. The controversy surrounding the election led to calls for election reform and changes in voting technology in the United States.
