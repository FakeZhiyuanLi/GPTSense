Military ships, especially warships, are typically well-defended with advanced weaponry, armor, and other defensive systems. Modern warships typically have anti-aircraft and anti-ship defense capabilities, including missile defense systems, high-caliber guns, and anti-torpedo countermeasures. Additionally, they may have advanced communication and intelligence capabilities to detect and respond to potential threats.
