The proximity to large bodies of water, particularly Puget Sound, produces a great variance in local climates in the Seattle area. Areas closer to the water tend to be cooler and experience more moisture, while areas further inland tend to be warmer and drier. This is because water has a moderating effect on temperature, keeping coastal areas cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter. Additionally, the topography of the region, with the coastal mountains and the Olympic Peninsula, also plays a role in shaping local climate patterns.
