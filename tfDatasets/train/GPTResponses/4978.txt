The Gurkhas are a group of people from Nepal who have a long and storied history of military service. They came into power during the time of the British Raj when the British East India Company recruited them to serve as soldiers in their army. The Gurkhas served with distinction in various battles and campaigns, earning a reputation as ferocious fighters with a fierce loyalty to their commanders. Following India's independence from British colonial rule, the Gurkhas were integrated into the British Army and continue to serve to this day.
