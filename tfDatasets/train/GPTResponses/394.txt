The capacity of a solar hot water system can vary widely depending on the size of the system, the number of solar collectors used, and the storage capacity of the hot water tank. However, a typical residential solar hot water system can provide between 40 and 80 gallons of hot water per day. Larger systems used by commercial or industrial facilities can provide much more hot water, up to several thousand gallons per day.
