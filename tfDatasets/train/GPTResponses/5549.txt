The ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus believed that the gods were distant and uninterested in human affairs. He argued that the gods lived in a state of perfect bliss and had no interest in intervening in the affairs of mortals. Epicurus believed that the universe was governed by natural laws, and that people should strive for happiness and pleasure in this life rather than seeking the favor of the gods.
