The government of India is based on a federal parliamentary democratic system. It consists of three branches: the executive, the legislative, and the judiciary. The president is the ceremonial head of state, while the prime minister is the head of government. The legislative branch is made up of the Rajya Sabha (Council of States) and the Lok Sabha (House of the People), which together make up the Parliament of India. The judiciary consists of the Supreme Court, high courts, and subordinate courts. India follows a constitution that was adopted on January 26, 1950, which outlines the structure and functioning of the government.
