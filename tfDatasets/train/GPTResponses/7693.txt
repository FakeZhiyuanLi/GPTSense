It depends on the country and region. In some countries, tourism may bring the most income from areas such as accommodations, restaurants, and transportation, while in others it may be from activities such as sightseeing, adventure tourism, or cultural experiences. Generally, countries with a strong tourism industry tend to benefit most from a combination of these sources. For example, in countries like France, Italy, and Spain, tourism is a major contributor to GDP, and income from various sources such as accommodations, restaurants, and attractions all contribute significantly to the industry's success.
