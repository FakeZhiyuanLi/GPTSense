The files about COINTELPRO revealed that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) engaged in a series of illegal and unethical activities in the 1950s and 1960s, including the surveillance and disruption of political groups and individuals. The FBI targeted groups involved in civil rights, anti-war, and other movements, with the goal of preventing these groups from achieving their goals. The bureau also engaged in activities such as the use of wiretaps, break-ins, and blackmail to disrupt or neutralize these groups. The files were eventually exposed to the public and resulted in significant criticism of the FBI's activities and increased scrutiny of government surveillance practices.
