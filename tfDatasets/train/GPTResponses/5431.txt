There is no one specific person who can be credited with saying that Elizabeth II was a behind-the-scenes force in ending apartheid. This idea is based on the fact that the Queen had longstanding relationships with key leaders in the anti-apartheid movement and visited South Africa in 1995, a year after the end of apartheid. Some historians and scholars have suggested that the Queen played a subtle yet important role in supporting the movement to end apartheid through her diplomatic efforts and personal relationships.
