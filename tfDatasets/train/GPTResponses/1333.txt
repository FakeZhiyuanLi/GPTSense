The Germanic tribes were fleeing from the expansion of the Huns in the 4th and 5th centuries AD. This migration is often referred to as the "Migration Period" and led to the displacement of various tribes, including the Goths, Vandals, Franks, and Saxons, among others. They moved westward and southward into the Roman Empire, causing great disruption and eventually leading to the fall of the Western Roman Empire.
