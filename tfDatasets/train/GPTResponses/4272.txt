Carnivore was a controversial surveillance tool designed to monitor internet traffic and intercept and analyze electronic communications for criminal and terrorist activities. It was developed and used by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) during the late 1990s and early 2000s, but was eventually replaced by other surveillance tools. The exact details of what Carnivore monitored and how it worked were not publicly disclosed, but it was criticized for potentially violating individuals' privacy rights.
