Another example of affirmative action for collegiate admissions could be giving preference to applicants who come from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds or who are first-generation college students. Admissions offices may consider an applicant's family income, education level of their parents or guardians, and the students' educational opportunities and resources available to them growing up. This is done in an effort to provide access and opportunities to students who may not have otherwise had them due to systemic socioeconomic inequalities.
