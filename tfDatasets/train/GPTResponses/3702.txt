There is still ongoing research and debate regarding the exact cause of the upper Cretaceous extinction event, but some possible factors include:1. Asteroid impact: A massive asteroid impact, known as the Chicxulub impact, occurred around 66 million years ago in present-day Mexico. The impact caused massive tsunamis, earthquakes, and firestorms, which led to widespread destruction and environmental changes, including a long-term decrease in global temperatures and sunlight. This event is considered the most likely primary cause of the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and many other species.2. Volcanic activity: The Deccan Traps volcanic eruptions in modern-day India may have also played a role in the extinction event. The massive eruptions released massive amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, causing global warming and acid rain, which may have caused stress to many species, making them more vulnerable to other factors.3. Climate change: Global warming caused by either the asteroid impact or volcanic eruptions may have also contributed to the extinction event. The sudden temperature changes and changes to sea level and precipitation patterns would have impacted many speciesâ€™ ability to survive.4. Sea level changes: The extinction event may have been caused by a combination of changes in sea level and oceanic conditions, such as ocean acidification, caused by the asteroid impact or volcanic eruptions. The changes would have impacted marine species, which were particularly vulnerable during this period.5. Other factors: Other factors, such as disease, competition, and predation, may have also played a role in the extinction event, but their relative importance is still under study.
