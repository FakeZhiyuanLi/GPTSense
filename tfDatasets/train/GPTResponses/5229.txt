One practice that differentiates the Anglican communion from Protestant churches at large is the use of a liturgy and sacraments. Anglicans generally follow a structured liturgy, such as the Book of Common Prayer, and participate in sacraments such as baptism, confirmation, Eucharist, confession, and anointing of the sick. Protestant churches tend to have more flexibility in their worship practices and place less emphasis on sacraments as a means of grace.
