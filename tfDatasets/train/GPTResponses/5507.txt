The Bay of Montevideo forms a natural harbor located in the southern part of Uruguay's capital city, Montevideo. The bay extends about 20 kilometers inland and is created by three natural features: the Santa Luc√≠a River to the west, the Montevideo Bay to the east, and the River Plate (Rio de la Plata) to the south. The bay plays a vital role in the city's economy by serving as a commercial port and a popular tourist destination.
