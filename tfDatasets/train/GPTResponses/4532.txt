Brewing companies sometimes use adjuncts such as corn, rice or sugar to give more alcohol content to their beer. They can also add more malt to the mash, which can increase the alcohol content. Additionally, some brewing companies use a process called "brewer's yeast pitching rate" which involves adding more yeast to the fermenting beer, which can help increase the alcohol content. Finally, sometimes the beer is simply brewed for a longer period of time, which allows more fermentation to occur, resulting in a higher alcohol content.
