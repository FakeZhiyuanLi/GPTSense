No, the bishops did not consider themselves Arians. Arianism was a heretical belief that denied the divinity of Jesus Christ and was officially condemned by the First Council of Nicaea in 325 AD. Most bishops at the council affirmed the orthodox belief in the Trinity - that God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are all equally and eternally God. However, there were some bishops who held Arian beliefs and were ultimately excommunicated from the church.
