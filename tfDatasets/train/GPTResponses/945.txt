Japan began its invasion of China in 1937 with the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, which led to the Second Sino-Japanese War. They gradually occupied large parts of China until their surrender in 1945, at the end of World War II. However, it is important to note that Japan never fully controlled all of China during this time.
