A candidate typically swears to fulfill his obligations as a Mason during the initiation ceremony, which is a solemn and meaningful event that takes place within the lodge. During this ceremony, the candidate is asked a series of questions and is required to make certain promises and commitments to uphold the principles and values of Freemasonry. This usually includes an oath or obligation to keep the secrets of the fraternity, to be faithful to its teachings, and to always act with honor, integrity, and compassion towards others.
