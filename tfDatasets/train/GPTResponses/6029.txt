Drug exclusivity rights typically last for a period of 5 to 7 years, depending on the type of exclusivity granted. This period may be extended for an additional 6 months if the drug developer conducts clinical trials in pediatric populations. However, it is important to note that exclusivity rights apply only to specific uses of a drug, and other companies may still manufacture and sell the same drug for other uses or indications.
