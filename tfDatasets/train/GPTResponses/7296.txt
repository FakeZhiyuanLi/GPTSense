One key change brought about by Christian thought was the idea of the equality of all human beings in the eyes of God. This challenged the hierarchical social structure of ancient societies and paved the way for ideas of democracy and human rights. Additionally, the Christian emphasis on compassion, forgiveness, and selflessness helped shape Western values of empathy and altruism. The concept of a personal relationship with God also brought about individualism and spiritual autonomy.
