Replays are typically played after a live event has ended, either on television or online. The exact time and channel for the replay will depend on the type of event and the broadcaster. Many sports leagues and events will have scheduled replays on their website, streaming platforms, or on-demand services. Some networks may also offer replays on their website, mobile apps, or cable/satellite TV services. Additionally, fans may be able to DVR a live event and watch it at a later time.
