Parsons believed that for a society to be functional, it needed a shared value system that provided norms and expectations for behavior. He described this as a "value consensus." This shared value system would guide individuals to act in ways that promoted social order and stability. Additionally, he believed that all individuals in society must fulfill certain roles and responsibilities to ensure the smooth functioning of society. These roles would be shaped and enforced by institutions such as family, education, religion, and government. Finally, Parsons believed that social change should be gradual and incremental to prevent disruption to social systems.
