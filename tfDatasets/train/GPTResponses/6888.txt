The offshoot of cubism that was influenced by Picasso is known as Synthetic Cubism. This movement emerged between 1912 and 1914, and it sought to incorporate elements of reality into cubist works. Picasso was one of the main proponents of this movement, which also included Georges Braque and Juan Gris. The hallmark of Synthetic Cubism is the use of collage and mixed media to create abstract compositions that still retain a connection to the real world.
