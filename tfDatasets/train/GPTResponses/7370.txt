The most influential political philosopher of medieval Europe was Thomas Aquinas. His major work, Summa Theologica, synthesized Christian theology and Aristotelian philosophy, and he developed a theory of natural law that has influenced political thought to this day. Aquinas argued that humans have inherent dignity and a natural right to life, liberty, and property. He also believed in the importance of active citizenship and the common good. His ideas influenced many later philosophers and political thinkers, including John Locke, who based much of his own theory of natural rights on Aquinas's work.
