The mendicant orders were religious orders founded in the 13th century whose members (friars) begged for their daily sustenance while also preaching and ministering to the people. They did not own property or engage in commercial enterprises like the older monastic orders did. Instead, they lived in poverty and relied on the generosity of the people for their basic necessities such as food, clothing, and shelter.Some mendicant orders, such as the Franciscans and Dominicans, also became skilled at various professions such as carpentry, sewing, and medicine. They used these skills to offer their services to the communities they served and to earn money to support their needs. They also received donations from wealthy patrons and from the Church to support their mission and to help establish schools and hospitals.Overall, the mendicant orders survived through their reliance on the charity of the people they served, their own ingenuity in developing skills and using those skills to support their mission, and the support of the Church and wealthy patrons.
