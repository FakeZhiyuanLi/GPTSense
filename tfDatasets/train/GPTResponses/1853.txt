Corruption undermines the fundamental principles of democracy and good governance, such as accountability, transparency, and legitimacy. It also leads to a lack of trust in the government and the political system, as well as a sense of injustice and inequality among citizens. Corruption can weaken institutions and hinder economic growth, leading to the misallocation of resources and the perpetuation of poverty. In addition, it can lead to social and political instability, as well as to human rights violations, and undermines the rule of law. Ultimately, corruption erodes the social contract between citizens and the government and weakens democracy itself.
