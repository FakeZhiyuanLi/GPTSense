Nagarjuna criticized the teaching of substantialism, which argues that things have a fixed, inherent nature and essence. He also criticized the teaching of eternalism, which asserts the existence of permanent entities or principles, and the teaching of nihilism, which denies the existence of any true reality. Nagarjuna's philosophy of emptiness emphasizes the interdependent and impermanent nature of all phenomena, rejecting the idea of absolute, fixed truths or substances.
