The first women's Olympic competitions were held at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, France. However, only a few events were available for women, such as tennis, sailing, and equestrian sports. It was not until the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium that more events were added for women, including swimming and athletics.
