Stalin had thousands of people executed or imprisoned during the Great Purge of 1937, including government officials, military officers, intellectuals, and members of the Communist Party who were accused of being enemies of the state or of plotting against his regime. Some of the notable figures who were executed during this time include former Soviet leader Leon Trotsky, Grigory Zinoviev, Lev Kamenev, Nikolai Bukharin, and Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky. However, the exact number of those who were killed during the purges is unknown, with estimates ranging from 700,000 to over a million.
