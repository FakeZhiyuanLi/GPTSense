is commonly referred to as "corruption". When public officials are put in charge of managing large sums of public money, there is a risk that they will use this money for personal gain rather than for the benefit of the public. This can take the form of kickbacks, which are payments made to officials in exchange for favorable treatment, or embezzlement, which is the theft of funds from the public treasury.Additionally, public spending can also be subject to inefficiencies, waste and lack of transparency. Inefficiencies occur when funds are used in ways that do not produce the intended outcomes or when the cost of delivering public goods and services exceeds what is actually needed to produce them. Waste occurs when public resources are used for things that are not essential or necessary. Lack of transparency occurs when public officials are not held accountable for their actions and their use of public resources.All of these risks can result in negative consequences for the public, including weakened trust in government, reduced public investment, and poor performance of public services. Therefore, it is important for governments to implement effective measures to prevent and address these risks, such as transparency in public spending, strong oversight mechanisms, and independent audit processes.
