Swans have been marked for many centuries, with the practice of marking them dating back to the reign of King Edward IV in England. The marking of swans was originally done to identify which birds belonged to which owner, and protect them from poaching. Today, swans are still marked for a variety of reasons, including for research purposes, to monitor their migration patterns, and to help with population management.
