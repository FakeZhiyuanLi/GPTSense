The second time period that a significant change began to happen in Cubism was during the late 1910s and early 1920s, which is sometimes referred to as the "Crystal Cubism" or "Orphic Cubism" period. During this time, Cubist artists began to incorporate more geometric shapes and vibrant colors into their work, moving away from the muted tones and simplified forms of earlier Cubist works. The artists also placed a greater emphasis on the depiction of movement and rhythm in their compositions. Some of the artists associated with this period include Robert Delaunay, Albert Gleizes, and Francis Picabia.
