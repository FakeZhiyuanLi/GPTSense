Servo motors differ from stepper motors in several ways:1. Control: Servo motors are controlled by sending a signal to their control circuit, which determines the position and speed of the motor. Stepper motors, on the other hand, are controlled by sending a series of pulses to the motor to move it in precise steps.2. Feedback: Servo motors have feedback mechanisms such as encoders or potentiometers that provide feedback to the control circuit to ensure accurate positioning. Stepper motors do not have this feedback mechanism.3. Torque: Servo motors have varying levels of torque depending on the load, while stepper motors have a constant torque output.4. Speed: Servo motors have a higher speed range than stepper motors, which are limited by their step frequency.Overall, servo motors are better suited for applications that require precision, accuracy, and high speed, while stepper motors are more appropriate for applications that require low speed, high torque, and precise positioning.
