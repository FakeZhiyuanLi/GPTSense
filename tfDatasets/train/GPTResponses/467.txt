The presence of moisture and instability in the atmosphere are other factors that can provoke rain in the Plymouth area. When warm, moist air rises and cools, it can reach its dew point, causing water vapor to condense into droplets and form clouds. As the cloud continues to grow, the droplets may grow larger and eventually fall to the ground as precipitation. Additionally, atmospheric disturbances such as low-pressure systems, fronts, and weather patterns can also play a role in producing rain in the area.
