Gametes are specialized reproductive cells produced by sexually reproducing organisms, such as humans, animals, and plants. These cells are responsible for transmitting genetic information from one generation to the next. In most animals, including humans, gametes are typically haploid, meaning they contain only half the number of chromosomes as somatic cells. During fertilization, the gametes of two individuals combine to form a zygote, which develops into a new organism with a unique combination of genetic traits from both parents. In humans, the male gamete is the sperm and the female gamete is the egg.
