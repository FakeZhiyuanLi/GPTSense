One of the main differences between animals and bacteria/protists is that animals are eukaryotic, meaning their cells have a nucleus and other organelles, while bacteria and most protists are prokaryotic, lacking a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. Additionally, animals are multicellular, while bacteria and some protists are unicellular. Animals also possess the ability to move and respond to stimuli, whereas bacteria and most protists do not have this capability. Finally, animals are typically heterotrophic, meaning they obtain their food by consuming other organisms, while many bacteria and protists can be autotrophic and produce their own food through photosynthesis or chemosynthesis.
