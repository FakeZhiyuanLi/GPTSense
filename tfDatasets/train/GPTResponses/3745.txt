The most abundant polyphenolics in purple grapes are anthocyanins, which are responsible for the grape's dark purple color. Other important polyphenolics in grapes include flavonoids such as quercetin and resveratrol. These compounds have been shown to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and may provide health benefits when consumed in moderate amounts.
