Engravers use diamond dust for cutting and shaping hard materials such as glass, ceramics, and metals. The hardness and abrasive qualities of diamond make it effective in cutting and grinding these materials with precision and accuracy. Diamond-tipped engraving tools are also used to create intricate and detailed designs on jewelry and other decorative objects.
