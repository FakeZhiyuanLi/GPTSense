The two forms of environmental determinism are physical environmental determinism and cultural environmental determinism. Physical environmental determinism suggests that the physical environment, such as climate and terrain, predominantly shapes human behavior and cultural development. Cultural environmental determinism, on the other hand, holds that cultural factors and social forces are more important determinants of human behavior and development than physical environment.
