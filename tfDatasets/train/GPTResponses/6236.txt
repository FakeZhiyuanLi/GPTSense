Sexual differences in males and females are mainly the result of differences in sex hormones, particularly testosterone, estrogen, and progesterone, which are produced in greater amounts in males and females, respectively, and regulate the development of sexual organs and secondary sexual characteristics such as body hair, voice pitch, and muscle mass. Genetic differences, such as the presence of a Y chromosome in males that determines male development, also play a role in sexual differentiation. Additionally, societal and cultural factors can influence sexual roles and behaviors, resulting in further differentiation between males and females.
