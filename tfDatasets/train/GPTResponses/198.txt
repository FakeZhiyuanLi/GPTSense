A recent development in sequencing methods is the introduction of nanopore sequencing, which uses nanopores to measure changes in electrical current as DNA strands are passed through them. This technique offers real-time, long-read sequencing capabilities and does not require the use of amplification or labelling procedures, making it a promising tool for rapid and accurate genome sequencing.
