The goal of an immunologist is to study the immune system and its response to various pathogens, infections, diseases, and foreign substances in the body. This includes studying the various types of immune cells, antibodies, cytokines, and other molecules and how they interact with each other and with different pathogens and environmental factors. Immunologists seek to understand how the immune system can be both protective and damaging to the body, and how it can be harnessed to develop better treatments and prevention strategies for various diseases and disorders.
