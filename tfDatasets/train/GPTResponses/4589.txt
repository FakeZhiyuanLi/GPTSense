Aircraft carriers feature a flight deck with a catapult system to launch aircraft and arresting gear to recover them. The catapult system uses steam or electromagnetic forces to accelerate aircraft to takeoff speed, while the arresting gear uses a series of cables and hydraulic systems to stop landing aircraft quickly and safely. The flight deck also has a series of lights and markings to assist pilots during takeoff and landing operations. Additionally, aircraft carriers have angled decks that allow for simultaneous launching and recovery operations to occur.
