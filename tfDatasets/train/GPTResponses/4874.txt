The distinction sometimes referred to as the self is the concept of individual identity and the subjective experience of being a unique, conscious entity with thoughts, feelings, and desires. It is the underlying sense of personal identity that allows individuals to experience the world from their own perspective and to differentiate themselves from others. The self is often associated with the ego or the "I" and represents a fundamental aspect of human consciousness and identity.
