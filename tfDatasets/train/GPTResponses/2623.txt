can be observed in their geological structure and composition.The western alps, including regions like the French Alps and Swiss Alps, are mostly composed of rocks that formed during the Mesozoic era (252 to 66 million years ago). These rocks include marine sediments, limestone, and sandstone. The western Alps are also characterized by large amounts of granite intrusions and metamorphism, which contribute to the high peaks and jagged ridges.On the other hand, the Austroalpine peaks such as the Austrian Alps and the Julian Alps are primarily composed of rocks from the Paleozoic era (541 to 251 million years ago). These rocks include metamorphosed sedimentary rocks such as schist, gneiss, and quartzite, as well as igneous and metamorphic rocks like granite and marble. The Austroalpine peaks also feature large deposits of coal and oil shale.In terms of their physical appearance, the western alps often have more dramatic peaks, while the Austroalpine peaks are known for their rugged, rocky terrain. The differences in geology are also reflected in the vegetation found in these regions, as the western alps support more species of trees, while the Austroalpine peaks are home to hardy alpine plants and grasses.
