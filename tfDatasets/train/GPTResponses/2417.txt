One liturgical form that endured throughout the entire Renaissance period was the Mass. The Mass is a ritualized form of worship in the Catholic Church that includes prayers, readings, and music. It has been an integral part of Catholic worship for centuries and was a common form of musical expression during the Renaissance. Many composers, such as Josquin des Prez and Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, wrote Mass settings that are still performed today.
