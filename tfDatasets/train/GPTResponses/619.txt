One of the thermochemical processes that has been explored besides electrolysis is the sulfur-iodine cycle. It is a three-step process that involves the conversion of water into hydrogen and oxygen through the use of sulfuric acid and iodine. This process has the potential to be an efficient and cost-effective method for producing hydrogen fuel.
