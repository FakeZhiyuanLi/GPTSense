Climate change has been shown to change various aspects of the environment including:1. Sea level rise: due to melting of ice sheets and glaciers, sea levels are rising causing coastal flooding and erosion.2. Temperature: climate change is causing global temperatures to rise resulting in heatwaves, droughts and wildfires.3. Precipitation: changes in precipitation patterns including increased frequency of heavy rain events and longer periods of drought.4. Ocean acidification: as more carbon dioxide is absorbed by the ocean, the water becomes more acidic, damaging coral reefs and impacting marine life.5. Biodiversity: changes in temperature and precipitation patterns are affecting the distribution and migration patterns of many plant and animal species.6. Human health: climate change is affecting human health in various ways including increased heat-related illnesses and diseases spread by insects and animals moving into new areas.7. Agriculture: changes in temperature and precipitation patterns are affecting crop yields and distribution, impacting global food security.
