The action of food being moved into the stomach is called ingestion. The process of ingestion involves chewing the food, which breaks it down into smaller pieces, and then swallowing it. The muscles in the esophagus contract, pushing the food down into the stomach. Once in the stomach, the food is mixed with digestive juices and enzymes, which continue to break it down before it moves on to the small intestine for further digestion and absorption of nutrients.
