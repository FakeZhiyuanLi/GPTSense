A common pattern in North America migration is the movement of people from rural areas to urban areas in search of better economic opportunities, education, and access to amenities. This type of migration is known as urbanization and has been occurring for centuries in North America, particularly since the Industrial Revolution. Additionally, there is also a relatively new pattern of migration of individuals from Mexico and other parts of Latin American to the United States in search of better economic opportunities or to reunite with family members.
