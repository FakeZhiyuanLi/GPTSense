The information to designate which character form to select can be found in the Unicode Standard. The Unicode Standard is a system for encoding characters in digital text, assigning each character a unique code point. It includes information on different character forms for some scripts, which are designated by variant selectors. This information can also be found in font documentation and language-specific style guides.
