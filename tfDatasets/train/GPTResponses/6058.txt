The type of risk assessment that results in approving a drug to go on the market is a comprehensive evaluation of the safety and efficacy of the drug. This includes clinical trials to determine the drug's effectiveness, safety studies to assess any potential adverse effects, and an analysis of the benefit-to-risk ratio of the drug. The goal is to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh any potential risks or adverse effects. This process is conducted by regulatory agencies such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before granting market approval.
