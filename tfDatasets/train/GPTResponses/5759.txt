The Hellenistic historian who focused primarily on the economic system was Diodorus Siculus. In his monumental work, Bibliotheca Historica, he dedicated significant portions to the economic systems of various ancient societies, including Greece, Egypt, and Persia. His work is regarded as one of the most comprehensive works on ancient economy and has been studied extensively by modern historians.
