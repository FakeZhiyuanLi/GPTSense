The diencephalon processes and integrates various types of sensory and motor information before relaying it to other parts of the brain. However, before being processed, these inputs have to pass through the thalamus, which acts as a gateway for sensory information such as visual, auditory, somatosensory, and olfactory inputs. The thalamus filters and sorts sensory information before relaying it to the appropriate cortices for further processing. Similarly, motor information from the cerebellum and basal ganglia also passes through the thalamus before being transmitted to the motor cortex for execution. Additionally, the diencephalon is involved in regulating various physiological processes such as homeostasis, hormone secretion, and circadian rhythms.
