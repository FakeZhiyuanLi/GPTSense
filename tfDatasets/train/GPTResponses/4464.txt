There is no one specific questionnaire that is widely used to measure the age at which adolescents should be able to engage in autonomous behaviors. However, there are various measures and scales that researchers may use to assess aspects of autonomy and decision-making in adolescents, such as the Autonomy Scale, the Decision-Making Competence Inventory, and the Behavioral Autonomy Scale. These measures may assess different aspects of autonomy and decision-making, such as self-determination, ability to make informed decisions, and confidence in decision-making abilities. Ultimately, the age at which adolescents are considered to be capable of autonomous behaviors may vary depending on cultural, legal, and individual factors.
