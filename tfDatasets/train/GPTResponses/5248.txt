The holy of holies in Islam is the Kaaba. It is a cube-shaped structure located in the center of the Grand Mosque in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. It is considered the most sacred site in Islam and Muslims around the world face the Kaaba during their daily prayers. The Kaaba is believed to have been built by the Prophet Abraham and his son Ishmael as a house of worship for monotheism. It is also believed to be the place where Muslims will gather for the Day of Judgment.
