There are several reasons why two consecutive year dates might be used:1. To indicate a range of time: When two consecutive year dates are used, the range of time between those years is implied. For example, if an event is said to have taken place between 2010 and 2011, it means that the event occurred sometime during that two-year period.2. To avoid confusion: In some cases, using a single year date can be ambiguous or misleading. For example, if someone says that they graduated in 2000, it may not be clear whether they mean the year 2000 or the academic year that ended in 2000. Using two consecutive year dates (e.g. 1999-2000) can help clarify the time period being referred to.3. To indicate continuity: Using two consecutive year dates can also imply a sense of continuity or ongoing progress. For example, if someone says that they have been working on a project since 2015-2016, it suggests that they have been making steady progress over the course of two years.
