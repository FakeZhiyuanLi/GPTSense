?Wood is also described as a natural composite material, consisting mainly of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. It is characterized by its high strength-to-weight ratio and its ability to absorb and release moisture, which can affect its dimensional stability. Additionally, wood can exhibit different physical and mechanical properties along different directions, making it anisotropic.
