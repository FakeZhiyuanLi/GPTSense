Oklahoma's winds bring moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. The Gulf of Mexico is a body of water that borders the southern United States, including Florida, Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama. The warm, moist air from the Gulf is carried by prevailing winds over Oklahoma and other parts of the Great Plains region, where it can fuel thunderstorms and contribute to precipitation.
