Yeast can tolerate alcohol concentrations up to around 14-18%. However, it depends on the specific strain of yeast being used. Some strains can survive and still ferment in higher concentrations of alcohol, while others may struggle even at lower concentrations. Once the concentration of alcohol reaches a certain point, it can become toxic to the yeast and they will die off, usually around 20-22%.
