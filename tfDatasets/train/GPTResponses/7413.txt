The restriction of the enzyme called acetolactate synthase (ALS) allows broad-spectrum herbicides to kill plants. ALS is an essential enzyme for the synthesis of branched-chain amino acids in plants, and its inhibition by herbicides leads to the accumulation of toxic compounds and ultimately results in the death of the plant. These herbicides are effective against a wide range of plant species because ALS is a conserved enzyme and essential for plant growth and survival.
