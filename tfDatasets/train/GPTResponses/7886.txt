The body can synthesize dgla and aa from the essential fatty acids (EFAs) alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and linoleic acid (LA). These EFAs can be obtained from sources such as plant-based oils (e.g., flaxseed oil, canola oil, soybean oil) and certain types of seafood (e.g., salmon, tuna, sardines). Once consumed, the body can convert ALA and LA into dgla and aa through a series of enzymatic reactions.
