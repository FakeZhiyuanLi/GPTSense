It is challenging to determine the exact population of Pygmies as they are often marginalized and discriminated against, making it difficult for them to be accurately represented in official population counts. Estimates suggest that there are between 250,000 to 600,000 Pygmies in Africa, which is less than 1% of the continent's population. However, these estimates vary widely and may not be entirely accurate.
