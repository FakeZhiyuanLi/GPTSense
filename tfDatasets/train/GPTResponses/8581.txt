The border between Texas and New Mexico was first determined in 1850 with the signing of the Compromise of 1850, which established the southern boundary of New Mexico as the 32nd parallel, separating it from Texas. However, there were disputes and adjustments made to the boundary over the years, ultimately resulting in the current boundary that was established in 1912.
