The largest ship constructed in antiquity is believed to be the "Syramus," a ship built in the 3rd century BCE by the Seleucid king Antiochus III. It was said to be over 400 feet long, with multiple decks and a capacity of up to 700 passengers. However, there is little physical evidence of the Syramus, so its exact size and specifications remain somewhat uncertain.
