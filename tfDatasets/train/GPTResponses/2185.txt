One group that was notably persecuted after the Roman Empire converted to Christianity was the Pagans. They were often seen as "godless" or "idol worshipers" and were forced to convert to Christianity or face persecution, discrimination, and even death. This persecution continued throughout the late Roman Empire and into the Byzantine Empire.
