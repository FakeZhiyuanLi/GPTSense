The type of Judaism that advocates segregation from non-Jewish culture is called Haredi or Ultra-Orthodox Judaism. This branch of Judaism seeks to maintain strict adherence to traditional Jewish practices and separate themselves from the outside world to avoid assimilation. They typically reject modernity and secular culture, and prioritize Torah study and religious ritual observance above all else.
