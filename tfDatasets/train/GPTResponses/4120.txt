There were several factors that caused population growth to decline in the 1980s:1. Economic recession: The 1980s saw a number of economic recessions around the world, which led to high unemployment rates and reduced economic growth. This led to fewer people having children, as they were more focused on their financial stability.2. Changing social attitudes: There was a shift in social attitudes towards smaller families, with more people consciously choosing to have fewer children. This was often motivated by a desire to have a better quality of life and to be able to provide their children with more opportunities.3. Family planning programs: Increased access to family planning programs and contraception helped people to control their fertility and prevent unintended pregnancies. As a result, the birth rate declined.4. Aging population: As people around the world became more affluent, they began to have fewer children and to focus more on their careers and personal goals. This led to an increase in the number of older people, which can result in a decline in population growth.
