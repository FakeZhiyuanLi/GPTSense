Traditionally, copper is commonly used for both roofing and plumbing. About 42% of all copper produced worldwide is used in construction, with a large portion being used in roofing and plumbing. However, nowadays, other materials have become increasingly popular for these purposes, such as aluminum, steel, and PVC in plumbing, and asphalt, shingles, and tiles in roofing. Thus, the exact percentage of copper used in roofing and plumbing varies by location and demand.
