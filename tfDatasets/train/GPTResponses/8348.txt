During the 19th century, there were significant changes in the way geology was implemented, which led to the development of modern geology. Some of the notable changes include:1. The emergence of the principles of stratigraphy: Stratigraphy became a critical tool for geologists. They were able to use it to describe the sequence of rocks and their characteristics.2. Establishment of geological societies: Geological societies such as the Geological Society of London were established in Europe and America, leading to the growth of scientific community and resources.3. Evolutionary theory: The development of the theory of evolution had a significant impact on the field of geology.4. Use of fossil record: Geologists began to use the fossil record to date and classify rocks.5. Technological advancements: The invention of the microscope, the telegraph, and other technological advancements allowed geologists to collect better data and communicate their findings more efficiently.6. The concept of plate tectonics: The theory of plate tectonics revolutionized the field of geology, leading to a better understanding of the Earth's geological history and how its geological features were formed.
