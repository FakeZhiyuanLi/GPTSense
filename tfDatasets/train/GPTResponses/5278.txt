Modifiers are added to sentences to specify status or tone. These may include adjectives, adverbs, or phrases that provide more information about a particular word or concept in the sentence. For example, "The happy dog jumped excitedly," the words "happy" and "excitedly" are modifiers that add a positive tone and specify the dog's behavior.
