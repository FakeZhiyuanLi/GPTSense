Russian carriers typically include ski-jump ramps for launching lightly loaded conventional fighters. The ski-jump ramp allows the fighters to take off at a higher angle, which helps to reduce the required takeoff distance and launch weight. Additionally, Russian carriers may also use catapults for launching heavier loaded aircraft or aircraft with shorter takeoff distances.
