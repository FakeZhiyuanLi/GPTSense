The cold resistance of a tungsten filament lamp is much lower than its hot resistance. This is because tungsten filaments have a positive temperature coefficient of resistance, which means that their resistance increases with temperature. Therefore, as the filament heats up and the temperature increases, its resistance also increases. As a result, the hot resistance of a tungsten filament lamp is much higher than its cold resistance.
