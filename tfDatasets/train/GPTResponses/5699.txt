Drugs made between the years of 1938 and 1962 had to be tested before going to market under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938. This act established the requirement for drug manufacturers to submit evidence of drug safety to the FDA before marketing their products. This was in response to the public health crisis caused by unsafe and ineffective drugs that were being marketed without regulation before the 1938 act.
