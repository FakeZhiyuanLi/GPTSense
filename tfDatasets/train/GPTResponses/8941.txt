Soccer (or football) has been gaining steam as more and more women play. It is one of the fastest-growing sports in the world for women, with increasing participation rates and competitive leagues at both amateur and professional levels. FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association) has been actively promoting women's soccer through initiatives such as the Women's World Cup and investing in women's soccer development programs.
