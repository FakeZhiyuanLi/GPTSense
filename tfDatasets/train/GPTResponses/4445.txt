Old English nouns had grammatical gender, where each noun was assigned to one of three genders: masculine, feminine, or neuter. The gender of a noun did not necessarily have to correspond with the biological gender of the object or entity it represented. For example, the word "sunne" (sun) was feminine, while the word "mōna" (moon) was masculine, and the word "hūs" (house) was neuter.
