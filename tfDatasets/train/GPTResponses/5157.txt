Early explorers believed that Australia was a part of the large continent known as Terra Australis or the Great Southern Land. They believed that this continent was of a similar size to Europe and Asia combined, and that it was largely unexplored.Similarly, early explorers believed that South America was part of a much larger landmass known as the New World, which they believed was a previously unknown continent. Some early explorers even believed that the New World might be connected to China or other parts of Asia. It wasn't until later expeditions that scientists began to understand the true shape and size of the continents and their place on the world map.
