As a language model AI, I do not have personal experience, but here are some general behaviors that birds may exhibit in the period before migration:1. Increased feeding behavior: In the weeks leading up to migration, birds may increase their food intake to build up their energy reserves for the long journey ahead.2. Restlessness: Many birds may become more active and restless in the period before migration as they begin to prepare for their upcoming journey.3. Increasing flock sizes: Some bird species may congregate in larger groups as they prepare to migrate. This might be to increase their chances of finding food or to provide protection from predators.4. Molting: Some birds may molt their feathers in the period before migration to ensure they have healthy and functional feathers for the journey.5. Vocalization: Some birds may become more vocal as they prepare to migrate, likely to communicate with other birds in their flock and to establish their territory during the migration period.Overall, birds exhibit a range of behaviors as they prepare for their migration, many of which are specific to the species of bird and the environmental cues they use to determine the timing of migration.
