When copper is placed touching another metal, a process known as galvanic corrosion or electrochemical corrosion can occur. This happens due to the difference in the electrical potentials of the two metals, causing one metal to act as the anode (more negatively charged) and the other as the cathode (more positively charged). As a result, the anode metal starts to corrode and deteriorate faster than normal. In the case of copper, it is a relatively noble metal, which means that it is less likely to corrode compared to other metals like iron or steel. However, if it is placed in contact with a more reactive metal like zinc, aluminum, or steel, it can accelerate the corrosion process. To prevent galvanic corrosion, electrical insulation or the use of anti-corrosion coatings can be applied to the metals.
