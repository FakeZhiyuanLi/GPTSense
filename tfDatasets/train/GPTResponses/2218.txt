Native peoples were able to maintain a minimum amount of land, resources, and autonomy through treaties. Some of these treaties guaranteed their right to hunt, fish, and gather on their traditional lands, while others outlined government assistance in areas such as education and healthcare. The treaties also recognized indigenous sovereignty and self-government to varying degrees, allowing for separate laws and legal systems to be maintained. However, the enforcement and adherence to these treaties has been a longstanding issue, with many indigenous communities still fighting for their rights today.
