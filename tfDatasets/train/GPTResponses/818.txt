The emergence of modern movements in Buddhism can be traced back to the 19th century, beginning with the introduction of Buddhism to the Western world through the efforts of scholars and explorers. However, the more significant developments occurred in the 20th century with the rise of new Buddhist movements such as Zen, Vipassana, and Tibetan Buddhism, which emphasized meditation and mindfulness practices, and incorporate modern scientific and psychological insights. Some scholars also consider the emergence of Engaged Buddhism, which addresses social and political issues, as a major modern movement in Buddhism.
