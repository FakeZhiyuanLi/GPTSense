The Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China members are known to wave the flag of the People's Republic of China with a black background to symbolize their desire for democracy in China. The flag is commonly known as the "Black Bauhinia" flag. The black background represents mourning for victims of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, while the image of a bauhinia flower in white on the flag represents Hong Kong's unique identity and history.
