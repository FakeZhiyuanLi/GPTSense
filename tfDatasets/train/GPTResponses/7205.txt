other types of motors?Universal motors can operate much faster than other types of motors because they are a type of AC or DC motor that uses brushes to change the direction of the magnetic field in the rotor. This allows them to operate effectively at high speeds, making them ideal for a variety of applications where speed is important, such as power drills, vacuum cleaners, and blenders. However, because of their design, universal motors tend to be less efficient and have a shorter lifespan than other types of motors, such as induction motors.
