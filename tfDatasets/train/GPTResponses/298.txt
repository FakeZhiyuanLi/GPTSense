Karma is a concept in Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism that refers to the actions of an individual, and the consequences of those actions. It is a belief that every action, whether good or bad, has consequences in the future. This means that one's present actions will determine their future experiences and quality of life. The concept of karma also involves the idea of reincarnation, where one's deeds in one life determine their next life.
