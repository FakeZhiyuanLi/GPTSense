The Eritrean War of Independence was fueled by several factors, including:1. Italian colonization: Eritrea was a colony of Italy from 1885 until 1941 when it was occupied by the British during World War II. Italian rule was characterized by harsh treatment and discrimination against the native Eritrean population.2. Ethiopian annexation: After World War II, Eritrea was placed under Ethiopian administration by the United Nations despite Eritrean protests. Ethiopian rule was marked by repression and discrimination against the Eritrean people.3. Nationalist movements: In the 1950s, Eritrean nationalist groups, such as the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF) and the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF), emerged and began a campaign for independence.4. Armed struggle: In 1961, the ELF launched an armed struggle against Ethiopian rule. In 1970, the EPLF emerged as the dominant force in the independence movement and continued the armed struggle, using guerrilla tactics to weaken Ethiopian forces.5. International support: The Eritrean independence movement gained support from several countries, including the Soviet Union and Cuba, who provided military aid and training to the EPLF.All these factors combined led to a lengthy armed struggle that ended with Eritrea gaining independence in 1993.
