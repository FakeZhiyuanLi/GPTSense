Before Somali weddings, a traditional engagement ceremony known as "shirib" is often held. This ceremony is a formal agreement and announcement of the upcoming marriage between the families of the bride and groom. It involves the payment of a bride price, followed by the exchange of gifts between both families. It is also an opportunity for the families to discuss the logistics of the wedding, such as the date, venue, and other arrangements.
