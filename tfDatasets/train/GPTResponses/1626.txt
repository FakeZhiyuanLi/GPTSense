The notion for all Polish nobles, which was enshrined in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth's constitution, the "Golden Freedom," was the principle of equality and shared responsibility for the common good. This notion held that all nobles, regardless of their wealth or status, had equal rights and were responsible for defending the state and enacting legislation. The nobles were also granted certain privileges, such as the right to elect the king and to participate in the Sejm, the Polish parliament. This notion played a significant role in the social and political structure of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and its eventual downfall.
