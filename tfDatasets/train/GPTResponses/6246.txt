During the reign of Caliph Hisham, the Arab forces suffered a major defeat in the Battle of the Burqan against the Tang Dynasty of China in 751 AD. The battle took place near the Talas River in present-day Kazakhstan, and it resulted in the capture of the Arab commander and the slaughter of thousands of Arab soldiers. This defeat marked the end of Arab expansion into Central Asia and limited their military and political influence in the region.
