The Eritrean Constitution recognizes all nine languages spoken in the country (Tigrigna, Tigre, Afar, Saho, Bilen, Kunama, Nara, Rashaida, and Arabic) as "working languages" and guarantees their equality in all areas of public and private life, including education, the media, and the administration. It also recognizes the right of individuals to use their language of preference in all legal proceedings.
