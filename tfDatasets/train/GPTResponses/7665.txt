The Free Officers wanted to establish a democratic government in Egypt, free from foreign control and corruption. They believed in social justice, equality, and the rule of law. The political ideology they followed was a mixture of Arab nationalism, socialism, and Islamic values. They called for the establishment of a modern, secular state that would prioritize the welfare of the Egyptian people over the interests of the ruling elite or foreign powers.
