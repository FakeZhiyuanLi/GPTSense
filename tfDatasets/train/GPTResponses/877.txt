The form of Buddhism that lays special emphasis on meditation is called Vipassana or Insight Meditation. This is a practice that involves focused introspection on one's own thoughts and sensations, which can ultimately lead to greater self-awareness and understanding of the nature of reality. Vipassana is often associated with Theravada Buddhism and is traditionally practiced in Southeast Asian countries such as Thailand, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka.
