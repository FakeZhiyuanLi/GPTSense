The opposites of injective maps are:1. Surjective maps - A surjective map, also called onto map, is a function where every element in the range is mapped to at least one element in the domain. In other words, the surjective map covers the entire range of values.2. Bijective maps - A bijective map is a function that is both injective and surjective, meaning every element in the range is mapped to one and only one element in the domain, and every element in the domain is mapped to one and only one element in the range.3. Non-injective maps - A non-injective map is a function that is not injective, meaning that there are two or more elements in the domain that have the same image in the range.4. Non-surjective maps - A non-surjective map is a function that is not surjective, meaning that there are some elements in the range that are not mapped to by any element in the domain.
