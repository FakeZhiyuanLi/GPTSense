The ISCII (Indian Script Code for Information Interchange) standard is a character encoding standard used to represent various Indian scripts such as Devanagari, Bengali, Gujarati, Gurumukhi, Oriya, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam on computers. It was developed by the Indian government in the early 1980s to enable the electronic exchange of information in Indian languages. ISCII assigns a unique 8-bit code to each character in the Indian script which allows for easy interchange of information across different computer systems and software applications. Although it has largely been superseded by Unicode, ISCII continues to be used in some legacy systems and software applications.
