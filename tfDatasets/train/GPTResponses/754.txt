additional mathematical structures and tools to understand and analyze their properties and behaviors. This includes tools from differential geometry, representation theory, and algebraic topology, as well as the development of specialized areas such as Kac-Moody algebras and noncommutative geometry. Additionally, the study of these structures has opened up connections to other areas of mathematics and physics, such as string theory and topology.
