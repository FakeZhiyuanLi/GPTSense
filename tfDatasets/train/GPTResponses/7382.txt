The famous Grecian author who inspired later authors and their works is Homer. His epic poems, "The Iliad" and "The Odyssey," have had a significant influence on Western literature, and his works continue to be taught and studied in schools and universities throughout the world. Homer's depictions of heroes, gods, and the struggles of human beings against fate have been a source of inspiration for many great writers, including Virgil, Dante Alighieri, William Shakespeare, John Milton, and many others.
