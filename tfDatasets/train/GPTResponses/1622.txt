When slavery ended in the US, there was a period of reconstruction and government-led efforts to integrate former slaves into society and provide them with equal rights. This period was marked by the passage of civil rights legislation, including the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments to the US Constitution, which abolished slavery, granted citizenship to former slaves, and granted them the right to vote, respectively. In contrast, in Brazil, there was no similar period of reconstruction or government-led efforts to integrate former slaves into society, and slavery ended gradually without significant legal or constitutional changes. This resulted in a legacy of racial inequality and discrimination in Brazil, which persists to this day.
