During Napoleon's brother Joseph's rule in Spain in 1813, Napoleon abolished the Spanish Inquisition. This was a significant move towards religious freedom and marked a break from the centuries-old tradition of Catholic orthodoxy in Spain. However, the abolition was also a strategic move to gain support among the Spanish population, many of whom were anti-Inquisition.
