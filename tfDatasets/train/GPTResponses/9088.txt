Islam began to become a political power in India with the arrival of the Delhi Sultanate in the 13th century. The first Muslim invasion of India was by Muhammad Bin Qasim in 712 AD, but it was not until the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate under Qutb-ud-din Aibak in 1206, that Islam began to exert a significant political influence in the region. The Sultanate, which ruled over northern India for nearly three centuries, was followed by the Mughal Empire, which further consolidated Muslim power in India until the arrival of British colonial rule in the 19th century.
