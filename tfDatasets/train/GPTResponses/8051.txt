The order of religious women who later converted to Dominican is the Third Order of St. Dominic or the Lay Dominicans. They are lay members of the Dominican Order who live a life of prayer, study, and service while remaining active in their secular professions and daily lives. The Third Order of St. Dominic was founded in the early 13th century by St. Dominic to extend the charisms and mission of the Dominican Order to the laity. Over the centuries, many laywomen joined the Third Order of St. Dominic and became dedicated to a life of prayer, study, and service as part of the Dominican family.
