An induction motor produces torque by means of an electromagnetic field that is created in the stator (stationary) part of the motor. When an alternating current is passed through the stator windings, it produces a rotating magnetic field. This magnetic field induces a current in the rotor (rotating) part of the motor, which creates its own magnetic field that interacts with the stator's magnetic field.The interaction between the two magnetic fields produces a force on the rotor, which causes it to rotate. This force or torque is strongest when the rotor is stationary and decreases as the rotor speeds up to the synchronous speed. The torque produced by the motor also depends on the design and size of the motor, as well as the characteristics of the load it is driving.In summary, the torque produced by an induction motor is a result of the interaction between the stator and rotor magnetic fields, which creates a rotating force on the rotor that causes it to rotate.
