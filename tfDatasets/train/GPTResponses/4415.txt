Fermentation during the brewing process occurs when yeast is added to the wort (a liquid mixture of water, malted barley, and other grains). The yeast consumes the sugars in the wort and converts them into alcohol and carbon dioxide gas. This process is called alcoholic fermentation. The yeast also produces other flavors and aromas that give the beer its unique character. The temperature and duration of fermentation, as well as the strain of yeast used, can all affect the final flavor of the beer.
