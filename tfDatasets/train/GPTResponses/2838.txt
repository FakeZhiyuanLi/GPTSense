The National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB) is the sole accrediting agency for architectural education in the United States. However, there are other organizations that offer specialized accreditation for schools serving architects, such as the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) and the Council for Interior Design Accreditation (CIDA).
