The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA): This law allows for the sharing of information between the FBI and private companies to prevent cyber attacks.3. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) Amendments Act: This law expanded the FBI's ability to conduct surveillance on foreign agents and individuals without a warrant.4. The Supreme Court case United States v. Jones (2012): This case ruled that the FBI could attach a GPS tracking device to a suspect's vehicle without a warrant, as long as the vehicle was parked in a public place.5.
