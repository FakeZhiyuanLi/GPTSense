The Antikythera mechanism is believed to be the first mechanical analog computer. It was an ancient Greek device designed to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes. The mechanism was built around 100 BCE and was discovered in 1901 in the Antikythera shipwreck off the coast of Greece.
