Thermal mass reduces the need for heating and cooling equipment by acting as a natural insulator, absorbing and releasing heat slowly over time. This helps to maintain a consistent indoor temperature and reduce fluctuations, resulting in lower energy consumption and costs. Additionally, thermal mass can help regulate humidity levels, further reducing the need for artificial heating or cooling.
