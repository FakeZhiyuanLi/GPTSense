The concept that determines relationships between grand lodges is called regularity. Regularity is the adherence to the fundamental principles of Freemasonry, which includes a belief in a supreme being, maintaining the secrecy of certain teachings, and the use of the proper rituals and modes of recognition.Grand lodges that are considered regular are recognized and accepted by other regular grand lodges, and they are allowed to form fraternal relationships and engage in activities such as visitations, joint ceremonial events, and mutual aid. On the other hand, grand lodges that do not conform to the principles of regularity are considered irregular and are not recognized by regular grand lodges.
