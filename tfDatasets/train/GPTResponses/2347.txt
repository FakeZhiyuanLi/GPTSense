Windows uses a 64-bit FILETIME structure for file time stamps in storage under NTFS. This structure stores the number of 100-nanosecond intervals that have elapsed since January 1, 1601. The structure consists of two 32-bit values representing the low and high order parts of the file time, respectively. This allows for precise tracking of file creation, modification, and access times.
