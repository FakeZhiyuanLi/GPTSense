Economic damage: Corruption can divert resources away from productive activities and into the hands of corrupt individuals, causing economic damage and growth.3. Poverty: Public resources allocated for the poor in health, education, and other sectors can be wrongly diverted, leaving the most vulnerable without critical services.4. Injustice: Corruption can undermine the rule of law, and lead to human rights abuses and social injustice.5. Security: It undermines national security by conferring undue privileges and advantages to a particular group, weakening the common citizenship bond.6. Environmental degradation: Corruption can manifest in weak enforcement and regulation of environmental laws, further exacerbating the negative outcome of careless actions on the environment.
