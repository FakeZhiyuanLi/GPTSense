The substance in CFL bulbs that raises health concerns is mercury. Mercury is a toxic heavy metal that can have serious health effects on humans, especially in high doses. If a CFL bulb breaks, it can release small amounts of mercury vapor into the air, which can be inhaled and cause health problems such as respiratory issues, headaches, and nausea. It is important to handle and dispose of CFL bulbs carefully to minimize the risk of exposure to mercury.
