This means that even if two encoders are given the same audio or video file to encode, the resulting output can differ in terms of quality, based on the settings and algorithms used by each encoder. This is because different encoders may prioritize certain aspects of the file, such as reducing noise or preserving fine details, differently. As a result, the final quality of the output file can vary based on the encoder used. This can be important for professionals who need to ensure high-quality results and may need to test different encoders to find the one that best suits their needs.
