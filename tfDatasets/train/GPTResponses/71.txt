During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), which was the most recent ice age, the sea level was about 120 meters (394 feet) lower than it is today. This was due to the large amount of water that was stored in the form of ice on land, particularly in the polar ice caps. As this ice melted over time, the sea level gradually rose to its current level.
