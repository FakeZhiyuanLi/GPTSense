The most current is typically found on the surface or near the surface of the water in a fast-flowing river or stream. This is known as the "surface current" or "surface layer" and is influenced by factors such as wind, temperature, and water depth. However, this may vary depending on the specific characteristics of the waterway and the surrounding environment. It is important to be aware of the currents in any body of water and exercise caution when swimming or boating.
