In the James-Lange theory, emotions are caused by physiological responses to stimuli in the environment. This means that the bodily changes, such as increased heart rate or sweating, that occur in response to a stimulus are what lead to the experience of an emotion. According to this theory, the experience of an emotion is a result of these bodily changes and not the other way around.
