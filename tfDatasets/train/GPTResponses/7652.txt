There have been multiple incidents of clashes between British forces and Egyptian police over several decades. One notable clash occurred on March 20, 1952, in Ismailia, Egypt, when British soldiers fired on Egyptian police who were protesting outside a military installation. The incident resulted in the deaths of around 50 Egyptians and several British soldiers. Another notable clash occurred on July 23, 1952, when Egyptian nationalist officers staged a coup against King Farouk and his pro-British government, marking the end of British rule in Egypt.
