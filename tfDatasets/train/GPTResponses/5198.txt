were a series of consumer protection laws and regulations aimed at ensuring the safety and reliability of products sold to the public. These laws required manufacturers to meet certain standards for product safety, durability, and functionality, and established penalties for companies that failed to comply with these regulations. Additionally, consumer advocacy groups and industry watchdogs emerged to enforce these regulations and draw attention to products that did not meet quality standards. As a result, manufacturers were forced to improve their products and be more transparent about their manufacturing processes, in order to avoid negative publicity and legal action.
