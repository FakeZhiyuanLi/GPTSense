From the late 19th century to the early 20th century, some of the buildings in urban Germany rose to great heights, particularly in cities such as Berlin and Frankfurt. The first skyscraper in Berlin was the 13-story Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church built in 1891. Other notable skyscrapers include the 27-story Park Inn Hotel (1929) and the 32-story Europa-Center (1963) in Berlin, and the 54-story Commerzbank Tower (1997) in Frankfurt.
