The main focus of the Marshall Islands' economy is the service industry, primarily related to the country's status as a tax haven and the presence of the United States military base on the Kwajalein Atoll. Fishing and agriculture also play a significant role in the economy. The country also relies heavily on foreign aid from the United States and other countries.
