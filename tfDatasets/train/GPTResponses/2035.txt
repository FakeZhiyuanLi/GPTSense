Monks were a type of clergy known as regular clergy, who lived in monasteries and devoted their lives to prayer, work, and the study of scripture. They were not ordained as priests, but some were trained in theology and could perform some religious duties, such as administering the sacraments. The primary focus of their life was on spiritual contemplation and personal devotion to God.
