The notable technological advancement of the 12th and 13th centuries was the invention of the mechanical clock. The first mechanical clocks were invented in Europe in the late 1200s and were used in churches and monasteries to regulate prayer times. They quickly spread to cities and were used for a variety of purposes such as timekeeping, counting the hours worked by employees, and regulating the opening and closing times of shops and markets. The mechanical clock revolutionized the way people measured time and was one of the key inventions of the Middle Ages.
