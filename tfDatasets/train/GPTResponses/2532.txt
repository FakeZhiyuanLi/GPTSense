Bird migration refers to the seasonal movement of birds from one place to another, usually in search of food, nesting sites, or better weather conditions. This movement can be temporary, as in the case of many wintering species that spend only a few months in warmer regions before returning to their breeding grounds, or it can be permanent, as in the case of migratory birds that spend their entire lives moving between different regions. Bird migration is usually triggered by changes in daylight hours or temperature, and can involve millions of birds traveling thousands of miles over land and sea.
