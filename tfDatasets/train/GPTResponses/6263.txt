The Frankfurt Proposals were a set of demands put forward by Prussia after its victory over France in the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871). The proposals sought to reduce France to a weakened state and establish a dominant position for Prussia in Europe. Specifically, the proposals called for France to cede the territories of Alsace and Lorraine to Germany, pay a large sum of money in war reparations, and concede various economic and diplomatic privileges to Prussia. The Frankfurt Proposals were eventually incorporated into the Treaty of Frankfurt, which ended the Franco-Prussian War.
