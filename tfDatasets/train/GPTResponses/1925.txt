Most western European peasants paid their landlords through the system of serfdom, where they were bound to the land and required to provide labor and goods to their lord in exchange for protection and use of the land. This could include working on the lord's land, providing a portion of their agricultural products or livestock, or paying rent. The precise terms of the arrangement varied depending on the region and the specific landlord, but the basic principle was that the peasant owed service and tribute to the lord in exchange for the right to live and work on the land.
