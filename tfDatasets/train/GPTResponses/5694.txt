Safety concerns: There have been instances where drugs have been found to have harmful side effects or interactions with other medications. In some cases, these side effects have been severe or even deadly.2. Lack of efficacy: Some drugs have been found to be ineffective or have limited effectiveness, despite being approved for use. This can lead to wastage of resources and unnecessary medication use.3. Industry pressure: The pharmaceutical industry has come under scrutiny for its marketing practices and for potentially influencing the approval process for drugs. This has led to calls for greater transparency and accountability in the drug approval process.4. Patient advocacy: Patient advocacy groups have played an important role in raising awareness about the need for greater drug safety and efficacy. They have lobbied for tougher regulations and increased funding for research into new treatments and therapies.5. Globalization: The growth of international trade and commerce has increased the need for harmonization of drug regulations across different countries and regions. This has led to efforts to develop international standards for drug testing and approval.
