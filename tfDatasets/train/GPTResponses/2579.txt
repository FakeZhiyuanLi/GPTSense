The architecture of New Delhi borrows from indigenous sources but fits into the tradition of colonial and modernist architecture. The city was planned and built by British architects and urban planners in the early 20th century, and the architecture reflects the colonial influence on Indian architecture. The buildings are designed with a mix of Western and Indian styles, creating a unique blend of architectural styles. The government buildings, such as the Rashtrapati Bhavan and the Parliament House, borrow from classical Indian architecture but are built in the modernist style. The use of red sandstone and marble inlays is a prominent feature of Delhi's architecture. Overall, the architecture of New Delhi reflects the city's diverse cultural heritage and its transition from a colonial city to a modern metropolis.
