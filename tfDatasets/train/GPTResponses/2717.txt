The notation of music on a staff began to take shape in the Middle Ages, around the 9th century. The Gregorian chant, which was the predominant musical form of the time, was transcribed using a system of neumes, or symbols placed above the text of the chant, to indicate the melodic contour. Over time, as music became more complex, additional lines were added to the staff, and new symbols were developed to represent specific rhythms and other musical elements. By the 16th century, the modern system of notation on a staff comprised of five horizontal lines and a set of standardized symbols had been fully developed.
