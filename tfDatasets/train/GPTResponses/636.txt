Long dead human groups are presumed to have lived and behaved based on the archaeological and paleontological evidence found of their physical remains, artifacts, and structures left behind. This evidence provides insight into their physical characteristics, diet, living conditions, and technological development.Comparisons can be made to still living populations through the study of genetics, linguistics, and cultural practices. Genetic studies can reveal similarities and differences in the DNA of long dead and still living populations. Linguistic studies can provide insight into the similarities or differences in the languages, dialects, and vocabularies of these groups.Cultural practices are often reflected in the history and literature of the times or may be inferred from the archaeological and paleontological evidence. The examination of religion, art, music, and other cultural practices can provide insight into the societal values and beliefs of long dead human groups and how they compare to still living populations.However, it is important to note that these comparisons are based on limited evidence and cannot provide a comprehensive understanding of the lived experiences of long dead human groups.
