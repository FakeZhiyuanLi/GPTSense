One possible condition that made the United Grand Lodge of England withdraw its recognition of the Grand Orient de France was the latter's decision to remove the requirement for belief in a Supreme Being from its members. This move was seen as a departure from traditional Masonic values, which placed a strong emphasis on faith and spirituality. The United Grand Lodge of England felt that this change undermined the moral and ethical principles that underpinned freemasonry, and so it decided to sever ties with the Grand Orient de France.
