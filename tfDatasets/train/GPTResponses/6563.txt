Appellate decisions began to be regularly reported in the 19th century, specifically in the mid-1800s. Before this time, court decisions were generally not published, making it difficult for lawyers and judges to refer to them in future cases. However, with the development of legal reporting and the growth of legal publishers, court decisions started to be published in print and became widely available.
