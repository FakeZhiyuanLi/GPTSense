The word that is commonly used to describe someone whose sexual orientation, behaviors, and identity match is "homosexual". However, it is important to note that this is just one of many terms that can be used to describe a person's identity and orientation, and it may not be the term that an individual prefers for themselves. Other terms that are commonly used in the LGBTQ+ community include "lesbian", "gay", "bisexual", "queer", and "pansexual", among others. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to choose the label that best fits their identity and to communicate that to others in a way that feels comfortable and authentic for them.
