There is no specific event that is celebrated on March 24th to recognize the test for latent tuberculosis (TB). March 24th is recognized as World Tuberculosis Day, which is a global event aimed at raising awareness about the impact of TB and the efforts to eliminate it as a public health threat. However, the test for latent TB may be promoted and highlighted during activities and campaigns related to World Tuberculosis Day.
