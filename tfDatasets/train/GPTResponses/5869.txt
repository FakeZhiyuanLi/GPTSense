There are several factors that contribute to increased pollution and levels of bacteria such as E. coli in the Yarra River and its tributaries, including:1. Urbanization: As the population in the surrounding areas increases, so does the amount of waste and pollution generated. This includes sewage, industrial effluents, plastic waste, and chemicals.2. Agriculture: Agriculture in the catchment area can also contribute to pollution in the river. Runoff from farms can contain fertilizers, pesticides, and animal waste.3. Stormwater runoff: Heavy rain can cause runoff from streets, parking lots, and other urban surfaces to enter the river. This water can carry pollutants such as oil, grease, and chemicals.4. Sewage treatment plants: The discharge from sewage treatment plants can contain traces of bacteria and chemicals that are harmful to the environment.5. Illegal dumping: Illegal dumping of waste in the catchment area can also contribute to pollution in the river.6. Climate change: Changes in temperature, rainfall, and weather patterns can also impact the river's water quality, potentially increasing bacteria levels.Overall, a combination of human activity and natural factors can contribute to pollution and increased bacteria levels in the Yarra River and its tributaries.
