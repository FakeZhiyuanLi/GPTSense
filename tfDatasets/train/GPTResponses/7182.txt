Czech Republic (formerly known as Czechoslovakia) applied cubism to architecture the most, particularly during the period of 1910-1920. The Czech version of cubism, also known as "Cubist Expressionism," was characterized by the use of geometric forms, bold colors, and abstracted shapes. Some famous examples of Czech cubist architecture include the House of the Black Madonna in Prague and the Diamond House in Turnov.
