In the southern hemisphere, the DST (Daylight Saving Time) schedule is opposite of that of the northern hemisphere. While the northern hemisphere implements DST during the spring to fall months, the southern hemisphere implements DST during the fall to spring months. This means that when the northern hemisphere "springs forward," the southern hemisphere "falls back." Similarly, when the northern hemisphere "falls back," the southern hemisphere "springs forward."
