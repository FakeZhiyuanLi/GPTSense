Off-grid PV systems typically use batteries to store excess electricity. The batteries can then be used to power the household or facility during times when there is no or limited sun exposure, such as at night or during cloudy weather. Other storage options include pumped hydro, compressed air, and flywheel energy storage systems, but these are less common for residential or small-scale systems.
