Gastric juice is a digestive fluid produced by the glands in the lining of the stomach. It consists of:1. Hydrochloric acid (HCl): This is the main component of gastric juice. It helps to break down proteins and other macromolecules, activates pepsinogen to pepsin and destroy bacteria, fungus, and viruses.2. Pepsinogen: It is a proenzyme that is activated to pepsin by HCl. Pepsin digests proteins into smaller peptides.3. Mucus: It is a viscous secretion that protects the stomach lining from the harmful effects of HCl and pepsin.4. Water: It helps to dilute the acid in the stomach and aids in the digestion of food.5. Intrinsic factor: It is required for the absorption of vitamin B12 in the small intestine.6. Other electrolytes: such as chloride, sodium and potassium which are essential for many physiological functions.
