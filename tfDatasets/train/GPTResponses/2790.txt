The middle ages are generally considered to have ended in the 15th century, with the beginning of the Renaissance period. The exact date is not universally agreed upon, but some historians mark the fall of Constantinople in 1453 or the Discovery of America in 1492 as significant events that marked the end of the medieval period.
