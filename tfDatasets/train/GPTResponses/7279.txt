No, plants are not able to mate across species. Crossbreeding between different plant species is generally not possible, as it requires the transfer of genetic material between individuals of different species. While some plants may be closely related and have hybrid offspring, such as the common tomato and potato plant, most species cannot crossbreed and produce viable offspring.
