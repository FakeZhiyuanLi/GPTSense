Hardware-based security solutions, such as biometric authentication devices and smart cards, offer an alternative to software-only computer security. These solutions provide an extra layer of security that cannot be easily bypassed by malicious software or hackers. Additionally, hardware-based security can also store encryption keys and other sensitive data in a separate chip or module, further enhancing the security of the system.
