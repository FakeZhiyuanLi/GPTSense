The Twin Prime Conjecture states that there is an infinite number of twin primes, which are pairs of prime numbers that differ by 2 (e.g., 3 and 5, 5 and 7, 11 and 13, etc.). This conjecture has yet to be proven, but it is widely believed to be true. There have been several significant progressions towards proving this conjecture, but it remains an open problem in mathematics.
