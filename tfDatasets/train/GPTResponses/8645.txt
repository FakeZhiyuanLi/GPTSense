Sociology is a social science that explains how societies work, how people interact with each other, and how social institutions like family, education, and government influence human behavior. Sociology seeks to understand the complex mechanisms and patterns of social phenomena, including social inequality, social change, and social movements. It explains how social structures shape people's lives, beliefs, and values, and how individuals and groups respond to social problems and challenges. Sociology also explores the interrelationships between different social systems and how they affect each other. Overall, sociology provides a scientific perspective on the social world and offers insights into the complexities of human behavior, culture, and society.
