The typical speed that axons send their electrical signals varies widely depending on factors such as the size and myelination of the axon and the type of signal being sent. However, typically, myelinated axons in the human body can transmit signals at speeds ranging from 30 to 120 meters per second (or 67 to 268 miles per hour). Unmyelinated axons tend to be slower, with signal speeds ranging from 0.5 to 10 meters per second (or 1 to 22 miles per hour).
