In many historical societies, there were various acts or systems that determined what class a citizen belonged to. For example, in feudal Europe, a person's social class was determined by their birth or family lineage. In India, the caste system determined a person's social status based on their occupation and birth. In ancient Rome, citizenship was originally granted only to free-born men who were descendants of Roman citizens, while slaves and women were excluded from citizenship. Overall, the specific act or system used to determine social class varied depending on the society and historical time period.
