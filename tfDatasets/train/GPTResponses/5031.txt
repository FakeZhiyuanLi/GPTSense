One large animal that travels from one pole to the other is the humpback whale. These whales migrate annually from their summer feeding grounds in the polar waters to their winter breeding and calving grounds in the tropical waters, covering a distance of up to 8,000 km. Other large animals such as seals, walruses, and polar bears also migrate across the poles.
