According to Sunni Hadith, it is reported that all male members of the Banu Qurayza tribe who had reached puberty were beheaded after surrendering to Muhammad and his followers. The women and children were taken as captives. However, there are different opinions and interpretations about this incident among scholars and historians. Some believe that the punishment was harsh and unjustified, while others argue that the tribe had committed treachery and violated their treaty with the Muslims.
