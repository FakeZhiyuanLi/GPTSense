The statement that Hipparchus created the first systematic star map is a well-established fact in the history of astronomy and is widely accepted by scholars and researchers. While it is difficult to attribute this statement to a single person, many historians of astronomy, including Sir Thomas Heath, Otto Neugebauer, and Gerald Toomer, have all written about Hipparchus and his contributions to the field, including his pioneering work on star cataloging and mapping.
