to prioritize for encoding with more accuracy. This decision is typically based on the specific requirements and priorities of the application or system using the encoded data. Factors that may be considered include the perceptual importance of different frequency bands, the potential for masking effects between adjacent bands, the desired level of compression, the available bandwidth or storage capacity, and the target codec or playback device. Ultimately, the encoder's goal is to strike a balance between maximizing the fidelity and perceptual quality of the encoded audio while minimizing the bit rate and computational complexity required.
