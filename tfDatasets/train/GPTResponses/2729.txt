If a tree starts forming heartwood right away, its sapwood layer will be thick. This is because sapwood is responsible for carrying water and nutrients from the roots to the leaves, and a thick sapwood layer is necessary to support the growth and development of the tree. As the tree gets older, the heartwood continues to grow and expand, eventually overtaking the sapwood and becoming the primary structural component of the tree. Over time, the sapwood layer may shrink and become thinner, as the tree becomes more efficient at transporting water and nutrients.
