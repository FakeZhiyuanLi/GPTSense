Gladstone resigned as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom for several reasons. One of the primary reasons was his failure to persuade Parliament to support his Irish Home Rule Bill, which aimed to give Ireland greater autonomy and lessen tensions between the Irish and British. Additionally, Gladstone was aging and facing health issues, making it difficult for him to continue leading the government. Finally, he was facing increasing opposition within his own party, particularly from Joseph Chamberlain, who disagreed with Gladstone's policies on Home Rule and other issues. All of these factors led to Gladstone's decision to resign in 1894.
