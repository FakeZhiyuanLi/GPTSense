Truman Capote and Harper Lee were childhood friends and grew up in the same small town of Monroeville, Alabama. Capote lived with his aunts next door to Lee's family home and the two spent much of their time together exploring the town and neighboring countryside. As adults, Capote remained close to Lee and even dedicated his famous book "In Cold Blood" to her.
