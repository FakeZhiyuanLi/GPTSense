is known as the "law of cause and effect." It suggests that what we do now will affect what happens to us in the future. Every action we take, every decision we make, every word we speak has a ripple effect that can impact the lives of others and ourselves. The concept of karma encourages us to act in ways that will bring positive outcomes in the future and to avoid actions that could result in negative consequences.
