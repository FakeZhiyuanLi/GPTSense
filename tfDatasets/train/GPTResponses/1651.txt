Usually, coat of arms are granted by heraldic authorities or by monarchs. In many countries, the granting of a coat of arms is a formal process overseen by a heraldic authority, such as the College of Arms in England or the Lord Lyon King of Arms in Scotland. In other countries, such as Sweden, the coat of arms is granted by the national government. In some cases, individuals may design their own coat of arms and register it with a heraldic authority, but this is less common.
