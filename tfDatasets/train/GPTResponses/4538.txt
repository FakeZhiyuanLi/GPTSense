One major source of copper in modern times is mining. Copper is typically found in various types of rocks and ores, which are mined and processed to extract the copper. Large-scale copper mining operations exist around the world, including in countries such as Chile, Peru, Indonesia, the United States, and Australia. Additionally, recycled copper from scrap and waste materials is also an important source of copper in modern times, as the metal can be easily reused and repurposed.
