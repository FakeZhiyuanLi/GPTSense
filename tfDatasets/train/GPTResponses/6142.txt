Non-Muslims in the Umayyad period paid a tax called jizya, which was a poll tax levied on adult males who were not Muslims. This tax was collected from dhimmis, who were citizens of the Islamic state but were not eligible for military service or holding high government positions. The jizya tax was assessed based on the wealth of each individual and could be paid in either cash or goods. The purpose of the tax was to provide financial support for the Islamic state and to ensure the protection of non-Muslims within the Islamic empire.
