Sexual orientation is argued as a concept related to an individual's persistent pattern of emotional, romantic, and sexual attractions towards people of a particular gender or a range of gender identities. It is considered to be an intrinsic and immutable aspect of a person's identity and is not a choice or a behavior that can be changed or controlled. Sexual orientation can be experienced across a spectrum ranging from heterosexual (attractions towards the opposite gender) to homosexual (attractions towards the same gender) to bisexual (attractions towards both genders) and others, such as pansexual or asexual.
