Grain is first steeped in water to activate the enzymes within it. It is then drained and allowed to germinate in a controlled environment, usually for three to five days. During germination, the grain starts to sprout and produce enzymes, which break down the starches in the grain into simple sugars. This is because the enzymes are necessary for the germination process.Once enough enzymatic activity is present, the germinated grain is dried in a kiln, which halts germination and also imparts flavor and color to the grain. The drying process is done at a specific temperature and for a specific amount of time, depending on the desired malt style. The finished product is malted grain or simply malt. The malt can then be used in brewing or distilling processes to produce a range of different drinks.
