The sudden extinction of many of the elms in New Haven was caused by Dutch elm disease, a fungal disease spread by bark beetles that infects the vascular system of elm trees and causes them to wilt, turn yellow, and die. The disease first appeared in the northeastern United States in the 1920s and by the 1950s had devastated the elm population. The elms of New Haven became symbolic of the disease's impact and the city's efforts to combat it.
