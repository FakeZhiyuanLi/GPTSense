The food processing industry also influences political decisions in areas such as food safety regulations, labeling requirements, trade agreements, and environmental regulations. They may push for more relaxed regulations in order to reduce their costs and increase profits, or to prevent competition from entering the market. They may also lobby for trade agreements that benefit their industry and push for environmental policies that are favorable to their operations. Additionally, the food processing industry may have an impact on government policies related to labor rights, as they often employ large numbers of workers in low-wage positions.
