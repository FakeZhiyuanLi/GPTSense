Doctors often wear personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gowns, gloves, masks, and face shields to protect themselves and their surroundings from infectious diseases. These items create a barrier between the doctor and any viruses or bacteria that may be present in the environment or on patients. The specific type of PPE worn may vary depending on the type of procedure being done, the level of risk of transmission, and the specific recommendations of the healthcare facility.
