By the 19th century, tourism had become common in the Alpine regions. The mountains had long been a destination for artists and adventurers seeking inspiration and challenge, but as travel became easier and more affordable, the Alps became popular among a wider range of tourists. The development of ski resorts and mountain railways in the late 19th and early 20th centuries further contributed to the growth of tourism in the region. Agriculture and forestry also remained important industries in the Alpine regions during the 19th century.
