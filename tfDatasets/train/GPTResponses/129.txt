The first British Empire was based on trade and the acquisition of colonies for economic benefit. The British established trading posts and colonies around the world, including in North America, the Caribbean, Africa, and India, in order to control valuable resources and markets for their goods. These colonies were also used as a source of cheap labor and raw materials to fuel the Industrial Revolution in Britain.
