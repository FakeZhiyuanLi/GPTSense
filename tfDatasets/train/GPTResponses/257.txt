The catalog of contents of a particular species' genetic makeup is its genome. It consists of all the DNA of a species, including all the genes and non-coding regions. The genome is the blueprint that determines the characteristics and traits of an organism, including its physical appearance, behavior, and susceptibility to disease. Genome sequencing has become a powerful tool in understanding the biology of organisms and developing new treatments for human illnesses.
