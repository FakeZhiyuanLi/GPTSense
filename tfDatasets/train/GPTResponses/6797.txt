A possible cause of copyright infringement is the unauthorized use or reproduction of copyrighted material, such as music, images, or written content, without obtaining permission from the owner of the copyright. This can occur when individuals or businesses download, copy, or distribute copyrighted material without proper authorization, or when they create derivative works based on copyrighted material without permission. Other causes of copyright infringement may include the failure to properly attribute the source of copyrighted material, or the violation of licensing agreements or terms of use.
