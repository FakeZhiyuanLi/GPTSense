The Congress of Vienna established the Concert of Europe, which included the major European powers of the time (Austria, Prussia, Russia, and Britain) as a means of maintaining peace and stability on the continent. This group could be considered the "police of Europe" as they worked together to prevent conflict and address issues that could potentially lead to war.
