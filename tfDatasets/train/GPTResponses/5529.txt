Queen Elizabeth II currently holds the record as the longest-serving head of state in the world. However, there are a few leaders who have served longer than her. For example, King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand served for 70 years until his death in 2016, and Jos√© Eduardo dos Santos was the President of Angola for 38 years before stepping down in 2017.
