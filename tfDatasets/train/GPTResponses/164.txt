There is no specific law that justified British imperialism. British imperialism was mainly justified by the belief in the superiority of British culture and values, and the idea that it was the mission of the British Empire to spread those values to the rest of the world. Some argued that colonization was necessary to provide economic benefits and security for both Britain and the colonies. However, the actions of the British Empire were often at odds with these justifications, and many people today see imperialism as a shameful and exploitative period in history.
