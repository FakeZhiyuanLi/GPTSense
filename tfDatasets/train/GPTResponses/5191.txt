The new testament book that provides a basis for the term queen when referring to Mary is the Book of Revelation. In Revelation 12:1-5, Mary is described as a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and a crown of twelve stars on her head. This image is often interpreted to symbolize Mary as the queen of heaven.
