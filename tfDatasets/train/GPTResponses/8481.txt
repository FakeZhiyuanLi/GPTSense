Unicode defines four mapping methods:1. The default mapping method, which maps characters to their Unicode scalar values.2. The normalization mapping method, which maps equivalent sequences of characters to a single canonical equivalent sequence (e.g. combining characters with their base characters).3. The case mapping method, which maps characters to their uppercase or lowercase equivalents based on the Unicode standard.4. The bidi (bidirectional) mapping method, which maps characters to their directional properties, such as left-to-right, right-to-left, or neutral, for proper display and handling of bidirectional text.
