Behavioral science uses the following terms instead of using a gender binary conceptualization:1. Gender identity: this refers to an individual's sense of their own gender, which may or may not correspond to the sex they were assigned at birth.2. Gender expression: this refers to the way an individual presents themselves to the world, which may or may not conform to traditional gender stereotypes.3. Gender roles: this refers to the social and cultural expectations placed on individuals based on their perceived gender identity.4. Gender non-conforming: this refers to individuals who do not conform to traditional gender norms in terms of their gender identity, expression, or roles.5. Non-binary: this refers to individuals who do not identify as exclusively male or female.6. Transgender: this refers to individuals whose gender identity does not match the sex they were assigned at birth.7. Intersex: this refers to individuals born with sex characteristics that do not fit typical male or female categories.Using these terms avoids binary gender assumptions, acknowledges the diversity of gender identities and expressions, and emphasizes individual autonomy and agency in constructing one's own gender identity.
