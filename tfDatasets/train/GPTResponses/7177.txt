Charcoal is made by heating wood or other organic material in a low-oxygen environment. The process of making charcoal involves the following steps:1. Collection of wood or other organic material: The first step in making charcoal is to collect wood or other organic material such as coconut shells or sawdust.2. Building a charcoal kiln: A kiln is constructed from bricks or other heat-resistant material. It is a closed structure with a small opening to allow smoke and gases to escape.3. Loading the kiln: The wood or organic material is loaded into the kiln. The wood is arranged in a stack around a central pole, leaving a small opening at the top.4. Ignition: The wood is ignited through the opening at the top of the kiln. The fire is allowed to burn for a short period of time, consuming the oxygen inside the kiln and creating a low-oxygen environment.5. Covering the kiln: Once the wood has caught fire, the opening at the top of the kiln is covered with a lid or other material to seal it off completely. This prevents oxygen from entering the kiln and helps the wood to burn evenly.6. Cooking: The wood is allowed to cook slowly in the kiln for several hours. As the wood burns, it releases gases and other volatile compounds, which are pushed out of the wood by the heat.7. Extinguishing the fire: After several hours of cooking, the fire is extinguished by removing the lid and allowing cool air to enter the kiln.8. Removing the charcoal: The charcoal is removed from the kiln once it has cooled down. It is then sorted, graded, and packaged for use in various industries.
