The form of federalism that is characterized by where sovereignty resides in the whole is known as dual federalism or layer cake federalism. This form of federalism was prevalent in the United States during the 19th century, and it emphasized a strict separation of powers between the federal government and the state governments. In dual federalism, the states were seen as separate and independent entities that were not subject to the direct control of the federal government. This form of federalism also emphasized a limited role for the federal government in the affairs of the states, with most powers and responsibilities left to the states themselves.
