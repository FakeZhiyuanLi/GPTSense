Incandescent lights have superior color rendering because they produce a continuous spectrum of light, which includes all colors of the rainbow in a balanced way. This means that they are able to accurately reproduce colors as they would appear in natural daylight, without any distortions or color shifts.In contrast, LED and fluorescent lights produce light through a different process that can result in gaps or peaks in their light spectrum, which can cause certain colors to appear washed out or distorted. This is why incandescent lights are often preferred for applications where color accuracy is important, such as in photography or interior design.
