Concrete marked the Cubism influence in architecture. The use of reinforced concrete allowed architects to create more innovative forms and shapes, and the emphasis on geometric shapes, angles, and planes became a hallmark of the style. This new material also allowed for greater structural freedom and larger, more open interior spaces. The use of concrete in architecture became increasingly popular during the early 20th century, coinciding with the rise of Cubism in the visual arts.
