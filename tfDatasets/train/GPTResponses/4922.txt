The main objectives of establishing the City and Guilds College were to provide education and training for skilled artisans and engineers in the fields of science and technology. The College was founded in 1878, and it aimed to offer practical courses for tradespeople and mechanics who were seeking to enhance their skills and knowledge. The College also aimed to promote technical education and research, and to foster a culture of innovation and creativity among its students. The College has since evolved into the City and Guilds of London Institute, a leading provider of vocational education and training across the globe.
