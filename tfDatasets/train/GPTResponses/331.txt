The energy consumption of an HVAC system in residential locations varies depending on several factors such as the size of the home, the efficiency rating of the system, the outside temperature and humidity, and the user's habits. However, according to the US Department of Energy, the average residential central air conditioning system uses about 3,500 watts of power or consumes around 1.5 kWh per hour of operation. The heating system, on the other hand, can consume about 500 to 1,500 watts or 0.5 to 1.5 kWh per hour. It is important to note that regular maintenance and upgrading to energy-efficient equipment can significantly reduce energy consumption and cost.
