The Soviet Union, like many other countries, began developing transformers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. One of the earliest Soviet transformer manufacturers was the Moscow-based Electrical Engineering Institute, which was founded in 1922. However, transformer technology had already been widely studied and used in the Soviet Union before this time, as part of efforts to modernize the country's infrastructure and industries.
