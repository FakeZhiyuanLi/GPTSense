The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations is one agency that is working to make the trade of pesticides safer through its International Code of Conduct on Pesticide Management. The code provides guidance on safe use, handling, storage, transport, and disposal of pesticides to reduce risks to human health and the environment. It also promotes integrated pest management techniques and alternative non-chemical methods to reduce reliance on pesticides.
