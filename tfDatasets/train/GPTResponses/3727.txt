The Late Triassic is known to have had hot and dry climatic conditions with high levels of CO2 in the atmosphere. This caused extensive deserts and arid landmasses to form, with sporadic oases and dry riverbeds. The climate was also characterized by intense monsoonal rains and intermittent flooding. The Late Triassic was also characterized by large-scale volcanic eruptions and tectonic activity that influenced the climate, ocean currents, and sea level fluctuations. These conditions created a diverse range of habitats that supported a rich ecosystem of plants and animals, including early dinosaurs.
