Maryam, the mother of Prophet Isa (Jesus), was visited by an angel in sura 19 (Maryam) of the Qur'an. The angel informed her that she would conceive a son, despite being a virgin, by the will of Allah (God). This event is known as the Annunciation and is a fundamental part of Christian and Islamic beliefs.
