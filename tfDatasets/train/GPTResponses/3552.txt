The electrical properties of neurons are controlled by the movement of ions across the neuronal cell membrane, which is regulated by ion channels and other membrane proteins. Specifically, voltage-gated ion channels and ligand-gated ion channels play prominent roles in controlling the membrane potential and electrical signaling of neurons. Additionally, the spatial distribution of ion channels and other membrane proteins also contribute to the electrical properties of neurons, as they help determine the shape and direction of neuronal signals.
