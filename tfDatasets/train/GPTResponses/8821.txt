Linguists generally agree that modern Czech originated in the late 18th and early 19th centuries when there was a movement towards standardization and the creation of a written language. This period saw the influence of Czech scholars and writers such as Josef Dobrovsk√Ω and Josef Jungmann, who sought to establish a unified Czech language and standardize grammar, vocabulary, and spelling. The publication of Jungmann's Czech-German dictionary in 1835 was a landmark event in the development of modern Czech.
