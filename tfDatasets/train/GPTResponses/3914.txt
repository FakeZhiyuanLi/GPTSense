One example of demonstrated equipment controlled by computers not connected to the internet that can also be vulnerable is air-gapped industrial control systems (ICS) used in critical infrastructure such as power plants, water treatment facilities, and transportation systems. These systems are designed to be isolated from the internet to prevent cyber-attacks. However, sophisticated malware like Stuxnet and Industroyer have proven that even air-gapped systems can be compromised through other means such as USB devices, human error, and physical access. Once inside, attackers can manipulate the system and cause physical damage or disruptions to essential services.
