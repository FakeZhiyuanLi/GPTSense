The debate between Huxley and Owen concerning humans and apes is commonly referred to as the "Great Ape Debate." The debate centered around the question of whether humans were related to apes and, if so, what the implications of that relationship were for human evolution and morality.Huxley argued that humans were closely related to apes and that this relationship provided evidence for the theory of evolution. He also argued that there was no inherent difference between humans and apes that would justify treating humans as superior or more valuable than other animals.Owen, on the other hand, argued that humans were fundamentally different from apes and that there was no evidence to support the idea that humans had evolved from apes. He also argued that humans were morally superior to other animals and that this superiority justified their exploitation of the natural world.The debate helped to popularize the theory of evolution and sparked a broader debate about the relationship between humans and other animals. Despite the controversy it generated at the time, the idea that humans are closely related to apes is now widely accepted among scientists and the general public.
