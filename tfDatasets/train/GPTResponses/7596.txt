After the war ended, Nasser continued to work towards Arab unity and independence. He introduced a number of social and economic reforms aimed at eradicating poverty and improving the standard of living in Egypt. He also nationalized a number of industries including banking, insurance, and foreign trade. In addition, he continued to support and fund guerrilla movements in other Arab states fighting against colonialism and foreign domination. Nasser remained a key figure in Arab politics until his death in 1970.
