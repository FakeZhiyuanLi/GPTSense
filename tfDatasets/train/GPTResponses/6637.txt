The commerce and spending clauses of the Constitution began allowing federal power to expand in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In the landmark case of Gibbons v. Ogden (1824), the Supreme Court upheld the federal government's power to regulate interstate commerce. However, it was not until the New Deal era in the 1930s that the Supreme Court began interpreting the commerce clause in a way that enabled the federal government to regulate a wide range of economic activity, including labor relations, agricultural production, and environmental protection. The spending clause has also been interpreted broadly to give the federal government significant power to fund various programs and initiatives.
