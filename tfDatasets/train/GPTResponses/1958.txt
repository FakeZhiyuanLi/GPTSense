Chalets are typically found in mountainous and snowy regions where they are used as traditional alpine homes. These regions include the Swiss Alps, the French Alps, the Austrian Alps, and the Italian Alps. The use of chalets for roof construction can also be found in areas with similar climate conditions, such as Canada and parts of the United States.
