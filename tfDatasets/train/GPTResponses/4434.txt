Jean Piaget believed that cognitive development during adolescence involves the ability to think abstractly and hypothetically. He proposed that during this stage, individuals move from concrete operational thinking to formal operational thinking, which involves the ability to reason logically and systematically about abstract concepts and hypothetical situations. Piaget also suggested that adolescents are capable of engaging in metacognition, or thinking about their own thinking, and can introspectively analyze their thoughts and beliefs. Overall, Piaget viewed adolescence as a time of significant cognitive growth and development.
