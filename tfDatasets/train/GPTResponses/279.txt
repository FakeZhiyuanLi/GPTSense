Samsara is a Sanskrit term used in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism that refers to the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. It is believed that all sentient beings are trapped in this continuous cycle of existence, propelled by karma (actions and consequences), and the desire for material and sensory pleasures. According to the concept of samsara, the cycle of rebirth continues until one achieves liberation or enlightenment (nirvana) through spiritual practices and detachment from worldly desires.
