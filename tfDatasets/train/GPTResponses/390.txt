Solar energy comes from the sun. It is produced by nuclear fusion reactions that occur within the sun's core, where hydrogen atoms combine to form helium and release vast amounts of energy in the form of photons. These photons then travel through space until they reach Earth, where they can be harnessed and converted into usable energy using solar panels.
