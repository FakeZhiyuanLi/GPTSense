The India Gate commemorates the sacrifice of 70,000 Indian soldiers who died in the service of the British Empire during World War I and the Third Anglo-Afghan War. A flame burns underneath the gate which is known as the Amar Jawan Jyoti, or the Flame of the Immortal Soldier, in memory of the soldiers who lost their lives in the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971.
