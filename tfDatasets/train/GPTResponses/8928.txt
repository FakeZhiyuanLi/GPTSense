The standard Czech dialect, also known as Common Czech, is currently gaining ground in journalism and the mass media. This dialect is based on the Prague dialect and is considered to be the most widely understood and accepted form of Czech language. It is characterized by a relatively neutral pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary, with an emphasis on clarity, simplicity, and correctness. It is used in all official documents, news broadcasts, and written publications, as well as in formal settings such as business, academia, and government. Other regional dialects may still be used in some types of media or contexts, but Common Czech is generally the norm.
