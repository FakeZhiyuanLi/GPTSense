The capacity of a cell in a computer's memory depends on the architecture and design of the computer's memory system. It can range from 8 bits (1 byte) to 64 bits or more. Consequently, the number of numbers a cell can hold can vary greatly, depending on the size of the data type being stored in the cell. For example, a 32-bit cell can hold values ranging from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647, while a 64-bit cell can store much larger values.
