There is no record or information available on any compositions composed by Athanasius while he lived as a monk. Athanasius (c. 296-373) was a prominent theologian and bishop in the early Christian church, known for his role in the Council of Nicaea and for his writings defending orthodox Christianity against the Arian heresy. However, there is no evidence that he was a composer or musician.
