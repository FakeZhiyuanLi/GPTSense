Interaction ritual theory was derived from Durkheim's work on the sociology of religion, specifically his study of the collective effervescence that occurs during religious rituals. Durkheim argued that during rituals, individuals become part of a group consciousness in which they experience a heightened sense of emotion and solidarity. This experience is what he called "collective effervescence," and it is the basis for his theory of social integration. Interaction ritual theory builds on this concept by examining how social interactions contribute to the creation and maintenance of shared beliefs, norms, and values in group settings.
