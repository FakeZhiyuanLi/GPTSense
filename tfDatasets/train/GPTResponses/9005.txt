The Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) was the first group to openly oppose the Soviet government in Russia. The RSDLP split into two factions, the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks, with the Bolsheviks later becoming the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The Mensheviks continued to oppose the Soviet government and were eventually suppressed by the Bolsheviks.
