The Hindu society has a four-tiered caste system known as the Varna system. The four castes are:1. Brahmins (Priests and scholars)2. Kshatriyas (Warriors and rulers)3. Vaishyas (Merchants, businessmen, and traders)4. Shudras (Laborers and service providers)Below the four castes are the Dalits or untouchables, who were historically considered to be outside the caste system and were considered to be the lowest of the low in social hierarchy. However, the Indian Constitution abolished untouchability and made discrimination against Dalits illegal.
