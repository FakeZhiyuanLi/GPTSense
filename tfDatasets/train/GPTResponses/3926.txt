James believed that a stimulus, such as an event or situation, acted upon the body to produce physiological changes which then created the experience of an emotion. For example, a person might feel their heart racing and their palms sweating when they encounter a frightening situation, such as a spider crawling on them. This physiological response would then lead to the experience of fear or anxiety.
