Minerals are acquired by the roots of plants in the form of ions (charged particles). These ions are present in the soil solution and are absorbed by the root hairs through a process called active transport. The plant uses energy to actively transport specific ions from the soil solution into the root hair cells. Once inside the root, the minerals are transported to other parts of the plant through the xylem and phloem.
