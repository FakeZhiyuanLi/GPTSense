The Norsemen (Vikings) provided the monastery with plunder, such as valuables, goods, and livestock they had taken from nearby villages and towns. In some cases, they would also provide protection to the monastery in exchange for tribute payments or other forms of compensation. However, not all interactions between the Norsemen and the monastery were hostile, as some Norsemen even converted to Christianity and became devout monks themselves.
