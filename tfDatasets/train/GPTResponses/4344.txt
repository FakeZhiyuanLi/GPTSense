When European countries entered the war, Britain lost the advantage of being the only major military power in the conflict. The entering of other countries on both sides of the conflict meant that it was no longer a limited war that could be won swiftly, and Britain was forced to spend significant resources to maintain its position. Additionally, as the war went on, Britain had to contend with multiple fronts, including conflict in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, stretching its resources even further.
