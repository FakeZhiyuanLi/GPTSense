?One piece of evidence is the fact that German pilgrims and merchants brought various items with them to Jerusalem, such as coins, textiles, and other luxury goods. These goods were often sold or traded in the city, and some of them have been found in archaeological excavations, indicating the presence of a German community in the area. Additionally, some German travelers and chroniclers wrote about their experiences in Jerusalem, describing the sights and customs they encountered there, further attesting to the presence of Germans in the city.
