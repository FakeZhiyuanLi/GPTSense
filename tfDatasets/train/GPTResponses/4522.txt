The American priority in mobilization prior to entering World War II was to provide economic and military aid to its allies in Europe in order to help them defeat Nazi Germany. This began with the Lend-Lease Act in March 1941, which allowed the United States to lend or lease arms and supplies to any country deemed "vital to the defense of the United States." The United States also began to increase its military spending, build up its armed forces, and prepare for the possibility of war. However, it wasn't until the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, that the United States officially entered World War II.
