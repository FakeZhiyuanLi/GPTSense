The periodontal ligament, which is a network of nerve fibers and connective tissue, enables proprioception in human teeth. The periodontal ligament helps to anchor teeth into the jawbone and also provides sensory feedback to the brain about the position and movement of the teeth. This feedback is important for activities such as biting and chewing, as well as for maintaining proper alignment and spacing of the teeth.
