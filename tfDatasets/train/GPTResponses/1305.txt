Historically, birds may have learned their migration routes through a combination of genetic predisposition and observational learning from adults in the flock. However, today, scientists still study these processes and have found that birds can also use a variety of environmental and celestial cues, such as the position of the sun and stars, Earth's magnetic field, and topographical features, to navigate during migration.
