The frame size or frame rate parameter specification cannot be dropped in general, as they are essential parameters for defining the resolution and quality of a video. However, depending on the context, these parameters may be assumed or known to the users, and therefore do not need to be explicitly specified. For example, if a user is working within a specific video format, such as 1080p or 4K, the frame size and rate are already defined and do not need to be specified every time. Similarly, if a user is working with a video that is part of a series or project with a consistent format, the frame size and rate can be assumed to be the same for all videos in that project.
