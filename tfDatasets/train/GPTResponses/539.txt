The process in which beings go through cycles of lifetimes in many forms of sentient life is known as reincarnation or rebirth. In this process, it is believed that the soul or consciousness of an individual survives physical death and is reborn in a new form. This cycle of birth, death, and rebirth is thought to continue until the soul achieves liberation or enlightenment, breaking free from the cycle of suffering known as samsara. The specific beliefs and practices associated with reincarnation vary among different religious and cultural traditions.
