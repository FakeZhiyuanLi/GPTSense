A colonist far from the Mediterranean and low in social rank would be more likely to engage in manual labor or agricultural work, as those were the main sources of income in colonial societies. They would have little access to education and professional training, which would limit their opportunities for upward mobility. They would also be more prone to exploitation and poor living conditions, as their social status and lack of resources would make them vulnerable to the demands of their superiors.
