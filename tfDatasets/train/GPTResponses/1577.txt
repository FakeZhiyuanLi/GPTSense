The era in history that saw local government begin setting up county councils in the area was the late 19th and early 20th century. This was a period of significant reform in local government in many countries, including the United Kingdom, United States, and Canada. In the UK, the Local Government Act of 1888 established county councils with powers and responsibilities for a wide range of local services, such as roads, public health, and education. This was followed by further reforms in subsequent decades, which expanded local government powers and made it more democratic and accountable to local communities.
