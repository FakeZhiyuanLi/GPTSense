The Devanagari script became prevalent around the 12th century AD in various parts of India, particularly in Northern India. It was developed from earlier Brahmi scripts and was greatly influenced by the Sanskrit language. Today, it is the primary script used for Hindi, Marathi, Nepali, and other languages in the Indian subcontinent.
