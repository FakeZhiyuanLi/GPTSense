developmental stageIdentity diffusion, foreclosure, and crisis are categories of the identity development stage, specifically during adolescence and young adulthood. It is during this stage that individuals begin to explore and establish their sense of identity, and each of these categories represents different ways in which individuals navigate this process. Identity diffusion refers to a lack of exploration or commitment to a particular identity. Foreclosure refers to a premature commitment to an identity without exploring other options. And crisis refers to a period of active exploration and questioning of one's identity before making a commitment.
