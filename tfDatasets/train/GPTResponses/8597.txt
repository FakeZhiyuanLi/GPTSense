The main belief of conflict theory is that society is characterized by inequality and competition for scarce resources, leading to conflict and tension between different social groups. Conflict theorists argue that the dominant group uses its power and influence to maintain their position of privilege, while exploiting and oppressing the subordinate groups. In this perspective, conflict and struggle are seen as necessary for social change and progress towards a more just and equal society.
