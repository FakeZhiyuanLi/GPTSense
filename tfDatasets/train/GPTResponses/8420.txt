Historians have noted that naturalists generally believed that variations in a species were the result of environmental factors and adaptation to different environments. They saw these variations as evidence of the natural order of things and did not necessarily view them as evidence of evolution or genetic differences. However, some naturalists did recognize the possibility that certain traits could be inherited and passed down through generations. Overall, naturalists were generally interested in observing and understanding the natural world and the variations that existed within it.
