The Celtic tribes mined a range of minerals including iron, gold, silver, tin, lead, copper, and coal. They were skilled miners and their mines were located throughout their territories, which extended across much of present-day Europe. They used the minerals they extracted from their mines to create a range of metal objects and tools.
