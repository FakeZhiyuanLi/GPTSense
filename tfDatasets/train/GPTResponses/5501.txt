The famous incident involving the German pocket battleship took place in the South Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Uruguay on December 13, 1939. The German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee engaged with three British battle cruisers - HMS Exeter, HMS Ajax, and HMS Achilles - in what is known as the Battle of the River Plate. The Admiral Graf Spee was eventually scuttled by its crew after sustaining significant damage.
