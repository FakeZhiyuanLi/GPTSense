Portuguese wines have been gaining international recognition in recent years, although the country has a long history of wine production dating back to ancient times. In the past few decades, Portuguese winemakers have been actively improving their production techniques and focusing on quality over quantity. This has led to international recognition, with several Portuguese wines receiving awards and high ratings from wine critics and publications. Some examples of internationally recognized Portuguese wines include Port, Douro, Vinho Verde, Alentejo, and DÃ£o.
