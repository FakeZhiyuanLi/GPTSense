It is not possible to give a definitive answer to this question without knowing the length of the audio file being created. However, assuming an audio file of standard length (around 3 to 5 minutes), a 128 kbit/s audio file would be approximately 2-3 MB in size.A standard audio CD can hold up to 700 MB of data, so a single audio CD could hold roughly 200-350 128 kbit/s audio files.
