The American Psychological Association (APA) distinguishes between different types of sources in academic writing, including:1. Journal articles: Peer-reviewed research articles published in academic journals which use empirical methods to present new findings in a particular field.2. Books: Scholarly books written by experts in the field, which may review existing research or present new theories and ideas.3. Chapters in edited books: Chapters written by various authors in a single book covering a specific topic, often published by academic presses.4. Conference proceedings: Papers presented at academic conferences by researchers in a specific field, often including unpublished research.5. Research reports: Technical reports of empirical research that have not been peer-reviewed for publication in an academic journal, often published by government agencies or research organizations.The APA emphasizes the importance of properly citing sources in academic writing to avoid plagiarism and to provide credit to the authors of the original research.
