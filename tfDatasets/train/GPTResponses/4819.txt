Helicopters use their rotors, which rotate around a vertical axis to create lift and hover in a stationary position, to move over the flight deck and land vertically. This allows them to take off and land on small, confined spaces without the need for a runway. The pilot can control the lift and direction of the helicopter by adjusting the angle of the rotors. Additionally, helicopters have specialized landing gear that allows them to secure to the flight deck to prevent movement during high winds.
