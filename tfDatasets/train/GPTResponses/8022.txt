Ibn al-Haytham had proof for his theory of optics, which explained how light travels in straight lines and is reflected off surfaces, and how vision works through the formation of images on the retina of the eye. He demonstrated this through experiments and observations, including his famous work with a dark room, a small hole, and a large illuminated object, which became known as the "camera obscura".
