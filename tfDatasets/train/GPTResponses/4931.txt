The unintentional injury of a species that depends on the species it replaces could be caused by:1. Loss of habitat: If the new species takes over the habitat of the original species, it may lead to a loss of habitat for the latter. This can cause the displacement of the original species, leading to lower availability of food and shelter.2. Competition for resources: The new species may compete with the original species for resources such as food, water, and shelter. This can lead to a reduction in the resources available to the original species and could result in a decline in numbers.3. Predation: The new species may eat the original species or its young. This can lead to a decline in the population of the original species.4. Reduced genetic diversity: If the new species is a genetically similar to the original species, it can lead to a reduction in the genetic diversity of the ecosystem. This could impact the health and resilience of the ecosystem.5. Disease transmission: If the new species carries diseases that the original species has not been exposed to, it can lead to a decline in the population of the original species.
