The U.S. government has emphasized a policy of neoliberalism from the 1970s onward. This is characterized by a shift towards free-market economies, deregulation, and privatization, as well as a reduction in government social programs and emphasis on individual responsibility. This policy has been largely supported by both major political parties in the U.S. and has had a significant impact on economic and social policies over the past few decades.
