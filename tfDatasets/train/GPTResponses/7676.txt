The Spanish and Portuguese enslaved most of their black people from Africa. Specifically, they captured and transported millions of Africans from West and Central Africa to the Americas as part of the transatlantic slave trade. The majority were taken from areas that are now modern-day countries such as Nigeria, Senegal, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Cameroon, Angola, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
