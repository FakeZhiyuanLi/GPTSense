The event that is considered to be the start of political modernity is often said to be the Enlightenment in the 18th century. The Enlightenment was a period of intellectual and cultural movement in Europe that emphasized reason, science, and individualism as key values in society. It challenged the authority of the church and the monarchy, and advocated for democratic principles and human rights. The ideas of the Enlightenment laid the foundation for modern political thought and the development of modern political institutions, such as constitutional democracy and the rule of law.
