The intercellular junctions unique to animal cells include tight junctions, adherens junctions, desmosomes, gap junctions, and hemidesmosomes.1. Tight junctions: They are found in epithelial cells and act as a barrier to prevent the movement of substances between cells.2. Adherens junctions: They are responsible for cell-cell adhesion and are found in epithelial and endothelial cells.3. Desmosomes: They are also involved in cell-cell adhesion but are found in tissues that undergo mechanical stress such as the skin, heart, and uterus.4. Gap junctions: They are channels that allow small molecules and ions to pass between cells and are found in cardiac, smooth, and some epithelial cells.5. Hemidesmosomes: They are found in the basement membrane and provide attachment between cells and the extracellular matrix.
