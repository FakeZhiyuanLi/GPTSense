provide enough power to charge devices, especially if the devices require a high amount of power. This can result in slow charging or no charging at all. Some USB host interfaces also do not support every device or file format, which can limit the functionality and compatibility of the device being connected. Additionally, some older USB host interfaces may have slow data transfer rates, which can result in slower file transfers compared to newer interfaces. Finally, some USB host interfaces may be prone to compatibility issues with certain operating systems or device drivers, which can make it difficult to use and troubleshoot connectivity problems.
