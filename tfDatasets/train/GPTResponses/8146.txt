The focus of the Northern Renaissance was on individualism, humanism, and a revival of classical Greek and Roman knowledge and culture. Northern Renaissance artists, writers, and thinkers were more interested in expressing emotions and portraying realism in their work, as opposed to the idealized forms and subjects of the Italian Renaissance. The Northern Renaissance also emphasized religious reform and criticism of the Catholic Church, leading to the Protestant Reformation.
