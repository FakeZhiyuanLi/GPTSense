Henry VIII was trying to avoid the need for parliamentary approval for his decisions and actions. By creating a new procedure for granting assent, Henry VIII could make unilateral decisions without the need for parliamentary approval or input. This gave him greater autonomy and control over the affairs of the kingdom, but it also weakened the power of Parliament and the role of the people in the decision-making process. Additionally, it allowed Henry VIII to bypass traditional legal processes and assert his authority even more so as a monarch.
