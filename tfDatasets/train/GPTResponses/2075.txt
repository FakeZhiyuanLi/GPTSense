it represents or refers to in the world, such as objects, actions, or concepts. This distinction is often referred to as the language-world relationship or the signifier-signified relationship. In other words, language is seen as a system of signs or symbols that represent or stand for something else in the world, with the connection or mapping between the signifier and signified being arbitrary and conventional. This distinction was first proposed by the Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure in the early 20th century and is one of the foundational concepts of modern linguistics.
