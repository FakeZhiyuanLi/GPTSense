Medieval scholars generally viewed the Genesis creation story as literal truth and authoritative scripture. They believed that God created the world in six literal days and rested on the seventh, and that all things were made by God and therefore had a purpose.Many scholars wrote commentaries on Genesis, analyzing everything from the Hebrew language used in the text to the theological implications of the creation story. One of the most famous of these commentaries was written by St. Augustine of Hippo, who believed that the creation story was allegorical and could be interpreted in different ways depending on the context.Medieval scholars also believed that the universe was geocentric, meaning that the Earth was the center of the universe and everything else moved around it. This viewpoint was based on Aristotle's teachings, which were widely accepted in the medieval world.Overall, medieval scholars viewed the Genesis creation story as a theological and philosophical foundation for their understanding of the world and their place in it.
