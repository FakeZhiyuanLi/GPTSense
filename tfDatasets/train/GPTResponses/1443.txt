Antibodies, also known as immunoglobulins, are proteins that are composed of four polypeptide chains. These chains are made up of amino acids and are arranged in a Y-shape. The two longer chains are called heavy chains, and the two shorter chains are called light chains. The heavy chains have a constant region that is identical for all antibodies and a variable region that differs between antibodies. The variable regions are responsible for recognizing and binding to specific antigens. The light chains also have a variable region that contributes to antigen recognition. Together, these chains form the antigen-binding site of the antibody.
