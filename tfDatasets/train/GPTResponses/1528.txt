Aristocrats from the Middle Ages were often buried in churchyards or crypts beneath the church or cathedral where they had worshipped during their lifetime. Some were buried in family tombs or mausoleums within the church or on their property. Others were interred in monasteries or convents that were associated with the family. Additionally, some aristocrats chose to be buried in pilgrimage sites or holy places that were important to them or their family.
