1. Ketones: When glucose levels in the body are low, the liver produces ketones from fat. These molecules can be used by the brain as alternative sources of energy, especially during periods of fasting or a low-carbohydrate diet.2. Lactate: The brain can also use lactate, a byproduct of glucose metabolism, as a source of energy. This is particularly important during times of stress or exercise, when lactate levels increase in the body.3. Fatty acids: The brain can also use fatty acids, which are derived from triglycerides stored in adipose tissue. However, fatty acids cannot cross the blood-brain barrier as easily as glucose or ketones, so they are not a primary source of energy for the brain.4. Amino acids: In certain situations, the brain can use amino acids from dietary protein (such as in a high-protein diet) as a source of energy. However, this process is less efficient than using glucose or ketones.5. Gluconeogenesis: The liver can also produce glucose from non-carbohydrate sources such as amino acids, lactate, and glycerol through a process called gluconeogenesis. This glucose can then be transported to the brain as a source of energy.
