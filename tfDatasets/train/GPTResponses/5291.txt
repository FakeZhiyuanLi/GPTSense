The European Economic Community (EEC) was the precursor to the European Union. It was established by the Treaty of Rome in 1957 and aimed to promote economic integration and cooperation between its member states. The EEC later evolved into the European Union with the creation of the Single European Act in 1986, which aimed to break down trade barriers and create a single market across Europe. Since then, the EU has expanded to include more member states and has taken on additional responsibilities in areas such as foreign policy, security, and environmental regulation.
