All treaties and their amendments must follow the official legal procedures of the United Nations if they are registered with the UN Secretariat in accordance with Article 102 of the UN Charter. This means that they must be deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who will then register the treaty and any subsequent amendments or modifications. Once registered, the treaty becomes part of the UN's database of international agreements and is open to public access. This requirement applies to all treaties that are concluded between two or more states and have an impact on international law.
