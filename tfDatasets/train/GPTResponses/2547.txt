Europeans tried to legitimize their colonial and imperialist activities all over the world by signing treaties with indigenous people. These treaties were meant to establish a legal framework for European claims to land, resources, and sovereignty over the native populations. Europeans often used coercion, violence, and deception to force indigenous peoples to sign these treaties, which were rarely honored or respected. Many of these treaties were based on unequal and unfair terms, which allowed Europeans to take advantage of indigenous peoples and exploit their resources. Despite these treaties, indigenous peoples resisted European colonization and fought to preserve their way of life and their sovereignty.
