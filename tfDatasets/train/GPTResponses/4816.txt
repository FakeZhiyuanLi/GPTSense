It depends on the country. In the United States, the Spanish dollar ceased to be legal tender in 1857. The Mexican peso was never used as legal tender in the United States. In Mexico, the Mexican peso is still legal tender. However, due to inflation, older versions of the peso (such as those issued before 1993) may no longer be accepted as legal tender.
