Darwin's ideas were accepted more readily than Lamarck's because they were based on more extensive scientific research and observation. Darwin spent many years collecting data on the Galapagos Islands, where he observed variations among finches and tortoises that led him to develop his theory of natural selection. Additionally, Darwin's ideas were supported by the emerging field of genetics, which provided evidence for how traits and characteristics are inherited from one generation to the next. In contrast, Lamarck's theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics lacked sufficient evidence and failed to account for how traits were passed down through generations. Additionally, Darwin's theory was more compatible with the prevailing scientific and religious beliefs of his time, making it more palatable to a wider audience.
