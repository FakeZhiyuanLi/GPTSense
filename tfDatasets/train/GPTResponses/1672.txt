The development of the chain termination DNA sequencing method, also known as the Sanger sequencing method, revolutionized the field of DNA sequencing. Before this method was developed, DNA sequencing was a slow and labor-intensive process that involved breaking down the DNA sequence into small fragments and then deducing the sequence by manually piecing together the fragments.The chain termination method made DNA sequencing faster, more accurate, and more efficient. It allowed scientists to determine the sequence of DNA molecules with greater precision and detail, enabling new discoveries in genetics, molecular biology, and other areas of science. The method is still widely used today in research laboratories and other settings, and has paved the way for many important advances in modern biology and medicine.
