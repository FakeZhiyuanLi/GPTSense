The formula you are referring to is known as the Sieve of Eratosthenes, which is based on the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. This theorem states that every integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes, and that this factorization is unique except for the order in which the primes are written. The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a way to identify all the prime numbers up to a certain limit by systematically removing multiples of smaller primes from a list of integers.  So, while the Sieve is not based on a single specific theorem, it relies heavily on the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.
