John Punch was an enslaved African man who lived in the colony of Virginia in the United States during the 17th century. He is known for being the first recorded slave to have attempted to escape from slavery and for being the subject of a landmark court case. In 1640, Punch ran away from his master, along with two white indentured servants. All three were eventually caught and brought before a court, where they were punished severely. Punch was punished by being enslaved for life, making him the first documented African to be legally enslaved for life in Virginia.
