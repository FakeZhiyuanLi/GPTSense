The work describes medicinal plants, their uses, and properties, including information on their preparation, dosage, and potential side effects. It was an essential reference for pharmacists, physicians, and botanists for centuries and is considered one of the most influential works on herbal medicine. It was also an important source for medieval and Renaissance scholars interested in the natural world.
