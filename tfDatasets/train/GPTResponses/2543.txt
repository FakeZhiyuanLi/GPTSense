During the Romantic era, tensions increased about several issues, including:1. Individualism: The Romantic movement embraced individualism and the idea that every person is unique and inherently valuable. This led to tensions with traditional social structures that emphasized conformity and hierarchy.2. Nature vs. Industry: The Romantics celebrated nature and its beauty, in contrast to the growing industrialization of society. This tension manifested in debates over conservation and environmentalism.3. Tradition vs. Innovation: The Romantic era was characterized by a rejection of traditional literary forms and a focus on creativity and experimentation. This led to tensions with conservative literary critics who favored established forms and styles.4. Rationalism vs. Emotion: The Romantics emphasized the importance of emotion, intuition, and imagination, and rejected the Enlightenment emphasis on reason and logic. This led to tensions with proponents of rationalism and scientific inquiry.5. Nationalism vs. Internationalism: The Romantic movement emphasized national identity and cultural heritage, which led to tensions with the growing trend towards internationalism and globalization.
