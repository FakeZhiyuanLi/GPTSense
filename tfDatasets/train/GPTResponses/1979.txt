The main goal of the V&A + RIBA partnership is to create a new museum of architecture and design, which will showcase and celebrate the built environment and its impact on society. The partnership seeks to bring together the collections, expertise and research of both institutions to create a dynamic, interactive and engaging space that will inspire and educate visitors about the history, present and future of architecture and design.
