Precepts: These are moral guidelines that Buddhists follow to live an ethical life, including the Five Precepts (refrain from killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, and drug and alcohol abuse) and the Noble Eightfold Path.5. Offerings: Buddhists offer flowers, incense, and other items to honor the Buddha, his teachings, and other spiritual entities.6. Chanting: Buddhists may chant specific prayers or mantras to achieve mental clarity and invoke blessings.7. Retreats: Buddhists may participate in retreats or pilgrimage to deepen their spiritual practice and connect with the community.
