Sensitivity is shown in the ISO systems through the ISO sensitivity settings or ISO values. ISO sensitivity or ISO speed is a measure of a digital camera's ability to capture light. The higher the ISO value, the more sensitive the camera is to light, and the brighter the image will be. ISO values are typically listed in increments of 100, such as 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, etc. A higher ISO value is generally used in low-light conditions to achieve a brighter image, but it can also result in more image noise or graininess. Conversely, a lower ISO value is used in bright conditions to achieve a better image quality.
