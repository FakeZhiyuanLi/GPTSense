Antarctic meteorites are different from meteorites found in other places because they are easier to find due to the vast, ice-covered landscape that preserves them well. Additionally, the cold, dry climate of Antarctica helps prevent weathering and oxidation, keeping the meteorites in better condition. Antarctic meteorites are also thought to come from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, whereas meteorites found in other locations could come from a variety of sources, including the Moon, Mars, and beyond the solar system.
