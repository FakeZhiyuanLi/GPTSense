The Gothic vault offered a number of structural benefits, including:1. Greater height: Gothic vaults allowed for greater height in buildings because the pointed arches distributed weight more evenly than the rounded arches of Romanesque architecture.2. Greater strength: The pointed arches of the Gothic vault were stronger than the rounded arches of Romanesque architecture, which allowed for thinner and lighter walls, columns, and piers.3. Greater resistance to lateral forces: Gothic vaults were designed to resist lateral forces such as earthquakes and wind, which helped prevent collapses and added stability to the structure.4. More natural light: Gothic vaults incorporated large stained glass windows that allowed more natural light to penetrate the interior space. This meant that the walls, columns, and piers could be thinner and more elegant, while still maintaining structural integrity.
