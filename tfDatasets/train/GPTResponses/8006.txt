One of the primary reasons why the issue of affirmative action lost its momentum was the rise of the conservative movement in the 1980s and 1990s, which challenged the policy as reverse discrimination and pushed for its repeal or scaling back. This led to legal challenges and court decisions that weakened affirmative action programs, making it harder for them to be implemented effectively. This shift in public opinion and political power reduced the momentum and support for affirmative action, leading to its decline in many areas.
