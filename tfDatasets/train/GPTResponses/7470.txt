Communism is a political and economic system that advocates for the elimination of private ownership and the establishment of a classless society where all property and resources are collectively owned and controlled by the community as a whole. The idea of communism was first introduced by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in their book, The Communist Manifesto, published in 1848.The factors that brought about the rise of communism include:1. Industrialization and Capitalism: The rapid industrialization and development of capitalism during the 19th and early 20th centuries led to significant economic and social inequalities. Many workers were exploited and had little control over their lives, leading to widespread poverty and social unrest.2. Political Instability: The prevailing political systems in many countries were corrupt and ineffective, leading to a growing distrust of traditional political institutions.3. Historical Factors: The aftermath of World War I and the Russian Revolution of 1917 created a global environment that was ripe for the spread of communist ideas.4. Social and Intellectual Climate: Intellectuals and social activists who were disillusioned with the status quo began to embrace socialist and communist ideologies as a way to address the problems of industrialization and capitalism.5. The Role of Leaders: Leaders such as Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Zedong were instrumental in the spread of communism, promoting the ideals of economic equality, social justice, and collective ownership of property.
