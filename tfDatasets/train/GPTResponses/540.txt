According to the 22nd Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, no person can be elected to the office of the President more than twice, so the same rule would apply to a mayor. Therefore, if someone serves three consecutive terms as mayor, they must wait at least one full term before running again. This means they must wait a minimum of four years before running again.
