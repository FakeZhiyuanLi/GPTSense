The Russian Empire began to use pan-Slavism as an ideology justifying its territorial conquests, which compromised the movement. Russian leaders saw themselves as the protectors of all Slavic peoples and used this ideology to justify their expansion into neighboring Slavic territories, such as Poland and Ukraine. This expansionism led to tensions with other Slavic nations who saw Russian actions as imperialistic and self-serving rather than genuinely pan-Slavic. As a result, many began to distance themselves from the pan-Slavic movement, and it lost its momentum as a unifying force for Slavic peoples.
