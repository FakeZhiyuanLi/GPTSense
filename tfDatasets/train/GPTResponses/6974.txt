The beginnings of the historical study of Cubism were based on the opinions of art critic Guillaume Apollinaire and art historian Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler. They were the first to recognize the significance of the art movement and to write extensively about the philosophy and techniques behind it. Their writings helped to establish Cubism as a major movement in 20th-century art history.
