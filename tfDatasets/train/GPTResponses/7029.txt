A halogen bulb is typically smaller in size compared to an incandescent bulb. This is because halogen bulbs use a smaller filament to produce the same amount of light as an incandescent bulb, which means they require less space inside the bulb. In addition, halogen bulbs also require a smaller bulb envelope to contain the halogen gas that extends the lifespan of the filament compared to an incandescent bulb.
