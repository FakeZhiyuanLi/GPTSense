The New Haven trial known to be the longest in the history of Connecticut is the Steven Hayes trial. It lasted for seven months and resulted in the death penalty for Hayes, one of the two men convicted for the brutal murders of Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her two daughters during a home invasion in Cheshire, Connecticut in 2007.
