The Berlin Decree was issued by Napoleon on November 21, 1806, and imposed a system of continental blockade against Britain. The decree prohibited European nations from trading with Britain and established strict regulations for neutral nations, which were required to submit to French inspections in order to trade with the continent. The decree was part of Napoleon's strategy to weaken Britain's economy and push it into accepting French supremacy in Europe. The system was eventually expanded with subsequent decrees, but it ultimately proved ineffective in achieving its goals, as British merchants continued to find ways to trade with Europe and maintain their economic power.
