Multielectrode recording allows for the simultaneous recording of the activity of multiple neurons, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of neural circuits and network dynamics. It also provides a means for investigating the interactions between multiple neurons and their collective function in the brain. This technique has become an invaluable tool in neuroscience research, enabling researchers to study the neural basis of behavior and cognition, and helping to advance our understanding of the brain and its functions.
