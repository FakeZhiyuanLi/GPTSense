Housekeeping genes are expressed at relatively constant levels in all cells and are essential for basic cellular functions, such as DNA replication, transcription, and translation. Their expression is consistently required for the maintenance of cellular processes and therefore they are expressed at a higher level than other genes. However, the exact relative level of expression may vary depending on the specific housekeeping gene and the cell type or tissue.
