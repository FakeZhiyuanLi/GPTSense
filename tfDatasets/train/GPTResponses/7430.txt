John Locke's political theory was mainly a response to absolute monarchy and the divine right theory of kingship, which was popular at the time. It is not accurate to say that Locke refuted a specific political theory. Instead, his ideas were influential in the development of classical liberal and democratic theories, and were a direct challenge to traditional notions of absolute monarchy and the divine right of kings.
