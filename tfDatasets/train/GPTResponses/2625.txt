Most biological traits are under genetic influence. Genes are the basic instructions for building and maintaining a living organism, including its physical characteristics and behaviors. However, environmental factors can also play a role in shaping biological traits. For example, a person's height is primarily determined by their genes, but factors such as nutrition and physical activity can also affect their growth and development. Similarly, a person's risk for developing certain diseases is influenced by their genetic makeup, but environmental factors such as exposure to toxins or lifestyle choices such as smoking can also increase their risk. Overall, biological traits are the result of complex interactions between genes and environment.
