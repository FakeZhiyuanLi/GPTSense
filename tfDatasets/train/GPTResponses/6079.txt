The most common breed of geese used for egg production is the Toulouse goose. Other breeds that are good for egg production include the Chinese and the Embden geese. However, it is important to note that geese typically do not lay as many eggs as chickens, and their egg production is highly influenced by environmental factors such as availability of water, food and nesting material.
