There were several constraints that kept HDTV from being widely adopted in the 90s, including:1. High cost: HDTVs were significantly more expensive than traditional TVs, making them unaffordable for many consumers.2. Limited availability: There were only a few channels broadcasting in HD, which limited the content available to viewers.3. Lack of content: There were few movies or TV shows produced in HD, so the added expense of an HDTV was not always justified.4. Technical barriers: HDTV required a different type of transmission format and set of broadcasting equipment, which made it more difficult and expensive for broadcasters to switch to HDTV.5. Bandwidth limitations: The limited bandwidth available for broadcasting meant that broadcasters had to choose between broadcasting HD content or multiple standard definition channels.6. Lack of government support: The US government did not mandate a switch to HDTV until 1996, and even then, the mandate was not fully enforced until 2009. This lack of government support slowed the adoption of HDTV in the marketplace.
