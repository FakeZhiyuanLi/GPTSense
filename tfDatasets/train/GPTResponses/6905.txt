Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque are the main artists who are often credited with starting the Cubist movement, which utilized the flat canvas to break down objects into geometric shapes and experiment with multiple perspectives. They believed that the traditional way of representing space and form in painting was limiting and wanted to create a new way of seeing the world through art.
