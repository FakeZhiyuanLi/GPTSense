The ecumenical movement, which began in the early 20th century, is representative of the ecumenical past. This movement aimed to promote unity and cooperation among different Christian denominations and traditions, with a focus on common beliefs and practices. The movement led to the establishment of interfaith organizations, such as the World Council of Churches, and fostered greater dialogue and understanding between different Christian communities. It continues to influence religious communities across the world and has contributed to efforts to promote peace, justice, and social cohesion.
