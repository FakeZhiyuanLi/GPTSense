The model that describes the opposite of approach as moving away is the avoidance model. It suggests that people have a natural tendency to avoid situations they perceive as unfavorable or threatening. This results in a behavior pattern of moving away from the source of the perceived threat or unease. The avoidance model can be applied in various contexts, including relationships, decision-making, and goal-setting.
