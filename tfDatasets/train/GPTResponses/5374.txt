In finance, Jews became moneylenders and bankers, providing credit and financing to burgeoning European economies. In medicine, Jews were often sought after as physicians and healers, using their knowledge of Jewish medical traditions and Arabic medicine to help cure and treat illnesses. These two fields of work allowed Jews to establish themselves in Frankish society, but also made them easy targets for persecution and discrimination.
