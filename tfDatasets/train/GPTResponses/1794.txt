Microsoft Windows uses a quartz crystal oscillator as its real-time clock source. This oscillator generates a wave of fixed frequency, which is used to keep track of time. The frequency of the oscillator is very stable and accurate, which ensures that the clock keeps accurate time over long periods. The basic time unit is the frequency of the oscillator, which is typically 32.768 kHz.
