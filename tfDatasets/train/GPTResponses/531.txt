Thermal mass is used to keep buildings cool by absorbing and storing excess heat, then releasing it slowly when the air temperature cools down. This is often achieved by incorporating dense, heavy materials like concrete, brick, or stone into the building's structure or inner core. When heat from the sun, appliances, or human occupants enters the building, the thermal mass absorbs and retains the heat, preventing it from raising the indoor temperature. As the air temperature starts to cool, the thermal mass releases the stored heat, maintaining a comfortable and consistent temperature inside the building. This is especially useful in regions with high diurnal temperature ranges or hot and humid climates where air conditioning is not practical. By taking advantage of the natural cooling provided by thermal mass, buildings can reduce their energy consumption and lower their carbon footprint while staying comfortable year-round.
