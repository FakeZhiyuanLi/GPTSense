Heating copper ore materials with silica removes impurities such as iron, oxides, and other non-copper elements. The high temperature causes these impurities to react with silica and form a slag, which is a byproduct of the copper smelting process. The slag is then separated from the copper, leaving behind a more pure form of copper that can be further processed and refined. Removing impurities through heating with silica improves the quality and purity of the final copper product.
