The word Tajik comes from the Persian language and originally referred to the people of the ancient Persian region of Tajikistan. The word became widespread during the Soviet era when Tajikistan became a Soviet republic, and it is now commonly used to describe the ethnic group that is predominant in Tajikistan, as well as minorities in neighboring countries.
