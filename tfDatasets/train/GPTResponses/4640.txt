Benedict's reagent and Fehling's solution are commonly used to detect the presence of reducing sugars in a given sample.Benedict's reagent contains copper sulfate, sodium carbonate, and sodium citrate. When Benedict's reagent is added to a solution containing reducing sugar, it undergoes a chemical reaction with the aldehyde or ketone group present in the sugar. This reaction results in the formation of a red or orange precipitate.Fehling's solution is a mixture of copper sulfate and sodium hydroxide. When Fehling's solution is added to a solution containing reducing sugar, it also undergoes a chemical reaction similar to that with Benedict's reagent. The reaction results in the formation of a red or orange precipitate.In both cases, the intensity of the color of the precipitate formed indicates the concentration of reducing sugar present in the sample. Therefore, the presence of sugar is shown by the formation of the colored precipitate.
