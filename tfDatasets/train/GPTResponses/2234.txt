Many birds migrate along specific routes or flyways, which vary depending on the species and their breeding and wintering locations. Some of the major flyways include the Pacific Flyway, Central Flyway, Mississippi Flyway, and Atlantic Flyway in North America, and the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, African-Eurasian Flyway, and South American Flyway in other parts of the world.
