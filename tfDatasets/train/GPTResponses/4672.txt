During the period between 1866 to 1895, cowboys herded an estimated 10 million cattle from Texas to Kansas along the famous Chisholm Trail. However, the actual number of cattle herded by individual cowboys varied widely based on the size of the cattle drive and the number of cowboys involved. A typical cattle drive might consist of 2,000 to 3,000 head of cattle and employ around 12 to 15 cowboys.
