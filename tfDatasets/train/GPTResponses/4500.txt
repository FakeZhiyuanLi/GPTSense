It is not possible for beer to have a 55% ABV (alcohol by volume) as the maximum ABV for beer is around 20%. A 55% ABV is more characteristic of a distilled spirit such as whiskey or vodka, which is produced through a process of distillation that separates the alcohol from the fermented mash. Therefore, the process of distillation, not beer brewing, can cause a beverage to have a 55% ABV.
