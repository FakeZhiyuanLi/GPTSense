According to Richard Sander, a negative effect of affirmative action is that it can lead to a mismatch between students and universities, where students admitted under affirmative action policies may struggle to keep up with the academic demands of the school. This can result in lower grades, higher drop-out rates, and a feeling of frustration for the students. Additionally, it can reinforce stereotypes and resentment among non-minority students who may feel that the admissions process was unfair to them.
