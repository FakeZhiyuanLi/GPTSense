were once pristine natural landscapes, disrupting ecosystems and causing soil erosion. This has also had a negative impact on the wildlife that once called these areas home. Additionally, the construction of ski resorts often involves clear-cutting of large areas of forest, which can lead to decreased biodiversity and loss of habitat for many species. Furthermore, the increased tourism and development that often accompanies ski resorts can also lead to overcrowding, pollution, and strain on local resources.
