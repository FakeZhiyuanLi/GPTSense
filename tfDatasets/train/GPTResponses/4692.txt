In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many farmers rushed in to settle the land with the help of the railroads, particularly in the western United States. These included homesteaders, who were able to obtain free plots of land from the government under the Homestead Act of 1862, as well as ranchers and other agricultural workers who saw opportunity in the vast open spaces and fertile soil of the West. Many of these pioneers traveled on the transcontinental railroads which made the journey easier and more accessible. Some famous settlement movements of this time include the Oklahoma Land Rush of 1889 and the California Gold Rush of 1849.
