Night vision devices convert ambient light photons into electrical signals, which are then amplified and converted into a visible image. This process is known as electro-optical conversion. The electrons generated by the ambient light photons are detected by the device's photocathode, which converts them into a stream of electrons that are then multiplied by the device's image intensifier tube. The amplified signal is then converted into a visible image by the device's display screen.
