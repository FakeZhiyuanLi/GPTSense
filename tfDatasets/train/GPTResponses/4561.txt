It depends on the individual's personal preference. However, some tastes that may significantly impact a man's desire to drink could be bitter, sour, or sweet flavors. For example, a man who enjoys hoppy, bitter beers may be more likely to drink alcohol than a man who prefers sweeter drinks like cocktails or wine coolers. Additionally, a man who dislikes the taste of alcohol altogether may not be as likely to drink at all.
