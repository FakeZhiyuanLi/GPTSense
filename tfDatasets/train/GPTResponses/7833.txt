The electronic device itself negotiates power draw with the host interface. This is typically done through a process called Power Delivery (PD) negotiation, which allows the device and the host to communicate about their power requirements and capabilities. The negotiation process determines how much power the device can draw from the host and ensures that the host can supply enough power to meet the device's needs. This helps to prevent overloading the host and damaging the device.
