Romance languages: Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, and Romanian are all Romance languages and share many similarities in their vocabulary due to their Latin roots.3. Germanic languages: English, German, Dutch, Swedish, and Norwegian are all Germanic languages with many similarities in their roots and vocabulary.4. Greek and Latin words: Both Greek and Latin are classical languages that have had a significant impact on modern languages. Many scientific and medical terms have Greek and Latin roots, such as "psychology" and "psychiatry," "biology" and "botany," "anatomy" and "physiology."
