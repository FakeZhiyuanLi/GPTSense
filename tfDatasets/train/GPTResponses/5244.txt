Jewish communities have existed in Brittany since at least the 11th century, although evidence of their existence is limited. The earliest documented presence of Jews in Brittany dates back to the 12th century, with the arrival of Sephardic Jews from Spain and Portugal following the expulsion of Jews from these countries.
