One common terminological problem that can lead to confusion surrounding a treaty is the use of the terms ratification and signature. The term ratification refers to the process by which a country formally gives its consent to be bound by a treaty. Signing a treaty, on the other hand, does not necessarily indicate an intention to be bound by the treaty. It is possible for a country to sign a treaty without ratifying it or for a country to ratify a treaty without first signing it. This can lead to misunderstandings about whether a country is party to a treaty and what its obligations are under the treaty.
