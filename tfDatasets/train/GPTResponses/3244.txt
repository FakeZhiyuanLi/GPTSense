Tito's belief in self-determination caused a rift with the Soviet Union and its leader Joseph Stalin. Stalin believed in maintaining strict control over the Communist countries in Eastern Europe, while Tito wanted to pursue independent and socialist policies for Yugoslavia. This led to the Yugoslav-Soviet split in 1948 and the expulsion of Yugoslavia from the Soviet bloc.
