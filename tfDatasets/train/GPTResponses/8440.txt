Functions having antiderivatives of a prescribed form are typically functions that can be expressed using a specific set of mathematical operations. For example, a function that is a polynomial can be expressed as a sum of powers of a variable multiplied by coefficients. Functions that are trigonometric can be expressed as a sum of sine and cosine functions. Functions that are exponential can be expressed as a product of a constant and a power of the base of the exponential function. Functions that are logarithmic can be expressed as a natural log of a variable or a constant. These prescribed forms allow for a methodical approach to finding antiderivatives by applying integration rules that match the form of the given function.
