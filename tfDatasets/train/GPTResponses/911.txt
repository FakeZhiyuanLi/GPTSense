Cultural Anthropology describes the workings of societies around the world. It is concerned with the study of human cultures, beliefs, practices, values, customs, institutions, and behaviors. This field aims to understand the similarities and differences among various cultures, as well as the ways in which they change and adapt over time. Cultural anthropologists use a variety of research methods, including participant observation, interviews, surveys, and archival research to gather data about different cultures. Ultimately, the goal of cultural anthropology is to develop a comprehensive understanding of human societies and the cultural variations within them.
