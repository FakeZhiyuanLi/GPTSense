There are several types of survey results that can complement data on health status, including:1. Lifestyle and behavior surveys: Surveys that assess factors such as smoking, physical activity, diet, and alcohol consumption can help explain variations in health status among different demographic groups.2. Access to healthcare surveys: Surveys that measure access to healthcare, such as the availability of primary care physicians, insurance coverage, and transportation to medical appointments, can inform the development of interventions to improve health outcomes.3. Health literacy surveys: Surveys that evaluate people's understanding of basic health information and their ability to make informed decisions about their health can provide insight into the root causes of health disparities.4. Environmental health surveys: Surveys that focus on environmental factors that can affect health, such as air quality, water quality, and exposure to toxins, can help identify populations at risk for specific health conditions.5. Quality of life surveys: Surveys that assess an individual's overall wellbeing, including their physical, emotional, and social health, can provide a more comprehensive understanding of health status beyond just the presence or absence of illness.
