The virtue that guides Christians in their understanding of God is faith. Faith is the belief and trust in the existence of God and his love, mercy, and power. It is also the confidence in the promises of God as revealed in the Bible and the teachings of Christ. Christians rely on their faith in God to give them guidance, strength, hope, and assurance in their daily lives.
