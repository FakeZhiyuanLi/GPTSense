Greece was split into sections of different rulers at various points in history, and there is no specific year that marks this division. Throughout the ancient and medieval periods, Greece was controlled by various city-states, kingdoms, empires, and other political entities that exercised varying degrees of power in different regions. Some notable examples include the Mycenaean civilization, the Classical Greek city-states, Alexandrian Macedon, the Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, and the Ottoman Empire. Each of these rulers established their own territories and spheres of influence, resulting in a complex and dynamic political landscape over the course of many centuries.
