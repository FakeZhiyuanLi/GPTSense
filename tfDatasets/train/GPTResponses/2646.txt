is known as a seamless listening experience. Gapless playback refers to the ability for one song to flow seamlessly into the next without any interruption or silence between them. This is especially important for albums where the tracks are designed to blend together or tell a story. By adding metadata such as track transitions and crossfades, players are able to deliver gapless playback and ensure that the listener experiences the intended flow of the album. This can greatly enhance the overall listening experience and make the music feel more cohesive and immersive.
