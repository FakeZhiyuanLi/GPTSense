Archimedes used a method called "the method of exhaustion" to determine the area under a parabola. The method involves dividing the parabolic region into an infinite number of smaller regions by using an inscribed and circumscribed polygon. As the number of sides of the polygon increases, the area of the inscribed and circumscribed polygons approaches the area under the parabola. By taking the limit of these areas, Archimedes was able to accurately calculate the area under the parabola.
