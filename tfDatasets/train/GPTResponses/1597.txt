Royal weddings have been celebrated at churches for centuries. The earliest recorded royal wedding in a church took place in 1100 when King Henry I of England married Edith, daughter of Malcolm III of Scotland at Westminster Abbey. Since then, most British royal weddings have been held in churches, including St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, Westminster Abbey, and St. Paul's Cathedral.
