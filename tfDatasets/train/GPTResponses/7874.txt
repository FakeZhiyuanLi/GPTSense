In the early days of soccer, the most common type of matches were between local clubs or teams, with minimal rules and regulations. These matches were often played on makeshift fields or open spaces, with no official referees or governing bodies. The matches were generally played for fun and entertainment, with little emphasis on winning or losing. As the sport grew in popularity and formalized rules were established, more structured matches and competitions began to emerge.
