The Council of Nicaea rejected Arianism and affirmed the Nicene Creed, which clarified the orthodox understanding of the Trinity and declared that Jesus was co-eternal with God the Father, of the same substance (homoousios), and not a mere creation or subordinate being. This decision marked an important turning point in the history of Christianity, as it helped establish the foundational beliefs of the orthodox faith and defined the boundaries of acceptable teachings.
