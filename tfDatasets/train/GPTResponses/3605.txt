Language learning primarily occurs most intensively during early childhood (from birth to about age 5 or 6). This is the critical period when a child's brain is highly receptive to learning new languages and when they can easily acquire multiple languages with native-like proficiency. However, language learning can also occur intensively during adolescence and adulthood through effective language instruction, immersion, and practice.
