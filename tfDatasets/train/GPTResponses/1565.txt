This question is too vague to provide a precise answer. Many different groups of Slavs migrated in various directions throughout history, so it depends on the specific time and place being referred to. Additionally, it is not accurate to say that the majority of Slavs moved south, as many also migrated east, west, and north.However, if we are looking at the Slavic migrations of the Early Middle Ages (6th-10th centuries AD), it is generally accepted that the majority of Slavs moved south and settled in the Balkans, where they eventually formed the core of several powerful states, including Serbia, Bulgaria, and Croatia.
