The first introduction of a quota system mandated that contractors had to hire a certain percentage of minority workers, usually African Americans or Hispanics, to work on government-funded projects. This was aimed at increasing diversity in the workforce and providing opportunities for underrepresented groups. Quota systems have since evolved to include gender, disability, and veteran status quotas as well.
