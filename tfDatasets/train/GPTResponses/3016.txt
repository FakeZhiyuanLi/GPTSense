Heartwood is naturally resistant to decay, insect attack, and fungal growth due to the presence of chemicals such as tannins and resins that accumulate in the wood over time. This resistance can vary depending on the species of the tree and environmental factors such as moisture content and temperature. Some examples of heartwood that are particularly resistant to decay and insects include cedar, redwood, and teak.
