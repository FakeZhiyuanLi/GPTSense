According to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, coercion through the threat or use of force against a state's representatives constitutes a violation of the state's sovereignty and territorial integrity. If such coercion is proved to be a decisive factor in inducing the state to enter into a treaty, the state has the right to invoke it as a ground for invalidating its consent to the treaty. The coercion must have been unlawful, serious, and external to the state's internal political process. Additionally, the state must have protested against the coercion promptly, or it must have become aware of the facts that rendered its consent invalid after the treaty's conclusion. The burden of proof rests on the state alleging coercion.
