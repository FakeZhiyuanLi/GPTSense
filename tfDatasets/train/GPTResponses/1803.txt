The nucleotide sequence of mRNA (messenger RNA) is complementary to the DNA sequence of the gene it corresponds to. However, there are some differences between mRNA and DNA:1. RNA contains the sugar ribose, while DNA contains the sugar deoxyribose.2. RNA contains the nucleotide base uracil (U), which replaces thymine (T) found in DNA.3. RNA is usually single-stranded, while DNA is double-stranded.4. The length of mRNA is usually shorter than the corresponding DNA sequence, as it only contains the coding regions of the gene.5. The mRNA sequence is not identical to the DNA sequence, as RNA polymerase can introduce errors or mutations during transcription.
