Sir James Weddell was a British sea captain and explorer who is best known for his Antarctic exploration expeditions in the early 19th century. He is particularly famous for the voyage he undertook in 1823-24, when he commanded the brigantine "Jane" and discovered the Weddell Sea, a large body of water off the coast of Antarctica. During that expedition, he also explored many islands and coastlines of the Antarctic Peninsula and set a record for the furthest south any manned vessel had ever gone up to that point.
