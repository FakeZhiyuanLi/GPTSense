Many economists and financial experts have different opinions on the causes of the 2008 financial crisis. However, one notable figure who believed that the growth of the commercial real estate bubble indicated that U.S. housing policy was not the cause of the crisis is Peter Wallison, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. Wallison has argued that the government's affordable housing goals, promoted by policies such as the Community Reinvestment Act and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's affordable housing mandates, did not lead to risky lending practices and the housing bubble. Instead, he points to the government's interventions in the housing market and the failure to regulate the mortgage market as key factors that led to the crisis.
