On average, a female Japanese quail can lay around 300 eggs per year. The number of eggs that can be laid by the present day descendants of the Japanese quail would depend on the breeding and selection practices used to selectively breed and maintain the traits of the quails. It is difficult to estimate an exact number without more information about the specific population and breeding program.
