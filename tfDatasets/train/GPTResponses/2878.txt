The variations in an organism's phenotype are caused by the presence and combination of different alleles inherited from their parents. Alleles are different forms of the same gene that can result in variations in physical and behavioral traits. So, according to Mendelian inheritance, the genotype (allele combination) determines the phenotype (observable traits), and the variations in the genotype are responsible for the variations in the phenotype.
