The development of recombinant DNA technology in the 1970s provided a breakthrough in genetic engineering that opened the door to plant genetic engineering. This technology allowed scientists to manipulate and transfer specific genes from one organism to another. With this technology, researchers were able to identify and modify genes that control specific traits in plants, such as crop yield, pest resistance, and nutritional content. This led to the development of new varieties of crops with improved productivity, pest resistance, and nutritional quality. The first genetically modified crop, a tomato, was commercialized in 1994.
