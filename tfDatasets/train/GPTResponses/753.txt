They recognize that each school of thought offers valuable insights into the nature of reality and the path to enlightenment, and they believe that diversity enriches their spiritual community. Moreover, they follow a common set of ethical principles, such as non-violence, truthfulness, contentment, and compassion, which form the basis of their shared commitment to personal and collective transformation. As such, monks from different traditions coexist peacefully and collaborate in various activities, such as meditation, rituals, teachings, and social services. They do not see their differences as obstacles but as opportunities for learning and growth, and they celebrate the unity that underlies their diversity.
