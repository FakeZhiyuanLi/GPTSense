In the absence of natural selection, any trait or characteristic that does not have a negative impact on survival or reproduction is likely to increase continually over generations. This phenomenon is known as genetic drift. Essentially, genetic drift occurs when random events cause certain alleles to become more common in a population over time. This process can lead to the fixation of neutral or even slightly harmful traits in a population, simply because they were present in the founding population or happened to become more prevalent by chance. However, genetic drift does not necessarily result in any particular trait or characteristic increasing continually - it is a stochastic process that is subject to chance events and random fluctuations.
