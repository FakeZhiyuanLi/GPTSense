The USB specification requires that the device be capable of negotiating with the host for the amount of power it requires before the battery charging specification can come into play. This negotiation ensures that the device does not draw more power than needed, which can cause compatibility issues or damage to the device or the host. Once the power negotiation is complete, the battery charging specification allows the device to draw the appropriate amount of power to charge its battery.
