The decline of the Delhi Sultanate began in the 14th century, with internal conflicts and rebellions weakening the state. The invasion of Timur in 1398 dealt a severe blow to the sultanate, and it never fully recovered from the destruction and instability that followed. The sultanate officially came to an end in 1526, with the establishment of the Mughal Empire under Babur.
