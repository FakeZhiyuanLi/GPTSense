During World War I, the Germans placed machine guns on their blockhouses along the Western Front to defend against enemy attacks. These blockhouses were often fortified structures built with reinforced concrete, and they were strategically placed to control and defend key sections of the front line trenches. The use of blockhouses was a significant part of the static trench warfare that characterized the Western Front during the war.
