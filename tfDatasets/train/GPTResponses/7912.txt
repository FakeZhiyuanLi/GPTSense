The use of negative numbers and decimals dates back to ancient civilizations. The Babylonians used negative numbers in their clay tablets for counting and accounting purposes as early as 2400 BCE. Similarly, the ancient Egyptians also used negative numbers around 2000 BCE for calculating debts and shortages.The concept of decimals was also developed by various civilizations at different points in history. The ancient Greeks and Chinese have been credited with first using decimals in their mathematical calculations. However, the modern decimal notation we use today was developed in India in the 9th century, which was then introduced to Europe in the 16th century.
