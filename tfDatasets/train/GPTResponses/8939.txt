The 2008 stimulus plan was funded through a combination of government borrowing and redirected funds from other areas of the federal budget. The cost of the stimulus plan was approximately $831 billion. The government borrowed most of the funds through the sale of Treasury bonds to investors, both domestically and internationally. Additionally, an estimated $200 billion was redirected from other areas of the federal budget, such as defense spending and other programs.
