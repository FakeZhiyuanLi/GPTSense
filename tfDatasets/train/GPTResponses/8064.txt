The one exception to the NFL's 4-preseason-game limit is when a team is selected to play in the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game, which takes place annually in Canton, Ohio as part of the Hall of Fame weekend. This game is considered an extra preseason game and participating teams are allowed to play 5 preseason games instead of the usual 4.
