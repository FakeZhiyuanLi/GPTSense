One potential negative effect of using newer online channels of communication is an increased risk of cyberbullying and harassment. With the anonymity provided by some platforms, people may feel more emboldened to make hurtful or offensive comments to others. In addition, the speed and instantaneous nature of communication online can also lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications, causing tension and conflict between individuals or groups. Finally, there may be issues with privacy and security on some platforms, which can put personal information and data at risk.
