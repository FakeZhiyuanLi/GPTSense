Adolescent cultural differences are especially visible in the type of autonomy related to decision-making and independence. This can include decisions related to education, career paths, relationships, and cultural practices. Cultural values and beliefs often shape how adolescents perceive and exercise their autonomy, which can vary widely across different cultural groups. For example, collectivistic cultures may prioritize family expectations and obligations over individual autonomy, whereas individualistic cultures may emphasize personal choice and self-expression.
