Antarctica is largely devoid of vegetation due to its cold and arid conditions. However, there are some patches of mosses, lichens, and algae that can be found in areas with slightly more favorable conditions, such as on the Antarctic Peninsula and in some of the coastal regions. These vegetation types are adapted to survive harsh environmental conditions, such as extreme cold, limited water supply, and high exposure to wind and sunlight.
