Federalism is a system of government in which power is divided between a central governing authority and constituent political units, such as states or provinces. This distinguishes federalism from other types of government in several ways:1. Power sharing: In federalism, power is shared between the central government and regional governments, which allows for greater local control and decision-making.2. Constitutionally defined powers: Federalism is typically codified in a constitution, which outlines the powers and authorities of the central government and the constituent political units.3. Checks and balances: Federalism provides checks and balances between the central government and regional governments, which help to prevent any one level of government from becoming too powerful.4. Dual sovereignty: Under federalism, each level of government has its own sovereignty and authority, which is separate from the other levels of government.Overall, federalism allows for greater political and social diversity, as different regions and political units can have their own laws, customs, and traditions. It also promotes greater citizen participation and accountability, as citizens can have a greater say in local governance and decision-making.
