The fraternities of stonemasons were originally responsible for the construction of Gothic cathedrals, churches, castles, and other monumental public buildings during the Middle Ages in Europe. They were highly skilled builders who worked with stone, designing and constructing elaborate architectural structures. They also played a crucial role in the maintenance and upkeep of these buildings, ensuring their long-term durability and beauty. Additionally, these fraternities maintained a system of apprenticeship and training, passing on their knowledge and skills to future generations of stonemasons.
