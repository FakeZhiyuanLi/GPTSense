The throne of Hanover passed to Prince Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale, who was Queen Victoria's first cousin. However, he was excluded from the British succession due to the controversial Hanoverian rule that prohibited a Catholic or someone married to a Catholic from ruling Hanover. Therefore, the British throne passed to Queen Victoria's eldest son, Edward VII.
