Jurisdictions sometimes change their laws regarding daylight saving time (DST) dates and times. This could include changing when DST begins and ends, or changing the length of DST altogether. For example, in the United States, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 extended DST by four weeks, starting in 2007. These changes can sometimes cause confusion and mistakes, especially for people who travel between different jurisdictions with differing DST laws.
