During the Mesozoic era, there were several significant geological activities, including:1. Continental Drift: In the early Mesozoic, the supercontinent Pangea began to break apart, and by the Late Cretaceous, the continents had moved to their present-day positions.2. Mountain Building: The uplift of various mountain chains occurred during the Mesozoic era, including the Sierra Nevada, Rocky Mountains, and Andes.3. Volcanism: There were numerous volcanic eruptions during the Mesozoic, including the formation of the Deccan Traps in India, which is considered one of the largest volcanic events in Earth's history.4. Sea-level Changes: The sea level during the Mesozoic fluctuated frequently due to the tectonic activity and mass extinctions. As a result, there were extensive marine transgressions and regressions, leading to diverse marine life.5. Metamorphism: The Mesozoic saw significant metamorphism, where rocks changed their original form and structure due to high pressure and temperature.6. Plate Tectonics: The Mesozoic is the era where the modern plate tectonic system came into existence, caused due to the convection in the mantle.
