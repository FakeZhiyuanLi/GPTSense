Sigmund Freud did not believe that everyone experiences their bisexuality equally or that everyone is equally attracted to both sexes. He believed that most people have a preference for one sex over the other and that this preference is established during childhood development. He also acknowledged that cultural and social factors can influence a person's expression of their sexuality.
