Buddhism encourages everyone to become bodhisattvas because a bodhisattva is one who is dedicated to achieving enlightenment for the benefit of all sentient beings. The ultimate goal of Buddhism is to attain enlightenment, which is the highest state of awareness and wisdom. However, the bodhisattva vows to postpone this ultimate state of enlightenment until all sentient beings have also attained it. This commitment to helping others is an essential aspect of the Buddhist path, as it cultivates compassion and altruism. Furthermore, becoming a bodhisattva helps individuals to develop a deep concern for the well-being of others, which is considered essential for achieving enlightenment.
