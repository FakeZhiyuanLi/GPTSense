There is no specific resolution of the United Nations Security Council that gave the United States control over the Marshall Islands. The United States has administered the Marshall Islands since the end of World War II, under a United Nations trusteeship agreement. In 1986, the United States and the Marshall Islands signed the Compact of Free Association, which established a self-governing relationship between the two countries.
