The Infrared Data Association (IrDA) is an industry-led organization that develops and promotes Infrared (IR) communication standards for wireless communication between devices such as laptops, mobile phones, printers, and cameras. IR communication uses infrared light waves to send and receive data between devices. The organization works to ensure interoperability between different devices and to standardize the protocols for their operation. It was founded in 1993 and has since developed a range of standards, such as IrDA Data, IrDA OBEX, and IrSimple. IrDA has been widely used in consumer electronics, especially in the early 2000s, but has since been largely replaced by other wireless technologies like Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.
