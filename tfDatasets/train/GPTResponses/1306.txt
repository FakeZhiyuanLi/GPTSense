HG I2a2 is a Y-chromosome haplogroup that is found predominantly in Europe, with significant frequencies in the Balkans, Central Europe, and Scandinavia. It is believed to have originated in the eastern Mediterranean region, possibly in Anatolia (modern-day Turkey), around 20,000 years ago. From there, it spread and diversified throughout Europe via different migration and expansion events, such as the Neolithic Revolution, the Indo-European migrations, the Bronze Age, and the Medieval period. Today, HG I2a2 is one of the major haplogroups in European populations, with estimated frequencies of around 15-20% depending on the region.
