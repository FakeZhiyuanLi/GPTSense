During the Middle Ages, the Eritrean region was known as the Land of Punt. It was a trading center and a source of exotic goods such as ivory, ostrich feathers, and frankincense. The Land of Punt was located on the eastern coast of Africa, in what is now Eritrea and Somalia. The ancient Egyptians conducted trade with the people of the Land of Punt, and references to the region can be found in Egyptian texts from as early as 2450 BCE.
