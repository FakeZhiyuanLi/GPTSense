The major strike in 1934 that damaged Seattle's maritime economy was the West Coast waterfront strike, also known as the Longshoremen's strike. It lasted for 83 days and involved over 70,000 workers from San Diego to Seattle who demanded increased wages, better working conditions and the right to join a union. The strike had a significant impact on the shipping industry and the regional economy. Ships were unable to unload and load cargo, leading to significant financial losses for businesses and disrupting trade in the Pacific Northwest.
