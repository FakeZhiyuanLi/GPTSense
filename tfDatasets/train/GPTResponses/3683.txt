By the end of the Cretaceous period, angiosperms (flowering plants) had become the dominant group of trees in many floras. They had diversified greatly and conquered most terrestrial ecosystems, displacing the previously dominant gymnosperms (such as conifers and cycads). This marked a major shift in the composition of plant communities and paved the way for the modern diversity of flowering plants.
