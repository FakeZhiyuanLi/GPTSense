The amount of solar energy absorbed by the Earth varies depending on many factors such as latitude, time of day, season, cloud cover, and atmospheric conditions. On average, about 70% of the solar energy that reaches the top of the Earth's atmosphere is absorbed by the land, oceans and atmosphere, while the rest is reflected or scattered back into space. According to NASA, the total amount of solar energy absorbed by the Earth is around 3.8 × 10²⁴ joules per year.
