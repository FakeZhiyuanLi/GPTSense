Most countries needed an adapted version of ASCII because the original ASCII only supported the English language with 128 characters. It did not include special characters used in other languages, such as accented characters and characters used in Asian languages. Therefore, adapted versions of ASCII were created to include these additional characters for specific languages and alphabets. These adapted versions allowed computers and other electronic devices to display and communicate text in different languages, making it easier for people to use technology in their native language.
