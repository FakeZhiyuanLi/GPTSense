By August 1805, Napoleon changed the primary target of his army's efforts from the English Channel to the Austrian Empire in Central Europe. This led to the War of the Third Coalition between France and several European powers, including Austria, Russia, and Great Britain. The war ended with a decisive French victory at the Battle of Austerlitz in December 1805.
