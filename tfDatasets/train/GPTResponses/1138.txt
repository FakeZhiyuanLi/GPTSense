The one drop rule is a social and legal principle that states that a person with even one ancestor of African descent (one "drop" of African blood) is considered Black. Historically, this rule was used in the United States to define and enforce racial segregation, discrimination, and slavery. The one drop rule helped to uphold the racial hierarchy of white supremacy, and it reinforced the belief that people with African ancestry were inferior and should be discriminated against. Today, the one drop rule is widely rejected as a racist and inaccurate concept.
