Since the 1990s, Congo-Brazzaville has operated as a semi-presidential republic, where power is shared between a president and a prime minister. The president is the head of state and holds significant executive power, while the prime minister is responsible for running government affairs. However, the political system in Congo-Brazzaville is widely viewed as authoritarian, with the ruling party maintaining tight control over the government and state institutions. Elections have often been marred by allegations of fraud and the opposition have faced suppression and intimidation.
