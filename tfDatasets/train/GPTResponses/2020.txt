No bird migrates by circling the earth. It is impossible for any bird to fly continuously without stopping for food, rest and sleep for the entire circumference of the earth, which is about 40,075 km (24,901 miles). Some birds do migrate very long distances between their breeding and non-breeding grounds, but they follow established migration routes and do not circle the earth.
