hormone?The characteristic of the cycle other than fat storage is a continuously high stimulation of the hormone insulin. Insulin plays a crucial role in regulating the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and protein in the body, and it is responsible for signaling the cells to take up glucose from the bloodstream and store it as glycogen or fat. In the context of the menstrual cycle, the continuously high levels of estrogen and progesterone can cause insulin resistance in some women, leading to higher blood sugar levels and increased fat storage. Additionally, insulin can also affect the production of other hormones, such as androgens, that play a role in the menstrual cycle.
