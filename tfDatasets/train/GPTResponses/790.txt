The Yogacarins asserted that the mind was not truly existent and that it was a product of the interdependent nature of things. They believed that the mind was not separate from the external world and that all experience arises from the interplay between various phenomena. They argued that the concept of a truly existing mind was a delusion and that it caused suffering by reinforcing a sense of individual identity and separateness. Instead, they advocated for a more holistic understanding of the self and the world, emphasizing the interdependent nature of all things and the need to cultivate awareness and empathy in order to overcome suffering.
