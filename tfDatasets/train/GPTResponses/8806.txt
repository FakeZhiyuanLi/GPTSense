During Darwin’s lifetime, France was one of the few European countries that largely accepted his ideas of evolution by natural selection. The French scientific community, including biologists, paleontologists, and geologists, had closely followed and engaged with Darwin’s work since the publication of "On the Origin of Species" in 1859. French intellectuals, including the writer Emile Zola and the philosopher Henri Bergson, also embraced Darwin’s ideas.Despite this general acceptance, there were still criticisms and debates about some of Darwin’s theories, particularly around the role of acquired characteristics in evolution, which was championed by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. However, even Lamarck’s ideas did not completely reject Darwin’s work and instead built upon it. Overall, Darwin’s ideas had a significant impact on French scientific thought and influenced the development of many important scientific theories in the country.
