One example of a mesa range is the Grand Mesa in western Colorado. It is an enormous plateau that covers over 500 square miles and rises to an elevation of almost 11,000 feet. It is the largest flat-topped mountain in the world and is known for its scenic beauty, recreational opportunities, and diverse wildlife. The Grand Mesa is a popular destination for hiking, camping, fishing, and hunting, and it is home to many rare and endangered species of plants and animals.
