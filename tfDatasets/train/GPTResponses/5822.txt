Heavy weapons such as missiles, rockets, and bombs are typically used for high-altitude targets such as aircraft or drones. These weapons are designed to explode in the air and create a blast radius that can take down the target.On the other hand, weapons such as machine guns, cannons, and small arms are used for low-altitude targets such as ground troops or vehicles. These weapons are designed to fire at a specific target and have a lower range than heavy weapons.However, it is important to note that some heavy weapons can also be used for low-altitude targets, depending on the situation and the weapon's capabilities.
