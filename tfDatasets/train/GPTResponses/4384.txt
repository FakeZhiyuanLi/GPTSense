Alcohol is measured in the human body through blood alcohol concentration (BAC) testing. This can be done through:1. Breathalyzer: This measures the amount of alcohol present in the breath.2. Blood test: This measures the amount of alcohol in the blood.3. Urine test: This measures the amount of alcohol in the urine.BAC is measured as a percentage of the amount of alcohol present in the blood. The legal limit for driving in most countries is 0.08% BAC. Factors such as weight, age, gender, and amount of alcohol consumed can affect how quickly alcohol is absorbed and eliminated from the body.
