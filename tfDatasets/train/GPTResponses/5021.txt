Captain Matthew Flinders wrote his book "A Voyage to Terra Australis" between 1814 and 1815 while he was detained on the island of Mauritius as a prisoner of war during the Napoleonic Wars. The book was published in 1814, while Flinders was still in Mauritius, but he did not live to see its success as he died in 1814.
