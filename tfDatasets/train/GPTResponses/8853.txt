During the mid-18th century, the Czechs, as a people, gained greater autonomy and recognition of their cultural identity within the Habsburg Empire. Emperor Maria Theresa, who ruled from 1740 to 1780, allowed the Czechs to establish their own schools and universities, and she also re-established the Bohemian Royal Court, which had been abolished by her predecessor. This period also saw a revival of Czech literature and music, with notable figures such as Jan Hus, Jan Neruda, and Bedrich Smetana emerging as leaders in these fields. Additionally, the Czech lands experienced economic growth and development during this time, with increased industrialization, improved transportation networks, and expanded trade.
