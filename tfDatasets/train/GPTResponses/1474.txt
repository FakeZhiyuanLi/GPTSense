are known as "runaway serfs" - serfs who had fled feudal estates and sought refuge in the lands outside of Russian control. They joined the Terek Cossacks as a way to live a freer life and to escape the oppression of their former masters. Additionally, some members were also escaped prisoners or criminals seeking a new start. The Terek Cossacks were known for accepting all types of individuals, regardless of their background or origin.
