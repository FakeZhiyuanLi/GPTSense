As an ontologist and philosopher, Whitehead classified what is usually seen as an individual person as an "actual occasion." According to Whitehead, an actual occasion is a momentary unit of existence that arises out of the convergence of various "pre-existing" elements, including past events, physical matter, and the cosmos. An actual occasion is also characterized as being self-determining, meaning that it has the ability to select which past events and physical elements will be included in its constitution. In essence, Whitehead saw individual persons as dynamic, constantly evolving entities that consist of a unique blend of past and present factors.
