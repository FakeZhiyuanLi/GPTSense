This type of diversity is known as agro-biodiversity or crop diversity. It refers to the number and variety of different crops, plants, and animals that are grown, raised, and managed on the farm. Farmers may intentionally choose to plant different varieties of crops to increase biodiversity, improve soil health, and reduce the risk of crop failure. This diversity is important for sustainable agriculture and food systems, as it can provide greater resilience to pests, diseases, and climate change.
