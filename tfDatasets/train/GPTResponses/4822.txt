It is impossible to determine the exact amount of gold in grams that one dollar was equivalent to without specifying a particular time period as the value of gold changes over time. However, historically, the US dollar was pegged to gold at a rate of $20.67 per ounce of gold from 1834 to 1934. Therefore, one dollar was equivalent to approximately 1.51 grams of gold during this period. In 1971, the US dollar abandoned the gold standard and its value is now determined by foreign exchange markets.
