1. The force applied: Torque is calculated by multiplying force by the distance from the pivot point. So, the magnitude and direction of the force applied must be known in order to calculate torque.2. The distance from the pivot point: The distance between the point where the force is applied and the point around which the object rotates (or "pivot point") is also required.3. The angle of application: If the force is not applied perpendicular to the moment arm (the distance from the force to the pivot point), the angle of application must also be known.4. The nature of the object: An object's mass, shape, and size can influence its resistance to rotation and therefore affect the amount of torque required to rotate it.5. The units of measurement: Torque can be measured in different units, such as Nm, lb-ft, or oz-in. The units of measurement must be consistent in order to accurately calculate torque.
