Capacitors used in high current applications can experience several issues, including:1. Overheating: Capacitors can overheat when they are exposed to high currents, leading to a decrease in their performance and eventual failure.2. Capacitance loss: High current flow can cause a reduction in the capacitance value of a capacitor. This can affect the performance of the device it is intended to operate.3. Leakage current: In high current applications, capacitors can develop a leakage current due to the presence of impurities or contaminants in the materials or manufacturing process.4. Voltage breakdown: If the voltage is too high, the dielectric material between the capacitor plates can break down, leading to a loss in capacitance or even catastrophic failure.5. Short circuit: High currents may cause a capacitor to short circuit, leading to a release of energy causing damage to the device or harm to the operator.It is important to choose capacitors that are rated for the specific current and voltage requirements of the application to reduce the likelihood and impact of these issues.
