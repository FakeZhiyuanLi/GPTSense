There were several reasons why the US public condemned the occupation of the Philippines:1. Anti-Imperialism Movement: Many Americans were against the idea of the country acquiring territories through imperialistic means. They believed that the US should not impose its rule on other nations and felt that the occupation of the Philippines violated this principle.2. Human Rights Violations: There were reports of US soldiers committing atrocities and human rights violations against the Filipino people during the occupation. This led to a public outcry and condemnation of the occupation.3. Cost and Effort: Maintaining and governing a faraway territory like the Philippines required significant investment and resources. Many Americans felt that this was a waste of money and effort when there were problems and needs back home that needed attention.4. Racial Prejudice: Some Americans also held racist views towards the Filipinos and did not believe that they were capable of self-governance. This led to calls for the US to leave the Philippines and allow the Filipinos to govern themselves.Overall, the US public's condemnation of the occupation of the Philippines was driven by a combination of ethical, practical, and ideological reasons.
