It depends on the time and location in history. In ancient times, students came from various empires, such as the Roman Empire, the Persian Empire, the Chinese Empire, and the Indian Empire, to attend universities or similar institutions of higher learning. In the Middle Ages, students often traveled from across Europe to study at universities in cities like Bologna, Paris, and Oxford. In more recent times, students from various European empires, including the British Empire, attended universities both at home and abroad, and in the present day, students from various countries and empires attend universities globally.
