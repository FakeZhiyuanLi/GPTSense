is believed to be the operative stonemasons of the Middle Ages, who built castles, cathedrals, and other monumental structures across Europe. Over time, these workers formed fraternities or guilds to regulate their trade and protect their interests. As construction methods shifted from medieval to Renaissance styles, the stonemasons gradually evolved into a social and philosophical organization that focused on moral and intellectual development, drawing on the symbolism and tools of their craft to teach lessons of morality and virtue. By the early 18th century, Freemasonry had spread throughout Europe and America, attracting members from all walks of life and establishing a reputation as a charitable and benevolent force in society. Today, there are an estimated six million Freemasons worldwide.
