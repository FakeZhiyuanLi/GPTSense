If a treaty is considered unenforceable and void under international law, it would mean that the treaty is not legally binding and cannot be enforced by any party. This could happen if the treaty violates fundamental principles of international law, such as the right to self-determination or the prohibition of the use of force. In such cases, the parties to the treaty may choose to renegotiate the terms or abandon the treaty altogether. Alternatively, they may continue to follow the terms of the treaty despite its unenforceability, either for practical reasons or as a matter of principle.
