There isn't a clear definitive answer as to why English freemasonry almost came to a halt in 1799, but there are a few possible reasons:1. Anti-Masonic sentiment and legal restrictions: Freemasonry had faced criticism and backlash throughout the 18th century, with some governments and religious authorities viewing it as a secret society that threatened their power. In 1799, the United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE) faced legal challenges to its legitimacy and authority, including a lawsuit that sought to ban all Masonic activity in the country. This created a climate of fear and uncertainty among Masons, and may have contributed to a decline in membership and activity.2. Internal divisions and politics: Freemasonry has always had political and ideological divisions, which can sometimes lead to schisms and disagreements. In the late 18th century, there were several debates and controversies within English freemasonry over issues such as the role of women, the admission of non-Christians, and the extent of Masonic secrecy. Some of these debates became quite heated and caused rifts within the fraternity, which could have contributed to a decline in participation and enthusiasm.3. External factors: There may have been other factors beyond the control of the fraternity that impacted its popularity and viability in 1799. For example, there were significant economic and social upheavals in Europe at this time, including the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, which could have distracted people from Masonic activities or made them feel less relevant or important.Overall, it's likely that a combination of these factors contributed to the decline of English freemasonry in 1799. However, the fraternity was able to recover in the following years and continued to play a significant role in British society throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.
