There are many groups that have been started by ex-political prisoners, so it would depend on the specific group being referred to. Some examples include:- The National Congress of Black Women, founded by Shirley Chisholm, who was the first Black woman elected to Congress and also spent time in prison during the Civil Rights Movement.- The Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa, which was created in part by Nelson Mandela and other former political prisoners to help heal the divisions caused by apartheid.- The Irish Republican Army (IRA), which was founded in part by former Irish Republican prisoners who had been jailed for their involvement in the Northern Ireland Troubles.- The Black Panther Party, which was founded in part by former prisoners who had been radicalized by their experiences in the criminal justice system.Again, it would depend on the specific group in question.
