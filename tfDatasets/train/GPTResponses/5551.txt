Autosomal DNA refers to the DNA found in the 22 pairs of chromosomes that are not involved in determining gender (the X and Y chromosomes). Autosomal DNA is inherited from both parents and contains information about an individual's traits, physical characteristics, and other genetic information. It is used in genetic genealogy to trace ancestry, identify relatives, and determine genetic predispositions to certain diseases.
