The Global Plan to Stop Tuberculosis is headed up by the Stop TB Partnership, which is a partnership of international organizations, countries, donors, and civil society groups. The partnership was established in 2000 and is hosted by the World Health Organization (WHO) in Geneva, Switzerland. Its goal is to accelerate the global response to tuberculosis and to advance efforts towards its elimination.
