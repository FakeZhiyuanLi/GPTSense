Darwin used the example of pigeon breeding to illustrate the effects of artificial selection. By selecting certain desirable traits (such as feather color or beak shape) over many generations, pigeon breeders were able to create a wide variety of pigeon breeds with very distinct characteristics. Darwin argued that this same process of selection and breeding could explain the diversity of species found in nature, with natural selection acting as the driving force rather than human intervention.
