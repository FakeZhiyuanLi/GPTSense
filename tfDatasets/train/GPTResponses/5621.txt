The five Platonic solids were studied and described by the ancient Greek philosopher Plato and later by the mathematician Euclid. However, the concept of the Platonic solids predates both of them and can be traced back to the ancient Greeks Pythagoras and Thales. The study of the Platonic solids has continued throughout history by many mathematicians, scientists, and philosophers.
