One more fuel-efficient way for STOVL aircraft to take off rather than vertically is by performing a short takeoff (STO) or a rolling takeoff. In short takeoff, the aircraft takes off using a shorter runway, requiring less fuel to accelerate and liftoff. In contrast, in rolling takeoff, the aircraft accelerates along the ground and takes off using a longer runway or a catapult system, similar to those used on aircraft carriers. Both short takeoff and rolling takeoff methods require less fuel than a full vertical takeoff.
