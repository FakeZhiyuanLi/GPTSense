of liturgical music?Monophonic chant stopped being the dominant form of liturgical music in the 12th century with the emergence of polyphony. Polyphony is a form of music where two or more independent melodic lines are played or sung simultaneously. This new form of music paved the way for the development of various musical genres, including madrigals, motets, and masses. Despite this change, monophonic chant remains an essential part of liturgical music to this day.
