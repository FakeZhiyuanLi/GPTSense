The First Congregational Church of New Haven is the one that houses a notorious 17th century crypt. This crypt is located beneath the church and is believed to be the final resting place of several prominent figures, including the Reverend James Pierpont, who co-founded Yale University. The crypt has been the subject of many legends and ghost stories over the years, and visitors to the church can take guided tours of the crypt to learn more about its history and the people buried there.
