The language and wording of the treaty must often be interpreted when it's not clear. This involves analyzing the terms and phrases used in the treaty and determining their intended meanings. Additionally, the context and purpose of the treaty may also be considered when interpreting its meaning. In some cases, international legal principles and norms may also be used to assist in interpreting treaties.
