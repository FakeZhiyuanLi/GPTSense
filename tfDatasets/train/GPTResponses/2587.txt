Parties to a treaty are forbidden to take actions that are contrary to the provisions of the treaty after they have already joined the treaty. This includes violating the obligations and commitments they have made under the treaty, as well as trying to undermine the treatyâ€™s objectives or purpose. Parties are also prohibited from withdrawing from a treaty without following the proper procedures outlined in the treaty itself. Finally, parties cannot enter into agreements or take actions that would undermine the treaty or its provisions, even if such actions would be consistent with their own interests.
