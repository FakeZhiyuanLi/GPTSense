The concept of a continuum of intensity was described by Wilhelm Wundt, a German psychologist who is often considered the founder of modern psychology. He believed that there was a continuous scale of sensory experience, from the weakest to the strongest, and that our perception of intensity was relative to our previous experiences. This idea became a cornerstone of the psychological approach known as psychophysics.
