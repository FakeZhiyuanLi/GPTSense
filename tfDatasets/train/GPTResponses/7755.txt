A large number of Bermudians immigrated to the Bahamas before the American Revolution. This was due to economic opportunities, as the Bahamas provided better trade and fishing opportunities as compared to Bermuda, which had limited land and resources. The British government also encouraged migration to the Bahamas to establish a more permanent British presence in the region.
