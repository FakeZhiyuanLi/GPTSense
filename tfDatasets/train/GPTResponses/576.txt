One way to characterize solar technologies as passive or active is by their ability to convert solar energy into usable energy. Passive solar technologies utilize the natural movements of heat and air to provide heating, cooling, and lighting solutions without the need for added energy sources. Active solar technologies, on the other hand, use mechanical and electrical devices to capture and transfer solar energy, such as solar panels and solar water heaters.
