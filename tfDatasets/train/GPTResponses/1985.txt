The Asian country that notably influenced Somali culture is Yemen. Yemeni influence can be seen in Somali language, music, dance, clothing, and cuisine. The Yemeni city of Aden was a major center for trade and cultural exchange in the Indian Ocean, and it played a crucial role in the development of Somali culture. Many Somalis trace their ancestry back to Yemeni immigrants who arrived in Somalia centuries ago.
