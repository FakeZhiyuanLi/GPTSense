In the 19th century, the idea of transmutation of species (also known as evolution) was a highly controversial topic. While some naturalists and scientists, such as Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, developed and promoted the theory of natural selection and the transmutation of species, many others rejected these ideas.The scientific and religious communities were deeply divided on this issue, with religious leaders and conservative scientists rejecting the theory of evolution in favor of biblical creationism. Some scientists argued that evolution was not possible because it violated the concept of fixed species that had been accepted since the time of Aristotle. Others believed in the idea of spontaneous generation, the notion that living organisms could arise from non-living matter, which contradicted the idea of evolution.Overall, the general opinion about transmutation of species in the 19th century was one of skepticism and controversy. However, the widespread publication and dissemination of Darwin's On the Origin of Species in 1859 helped to popularize the theory of evolution and eventually led to its acceptance as a fundamental concept in biology.
