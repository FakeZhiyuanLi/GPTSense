Social Darwinism and theories of race were rooted in the social sciences, particularly in anthropology, sociology, and biology. These theories attempted to explain the differences in human behavior and achievement by looking at biological factors such as genetics, race, and evolutionary history. However, they were often misused to justify discrimination, racism, and imperialism, and they are now considered outdated and discredited.
