Exclusive jurisdiction can be waived in two different scenarios:1. The parties agree to waive exclusive jurisdiction in a contract or agreement. This could be done in a clause within the contract or agreement that allows the parties to choose a different jurisdiction to govern disputes.2. The defendant does not object to the plaintiff filing a lawsuit in a non-exclusive jurisdiction. If the defendant does not assert their right to exclusive jurisdiction, then they are deemed to have waived that right and the case can proceed in the non-exclusive jurisdiction.
