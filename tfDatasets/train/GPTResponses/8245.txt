The problem with general relativity and quantum mechanics is that they both describe the behavior of the universe at very different scales, and they appear to be incompatible with each other. General relativity describes the behavior of large-scale objects, such as planets and galaxies, while quantum mechanics describes the behavior of subatomic particles. The two theories appear to contradict each other when applied to certain situations, such as the behavior of black holes and the early universe. Scientists have been working to find a way to reconcile the two theories into a single, unified theory of physics, known as a theory of everything.
