The amino acid sequence of a protein is specified by the sequence of nucleotides in the gene that encodes the protein. This sequence of nucleotides is transcribed into a sequence of messenger RNA (mRNA), which is then translated into a sequence of amino acids by the ribosome during protein synthesis. The order of the nucleotides in the gene determines the order of the amino acids in the protein, and different genes have different nucleotide sequences that result in different amino acid sequences and therefore different proteins.
