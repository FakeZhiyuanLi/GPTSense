The Decree of Valens, also known as the Cunctos Populos decree, was issued by the Roman Emperor Valens in 372 AD. It made Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire and prohibited all other religions, including paganism and Judaism. The decree ordered that all pagan temples be closed, and their property confiscated by the government. This decree helped to further solidify Christianity's position as a dominant religion in the Roman Empire.
