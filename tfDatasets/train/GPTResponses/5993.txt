Freemasonry began to spread to continental Europe in the early 18th century, particularly in France and then in Germany. The Grand Lodge of France was established in 1728, and the Grand Lodge of Berlin in 1740. Freemasonry then began to spread throughout the rest of Europe, including Italy, Spain, Austria, and Russia.
