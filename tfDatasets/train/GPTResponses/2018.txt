When using a sundial, we must adjust the reading to reflect natural discrepancies caused by the Earth's axial tilt and the effect of other influences such as the longitude, latitude, and altitude of the sundial's location. Other factors that may affect the measurement include the length of the gnomon (the part of the sundial that casts a shadow), variations in the Earth's orbit, and the equation of time (the difference between the mean solar time and the actual solar time).
