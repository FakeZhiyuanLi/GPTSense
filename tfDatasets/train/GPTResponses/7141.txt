1. Microbial biopesticides: These are products that contain microbes such as bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoa that can control pests by causing diseases, parasitizing or infecting them.2. Plant-Incorporated Protectants (PIPs): These are biopesticides in which genetic material from specific pests is introduced into plants. The PIP plant then produces a protein that is toxic to the pest when it feeds on the plant.
