The term "affirmative action" first appeared in President John F. Kennedy's Executive Order 10925 in 1961, which established the Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity and instructed federal contractors to "take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin."
