Having unprotected sex, multiple sexual partners, and poor communication can increase individual and social risk.Individual risk can be increased because:- Unprotected sex can lead to sexually transmitted infections (STIs), unintended pregnancy, and exposure to blood-borne viruses like HIV.- Having multiple sexual partners can increase the chances of coming in contact with someone who has an STI or other infection.- Poor communication can lead to misunderstandings about sexual health status, consent, and preferences, which can put individuals in potentially risky situations.Social risk can be increased because:- STIs can be spread from person to person, potentially leading to outbreaks and a higher prevalence of infection in a community.- Unintended pregnancies can lead to financial strain, child-rearing challenges, and potential strain on relationships.- Poor communication can lead to misunderstandings and mistrust, potentially undermining social connections and relationships.Overall, having unprotected sex, multiple sexual partners, and poor communication can increase individual and social risk in various ways, including physical, emotional, and financial consequences.
