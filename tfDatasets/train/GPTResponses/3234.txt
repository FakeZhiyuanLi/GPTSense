The Allied leaders switched their support from Draža Mihailović to Josip Broz Tito during World War II. Mihailović was a Serbian nationalist and leader of the Yugoslav Army in the Fatherland (Chetniks), who initially fought against both Nazi Germany and the communist forces led by Tito. However, his reluctance to cooperate with Tito's Partisans and allegations of collaboration with the Axis powers led to the Allies withdrawing their support and backing Tito and his Partisans instead.
