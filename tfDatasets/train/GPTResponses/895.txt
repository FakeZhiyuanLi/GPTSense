Geography has an effect on the amount of solar energy available because the amount of solar radiation received by a particular location on the earth's surface varies depending on factors such as latitude, altitude, cloud cover, and atmospheric conditions. Areas that receive more direct sunlight and have less cloud cover will receive more solar energy than areas that receive less direct sunlight and have more cloud cover. Additionally, the angle at which the sun's rays hit the earth's surface can also affect the amount of solar energy received. This means that different parts of the world will have different amounts of solar energy available depending on their geographic location and local conditions.
