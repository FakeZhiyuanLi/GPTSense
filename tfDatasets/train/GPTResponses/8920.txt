In 1950, Pope Pius XII issued an encyclical called Humani Generis in which he did not directly condone or condemn the theory of evolution, but he did caution that the concept of “evolutionism” should not be taken as an absolute philosophical truth without regard for the role of God in the creation of humanity. He also acknowledged that evolution could be compatible with Catholic doctrine as long as it acknowledged God’s role as the ultimate creator.
