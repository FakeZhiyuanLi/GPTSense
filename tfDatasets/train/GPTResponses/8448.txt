There are a few possible reasons why competition can be fierce between related species:1. Overlapping niches: Related species often occupy similar ecological niches, or roles within the ecosystem. This means they may compete for the same food, shelter, or other resources.2. Limited resources: Even if related species occupy different niches, they may still compete for limited resources like water, space, or sunlight.3. Genetic similarity: Related species may have similar genetic traits, which means they may also have similar ecological requirements. This can lead to more intense competition than between unrelated species.4. Evolutionary history: Related species may have shared a common ancestor and therefore have a longer history of competing with each other. This can result in stronger competitive pressures and adaptations.Overall, fierce competition between related species may be a natural consequence of their similarities and shared ecological histories.
