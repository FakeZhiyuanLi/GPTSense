Jean Baudrillard is often credited with moving a Marxist analysis of commodity fetishism to the realm of consumption. In his book "The System of Objects," Baudrillard argues that consumption has become a form of social communication, with objects serving as signifiers of social status and identity. He also suggests that the value of objects is not inherent, but rather constructed through social and cultural processes, further emphasizing the idea of commodity fetishism.
