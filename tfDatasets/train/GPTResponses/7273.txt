No, plants and animals are not genetically the same. They have different genetic makeups and belong to different kingdoms in the biological classification system. Plants are in the kingdom Plantae and have cell walls, while animals are in the kingdom Animalia and do not have cell walls. Additionally, plants have a unique ability to perform photosynthesis and animals cannot produce their own food. Therefore, there are major differences in the genetic makeup of plants and animals.
