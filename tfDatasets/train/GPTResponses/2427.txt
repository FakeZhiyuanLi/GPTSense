Alleles are responsible for coding for different variations of a particular trait or gene. They determine an individual's inherited characteristics such as eye color, hair type and color, height, susceptibility to certain diseases, and more. In simple terms, an allele is like a recipe for a particular characteristic, and different combinations of alleles from two parents give rise to different traits in their offspring.
