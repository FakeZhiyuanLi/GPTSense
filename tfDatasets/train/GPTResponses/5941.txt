Sanskrit is an adaptation from the language of Vedic Sanskrit, which was spoken in ancient India. The language was standardized and codified by grammarians and scholars, resulting in the form of Sanskrit known as Classical Sanskrit. It served as the liturgical and literary language of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, and was also used for scientific, philosophical, and literary purposes. Sanskrit was also significant in the development of many languages in South Asia and Southeast Asia.
