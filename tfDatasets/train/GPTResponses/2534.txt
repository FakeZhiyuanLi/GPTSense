The United Nations (UN) can be compared to the pre-constitutional United States federal government when discussing the function and effectiveness of modern treaty law. Just like how the Articles of Confederation established a weak federal government with limited powers, modern treaty law relies on the willingness of state parties to comply with the treatyâ€™s provisions. Similarly, the UN relies on the cooperation of its member states to carry out its mandates and resolutions, lacking the power to enforce its decisions without the consent of its members. Therefore, the comparison of the pre-constitutional United States with the UN highlights the ongoing tension between sovereignty and international cooperation, which is a fundamental issue in modern international law.
