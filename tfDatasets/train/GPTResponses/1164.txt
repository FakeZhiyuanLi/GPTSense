Bird migration primarily happens in both hemispheres, from the Arctic to the Antarctic, as birds move towards the warmer tropics during winter or towards places with more abundant food during breeding seasons in spring and summer. The specific routes and destinations of bird migration vary depending on the species of bird and their environmental and ecological preferences.
