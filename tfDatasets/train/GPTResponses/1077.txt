Somali men typically wear a long loose garment called a "macawiis" or "ma'awiis". It is similar to a sarong and is worn around the waist and draped over the shoulders. They also wear a headscarf called a "shash" or "keffiyeh" and sandals or leather shoes. Some Somali men also wear traditional embroidery and adornments.
