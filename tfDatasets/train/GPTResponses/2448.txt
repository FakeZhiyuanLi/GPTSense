During Bach's time, the system of temperaments that was common was the well-tempered tuning system. This system was developed in the late 17th century and allowed for greater flexibility in tuning keyboard instruments, such as the harpsichord and organ, to accommodate different keys and modes. The most famous example of the well-tempered tuning system is Bach's own work, "The Well-Tempered Clavier," which features preludes and fugues in all 24 major and minor keys. In well temperament, the pitch relationships between notes are adjusted so that every key is usable, though some keys (particularly C major and A minor) are favored more than others.
