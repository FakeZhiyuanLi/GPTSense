One of the features that have come to be considered as an important part of the gothic style is the use of dark and dramatic elements such as arches, vaulted ceilings, gargoyles, stained glass, and pointed arches. These features create a sense of mystery, drama, and awe, and are often associated with medieval cathedrals and castles. The gothic style also often incorporates elements of horror and the supernatural, such as ghosts, vampires, and eerie landscapes.
