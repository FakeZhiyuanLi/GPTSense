When a name is defective or misleading, it can lead to confusion and misunderstanding among individuals and businesses. It can also impact the credibility and trustworthiness of the person or company associated with the name. In some cases, legal action may be taken against the person or company to change the name or to seek damages for any harm caused by the defective or misleading name. In the case of businesses, it may also impact their ability to attract customers and generate revenue.
