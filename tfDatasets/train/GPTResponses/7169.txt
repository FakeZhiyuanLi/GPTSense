Miniature PM motors use high energy magnets because they provide greater power density and efficiency compared to low energy magnets. This means that, despite their small size, the motors can generate higher torque and perform more work. Additionally, high energy magnets increase the overall lifespan of the motor as they maintain their magnetic strength over a longer time period. This enables the motor to operate at higher speeds while requiring less energy to maintain its magnetic field, making them ideal for use in applications where space and power consumption are critical factors.
