Many of the hotels in Atlantic City were struggling financially and needed a new source of revenue to survive. Prior to the legalization of gaming, Atlantic City was known primarily as a seaside resort town, but the popularity of other destinations like the Caribbean and Florida began to lure tourists away. By the late 1970s, only a handful of hotels remained open in Atlantic City.The state of New Jersey recognized the need for a new industry to revive the city's economy, and in 1976, a referendum was passed to legalize casino gambling in Atlantic City. This led to an influx of investment in the city and the construction of new hotels, casinos, and entertainment venues. Many of the old hotels were refurbished and updated to accommodate the new industry, while others were demolished to make way for new developments.The legalization of gaming helped to transform Atlantic City from a struggling resort town into a thriving entertainment destination, attracting millions of tourists each year. The city's skyline was transformed with the construction of massive hotel and casino complexes like the Borgata, Caesars, and Harrah's, bringing new life and prosperity to the once-struggling city.
