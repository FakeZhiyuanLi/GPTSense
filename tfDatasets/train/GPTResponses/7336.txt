The Rationalist Mutazilite philosophers held the view that reason and rationality were the most important tools for understanding religion and interpreting scripture. They believed that God created the universe according to rational and immutable laws and that divine justice was based on the principles of reason, morality, and causality. They rejected blind faith and emphasized the importance of human responsibility for their actions. They also believed in the concept of free will and the necessity of a just and fair society governed by laws based on rational principles.
