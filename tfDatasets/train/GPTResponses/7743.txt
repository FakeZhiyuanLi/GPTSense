In the context of the United States, only certain entities or individuals can refer a proposed measure to the Supreme Court. Generally, this would depend on the nature of the measure and the legal framework governing it.Some possible examples include:- For a federal law or regulation, the President of the United States, members of Congress, or individuals or groups affected by the law could petition the Supreme Court to review its constitutionality.- For a state law or state constitutional amendment, the state legislature, the governor, or individuals or groups affected by the law could appeal to the Supreme Court if they believe their rights or the rights of others have been violated.- In some cases, the Supreme Court may choose to review a case on its own initiative if it deems the issue to be of significant legal or constitutional importance.However, the process for referring a proposed measure to the Supreme Court would typically involve more than just a four-week period, and would likely involve legal challenges and appeals at multiple levels before reaching the highest court in the land.
