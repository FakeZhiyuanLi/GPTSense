is commonly referred to as "narrowband" technologies, which offer lower data rates but require less power and can transmit signals over longer distances. Some examples of narrowband technologies include:1. Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT): This cellular network technology is designed specifically for IoT devices and relies on a narrowband signal to provide low-power, wide area coverage.2. LoRaWAN: This is a low-power, low data rate protocol that is specifically designed for IoT devices that operate on the unlicensed Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) bands.3. Sigfox: Sigfox is another low-power, narrowband network that is designed to support IoT devices operating on an unlicensed spectrum.4. Weightless-N: This is another narrowband wireless protocol designed for IoT devices that operate on unlicensed spectrum.5. LTE-M: This is a cellular network technology that is optimized for IoT devices operating at lower data rates, and supports both low-bandwidth and high-bandwidth use cases.
