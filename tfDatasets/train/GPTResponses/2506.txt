In 2007, the United States extended the duration of daylight saving time (DST) by four weeks, starting it three weeks earlier in the spring and ending it one week later in the fall. This change was made as an energy-saving measure, as it was believed to reduce the consumption of electricity for lighting and heating. However, there were concerns that the change could have unintended consequences, such as impacting scheduling for transportation, communication systems, and other critical infrastructure.It is unknown what specifically led to the Department of Energy (DOE) investigation, but it is possible that it was related to assessing the energy savings and impacts of the extended DST period. The DOE may have also been interested in studying how the change affected consumer behavior, such as whether individuals adjusted their energy use in response to the altered DST period.
