The withdrawal method, also known as "pulling out," is an example of a poor birth control method. This involves the male partner withdrawing his penis before ejaculating during intercourse, in an attempt to prevent sperm from reaching the female's uterus. However, this method is unreliable as it can be difficult to time correctly and pre-ejaculate can still contain sperm. It is estimated to have a failure rate of 22% with typical use.
