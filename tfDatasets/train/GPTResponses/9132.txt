The rapid development of British rule caused significant changes in India, including social, economic, and political changes.1. Economic changes: Under the British rule, India became a large producer and exporter of raw materials like cotton, jute, tea, and indigo, transforming the Indian economy into a plantation economy. However, India's economy remained dependent on Britain, and Indian industries could not compete with the cheaper and more efficient British goods, leading to the decline of indigenous industries.2. Social changes: British rule brought Western education to India, leading to the emergence of a new middle class, who adopted English language and culture. The British rule also led to the growth of Christian missionaries and the spread of the Christian religion, which led to the erosion of traditional Indian culture.3. Political changes: The British colonial rule centralized political power, which was previously decentralized under various regional rulers. India's political system increased its efficiency, but Indian subjects saw the powerlessness of Indian rulers and the disregard for Indian laws as oppressive.Overall, the development of British rule brought progress and underdevelopment, laying the foundation for India's eventual independence.
