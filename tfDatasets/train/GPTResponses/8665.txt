Many newer churches started growing in Nigeria in the late 20th century, particularly in the 1980s and 1990s. This period saw a rise in the popularity of Pentecostalism and Charismatic Christianity, which led to the establishment of numerous new churches across the country. The growth of these churches was also facilitated by the rise of mass media, which enabled pastors to reach a wider audience through television and radio broadcasts.
