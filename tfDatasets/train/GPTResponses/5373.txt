Some biblical scholars claim that Jesus' family did not fully accept or understand his message during his ministry. In fact, there are instances in the Bible where Jesus' family members are portrayed as being skeptical of his teachings and even questioning his sanity. Mark 3:21, for example, states that "When his family heard about this, they went to take charge of him, for they said, 'He is out of his mind.'" However, after Jesus' death and resurrection, some of his family members became prominent leaders in the early Christian church, including his brother James who is believed to have written the biblical book of James.
