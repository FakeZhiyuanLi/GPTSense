The most commonly used transliteration system today is the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), which is used to transcribe the sounds of speech in any language. However, there are also country-specific transliteration systems used in different regions of the world, such as the Romanization of Russian, which uses the Latin alphabet to represent Cyrillic characters.
