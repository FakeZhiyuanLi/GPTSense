The tradition with a newborn boy's hair may vary depending on culture and religion. In some cultures, the first haircut is a significant event and is performed with a ceremony or ritual. For example, in Hindu culture, the first haircut is known as "Mundan" and is a sacred tradition performed when the baby is four or five months old. The hair is considered impure and, therefore, is shaved off.In some cultures, the hair is saved and offered as a gift to the gods. It is believed that the gods will bless the baby and protect them from harm. In other cultures, the hair is mixed with clay and buried in a special ritual to symbolize the baby's connection to the Earth.In modern times, some parents choose to keep a lock of baby hair as a keepsake or to commemorate the baby's first haircut. Others may choose to simply discard the hair, and it is not considered significant.
