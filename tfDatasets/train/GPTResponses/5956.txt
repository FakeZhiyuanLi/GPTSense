Multinational corporations are increasingly relying on organizations that specialize in data analytics, digital technology, and artificial intelligence to improve their operations and gain a competitive advantage. They may also rely on organizations that provide outsourcing services for certain business functions, such as customer service, accounting, or manufacturing. Additionally, they may partner with government agencies or non-governmental organizations to address issues related to sustainability, labor rights, and social responsibility.
