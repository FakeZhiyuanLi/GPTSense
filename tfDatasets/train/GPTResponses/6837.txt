Downloaders wanted to help independent artists and musicians by avoiding studios and record companies. They believed that these entities often took a large share of profits and controlled the creative freedom of artists. By downloading music directly from independent artists, they felt they were supporting the artist directly and allowing them to have more control over their own careers.
