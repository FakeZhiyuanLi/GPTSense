The sounding of the division bell traditionally signifies the start of a parliamentary session or a vote in the UK House of Commons. It alerts members of parliament to return to the Chamber to participate in the proceedings, and ensures that a quorum is maintained for important decisions. The term "division" refers to the process by which members physically divide into two groups, indicating their vote either for or against a proposed motion.
