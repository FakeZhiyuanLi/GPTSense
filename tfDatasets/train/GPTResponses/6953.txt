The molecular weight of a gas is inversely proportional to its thermal conductivity. This means that gases with lower molecular weights tend to have higher thermal conductivities. This is because gases with lighter molecules have higher velocities and more collisions in a given volume, which leads to better heat transfer. Conversely, gases with heavier molecules tend to have lower thermal conductivities due to slower molecular velocities and fewer collisions. Therefore, thermal conductivity increases with decreasing molecular weight of the gas.
