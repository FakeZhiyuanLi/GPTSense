The theory that is based off of projectiles' motion is called projectile motion theory. It explains the motion of objects that are launched into the air and are subject to gravity and air resistance. Projectile motion theory is essential in fields such as physics, engineering, and sports science, as it helps to determine the trajectory and range of a projectile.
