Macronutrients provide structural components for the body's tissues and organs. For example, proteins are used to build and repair muscle tissues, while carbohydrates are used to make cell walls and provide structural support for the body. Additionally, fats are used to provide insulation and protection for organs, as well as to help regulate various bodily processes. These structural roles are just as important as their energy-providing functions in maintaining overall health and well-being.
