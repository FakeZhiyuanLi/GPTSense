Prokaryotes typically store their genomes in circular DNA molecules known as plasmids or in a single, circular chromosome that is located in the cytoplasm. The genome is unbound by any membrane-bound nucleus or other organelle.In some species of prokaryotes, genetic material can also be stored in small segments of circular DNA called episomes, which have the ability to replicate independently of the chromosome. Additionally, some prokaryotes, such as bacteria, may exchange genetic material through mechanisms such as horizontal gene transfer, allowing for genes from different individuals or species to be incorporated into their genome.
