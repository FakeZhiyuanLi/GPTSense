The Byzantine historian Theophylact Simocatta mentions Daurentius in his work "History" (Book VII, Chapter 9), where he recounts the events of the Byzantine-Avar War of 577-579. According to Simocatta, Daurentius was a Byzantine soldier who, in the service of the emperor Tiberius II, killed an Avar envoy of Khagan Bayan I during a diplomatic mission.
