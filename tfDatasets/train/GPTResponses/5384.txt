is sometimes called an "Aircraft on Ground" (AOG) situation. The amount of time that an aircraft is out of action depends on the extent of the damage and the availability of spare parts and qualified maintenance personnel to fix it. In some cases, it may only take a few hours to fix minor damage, while in more severe cases, it could take several days or even weeks. During this time, airlines may have to find alternative aircraft or adjust their schedules to accommodate the loss of the affected aircraft.
