Health courses are typically required in both public and private schools at various levels, including elementary, middle, and high schools. In some states, health education is mandated by law and students are required to take a certain number of health-related courses to graduate. Additionally, health courses may be required for students pursuing degrees in health-related fields such as nursing, physical therapy, and medicine.
