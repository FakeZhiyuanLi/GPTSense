The Times continued to use courtesy titles for names of individuals in references after the first mention. This is a common practice in journalism and writing to show respect and formality in addressing an individual. For example, if a person's name is John Smith, The Times may refer to him as Mr. Smith in subsequent mentions of his name in the article.
