It is difficult to pinpoint an exact date, but dogs have been used as therapy animals for many years, with documented cases dating back to the early 20th century. However, the use of therapy dogs became more widespread in the 1970s, particularly in medical settings such as hospitals and nursing homes. Today, therapy dogs are also used in schools, prisons, and for veterans suffering from PTSD.
