If I were to go to the northern part of New Haven, I would find the following districts:- Dixwell- Newhallville- Westville (partially in the northern area)- Prospect Hill (partially in the northern area)- Beaver Hills (partially in the northern area)- East Rock (also partially in the northern area)Note: The division of neighborhoods within New Haven is not always exact, as some neighborhoods overlap or include only parts of others.
