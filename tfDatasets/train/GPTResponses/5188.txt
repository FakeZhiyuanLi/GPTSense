In the Orthodox Church, only venerative images of Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary, and saints are allowed to be venerated and prayed before. These icons must also be written according to certain guidelines and be approved by the church authorities. Icons of other religious figures, such as angels or demons, are not allowed to be venerated. Additionally, the veneration of icons is not considered idolatry, as the Orthodox Church teaches that icons serve as a visual aid to connect with the spiritual reality they represent.
