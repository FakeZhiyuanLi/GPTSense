Muscle movements used for digestion are:1. Peristalsis: Involuntary muscle contractions that move food through the digestive system.2. Segmentation: Contraction and relaxation of the circular muscles in the digestive tract that mix and break down food.3. Sphincter contraction: Closing and opening of the sphincters along the digestive tract that control the flow of food and prevent backflow.4. Esophageal sphincter relaxation: Relaxation of the esophageal sphincter at the top of the stomach to allow food to enter.5. Gastric muscles contraction: Contraction of the muscles in the stomach wall to grind and mix food with digestive juices.6. Intestinal muscle contraction: Contraction of the muscles in the intestinal wall to propel food forward and absorb nutrients.7. Rectal muscle relaxation: Relaxation of the rectal muscles to allow elimination of waste material.
