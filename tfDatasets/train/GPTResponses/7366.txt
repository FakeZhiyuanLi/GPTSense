Various opposition groups and international organizations raised concerns of fraud in the 2012 elections held in Burma (Myanmar), including the National League for Democracy, the United States government, and the European Union. These concerns were related to irregularities such as voter intimidation and discrimination, ballot box stuffing, and inaccurate voter lists. Despite these concerns, the Union Solidarity and Development Party, backed by the military, won a majority of seats in the parliament.
