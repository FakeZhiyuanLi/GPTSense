Hormones are moved around the plant through the xylem and phloem vessels. Xylem vessels transport water and minerals from the roots to the leaves and other parts of the plant, and hormones can travel through these vessels as they move along. Phloem vessels, on the other hand, transport sugars and other organic compounds from the leaves to various parts of the plant, and hormones can also travel through these vessels as they move along. Hormones can also be produced in one part of the plant and travel to another part via diffusion or active transport. Additionally, some hormones can be transported in the form of gases and may diffuse through cell membranes to reach their target cells.
