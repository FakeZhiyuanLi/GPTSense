The papal summer residence is the Apostolic Palace of Castel Gandolfo, located in Castel Gandolfo, a small town in the Alban Hills outside of Rome, Italy. It was considered to be the traditional summer residence of the popes since the 17th century. However, since Pope Francis' papacy, the palace has been opened to the public as a museum and conference center, and the pope has chosen to reside in the Vatican City throughout the year, breaking away from the centuries-old tradition.
