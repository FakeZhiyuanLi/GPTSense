One of the major influences on the early Christian philosophy of Augustine of Hippo was the writings of the Neoplatonic philosopher, Plotinus. Augustine was also influenced by the teachings of Ambrose of Milan, a bishop who introduced him to the Scriptures and helped him to further develop his understanding of Christianity. Additionally, Augustine was influenced by the Manichean heresy, which he was a part of before converting to Christianity, and the writings of the apostle Paul.
