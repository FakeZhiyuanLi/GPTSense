Shia Muslims believe that the divine knowledge and authority are possessed by the 12 Imams, who are the descendants of the Prophet Muhammad through his daughter Fatimah and her husband Ali. The 12 Imams are believed to have been appointed by Allah to succeed the Prophet Muhammad as leaders of the Muslim community, and they are considered to be infallible and sinless. The last Imam is believed by Shia Muslims to be in hiding and will return as the Mahdi, who will bring justice and righteousness to the world.
