There are several factors that have increased the power of the House of Commons:1. Executive accountability: The House of Commons is responsible for holding the executive (government) accountable for its actions. This means that the government must answer to parliament for its policies, decisions, and use of public funds. As the power of the executive has increased in recent decades, so has the power of parliament to scrutinize and question it.2. Judicial review: The House of Commons has the power to pass laws and make decisions that are subject to review by the courts. This increases its power by giving it the ability to shape legal and policy outcomes that are enforced by the judicial branch.3. Party discipline: The role of political parties in the House of Commons has grown in recent decades. This has meant that MPs are more likely to vote along party lines, which gives party leaders greater control over parliamentary business and makes it easier for them to pass legislation.4. Public engagement: The growing importance of social media and other forms of communication have made it easier for citizens to engage with their elected representatives. This has given the public a greater voice in parliamentary debates and has increased the power of individual MPs to shape public opinion.5. Parliamentary privilege: Parliament has a set of legal and procedural privileges that allow it to operate independently of other branches of government. This includes the power to summon witnesses, to compel documents, and to speak without fear of legal repercussions. These privileges give the House of Commons greater power to investigate and hold the government to account.
