The rule of precedent was allowed because it provides consistency and predictability in the legal system. It ensures that previous decisions made by higher courts are followed and applied in future cases of a similar nature. This promotes fairness and equality by treating similar cases in the same way. Additionally, the rule of precedent allows for the development of the law through the accumulation of judicial decisions over time.
