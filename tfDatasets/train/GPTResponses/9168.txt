Before the modern schooling system was established in Hungary, children were usually taught at home by their parents or by community members, such as church leaders or skilled tradesmen. The education was focused on basic literacy and numeracy skills, as well as religious education and practical skills related to agriculture, handicrafts or trades. In some cases, children from wealthy families had the opportunity to receive private tutoring from educated individuals, such as professors or language teachers.
