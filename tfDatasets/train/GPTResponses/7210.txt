early humans?Modern humans, or Homo sapiens, are the only survivors of several species of early humans, such as Homo erectus, Homo habilis, and Homo neanderthalensis. These species lived alongside each other and even interbred to some extent, but only Homo sapiens has survived until today. This is likely due to a combination of factors such as adaptation to changing environments, innovative technology and social organization, and competition with other hominid species.
