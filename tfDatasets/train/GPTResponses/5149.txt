The protocol on environmental protection seeks to regulate the protection of the Antarctic environment and dependent and associated ecosystems. It includes provisions for waste management, environmental impact assessments, conservation of flora and fauna, and management of tourism and non-native species. It also establishes protected areas and designates the Antarctic as a natural reserve, devoted to peace and science.
