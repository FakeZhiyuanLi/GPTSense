During the 19th century, many word roots of German origin were rejected in favor of words with more common Slavic roots. This was particularly evident in the languages of Eastern Europe, where there was a strong movement to replace foreign loanwords with native terms. For example, in Polish, words like "kilk" (German: "paar") were replaced with "para," and "krawc" (German: "schneider") was replaced with "szewc." Similarly, in Czech, words like "hračka" (German: "spielzeug") were replaced with "hrátky," and "písmo" (German: "schrift") was replaced with "písmeno." These changes were part of a larger movement to promote national pride and linguistic purity.
