The number of councillors who choose the lord mayor varies depending on the specific city or locality in question. In some areas, the position of lord mayor may be chosen by a vote of the entire council, while in others it may be elected by a smaller group of councillors or even appointed by an external authority. Additionally, the specific structure and guidelines for choosing a lord mayor may be outlined in local laws and regulations that vary from place to place.
