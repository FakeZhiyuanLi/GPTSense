The consequence of the large loan defaults and MBS losses in 2007 was a worldwide financial crisis, commonly referred to as the Global Financial Crisis. This crisis had a severe impact on the global economy, resulting in a significant increase in unemployment rates, a decline in economic growth, and a decrease in living standards for millions of people around the world. It also resulted in the failure of several major banks and financial institutions and triggered a broader debate on financial regulations and the role of governments in the financial sector.
