is now known as the Mahasanghika school of Buddhism. This split occurred during the Second Buddhist council, which was held in Vaishali around 386 BCE. The Mahasanghikas believed in a more liberal interpretation of Buddhism and rejected some of the strict rules and regulations that were established by the winning party, the Theravadins. The Mahasanghikas also believed in the existence of a "supreme self" (atman), which contradicted the Buddhist teaching of anatman (no-self). However, despite these differences, both schools agreed on the fundamental teachings of the Buddha and the path to enlightenment.
