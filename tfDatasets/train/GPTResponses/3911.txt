A potential attack vector for utilities such as the power grid is a cyber attack on the computer systems and network infrastructure controlling the grid. Hackers could exploit vulnerabilities in these systems to gain unauthorized access and control, potentially leading to power outages, equipment damage or destruction, and disruption of critical infrastructure. Another possible attack vector is physical attacks, such as sabotage or terrorism, targeting power plants, transmission lines, and substation equipment. These attacks could also cause widespread power outages and damage to infrastructure.
