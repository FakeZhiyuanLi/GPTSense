Before the widespread use of binary system in computing, other systems such as decimal, hexadecimal, and even ternary (base-3) and quinary (base-5) were used to represent numbers in calculations and data storage. However, in the context of computers and digital electronics, the use of 0 and 1 in binary system became the natural choice due to the simplicity and reliability of electronic switches in representing these two states.
