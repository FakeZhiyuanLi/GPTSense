The transitional period between childhood and adulthood is viewed as adolescence. This is a time when an individual goes through a range of physical, emotional, and social changes as they move from childhood to adulthood. Adolescence is often characterized by increasing independence, self-discovery, and identity formation, as well as challenges such as puberty, peer pressure, and academic stress. It is a critical time for growth and development, and can set the stage for success or struggles later in life.
