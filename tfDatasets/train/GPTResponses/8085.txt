Bermuda's legal system is derived from English common law, which was introduced during the period of British colonial rule. The legal system is based on statutes and is administered by local courts, including the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals. The court system is independent of the government, and judges are appointed on the basis of their qualifications and experience. In addition to English common law, Bermuda's legal system has also been influenced by American legal principles and international law.
