Copper can be treated in several ways to give it a certain appearance, such as:1. Patina: By exposing copper to air and natural elements, it will gradually form a greenish-blue patina that gives it a rustic and aged look.2. Lacquer or varnish: Applying a lacquer or varnish to copper can protect it from tarnishing and give it a glossy or matte finish.3. Burnishing: This process involves polishing the copper surface with a burnishing tool, which creates a shiny, reflective surface.4. Chemical treatment: Copper can be treated with chemicals to produce a variety of colors, from turquoise to black, depending on the chemical used.5. Hammered or textured finish: Copper can be hammered or textured to create a unique and textured surface, giving it a handcrafted and artistic look.
