The regular garment of Somali women is the dirac. It is a long, loosely fitted dress that drapes over the body and is often made of light and breathable fabrics, such as cotton or silk. The dirac is typically paired with a headscarf called a hijab and worn with a petticoat and a slip underneath for modesty.
