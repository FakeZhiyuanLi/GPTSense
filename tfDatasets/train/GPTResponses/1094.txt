CPUs have been constructed with microprocessors since the 1970s. Intel introduced the first microprocessor, the Intel 4004, in 1971. This microprocessor was used in the design of the first single-chip microprocessor-based CPU, the Intel 8080, which was released in 1974. Since then, microprocessors have been an essential component in the design of CPUs for personal computers, game consoles, smartphones, and other electronic devices.
