The new Delhi town plan was influenced by British colonial architecture, notably the neoclassical style. The plan was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker, who were both trained in the neoclassical tradition. The buildings in Delhi reflect this style, with grand public buildings such as the Rashtrapati Bhavan and the Parliament House featuring classical columns, symmetrical designs, and grand facades. However, local architectural elements and materials were also incorporated, such as the use of red sandstone and intricate carvings inspired by Mughal architecture.
