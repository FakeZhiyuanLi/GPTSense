An endpoint can generate output streams in several ways, depending on the context in which it is used. Some possible examples include:1. A web server endpoint can generate HTTP response messages containing data or HTML pages in response to client requests.2. An IoT device endpoint can generate streams of sensor data, telemetry data, or device status updates, typically over a network protocol like MQTT or CoAP.3. A mobile device endpoint can generate output streams of app responses, notifications, or user-generated data, such as images or videos.4. A cloud service endpoint can generate output streams of processed data, analytics results, or notifications to other endpoints or applications.5. A streaming application endpoint can generate output streams of audio or video data, typically encoded using formats like MPEG, H.264 or H.265.Overall, the type and format of the output streams generated by an endpoint depend on the specific application or protocol being used, as well as the capabilities of the endpoint itself.
