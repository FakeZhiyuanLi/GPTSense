The oldest known method of studying the brain is through observation of symptoms and behaviors associated with brain injury or disease, dating back to the ancient Egyptians and Greeks. For example, Hippocrates observed and documented the symptoms of epilepsy, which is now known to be a neurological disorder. However, modern advancements in technology and techniques such as neuroimaging and electrophysiology have greatly improved our understanding of the brain.
