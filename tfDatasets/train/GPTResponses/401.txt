Concentrating solar power technologies have the following common features:1. Use of mirrors or lenses: All concentrating solar power technologies utilize mirrors or lenses to focus sunlight onto a central receiver.2. Thermal energy conversion: The focused sunlight is used to generate thermal energy, which is then converted to electricity through a variety of methods, such as steam turbines or Stirling engines.3. Large-scale electricity production: Concentrating solar power technologies are designed to generate large amounts of electricity, making them suitable for utility-scale power generation.4. Dependence on sunlight: As with all solar technologies, concentrating solar power requires sunlight to generate electricity and is therefore subject to weather conditions and time of day.5. Low greenhouse gas emissions: Concentrating solar power technologies generate electricity with a relatively low level of greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuel technologies.
