Some of the Islamist groups supported by the West later became seen as terrorists or extremist organizations. For example, the Taliban in Afghanistan, which received support from the United States during the Soviet-Afghan War, later became a terrorist group responsible for attacks on civilians and government buildings. Another group, Al Qaeda, was also supported by the United States government during the same war but later became known for conducting terrorist attacks against Western targets. The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) is also a group that emerged from the chaos of the Iraq War, and was initially supported by the West as part of the Syrian opposition but later became a notorious terrorist group with a global network.
