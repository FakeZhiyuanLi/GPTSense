are commonly referred to as oligarchs, or powerful business tycoons, over small business owners and the general population. They implemented economic policies that led to further income inequality and enriched the already wealthy few. This included reducing taxes on the wealthy, eliminating social programs that benefited the poor, and deregulating industries, allowing large corporations to dominate and exploit the market. The result was a system that favored the rich and powerful, while leaving the majority of the population struggling to make ends meet.
