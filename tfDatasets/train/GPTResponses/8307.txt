The first coup in Nigeria took place on January 15, 1966 and was led by a group of young army officers, mostly majors and captains, who called themselves the "Young Majors' Rebellion" or "January boys". The most prominent leaders of the group were Major Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu and Major Emmanuel Ifeajuna.
