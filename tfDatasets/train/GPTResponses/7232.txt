A semi-formal service for the "Lord's Day" is generally favored by most American Presbyterian churches. This type of service typically includes traditional elements such as hymns, prayers, readings from the Bible, and a sermon, but with a slightly less formal tone than a traditional or liturgical service. The atmosphere is usually reverent but relaxed, and there may be some opportunities for congregational participation, such as responsive readings or hymn singing. Overall, the goal is to create a welcoming and inclusive environment where worshippers can connect with God and with one another.
