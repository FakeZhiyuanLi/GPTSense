The second reform of the calendar was the adoption of the Gregorian calendar by many Catholic countries in October 1582. It was introduced by Pope Gregory XIII to reform the Julian calendar, which had become out of sync with the seasons due to a slight miscalculation in the length of a year. The new calendar omitted 10 days and introduced a leap year rule that is still in use today, resulting in a more accurate measurement of time.
