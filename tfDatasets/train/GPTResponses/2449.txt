International agreements can take various forms, such as memoranda of understanding, protocols, and declarations, among others. Unlike treaties, however, these agreements may not be legally binding or have the same level of authority as treaties under international law.Treaties are considered the most formal and binding form of international agreement. They require ratification by states and are generally considered to create legally binding obligations between the parties. Treaties are enforced by international law and may have a higher status than domestic law in some cases.On the other hand, other forms of agreements, such as memoranda of understanding or declarations, may be seen as more informal and less legally binding. These agreements are often used to establish cooperative frameworks or to signal intent between states, but they are not usually enforceable by international law.In summary, treaties carry more weight and are more legally binding than other forms of agreements under international law. Other forms of agreements may provide a framework for cooperation or signal intent between states, but they may not create legally binding obligations.
