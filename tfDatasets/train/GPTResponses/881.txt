Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell had a close professional and personal relationship. They collaborated on writing the landmark book "Principia Mathematica," which aimed to provide a solid mathematical foundation for all of physics. They also shared a philosophical interest in metaphysics, particularly the concepts of space and time. However, their relationship became strained after the publication of "Principia Mathematica," and they later held differing views on a number of philosophical issues.
