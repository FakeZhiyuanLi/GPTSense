is known as a paradox. The paradox is that if each of the four statements is true, then the first statement must be false, as it contradicts the other three. However, if the first statement is false, then the other three statements must also be false, as they are all contingent on the truth of the first statement. Therefore, the logic problem arises when trying to determine the truth value of the four statements, as they seem to be both true and false at the same time. This is known as the liar paradox or a self-referential paradox.
