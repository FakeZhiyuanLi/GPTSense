Some clergymen in the Church of England took issue with the theory of natural selection because it challenged the belief in divine creation as described in the Bible. They felt that the theory of natural selection was incompatible with the idea of God creating life and all living things. However, there were also clergymen who found ways to reconcile the theory of natural selection with their religious beliefs, seeing it as a manifestation of God's will. This led to ongoing debates and discussions among members of the clergy as well as the broader public about the relationship between science and religion.
