Yes, the Citizens' Commission to Investigate the FBI did take files from an FBI office in Media, Pennsylvania in 1971. The group, consisting of eight activists, broke into the office and stole thousands of classified documents, which they then mailed to newspapers around the country. The documents revealed the FBI's illegal surveillance and harassment of political dissidents, including activists in the civil rights and anti-war movements. The group never faced charges for their actions and their identities remained unknown for decades.
