Kaolin is not typically placed inside of a light bulb. Light bulbs typically contain a filament made of tungsten, along with an inert gas such as argon or nitrogen to prevent the filament from burning. Additionally, there is a glass or plastic bulb surrounding everything to protect and contain the filament and gas.
