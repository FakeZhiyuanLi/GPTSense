Most birds rely on a combination of instincts and environmental cues to navigate during migration. They use the sun, stars, and Earth's magnetic field to determine their direction, and they also use their sense of smell and memory to navigate familiar routes. Some birds also fly in flocks to benefit from the aerodynamic lift created by other birds' wings. During migration, birds typically fly at night, when the air is cooler and there are fewer predatory birds out, and rest and feed during the day. They may make several stops along their migration route to rest and refuel before continuing on their journey.
