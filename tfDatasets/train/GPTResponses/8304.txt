Charles Darwin may have feared upsetting the religious community, as his theory of evolution contradicted the traditional Christian belief of creationism, where God created all living beings as they are. He also may have worried about upsetting sociologists and philosophers, as his theory challenged the idea that humans were inherently superior to other animals. Additionally, he may have feared upsetting his colleagues in the scientific community, who were skeptical of his ideas and methods.
