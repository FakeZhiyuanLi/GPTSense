The prototype of ghetto house was the Chicago-based genre of music called house music, which emerged in the early 1980s. Ghetto house, also known as ghetto-tech, emerged in the mid-1990s as a subgenre of house music that incorporated elements of Chicago's urban dance culture with heavy bass and synthesizer sounds. Some of the pioneers of ghetto house include DJ Deeon, DJ Funk, DJ Godfather, and DJ Assault.
