Modern coil actuators can move in various directions depending on the specific design and application. Some coil actuators are designed to move linearly, meaning they can extend and retract in a straight line. Others are designed to rotate or oscillate back and forth. The direction of movement is determined by the arrangement of the coils and their magnetic field, as well as the position of the actuator's core or armature.
