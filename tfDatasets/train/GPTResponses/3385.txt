The coats of arms system was a system of heraldry, which is the art and science of designing, displaying, and interpreting armorial bearings (coats of arms), crests, and badges. This system was used to identify individuals, families, clans, and institutions, typically in the context of medieval warfare, where knights and soldiers would wear their coat of arms on their shield, banner, or surcoat to distinguish themselves on the battlefield. Over time, heraldry became associated with nobility and aristocracy, and the use of coats of arms spread beyond the battlefield to include civic and ecclesiastical organizations, as well as corporations and universities. Today, coats of arms are still in use in many countries, although their original military function has been largely replaced by their ceremonial and decorative role.
