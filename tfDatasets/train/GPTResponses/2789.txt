The genes necessary for performing basic cell functions are called housekeeping genes. These genes code for proteins that are essential for the maintenance of cellular functions such as cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and energy metabolism. Housekeeping genes are constitutively expressed in all cells and are necessary for the survival of the cell. Examples of housekeeping genes include beta-actin, GAPDH, and tubulin.
