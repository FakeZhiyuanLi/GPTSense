Assisted launch mechanisms are primarily used for launching large and heavy vehicles such as aircraft, rockets, and satellites into the sky or into space. These mechanisms provide an extra push or boost to the vehicle, which helps to overcome the force of gravity and propel it into the air or into orbit. Assisted launch mechanisms include tools such as rocket boosters, catapults, and aircraft carriers. These mechanisms are critical in enabling the safe and efficient launch of vehicles, both for commercial purposes and for scientific exploration.
