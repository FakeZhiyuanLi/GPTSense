the rest of the ship?The angled deck on an aircraft carrier separates the recovery operation area, where aircraft land and are secured, from the launch area where aircraft take off. The angled deck allows for simultaneous aircraft recovery and launch operations to occur, as aircraft can launch from the catapults on the launch area while others are being recovered on the recovery operation area. The angled deck also provides additional safety, as it allows aircraft that miss the arresting cables on the recovery area to be diverted away from parked aircraft and crew members on the carrier's deck.
