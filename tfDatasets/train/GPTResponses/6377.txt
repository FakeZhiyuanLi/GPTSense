Books can be used for the purpose of oath taking in any branch of government or legal system, depending on the specific customs and laws of that jurisdiction. For example, in a court of law, a witness may swear on a Bible or Quran to tell the truth, while in some government offices, officials may take an oath of office using a variety of books or documents. Ultimately, the choice of which book is used for oath taking depends on the individual's personal beliefs and the legal requirements of the situation.
