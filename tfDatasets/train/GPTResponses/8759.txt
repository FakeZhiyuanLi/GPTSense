Ernst Haeckel convinced Huxley that comparative anatomy and paleontology could provide evidence for the evolutionary relationships between different species. Haeckel believed that the similarities and differences in the structures of different organisms could be used to trace their evolutionary history and relationships, and Huxley was convinced of this approach. Huxley used comparative anatomy and paleontology to support his ideas about evolution, and he became a leading proponent of this approach in the scientific community.
