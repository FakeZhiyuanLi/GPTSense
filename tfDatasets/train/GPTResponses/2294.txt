The dominant theory of heredity prior to Mendel's work was the theory of blended inheritance or inheritance of acquired characteristics. According to this theory, offspring inherited a blend of traits from their parents with the traits of each parent being mixed together and diluted in the offspring. This theory was popularized by scientists such as Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and Charles Darwin, but it was later disproven by Mendel's experiments with pea plants which revealed the existence of discrete, independent factors (genes) that were transmitted from parents to offspring.
