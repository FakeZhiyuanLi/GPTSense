Some areas that experience periodic flooding from rapid snowmelt and runoff include:1. High-altitude regions such as mountains and plateaus that receive heavy snowfall in winter.2. River valleys and floodplains that are downstream from snow-covered mountains.3. Areas with extensive pavement and concrete surfaces, such as cities and urban areas, where rapid snowmelt and rainfall cannot be easily absorbed.4. Places with poor soil infiltration, such as hard, compacted soils and clay soils.5. Low-lying areas near coastal regions and river deltas, where snowmelt and rainfall can cause tidal surges and river flooding.
