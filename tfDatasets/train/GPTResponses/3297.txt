A court needs sufficient evidence and proof of the nobility member's wrongdoing or crime to impose imprisonment. The court may also need to follow the appropriate legal procedures and ensure that the accused have received a fair trial. Additionally, depending on the country and its legal system, the court may need to consider the individual's social status and determine if they have immunity or special privileges. Ultimately, the decision to imprison a member of the nobility should be based on the principle of equal treatment under the law.
