alternative splicing variants. The human genome project revealed that genes can produce multiple variants of mRNA by changing the way exons are spliced together. This leads to different protein isoforms with unique functions and can explain the diversity of biological processes in humans. Additionally, the project identified many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that can affect gene expression and contribute to individual differences in health and disease susceptibility.
