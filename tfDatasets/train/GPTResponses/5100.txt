The starting point on the runway for a vaulter is typically determined by their skill level and personal preference, as well as the rules and regulations of the competition. Generally, more experienced and skilled vaulters may start farther back on the runway to build up more momentum, while less experienced or younger athletes may start closer to the box to ensure a safe and smooth takeoff. Other factors such as wind direction and speed may also play a role in determining the starting point.
