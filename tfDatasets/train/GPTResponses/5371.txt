Elizabeth's father, King George VI, became the king after the abdication of his older brother, King Edward VIII. King Edward VIII gave up the throne in 1936 to marry the American socialite Wallis Simpson, which was considered scandalous at the time. As a result, the crown was passed onto George VI, who was then the Duke of York, and Elizabeth became the heir presumptive to the throne.
