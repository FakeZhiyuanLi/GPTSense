A symphony orchestra typically has a larger variety of instruments, including strings (violin, viola, cello, bass), woodwinds (flute, clarinet, oboe, bassoon), brass (trumpet, French horn, trombone, tuba), and percussion (drums, cymbals, timpani). Additionally, a symphony orchestra usually has a larger number of musicians, allowing for more complex and layered arrangements. The inclusion of string instruments, in particular, enables the orchestra to produce a wider range of tones and textures that are not possible with a concert band. Overall, symphony orchestras have a wider range of expressive possibilities, due to their larger ensemble size and broader range of instrumental timbres.
