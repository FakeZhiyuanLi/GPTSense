Ships with a smaller draft can move through Southampton water more easily due to the double high tide. The double high tide allows the water levels to rise and fall twice, creating more space for smaller ships to navigate through the area. However, larger ships with deeper drafts may still face limitations in navigating through Southampton water, even with the double high tide.
