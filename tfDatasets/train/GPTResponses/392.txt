The Brookings Institution reports that traditional banking systems do not have enough capital to close the lending gap, particularly in impoverished areas. This means that there is a lack of funds available for small businesses and individuals who need loans or credit. Additionally, traditional banking systems may be hesitant to provide loans to those with low credit scores or who have a higher risk of defaulting, which further exacerbates the lending gap.
