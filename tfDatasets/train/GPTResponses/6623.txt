There is no clear answer to this question as historical records do not specify which protestant group or individuals first reached out to the Catholic Church in Iceland in 1964. However, it is known that a group of Protestant pastors and theologians visited the Catholic Bishop of Iceland, Guðjón Samuelsson, in September 1964 to discuss possible ecumenical dialogue and cooperation. This meeting marked the beginning of a new era in relations between Catholics and Protestants in Iceland.
