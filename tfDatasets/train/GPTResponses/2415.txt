The shawl that married women traditionally wear on their upper bodies is called a pallu, also spelled as pallav or palli. It is a long, decorative piece of cloth that is draped over the head and shoulders, and often embellished with embroidery, prints, or embellishments. The pallu is an important part of traditional Indian attire such as sarees, salwar kameez, and lehenga cholis.
