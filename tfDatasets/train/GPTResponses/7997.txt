One example of a vitamin-like compound that is not considered an essential dietary nutrient is Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). CoQ10 is a crucial component of the electron transport chain in mitochondria, where it plays a role in energy production. While it is synthesized in the body and therefore not essential in the diet, some individuals may benefit from supplementation due to certain health conditions or medication use.
