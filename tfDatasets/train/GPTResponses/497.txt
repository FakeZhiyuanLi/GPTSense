The Masters of Technology (M.Tech) program was instituted in 2007 that brought master's degrees to the polytechnic education system. This program was aimed at providing advanced education and training to polytechnic graduates who wanted to specialize in a particular field. Before the introduction of the M.Tech program, polytechnic graduates could only pursue Bachelor's degrees or postgraduate diplomas/certificates. The M.Tech program is equivalent to a Master's degree and is designed to provide students with a more hands-on, practical approach to learning. It is offered in various fields, including engineering, technology, computer science, and management.
