Houston's land is primarily built on top of clay, silt, and other sedimentary materials that were deposited by the nearby rivers and bayous. Additionally, Houston's soil is composed of a mix of sandy loam and clay, which can affect the stability and composition of the ground. There are also a variety of rock formations beneath Houston's surface, including the Houston Formation of the Gulf Coast Series and the Eagle Ford Group of the Cretaceous Period, which have been extensively drilled and exploited for oil and gas.
