The patriation of the Canadian constitution did not remove anything from the constitution. Rather, it was a process by which Canada took control of its own constitution from Britain, and brought it under full Canadian authority. The main outcome of this process was the adoption of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms as part of the Constitution Act, 1982.
