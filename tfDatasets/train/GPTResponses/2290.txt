There were several factors that upset the peace of the church during the late Middle Ages:1. The Avignon Papacy - The papacy was moved from Rome to Avignon, France, in 1309 by Pope Clement V. This resulted in a loss of power for the Roman Catholic Church in Italy and created a division between the French-controlled papacy and the Italian-controlled Church.2. The Great Schism - From 1378 to 1417, there were two or even three popes at once, causing a division within the Church. This was caused by a dispute over who should be the rightful pope, and it lasted for almost 40 years.3. The Black Death - The bubonic plague swept through Europe in the mid-14th century, killing millions of people, including many clergy. This led to a shortage of priests and a loss of faith in the Church's ability to protect its followers.4. The Crusades - The Crusades, which began in the 11th century, led to a series of wars between Christians and Muslims, causing religious tensions and divisions that persisted into the late Middle Ages.5. Corruption and Scandals - The Church was accused of being corrupt and immoral, with some clergy engaging in simony, nepotism, and other forms of misconduct. The sale of indulgences also became a controversial issue, leading to the Protestant Reformation.
