There is no one language that all Western languages can be considered dialects of, as the West includes many diverse linguistic families, such as Romance, Germanic, Slavic, Celtic, and Finno-Ugric. Each of these language families has their own common ancestor and unique characteristics, making it impossible to consider them all dialects of a single language.
