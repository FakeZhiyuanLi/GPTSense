The Rhine was regulated to prevent flooding, improve navigation and transport, and provide hydroelectric power. The regulation of the Rhine involved the construction of dams, dikes, and canals to control the river's flow, maintain its depth, and ensure its safety for investors and industrialists. The regulation of the Rhine started in the 19th century and continued into the 20th century, transforming the river into a vital economic artery for commerce and trade in Europe.
