One culinary staple of North Carolina is barbecued pork, specifically Eastern-style barbecue. This involves smoking the entire hog and then chopping or pulling the meat and serving it with a vinegar-based sauce. Another staple is fried chicken, usually served with sides such as collard greens, mashed potatoes, and cornbread. Sweet potato dishes, such as sweet potato pie and sweet potato biscuits, are also popular in North Carolina cuisine.
