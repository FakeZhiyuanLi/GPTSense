The primary cue for migration varies among different species of animals, but it is generally triggered by changes in environmental conditions such as seasonal changes, food availability, water availability, and climate. For example, many bird species migrate to breeding grounds in the spring to take advantage of abundant food sources, while others migrate to warmer areas in the winter to escape harsh weather conditions. Similarly, some marine animals such as whales and sea turtles migrate to warmer waters to mate and give birth, while others follow food sources such as plankton blooms. Overall, migration is a complex behavior that is influenced by many different factors, and animals have evolved to respond to these cues in order to survive and reproduce.
