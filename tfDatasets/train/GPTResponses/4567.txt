Copper is primarily extracted from its ores using the process of smelting. This involves heating the ore with a reducing agent such as coke, charcoal, or gas to extract the copper metal. Another method of extraction is leaching, where copper is dissolved from the ore using chemicals and then recovered from the solution.
