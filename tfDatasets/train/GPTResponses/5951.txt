No, the famous school in Alexandria was not religious only. The school of Alexandria was a center of intellectual and scientific inquiry that flourished in the Hellenistic period from the 3rd century BCE to the 4th century CE. Although it was located in a city with a strong Greek heritage, it attracted scholars from diverse religious backgrounds, including Jews, Christians, and Muslims. Its curriculum covered a range of fields, from philosophy and mathematics to medicine and astronomy. The famous Library of Alexandria was also a part of the school and held a vast collection of books from different cultures and traditions.
