The effective f-number is inversely proportional to the diameter of the aperture. This means that as the aperture diameter decreases, the effective f-number increases, resulting in a narrower depth of field and a decreased amount of light reaching the sensor. Conversely, as the aperture diameter increases, the effective f-number decreases, resulting in a wider depth of field and an increased amount of light reaching the sensor.
