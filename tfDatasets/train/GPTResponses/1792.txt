Classical compositions typically adhere to specific musical forms, such as sonatas, symphonies, and concertos, with clearly defined sections and themes that are developed throughout the piece. Additionally, classical composers often prioritize the balance and harmony of different instrumental and vocal parts, creating a sense of coherence and unity in their works. Classical music also typically features virtuosic performances by highly skilled instrumentalists and vocalists, showcasing the technical mastery and expressive capabilities of the performers.
