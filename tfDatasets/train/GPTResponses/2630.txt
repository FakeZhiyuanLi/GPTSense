One exception to the central dogma of molecular biology is the process of reverse transcription, where RNA is converted back into DNA. This is achieved by the enzyme reverse transcriptase, which is used by retroviruses such as HIV to convert their RNA genome into DNA for integration into the host cell genome. This process violates the general flow of information in the central dogma, where DNA is transcribed into RNA and then translated into protein.
