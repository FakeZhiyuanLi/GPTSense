Some large broad-winged birds, such as eagles and hawks, rely on thermals or columns of rising warm air to help them soar. By circling in these thermals, they can gain altitude and travel long distances with minimal effort. They also use their large wingspan and strong breast muscles to maintain their flight and navigate through changing wind conditions.
