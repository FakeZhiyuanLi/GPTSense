A referee's action can result in a no contest if they determine that the rules have been violated to a degree that the fight cannot continue fairly. For example, if a fighter suffers an accidental foul that renders them unable to continue, the referee may declare a no contest if they deem the foul to be severe enough that it would have had an impact on the outcome of the fight. Additionally, if the referee determines that a fighter has committed a deliberate and intentional foul that would have resulted in their disqualification, but the opponent cannot continue due to injury from that foul, the referee may declare a no contest.
