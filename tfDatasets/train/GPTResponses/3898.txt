A virtual space free of any government intervention is often referred to as a "decentralized" or "unregulated" space. Examples of such spaces include blockchain-based networks and peer-to-peer sharing platforms. These spaces are created and maintained by the users themselves, with no central authority administering the transactions or activities within the platform. This lack of government intervention allows for individuals to interact and exchange value freely, without the restrictions imposed by regulations and laws.
