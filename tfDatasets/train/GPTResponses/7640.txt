Intellectual history and social history are used in the field of historical research and analysis. Intellectual history focuses on the evolution of ideas and concepts, exploring the intellectual origins, development and impact of these ideas to social, political and cultural transformation. Social history, on the other hand, examines society as a whole, its structure, communities, and cultural practices by analyzing the behavior and experiences of individuals and groups, their relations with society, economy and politics. Both intellectual and social history provide complementary perspectives for understanding historical events, social movements, and cultural changes over time. They employ interdisciplinary approaches to illuminating historical phenomena, combining theories and methods from fields such as philosophy, sociology, anthropology, politics, and cultural studies.
