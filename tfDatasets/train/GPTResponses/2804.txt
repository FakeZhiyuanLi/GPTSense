Spanish Jews were pressured into converting to Christianity during the Spanish Inquisition in the late 15th century. The ruling monarchs, Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, believed that the presence of Jews in Spain created intolerance and religious conflict that hindered the unity of the country. They issued several edicts that demanded the expulsion of Jews and offered the option of conversion or death. As a result, many Spanish Jews converted to Christianity, although many continued to practice their faith secretly. These converted Jews were known as conversos or New Christians.
