This statement is false. There have been several presidential candidates who have failed to win any counties in Oklahoma twice, including George Wallace in 1968 and Ross Perot in 1992 and 1996. It is also unclear what time period this statement is referring to, as there have been many presidential elections in which candidates did not win any counties in Oklahoma.
