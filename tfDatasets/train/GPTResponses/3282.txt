The United Nations (UN) and the pre-constitutional United States federal government have been compared in several aspects, including:1. Limited power: Both entities have limited power. The pre-constitutional United States federal government lacked the authority to tax or regulate commerce, while the UN has limited authority to enforce its decisions.2. Sovereign states: Both the pre-constitutional United States federal government and the UN are composed of sovereign states. In the case of the pre-constitutional United States, the states were largely independent and had control over important policy areas. In the UN, member states retain their sovereignty and have the final say on key decisions.3. Representation: Both the pre-constitutional United States federal government and the UN are designed to represent the interests of its members. In the case of the pre-constitutional United States, states were represented in Congress, while in the UN, member states are represented by their appointed ambassadors.4. Weak central government: The pre-constitutional United States federal government had a weak central government that lacked the authority to enforce its decisions. Similarly, the UN has a weak central government that lacks enforcement mechanisms and relies heavily on member states' cooperation.5. Checks and balances: Both the pre-constitutional United States federal government and the UN have some form of checks and balances. In the pre-constitutional United States, the states played a vital checking role on the federal government while the UN relies on the Security Council, the General Assembly, and other subsidiary organs to check each other's power.
