Neo-gothic was popularized by influential figures starting in the mid-18th century and reaching its peak in the 19th century. Some of the key figures of the movement include architects such as Augustus Welby Pugin and John Ruskin, writers such as Victor Hugo and Edgar Allan Poe, and artists such as William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones. The Gothic Revival movement, which encompassed neo-gothic styles, was also fueled by the interest in medieval architecture and literature during the Romantic period.
