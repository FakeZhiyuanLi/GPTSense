There were several scripts used in the northwest of India throughout history, including Brahmi, Kharoshthi, and Gurmukhi. Brahmi was the earliest script used in the region and was used to write various languages including Sanskrit, Prakrit, and Pali. Kharoshthi was used specifically for writing the Gandhari language in the northwest region during the period of the Indo-Greek kingdoms. Gurmukhi script was developed in the 16th century by Guru Angad, the second Sikh Guru, and is used to write the Punjabi language.
