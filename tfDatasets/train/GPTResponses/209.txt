There are many scientists who have contributed to our understanding of space and developed means of viewing it, but some notable ones include:- Galileo Galilei: In the early 17th century, Galileo constructed a telescope that allowed him to observe the moons of Jupiter, the phases of Venus, and the rugged surface of the Moon, among other celestial objects. This helped to support the heliocentric (sun-centered) model of the solar system and sparked a revolution in astronomy.- Isaac Newton: In the late 17th century, Newton developed mathematical laws of motion and gravity that explained the motions of the planets and other objects in the solar system. His work laid the foundation for modern physics and astronomy.- William Herschel: In the late 18th century, Herschel built a series of large telescopes that enabled him to discover numerous new objects in the solar system and beyond, including the planet Uranus and many galaxies and nebulae. He also catalogued thousands of stars and developed methods for measuring their distances.- Edwin Hubble: In the early 20th century, Hubble used the most powerful telescopes of his time to observe distant galaxies and discovered that the universe is expanding, providing the first evidence for the Big Bang theory of the universe's origin.- Vera Rubin: In the mid-20th century, Rubin used observations of the motions of stars and galaxies to provide evidence for the existence of dark matter, a mysterious substance that makes up most of the matter in the universe but does not emit or absorb light.
