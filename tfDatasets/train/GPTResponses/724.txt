The role of the head of state in Westminster-based parliamentary governments, such as the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, is largely ceremonial and symbolic. The head of state, which is typically a monarch or a representative of the monarch, performs various constitutional and ceremonial duties, such as opening and closing parliament, granting royal assent to bills, and receiving foreign dignitaries.However, in practice, the head of state has virtually no power to directly influence the government or the legislative process. The real power is held by the head of government (such as the Prime Minister in the UK), who is responsible for leading the government, appointing ministers, and making policy decisions.
