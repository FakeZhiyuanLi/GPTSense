The British of the 19th century wanted India to be a profitable colony that could provide them with resources, raw materials, and manpower for their industries and economy. They also aimed to establish Western-style governance, education, infrastructure, and legal systems in India, which would enable them to exert greater control and influence over the region. Additionally, they sought to spread Christianity and European values and culture in India, as they believed them to be superior to Indian traditions and customs. Overall, the British imperialists wanted India to be a subservient and dependent colony, serving their economic and strategic interests.
