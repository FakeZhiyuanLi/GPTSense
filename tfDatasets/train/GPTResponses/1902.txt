One cause of genetic variation in relative frequencies of different alleles in a population is natural selection, where certain alleles are favored over others based on their ability to survive and reproduce in a given environment. Another cause could be genetic drift, where random events such as genetic mutations or chance events can affect the relative frequencies of alleles in a population. Gene flow, migration, and genetic bottleneck events can also contribute to genetic variation.
