Viruses require a host cell to replicate and produce new viral particles, while bacteria can reproduce on their own without the need for a host cell. This makes it more difficult to create a vaccine for viruses as they require a more intricate understanding of their replication cycle and the host cell interaction. Additionally, viruses can mutate rapidly, making it challenging to create a vaccine that can provide long-term protection against various strains of the virus.
