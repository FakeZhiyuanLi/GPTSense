During the Cambrian period, there was no distinct East Antarctica as we know it today. The landmasses that now make up Antarctica were part of the supercontinent Gondwana and were situated near the South Pole. However, they were not completely covered by ice and had a temperate climate. The exact location and size of the landmasses that make up modern-day East Antarctica during the Cambrian period are difficult to determine due to geological changes and plate tectonics over millions of years.
