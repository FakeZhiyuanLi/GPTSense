The ancient religion of Tibet is called Bon or BÃ¶n, which is a pre-Buddhist indigenous religion that originated in Tibet before the introduction of Buddhism. It is a shamanistic and animistic religion that believes in the presence of spirits and gods in the natural world, and involves complex rituals and practices to appease them. The Bon religion has been influenced by Buddhism over the centuries and has evolved into a more syncretic and integrated form, known as Tibetan Buddhism.
