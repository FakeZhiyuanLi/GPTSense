The president of the United States might prefer the formal treaty process for agreements that impose legal obligations on the US that are considered to be substantial, permanent, and difficult to reverse, such as those related to national defense, diplomacy, and trade. This is because treaties ratified through the formal process would have the force of law and could only be amended or repealed through the same formal process, which requires the approval of two-thirds of the Senate. This provides more stability and certainty for US foreign policy and ensures that the US remains committed to its international obligations.
