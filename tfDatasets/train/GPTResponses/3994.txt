A listener can hear multiple frequencies simultaneously, but the number of frequencies they can distinguish and differentiate depends on several factors such as age, hearing ability, and attention span. Generally, an average person can hear and distinguish between 20 to 20,000 Hz of frequency. However, some people with exceptional hearing abilities can hear frequencies beyond this range.
