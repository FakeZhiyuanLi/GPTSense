A partially conscious wrestler may stumble around, struggle to stand or maintain balance, have difficulty speaking, and may not be able to fully comprehend their surroundings or what is happening to them. They may also make erratic or uncoordinated movements, and their ability to defend themselves or execute wrestling moves may be impaired. It is important for the wrestler's safety to be assessed by a medical professional if they are exhibiting signs of semi-consciousness.
