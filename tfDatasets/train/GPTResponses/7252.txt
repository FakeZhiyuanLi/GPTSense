Among the emerging Protestant and evangelical churches, some clergy are moving away from traditional church structures and hierarchies. Many are focusing more on community-building and engaging in social justice work, rather than strictly adhering to doctrinal or theological beliefs. Some clergy are also moving away from the concept of a "professional" clergy, and instead are emphasizing the priesthood of all believers, where every member of the community is seen as having their own gifts and abilities to contribute to the group. Additionally, some are moving away from reliance on external authority (such as a specific denomination or leader), and instead emphasizing the individual's direct relationship with God or a higher power.
