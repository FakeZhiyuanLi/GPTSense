The Gothic Revival architect and writer Augustus Pugin was one of the leading advocates for allowing as much light as possible into cathedral buildings. He believed that light symbolized the presence of God and that it was essential for creating a spiritual atmosphere within the building. Pugin's writings and designs heavily influenced the Gothic Revival movement and influenced many architects to incorporate more and larger windows in their designs.
