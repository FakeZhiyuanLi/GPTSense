The fungus known to cause uranium content in its symbiotic plant roots to increase is called arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). AMF have been found to enhance the uptake of uranium by plants by increasing the surface area of the plant roots and by mobilizing uranium in the soil through solubilization and chelation processes. This can be beneficial in certain applications, such as in phytoremediation of uranium-contaminated soils.
