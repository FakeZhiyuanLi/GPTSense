Political corruption is hard to get rid of even in developed countries. This is because politicians have access to power and resources that can be used to influence decision-making in their favor, and there is often a lack of transparency and accountability in political systems. Additionally, political corruption can become entrenched over time as certain groups or individuals gain power and use it to maintain their position. Therefore, strong political will, effective legal enforcement, and civic engagement are necessary to combat political corruption in developed countries.
