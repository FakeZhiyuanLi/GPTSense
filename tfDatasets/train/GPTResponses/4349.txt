Hopped wort becomes beer during the fermentation phase. The yeast is added to the hopped wort, and it consumes the fermentable sugars in the wort and produces alcohol and carbon dioxide. This is the process that transforms the hopped wort into beer. After fermentation is complete, the beer is typically aged and carbonated before it is ready to be bottled or kegged.
