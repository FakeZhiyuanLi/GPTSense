The theologians of Cologne, Germany gave the Dominican Order resistance during the high Middle Ages in the mid-13th century. They challenged the Dominican belief in the primacy of divine grace over human free will, leading to a controversy known as the "Dominican-Franciscan controversy" or the "Great Debate". The dispute was eventually resolved in favor of the Dominicans at the Council of Lyon in 1274.
