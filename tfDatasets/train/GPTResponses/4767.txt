The advent of carrier-launched aircraft as focal weapons was driven by several factors:1. The need for mobile air power: As modern warfare became more dynamic and fluid, it became increasingly important to have air power that could be rapidly deployed and relocated as needed. Aircraft carriers met this need by providing a mobile platform from which aircraft could operate.2. Improved aircraft technology: Advances in aircraft design and technology made it possible for planes to take off and land on short runways, which helped make carrier operations more feasible.3. Strategic considerations: In the early 20th century, naval strategists realized that aircraft could provide a tactical advantage over other naval assets, such as battleships. Developing carrier-launched aircraft allowed naval forces to project air power beyond the range of land-based aircraft and extend their influence over large areas of the world's oceans.4. World War II: The conflict in the Pacific theater of World War II demonstrated the effectiveness of carrier-launched aircraft in modern warfare. The ability of carriers to launch and recover planes quickly and efficiently helped allied forces gain the upper hand in many battles.Overall, the advent of carrier-launched aircraft was driven by a combination of technological, strategic, and operational factors, and it has played a critical role in modern military operations ever since.
