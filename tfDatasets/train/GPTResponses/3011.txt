Less efficient storage for VBR encoding can result in lower quality of the encoded audio file, as the encoder may need to use a higher bitrate to maintain the desired level of quality. This can result in larger file sizes and longer encoding times. Additionally, if the available storage is not enough to accommodate the required bitrate, the encoder may need to use a lower quality setting, resulting in further degradation of the audio quality.
