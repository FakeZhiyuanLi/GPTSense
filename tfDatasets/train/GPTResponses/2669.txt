The New Delhi town plan was chosen primarily to symbolize the power and grandeur of the British Empire in India. The urban design was intended to showcase British authority and control over the Indian subcontinent by creating public spaces and monumental architecture that projected an image of British superiority. The plan aimed to consolidate British rule by creating a new imperial capital that would serve as a physical manifestation of British power and influence in India.
