During the Cretaceous period, Antarctica had a warmer climate than it does today, with temperatures ranging between 0°C to 20°C. The continent was covered in dense forests, and the coastal areas were swampy with abundant plant and animal life. The higher temperatures were due to its location closer to the equator and its position as part of the supercontinent Gondwana, which had a more tropical climate. However, by the end of the Cretaceous period, Antarctica began to experience cooling, leading to the formation of ice sheets that cover the continent today.
