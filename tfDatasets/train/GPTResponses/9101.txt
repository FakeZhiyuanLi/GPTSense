One major figure who was thought to be influenced by continental anabaptists was Menno Simons, the founder of the Mennonite Church. Other religious groups that are believed to have been influenced by anabaptist teachings include the Amish and Hutterites. Some scholars also argue that early Quakers were influenced by anabaptist beliefs.
