The Soviet Union gained political-military influence and control over most Slavic-majority nations after World War II, specifically from the late 1940s to the early 1950s. Some countries, such as Poland and Czechoslovakia, were subjected to Soviet domination through military occupation and political interference, while others, such as Yugoslavia, maintained a degree of independence by pursuing a non-aligned foreign policy. However, the Soviet Union's dominance over the region continued until its collapse in 1991.
