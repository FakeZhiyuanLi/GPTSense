Yes, pesticides can have serious effects on people, especially if they are exposed to them at high levels or over a long period of time. Pesticides are designed to kill pests, so they can also harm humans if they are not used properly. Some of the health effects associated with pesticide exposure include respiratory problems, skin irritation, eye irritation, neurological issues, reproductive problems, and even cancer. Children, pregnant women, and those with weakened immune systems are particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of pesticides. It is important to follow safety guidelines and take precautions when using pesticides to minimize exposure and protect against their harmful effects.
