A tree usually grows the fastest during its early life stages, particularly during the first few years after it is planted. During this time, the tree is focused on establishing a strong root system and developing its structure. As the tree gets older, its growth rate typically slows down as it starts to focus more on producing branches, leaves, and fruit. However, the growth rate can vary depending on the species of the tree, environmental factors, and other variables.
