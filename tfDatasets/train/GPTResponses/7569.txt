The USB standard specifies the following tolerances for compliant USB connectors:1. Maximum insertion force: 8.0 N (newtons)2. Maximum extraction force: 1.0 N3. Operating temperature range: -25 °C to 85 °C4. Relative humidity range: 0% to 90%5. Durability: 1,500 mating cycles minimum (for standard USB connectors)6. Contact resistance: ≤25 mΩ (milliohms)7. Insulation resistance: ≥100 MΩ8. Dielectric withstand voltage: 500 VAC (volts AC) for 1 minute9. Cable retention force: 89 N minimum (for USB 2.0 and earlier), 178 N minimum (for USB 3.0 and later)These tolerances ensure that USB connectors are reliable and can withstand frequent use without degrading in performance or functionality.
