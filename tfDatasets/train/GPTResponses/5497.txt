Pharmaceutical fraud involves any type of unlawful or unethical activity committed by pharmaceutical companies or individuals working within the pharmaceutical industry. These activities can include things like intentionally misrepresenting the effectiveness or safety of a drug, falsifying clinical trial data to gain regulatory approval, or engaging in bribery or kickback schemes to incentivize healthcare providers to prescribe certain medications. Pharmaceutical fraud can cause harm to patients, lead to increased healthcare costs, and damage the publicâ€™s trust in the healthcare system.
