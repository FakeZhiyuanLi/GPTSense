Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) is primarily associated with the cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) school of psychotherapy. However, it is also considered to be part of the broader family of cognitive-behavioral approaches, which includes other psychotherapy schools such as acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), and cognitive therapy (CT).
