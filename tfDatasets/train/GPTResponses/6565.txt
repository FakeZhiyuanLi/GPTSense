One of the features that have come to be considered as an important part of the gothic style is the use of pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and flying buttresses in architecture. These elements not only provide structural support but also add a sense of drama and height to the building. Gothic architecture is often characterized by intricate details, such as elaborate tracery, gargoyles, and stained glass windows. The style can be seen in cathedrals, castles, and other grand buildings throughout Europe.
