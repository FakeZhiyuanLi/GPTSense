There are several factors that play a role in the dispersal of propagules of plants and plankton:1. Wind: Seeds and spores can be carried long distances by wind currents.2. Water: Hydrophilic seeds and spores can be dispersed through water currents.3. Animals: Animals such as birds, mammals, and insects can transport plant seeds with their fur or droppings.4. Gravity: Propagules that fall from trees or plants can be dispersed over short distances through the pull of gravity.5. Human activities: Human activities such as transportation or gardening can unintentionally disperse plant propagules to new areas.Overall, the dispersal of propagules is crucial for the survival and expansion of plant and plankton populations.
