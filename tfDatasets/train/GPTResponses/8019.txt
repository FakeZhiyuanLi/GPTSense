The Persians knew of various laws, including the Code of Hammurabi, which was a set of laws regulating various aspects of daily life, such as family, property, and crime in ancient Mesopotamia. They also had their own legal system, originating from their ancient Zoroastrian religion, which emphasized justice, truth, and moral responsibility. The Achaemenid Empire implemented a legal and administrative system that was based on the concept of royal justice, which applied to all citizens, regardless of their social status.
