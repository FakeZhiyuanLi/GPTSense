Napoleon used only one crown for his coronation ceremony, which was called the Crown of Napoleon. It was created specifically for the occasion by the jeweler Martin-Guillaume Biennais, featuring both Roman and Christian symbols. The crown was made of gold and decorated with diamonds and pearls, and it symbolized Napoleon's imperial power and authority.
