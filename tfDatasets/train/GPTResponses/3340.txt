influence they had on government policies and decision making. Some of the common instruments used to identify corruption include:1. Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI): This is a widely recognized measure of corruption that ranks countries and territories based on how corrupt their public sector is perceived to be.2. World Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI): This measures the quality of governance in 215 countries based on six key dimensions, including corruption control.3. Freedom House’s Freedom in the World Report: This assesses the level of political freedom and civil liberties in countries around the world, including the prevalence of corruption.4. United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC): This is a global legal framework to combat corruption, which includes measures to prevent, detect and punish corrupt practices.5. National audits and investigations: Governments can use internal or external audits to detect and prevent corruption in their own institutions.6. Whistleblower protection laws: These protect those who report corruption from retaliation or harassment.In assessing the different corrupt forms, these instruments can also look at the domestic factors that contribute to corruption, such as weak institutions, lack of rule of law, and a culture of impunity. They can also analyze external factors, such as globalization, international aid, and the impact of multinational corporations on government policies.
