The type of resolution to disputes that is typically outlined in a treaty is diplomatic negotiation and peaceful settlement. This may include mediation, conciliation, and arbitration, where the parties involved in the dispute try to reach a mutually agreeable solution. In some cases, the treaty may also establish an international court or tribunal to hear disputes between the signatory states. The goal is to avoid resorting to military force or other violent means to resolve conflicts between nations.
