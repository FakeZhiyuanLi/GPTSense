Paedobaptism, also known as infant baptism, is the practice of baptizing infants or young children into the Christian faith. This practice is mainly followed by the Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church, Anglican Communion, and some Protestant denominations. Proponents of paedobaptism believe that baptism symbolizes the washing away of original sin and that it's a necessary step for the child's salvation. Critics argue that baptism should only be administered to those who have consciously made a choice to enter the faith.
