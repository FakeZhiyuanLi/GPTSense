When a person coughs, he or she pushes air out of the lungs with force. This results in the expulsion of various substances that may be present in the lungs, such as mucus, phlegm, or sputum. These substances can be produced by the body in response to an infection, inflammation, or irritation in the respiratory tract. In some cases, coughing may also cause small amounts of saliva or even vomit to be expelled from the mouth. Ultimately, the specific substances produced in the lungs by coughing will depend on the underlying condition causing the coughing.
