Darwin learned that variations within a species could be selectively bred for and could lead to the creation of new varieties or even new species. He observed that breeders could selectively choose traits they found desirable and breed only those individuals, leading to a gradual shift in the traits of the offspring. He also noted that variations in traits could occur naturally within a population and that those individuals with traits that were better suited to their environment would be more likely to survive and pass on those traits to their offspring, leading to the gradual evolution of the species over time.
