The three main categories of solar cookers are:1. Box cookers: These are insulated boxes that trap the heat of the sun, similar to a greenhouse. They typically have a glass or plastic lid that allows sunlight to enter and retain heat. Box cookers are versatile and can be used to bake, roast, and slow cook.2. Parabolic cookers: These cookers use reflectors to focus sunlight onto a small area. The reflectors can be curved or flat, and the shape of the reflector determines how much heat can be concentrated. Parabolic cookers are ideal for boiling liquid or frying food quickly.3. Panel cookers: These cookers are made of multiple panels of reflective material that are arranged and angled to reflect sunlight onto a cooking pot. Unlike box and parabolic cookers, panel cookers are lightweight and portable, making them ideal for camping trips or picnics.
