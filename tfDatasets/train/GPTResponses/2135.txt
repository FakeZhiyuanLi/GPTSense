The queen of Egypt during the time when Punt and Egypt were close could be Queen Hatshepsut (1473-1458 BCE). Hatshepsut was known for her successful trade expeditions to the land of Punt, which was located along the eastern coast of Africa, around the modern-day countries of Somalia and Eritrea. She established diplomatic and trade relations with the people of Punt, which resulted in the importation of exotic goods, such as myrrh, frankincense, and ebony, into Egypt. Hatshepsut's reign is known as a time of prosperity and cultural achievements in ancient Egypt, as she commissioned many impressive building projects and art pieces during her rule.
