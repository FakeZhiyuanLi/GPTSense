Cancers such as liver cancer and stomach cancer have been found to have a link to certain risk factors. For example, liver cancer has been linked to chronic infection with the hepatitis B or C virus, excessive alcohol consumption, exposure to aflatoxins (toxic substances produced by certain fungi), and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Stomach cancer has been linked to chronic infection with Helicobacter pylori bacteria, smoking, consuming high amounts of salted or smoked foods, and a family history of stomach cancer. Other risk factors for various types of cancer include age, genetics, environmental factors, and lifestyle factors such as diet and physical activity.
