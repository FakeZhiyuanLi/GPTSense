Migrating land birds avoid large water bodies or mountain ranges because these obstacles can be physically demanding and dangerous for these small birds. Water bodies such as oceans or large lakes present difficult flying conditions due to strong winds and lack of place to stop and rest, while mountain ranges make flying more challenging due to high altitude and fluctuating temperatures. Additionally, there may be predators or unsuitable habitats on the other side of these barriers. Instead, these birds prefer to take routes that provide suitable habitats with food and shelter along the way, such as river valleys or open grasslands.
