The early problems of the investment bank Bear Stearns in 2007 were an indicator of the troubles that would soon befall other banks and financial institutions. Bear Stearns was heavily invested in the subprime mortgage market, and its troubles were a sign of the impending collapse of the housing market and the broader financial system. The collapse of Bear Stearns in March 2008 was one of the early warning signs of the 2008 financial crisis.
