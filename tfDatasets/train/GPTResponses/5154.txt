The temperatures necessary to cause the melting of a particular substance depend on various factors such as the chemical composition and properties of the substance, the amount of heat energy applied, and the pressure surrounding the substance.For example, the melting point of ice is 0째C (32째F) at standard atmospheric pressure (sea level), but ice can also melt at much higher temperatures if exposed to high pressure or dissolved in a solvent.In general, the temperatures necessary to melt most common materials such as metals, rocks, and plastics range from a few hundred degrees Celsius (for some plastics) to several thousand degrees Celsius (for some metals and minerals). However, some substances such as water can also melt at relatively high temperatures (over 100째C or 212째F) if exposed to high pressure.Therefore, it is difficult to give a specific answer to how high the temperatures could have risen to cause melting without knowing the specific substance or material being considered.
