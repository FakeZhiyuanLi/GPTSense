Aksum did not conquer the Arabian Peninsula. In fact, the Aksumite Kingdom had close trade and diplomatic relations with many Arab states, including the Kingdom of Himyar in southern Arabia. The Aksumites also adopted Christianity from the Byzantine Empire, which had close ties with the Arab world. However, there were occasional conflicts between Aksum and some Arab tribes in the region, such as the Banu Judham tribe that raided the city of Najran in 523 CE.
