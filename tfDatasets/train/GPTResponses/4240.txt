Yes, the FBI investigated Martin Luther King Jr. as part of their COINTELPRO (Counterintelligence Program) from 1963 until his assassination in 1968. The FBI viewed King as a potential threat to national security and gathered information on his personal life, including his alleged extramarital affairs, in order to discredit him. This surveillance and harassment of King was later widely criticized as an abuse of government power and a violation of his civil rights.
