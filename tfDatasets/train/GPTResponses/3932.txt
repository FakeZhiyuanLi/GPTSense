William James was a prominent figure in the development of functionalism, which focused on understanding the functions and processes of the mind. Other psychologists who developed theories similar to James' functionalism include John Dewey, Harvey Carr, and James Rowland Angell. Additionally, some scholars argue that the ideas of Charles Darwin and his theory of evolution also influenced James' development of functionalism.
