The two main scientists who worked on the electrical properties of nerve cells in the first half of the 20th century were Alan Lloyd Hodgkin and Andrew Fielding Huxley. They are known for their discovery of the mechanisms underlying the action potential in neurons, which led to a deeper understanding of how nerve cells communicate with each other. Their work also paved the way for the development of neurophysiology as a field of study.
