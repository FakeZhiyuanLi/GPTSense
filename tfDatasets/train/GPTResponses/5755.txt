In the past, discussing contraception could lead to prosecution under obscenity laws or laws that criminalized the distribution of contraceptives, such as the Comstock Laws in the United States. These laws were introduced in the late 1800s and early 1900s and prohibited the distribution of information or materials related to birth control, arguing that they were offensive and immoral. Violations of these laws could lead to fines, imprisonment, or both. It wasn't until the 1960s when these laws were challenged and gradually repealed, that contraception became widely available and openly discussed.
