Some countries use a different calendar than the Gregorian calendar. For example:- Iran uses the Solar Hijri calendar, which is based on the rotation of the Earth around the sun and the angle between the Earth and the sun. It has 12 months of varying lengths, with the year starting on the vernal equinox.- Ethiopia uses the Ethiopian calendar, which is based on the ancient Coptic calendar and has 13 months, with 12 months of 30 days each and a thirteenth month of 5 or 6 days depending on whether it's a leap year.- Some religious communities, such as Jews, use their own calendars. For example, the Jewish calendar is lunar-solar and has 12 or 13 months of 29 or 30 days, with the year starting on Rosh Hashanah.It's important to note that while these calendars are used for religious or cultural purposes, the Gregorian calendar is widely used for international and secular purposes.
