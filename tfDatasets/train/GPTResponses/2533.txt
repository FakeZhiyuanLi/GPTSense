The principles of phonological analysis are designed to be language-independent tools that can be applied to analyze the sound systems of any language. These principles guide linguists in identifying and describing the phonemes, allophones, and other phonological features of a language's sound system. They also help to identify patterns of sound changes and to understand how these changes impact the morphological and syntactic structures of the language. Overall, the principles of phonological analysis provide a framework for analyzing the organization and distribution of sound units in language, regardless of the specific language being studied.
