One unique architecture style that started in Miami after World War 2 is the Miami Modern style, also known as MiMo. This style is characterized by the use of bold, geometric shapes, bright colors, and tropical motifs. The MiMo style was popularized in the 1950s and 1960s as Miami became a fashionable vacation destination. Many famous architects contributed to the MiMo movement, including Morris Lapidus, who designed iconic Miami Beach hotels such as the Fontainebleau and Eden Roc.
