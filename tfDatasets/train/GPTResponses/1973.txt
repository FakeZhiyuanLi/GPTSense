An action of a state's representative that can invalidate a state's consent to a treaty can be both direct or indirect.Direct action refers to situations where the representative explicitly states that they do not have the authority to give consent on behalf of the state or a mistake is made in the process of giving consent to the treaty.Indirect action refers to situations where the representative may have concealed important details about the proposed treaty or misled the state into believing that the treaty was in their best interest. Additionally, if the representative exceeded their mandate and made commitments that went beyond their legal authority, it can also invalidate the state's consent.
