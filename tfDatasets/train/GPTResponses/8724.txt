The 419 scam is a type of advance fee scam in which the scammer asks the victim to pay an upfront fee or provide personal information in exchange for a promised reward or financial benefit that does not exist. It is commonly known as the Nigerian Prince scam, as many of the earliest known cases originated in Nigeria. The scam is named after the section of the Nigerian Criminal Code that deals with fraud.
