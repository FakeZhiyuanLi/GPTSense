One of the most prominent individuals charged with bringing Nazi collaborators to trial was Benjamin Ferencz, an American lawyer who served as a chief prosecutor at the Nuremberg Trials. He was later appointed as the Chief Prosecutor for the United States Army at the Einsatzgruppen Trial, where he prosecuted members of the SS and other Nazi officials for their involvement in the murder of over one million Jews and other individuals during the Holocaust.
