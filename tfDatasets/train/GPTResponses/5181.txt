Mary, the mother of Jesus, is not recorded to have brought a burnt offering and sin offering. Burnt offerings and sin offerings were part of the Jewish sacrificial system prescribed in the Old Testament. Mary, as a devout Jewish woman, may have participated in this system, but there is no record of her specifically bringing these offerings.
