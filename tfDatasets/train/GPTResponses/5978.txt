In ancient India, several vernacular languages existed alongside Sanskrit, including Prakrit, Pali, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Marathi. These languages were spoken by the common people and were used in literature, poetry, and daily communication. Prakrit, for instance, was a language that evolved from Sanskrit and was used extensively in ancient Jain and Buddhist literature. Similarly, Pali was a language used in Buddhist texts and was spoken in parts of India, Sri Lanka, and Southeast Asia. Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Marathi were regional languages that had their own unique scripts, grammar, and literature. These languages continue to thrive today and form an integral part of India's linguistic and cultural diversity.
