The typical range of registers for a CPU (Central Processing Unit) varies depending on the architecture of the processor. However, most modern CPUs typically have between 8 and 32 general-purpose registers, along with several special-purpose registers, such as program counters and status registers. Some CPUs also have additional registers dedicated to specific tasks, such as floating-point operations or multimedia processing. The exact number and type of registers can greatly impact the performance and capabilities of the CPU.
