There is no information available about elephants at the Gash River forming a symbiotic relationship with any particular species. Symbiotic relationships occur when two or more different species interact in a mutually beneficial way, and require specific conditions to develop. Without any further context or research, it is impossible to determine whether or not such a relationship exists between elephants and another species at the Gash River.
