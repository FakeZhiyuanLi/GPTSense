In a ladder match, wrestlers must climb a ladder that is suspended above the ring to retrieve a prize or championship belt that is hanging from above the ring. The first wrestler to climb the ladder and retrieve the prize is declared the winner of the match. Wrestlers may also use the ladder as a weapon to attack their opponents, and they must be prepared to take risks and perform high-flying maneuvers in order to gain an advantage in the match. Additionally, wrestlers must be careful not to injure themselves or their opponents while using the ladder, as it can be a dangerous and unpredictable tool in the ring.
