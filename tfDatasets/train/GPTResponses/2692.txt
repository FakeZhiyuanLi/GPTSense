The Malleus Maleficarum is a treatise on witchcraft written in Latin by Heinrich Kramer and Jacob Sprenger, two German Dominican friars, in 1486. It became one of the most influential works on witchcraft in medieval Europe and was used as a guidebook for the witch hunts that took place during the Inquisition. The Malleus Maleficarum depicted witches as evil women who engaged in satanic rituals and sexual intercourse with the devil. It also provided detailed instructions for identifying, capturing, and torturing suspected witches, including the use of a series of tests designed to prove guilt. The book fueled a mass hysteria that resulted in the deaths of thousands of people, primarily women, who were accused of witchcraft.
