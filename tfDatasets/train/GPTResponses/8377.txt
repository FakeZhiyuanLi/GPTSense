Affirmative action can be judged to be acceptable in terms of admissions when it is used as a means of addressing historical inequalities and promoting diversity in an inclusive manner. It should be based on objective and fair criteria, such as socioeconomic disadvantage or race, and be implemented as part of a comprehensive strategy to increase diversity in higher education or the workplace. It should not unfairly discriminate against any individual or group based on their race or ethnicity. Ultimately, affirmative action should aim to create equal opportunities for all individuals, regardless of their background or identity.
