The hygiene hypothesis suggests that the increase in the incidence of asthma may be due to the lack of exposure to certain infections during early childhood. According to this theory, the immune system needs to be exposed to certain types of bacteria and viruses to develop properly. Without this exposure, the immune system may become overactive and trigger inflammation, leading to diseases like asthma.In modern times, people tend to live in cleaner environments, use antibiotics more often, and have access to better sanitation. This can lead to a decreased exposure to certain types of bacteria and viruses that may be beneficial to the development of the immune system. The immune system may then overreact to harmless stimuli, like allergens, and cause asthma symptoms.Additionally, changes in lifestyle and diet may also contribute to the increase in asthma. Western diets that are high in fat and sugar have been linked to asthma, while diets rich in fruits and vegetables have been associated with a decreased risk of the disease. Lack of exercise and increased indoor exposure to allergens like dust mites and pet dander may also play a role in the development of asthma.
