Computers usually use UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) as a standard time reference for a wide range of applications, including computer networks, software development, testing, and data storage. UTC is also used in various time-sensitive systems, such as air traffic control, telecommunications, and financial transactions, where precise and accurate time synchronization is critical. Additionally, many programming languages and operating systems support UTC, making it a popular choice for handling date and time data across different platforms and time zones.
