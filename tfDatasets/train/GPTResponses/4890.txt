This classification falls under the field of psychology and can be described as self-concept or identity formation. Specifically, it may be categorized as a form of conformism or socialization, where an individual's personal beliefs and values are subordinated to the norms and expectations of their social environment. This can result in a conflict between one's true self and the perceived self that is projected to others.
