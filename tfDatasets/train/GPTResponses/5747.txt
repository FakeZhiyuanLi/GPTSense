The first oral birth control was created by two people: Dr. John Rock, a gynecologist, and Margaret Sanger, a women's rights activist. They worked together with chemist Gregory Pincus to develop the first hormonal contraceptive pill in the 1950s. The first oral birth control pill was called Enovid and was approved by the FDA in 1960.
