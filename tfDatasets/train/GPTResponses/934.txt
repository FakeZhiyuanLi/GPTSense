The first electronic programmable computer built in the United States was the Atanasoff-Berry Computer (ABC) in 1939. The ABC was designed by John Vincent Atanasoff and his graduate student, Clifford Berry, at Iowa State University. It was the first computer to use binary digits (bits) to represent data and was designed to solve systems of linear equations. However, the ABC was not fully functional and was later surpassed by the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC) in 1945.
