The ancient Somalis and others competed for the lucrative trade in spices and other luxury goods, such as frankincense, myrrh, ivory, gold, and textiles, along the Red Sea and Indian Ocean coasts of East Africa. They were renowned for their seafaring skills and established prosperous trading networks with other civilizations, including the Greeks, Persians, Egyptians, and Romans, among others. These trade routes were vital to the economic and cultural development of ancient societies, and facilitated the exchange of ideas, technology, and religion across vast distances.
