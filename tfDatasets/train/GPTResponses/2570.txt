The combination of two filter banks' outputs can create a problem of overlapping or interference between the frequency bands. This can result in distortion, aliasing, or loss of information in the signal. To mitigate this problem, techniques such as proper signal scaling and filtering can be employed to ensure that the combined output is free from any unwanted artifacts. Other solutions may include adjusting the filter parameters or using advanced signal processing techniques such as multirate processing.
