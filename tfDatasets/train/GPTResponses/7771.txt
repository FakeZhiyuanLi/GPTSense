Critics of affirmative action believe that merit should be the main factor in hiring. They argue that race, gender, or other characteristics should not be considered in the decision-making process, and that hiring should be based solely on an individual's qualifications, skills, and performance. They argue that affirmative action policies promote quotas and preferences that lead to reverse discrimination, and that they are not effective in increasing diversity and equal opportunity in the workplace. Critics often advocate for color-blind policies and a level playing field for all individuals.
