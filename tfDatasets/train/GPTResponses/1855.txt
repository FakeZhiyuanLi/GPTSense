are called disputes or conflicts between the parties involved in the treaty. These disputes may arise in different areas such as territorial or boundary issues, resource management, or cultural and language rights. The procedures outlined in modern treaties usually involve mediation or negotiation, often with the assistance of a third party such as a mediator or arbitrator, and may also include a dispute resolution tribunal or similar body. The aim is to avoid conflict and reach a mutually acceptable resolution that respects the rights and interests of all parties involved.
