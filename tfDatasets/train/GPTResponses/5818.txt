Acquiring targets and aiming have become more required due to advancements in technology, particularly in warfare and the military. With modern weapons, the accuracy of the shot is essential to minimize collateral damage and achieve the desired outcome. As weapons systems have become more complex and varied, it has become increasingly important to acquire targets accurately and aim precisely. Moreover, in situations where it is difficult to identify and distinguish between friendly and enemy forces, accurate targeting and precise aim significantly reduces the risk of friendly fire incidents. Thus, overall, acquiring targets and aiming precisely has become an integral part of modern warfare and military operations.
