Trade and commerce formed an important part of European colonization. European powers established colonies in Africa, Asia, and the Americas to gain access to valuable resources such as gold, silver, spices, and other raw materials. These resources were then taken back to Europe and traded for goods that were needed in the colonies. European colonizers also established plantations and mines, which were worked by enslaved people brought from Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Additionally, religion played a major role in colonization, as Europeans sought to spread Christianity to other parts of the world.
