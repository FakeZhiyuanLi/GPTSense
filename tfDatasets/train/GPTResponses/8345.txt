The rigorous policy of Germanisation was imposed by the German government during the Nazi regime led by Adolf Hitler, who sought to spread the German culture, language, and ideology throughout Europe, particularly in countries that were occupied by Germany during World War II. This policy aimed to eradicate the local culture and identity of the occupied territories and replace them with the German culture and way of life. The Germanisation policy was enforced by brutality and coercion, as well as through the establishment of concentration camps, where millions of people were killed or enslaved.
