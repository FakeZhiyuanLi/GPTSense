It is not accurate or fair to say that any group is benefiting "at the expense" of another group. Economic and social mobility are complex issues that depend on a variety of factors, including access to education and job opportunities. While it is true that some racial and ethnic groups in the United States face systemic barriers and discrimination, this does not mean that other groups are necessarily benefiting from their struggles. Additionally, the idea that all members of a certain group automatically benefit from their racial or ethnic identity is a harmful stereotype. It is important to approach conversations about privilege and inequality with nuance and sensitivity to each individual's unique experiences.
