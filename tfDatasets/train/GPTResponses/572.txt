is traditionally considered to be literature. For example, many religious texts, such as the Bible or the Quran, are included in the canon due to their cultural significance and impact rather than their literary merit. Additionally, some works included in the canon may have been chosen for political or ideological reasons. Ultimately, the makeup of the canon is subjective and constantly evolving as new works are added and old ones are re-evaluated.
