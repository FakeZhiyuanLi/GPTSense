The neoliberal economic policies implemented since the 1970s have emphasized deregulation to encourage business growth, resulting in less oversight and less disclosure. These policies have led to the removal of restrictions on industries such as finance, telecommunications, and transportation, which has allowed them to operate with more freedom and flexibility. Deregulation has been seen as a way to promote competition, spur innovation, and lower costs for consumers, but it has also led to increased risk-taking, market concentration, and reduced accountability. The financial deregulation in the 1980s, for example, contributed to the global financial crisis of 2008, while the deregulation of the energy sector in California in the late 1990s resulted in market manipulation and artificial price increases. The lack of transparency and accountability in many deregulated industries has also made it difficult for regulators, investors, and consumers to assess risks and make informed decisions.
