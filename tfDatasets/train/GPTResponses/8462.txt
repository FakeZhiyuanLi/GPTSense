There are several outcomes that can occur when a species immigrates to a new location, including:1. Competition: The introduction of a new species can lead to competition for resources such as food, shelter, and water. This can result in a reduction in the population of native species that have to compete with the newcomers.2. Predation: The arrival of a predator species can increase the mortality rate of native species that become the prey of the newcomers.3. Hybridization: When species from different locations interbreed, it can result in the creation of hybrid species that may have different characteristics from the original populations.4. Adaptation: Immigrating species can adapt to their new habitat and evolve new traits, behaviors, or modifications to their diet, lifestyle, or morphology.5. Biodiversity loss: The introduction of invasive species can disrupt the existing ecological balance and ultimately lead to biodiversity loss if they outcompete or prey on native species that have evolved in a balance with their environment.
