is commonly known as bribery. Bribery involves offering money or other valuable items to someone in exchange for them doing something for you, or not doing something that could be detrimental to you. This is often seen in business transactions, where companies may bribe government officials or other companies to gain an advantage in a particular market. Bribery is illegal in most countries and is considered a serious form of corruption as it undermines the rule of law and damages public trust in institutions.
