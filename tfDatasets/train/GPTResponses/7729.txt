It is difficult to provide an exact date as there have been fluctuations in the percentage of male monks in Tibet throughout history. However, during the height of Tibetan Buddhism in the 20th century, it is estimated that anywhere from 10 to 20% of male Tibetans were monks. This number has since decreased due to various factors including Chinese occupation and government policies.
