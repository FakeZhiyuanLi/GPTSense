The temperatures can differ so much between the city of Cork and the weather station maintained at the airport due to several factors such as:1. Urban Heat Island Effect - The city of Cork has more buildings, cars, and human activities that can trap heat and release them back into the atmosphere. This can cause the city to be warmer than the surrounding rural areas.2. Elevation - The airport weather station may be located at a higher elevation than the city of Cork, which can affect temperature readings.3. Distance from the coast - The airport weather station may be closer to the coast than the city of Cork, which can affect the temperature due to the moderating effect of the ocean.4. Microclimates - Cork City and the airport may have different microclimates due to the presence of different vegetation, soil types, and other factors that can affect the temperature.
