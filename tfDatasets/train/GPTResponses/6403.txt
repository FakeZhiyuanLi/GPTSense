the United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE) established its first provincial grand lodges in North America in 1786. The Provincial Grand Master was responsible for overseeing and managing the lodges in a specific geographic area and reporting back to UGLE. The first Provincial Grand Master appointed was M.W. Bro. Richard Harrison of New York in 1786. Since then, there have been numerous Provincial Grand Masters appointed throughout North America.
