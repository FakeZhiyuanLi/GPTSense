One of the unique design features of English cathedrals is their elaborate Gothic architecture, characterized by pointed arches, ribbed vaulting, and intricate stone carvings. Another notable feature is the use of stained glass windows to create a dramatic effect of light and shadow within the cathedral. Many English cathedrals also have a central tower, which serves as a landmark and symbolizes the spiritual significance of the building. Additionally, some cathedrals have a choir screen or rood screen separating the choir from the nave, which provides an ornate backdrop for the musical performances during religious services.
