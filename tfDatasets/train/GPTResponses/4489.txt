There are several factors that contributed to the US being a minor military power after the Revolutionary War, including:1. Lack of resources: The US was a new and relatively poor nation with limited resources to invest in building a large and powerful military.2. Lack of experience and training: The soldiers who fought in the Revolutionary War were mainly volunteers with little or no formal military training. After the war, the US did not have a standing army and had to rely on state militias, which often lacked proper training and organization.3. Political division and instability: The US was still experiencing political division and instability after the Revolutionary War, which made it difficult to build a strong and united military.4. Limited international support: The US did not have strong alliances or support from other nations, which limited its ability to project military power beyond its borders.Overall, these factors contributed to the US being a minor military power in the years following the Revolutionary War. It would take several decades of development and investment to build a strong and capable military.
