Slavic languages tend to inflect or conjugate their verbs based on the tense, aspect, mood, person, and number of the subject. They also have a complex system of verbal prefixes and suffixes that can change the meaning and/or add nuance to the verb. In some Slavic languages, such as Russian and Bulgarian, verbs also have a perfective and imperfective aspect, which indicates whether an action is completed or ongoing. Additionally, Slavic languages tend to have a relatively large number of verb forms, which can make them challenging for non-native speakers to learn.
