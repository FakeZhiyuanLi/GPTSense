Flying in flocks reduces the amount of energy that birds need to expend during migration as they can take turns leading the way and create aerodynamic efficiencies. It also provides safety in numbers as there are more eyes to spot predators and more birds to defend against an attack. Additionally, flying in flocks can help reduce stress and social isolation for birds.
