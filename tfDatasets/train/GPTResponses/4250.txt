The goal of the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) is to improve the accuracy and completeness of crime data collected by law enforcement agencies throughout the United States. It aims to replace the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program's Summary Reporting System, which only provides limited information on specific crimes, with a more comprehensive incident-based reporting system. The goal is to provide better information for the analysis of crime trends and the development of effective strategies to combat crime.
