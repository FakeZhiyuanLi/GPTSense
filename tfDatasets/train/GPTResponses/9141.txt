Missionary work in Canada began in the early 17th century with the arrival of Jesuit priests in Quebec. They began to establish missions and converted Indigenous peoples to Christianity. Other Christian denominations, such as the Anglicans and Methodists, also established missions throughout the 18th and 19th centuries.
