Darwin objected to the use of his ideology to support social Darwinism, eugenics, and racism. He believed that his theory of evolution by natural selection was a mechanism for understanding the diversity of species and had no moral implications for human behavior or social structures. Darwin also opposed the idea that some living beings were inherently superior to others and condemned any attempt to use evolutionary theory to justify discrimination or oppression.
