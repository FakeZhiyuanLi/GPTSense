By the late 1800s, Darwin's theory had become more complex and was supported by a significant amount of evidence from various fields of study, including genetics, embryology, and paleontology. This was largely due to the work of other prominent biologists such as Thomas Henry Huxley, Ernst Haeckel, and Gregor Mendel. Therefore, it can be said that by the late 1800s, Darwin's theory had become more refined and supported by a considerable body of evidence.
