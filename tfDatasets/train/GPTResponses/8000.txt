After the Nixon administration, the progression of affirmative action was somewhat halted, with subsequent administrations having varying stances on the issue. The Reagan administration was particularly critical of affirmative action and sought to limit its reach, while the Clinton administration was more supportive and sought to expand its implementation. However, affirmative action faced legal challenges during this time, with several cases reaching the Supreme Court that questioned its constitutionality. As a result, the implementation of affirmative action policy became more nuanced, with some forms being more heavily scrutinized than others. Overall, affirmative action has continued to be a controversial issue, with debates about its effectiveness and necessity ongoing in society and politics.
