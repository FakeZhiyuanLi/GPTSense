The origins of carnival can be traced back to ancient Roman festivals, but it has been celebrated in various forms and in different parts of the world for centuries. The modern carnival as we know it today originated in European countries, particularly Italy and Spain, in the Middle Ages and was brought to the Americas by European colonizers. Carnival has been celebrated annually in many countries, including Brazil, Trinidad and Tobago, and Germany, for several decades or even centuries.
