An island is a geographical feature that is a landmass surrounded by water on all sides. Islands are usually small and concentrated areas of land that are completely separate from the mainland. Due to their isolation, islands often have unique flora and fauna, as well as distinct cultural practices and traditions. Additionally, islands may concentrate certain resources or industries, such as tourism or fishing, due to their location and natural features.
