The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends solar water disinfection (SODIS) as an effective method for improving access to clean drinking water in areas with limited access to safe water sources. SODIS involves filling clear plastic bottles with water and exposing them to sunlight for six hours to destroy bacteria, viruses, and parasites. The WHO states that SODIS can be used in conjunction with other water treatment methods and is particularly useful in emergency situations.
