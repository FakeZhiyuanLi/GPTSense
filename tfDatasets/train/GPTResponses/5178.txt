High elevations and thin atmosphere are advantageous for viewing space because they offer:1. Reduced atmospheric distortions: High elevations and thin atmosphere reduce the amount of atmospheric distortions that affect astronomical observations. This reduces the blurring effect caused by air turbulence in the lower atmosphere, making it easier to observe faint celestial objects.2. Clearer skies: High elevations and thin atmosphere have less physical obstructions like clouds or pollutants, which result in clearer skies. This makes it easier for astronomers to observe planets, galaxies, and other celestial objects.3. Reduced light pollution: High elevations and thin atmosphere reduces light pollution since fewer artificial lights exist at higher elevations. This means that observations of faint celestial objects are made easier without any distractions from artificial lighting.4. Improved visibility: High elevations and thin atmosphere provide an improved viewing experience. The reduced moisture and dust in the atmosphere improve the ability to view from distant galaxies to planets in our solar system.5. Expanded spectral range: Observing at high elevations and in thin atmosphere expands the spectral range of astronomical observations. High elevations make it possible to observe infrared, ultraviolet, and radio waves, which would not be possible from the lowlands due to the thick atmosphere.
