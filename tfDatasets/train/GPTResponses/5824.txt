Bombillas are special straws used for drinking mat√©, a traditional South American tea-like drink made from the leaves of the yerba mate plant. The bombilla typically has a metal or bamboo tube that filters the drink, a filter at one end, and a mouthpiece at the other. They are designed to prevent the intake of small particulate matter present in the drink and to draw water evenly from a container. Bombillas are used in Argentina, Uruguay, southern Brazil, Paraguay, and parts of Chile and Bolivia.
