The immune system is composed of various types of cells, including white blood cells (such as T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells), tissues (such as the thymus, lymph nodes, and spleen), and molecules (such as antibodies, cytokines, and chemokines). These components work together to defend the body against foreign invaders such as viruses, bacteria, and cancer cells.
