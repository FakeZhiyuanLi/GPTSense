Cubism returned as a central consideration for artists after World War I with the assistance of art dealer Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler. Kahnweiler was a champion of cubism and worked closely with artists such as Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, promoting their work and helping to establish a market for cubist art. He also wrote extensively about cubism and organized exhibitions, which helped to introduce the style to a wider audience. Kahnweiler's influence and support played a significant role in the resurgence of cubism after World War I.
