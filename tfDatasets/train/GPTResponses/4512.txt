The process of bottle conditioning or priming is used to naturally carbonate beer. This involves adding a small amount of sugar and yeast to the fermented beer before bottling. The yeast consumes the added sugar and produces carbon dioxide as a byproduct, which then gets trapped in the sealed bottle and carbonates the beer. The beer is left to age and carbonate for several weeks before it is ready to drink.
