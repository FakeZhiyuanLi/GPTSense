As Charles V was a Holy Roman Emperor, he combined the power of the Roman Catholic Church with that of the Holy Roman Empire. He was also the king of Spain, which gave him control over vast territories on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, making him one of the most powerful rulers in Europe during the 16th century.
