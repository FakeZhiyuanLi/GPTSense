Britain blockaded trade during the Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815) to weaken France and prevent French goods from entering Britain or its colonies. The conflict was caused by a power struggle between Britain and France, as well as the expansionist ambitions of Napoleon Bonaparte. The two nations were involved in a long-standing rivalry for dominance in Europe and overseas territories, and the Napoleonic Wars were a culmination of that rivalry. Britain's blockade of trade was a major tactic in its efforts to defeat France and protect its own economic interests.
