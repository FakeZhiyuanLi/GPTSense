The maximum permissible current density in open air of copper varies depending on the application and the temperature at which it operates. In general, the maximum current density for copper in open air is around 3 A/mm2 at room temperature (20°C), but it decreases with increasing temperature due to the increased resistivity of copper. For example, at a temperature of 100°C, the maximum current density for copper in open air is around 2.2 A/mm2.However, it should be noted that current density is only part of the equation when it comes to electrical conductivity. The conductor size, shape, and material also play a role in determining the maximum permissible current that can be carried safely. It is always important to consult appropriate codes, standards, and guidelines when designing electrical systems to ensure safety and reliability.
