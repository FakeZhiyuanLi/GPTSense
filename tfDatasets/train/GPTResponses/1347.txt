Many Black people in the United States do identify as African, but there are others who may not use this term due to a variety of reasons. One reason may be a lack of connection to their African heritage or culture, as a result of historical trauma, forced assimilation, or displacement through the transatlantic slave trade. Additionally, some Black people may feel that identifying as African reinforces racial stereotypes or marginalizes their experiences as Black Americans. Ultimately, whether or not someone chooses to identify as African is a personal decision influenced by a complex array of factors.
