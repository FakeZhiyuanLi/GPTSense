Compression perpendicular to the grain of wood will not weaken it, even with sound knots in it. This is because wood is strongest along its grain, so compressing it perpendicular to the grain does not affect its structural integrity. However, compression parallel to the grain can weaken wood, especially if there are knots present, as this places stress on the weakest areas of the wood.
