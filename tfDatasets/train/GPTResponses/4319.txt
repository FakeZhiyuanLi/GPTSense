In protostomes, including mollusks, annelids, and arthropods, the anus forms first and the mouth develops secondarily from a different embryonic tissue layer. This developmental process is known as protostomy, in contrast to deuterostomy, where the mouth develops first and the anus forms secondarily. Deuterostomy is seen in echinoderms and chordates, including humans.
