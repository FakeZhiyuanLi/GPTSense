In most countries, the ultimate decision to grant or refuse a bill lies with the legislative branch of government, whether it is a single chamber or bicameral parliament. However, this decision may be influenced by various actors, including the executive branch, interest groups, public opinion, and legal considerations. Within the legislative branch, specific committees and individual members may advise colleagues on the merits and drawbacks of a proposed bill, using expert testimony, research, and debate. Ultimately, the decision to grant or refuse a bill is a political one, reflecting competing interests, priorities, and values among legislators and other stakeholders.
