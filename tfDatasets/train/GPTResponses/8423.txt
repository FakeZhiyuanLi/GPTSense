The Naming Policy guarantees that characters have a unique and immutable name in a game or virtual world. This policy ensures that each player has a unique and distinguishable identity within the virtual world, and prevents others from impersonating or misrepresenting themselves as someone else. Under the Naming Policy, once a character name has been chosen and assigned, it cannot be changed or reused by another player.
