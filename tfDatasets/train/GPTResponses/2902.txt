There are currently several techniques that can be used to alter the genomes of an adult organism to treat genetic disease, including:1. Gene editing: This involves using specific enzymes, such as CRISPR-Cas9, to cut and modify the DNA of specific genes. This can be done to insert healthy genes or remove disease-causing mutations.2. Gene therapy: This involves introducing healthy genes into the body to replace defective or missing genes. This can be done through different methods, such as viral vectors, which are used to deliver the genes into the cells.3. RNA interference: This involves using small RNA molecules to target and silence specific genes that are causing disease.4. DNA methylation: This involves modifying the way genes are expressed by adding or removing methyl groups from the DNA.5. Epigenetic modification: This involves modifying the structure and function of genes without changing the DNA sequence. This can be done by adding or removing chemical groups from the proteins that are involved in gene expression.Each technique has its advantages and limitations, and the choice of technique used will depend on the specific genetic disease and the characteristics of the patient.
