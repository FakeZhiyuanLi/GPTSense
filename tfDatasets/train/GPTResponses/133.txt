Until the 1980s, industry dumped large quantities of pollutants and chemicals into the Rhine River, leading to severe contamination and environmental damage. Industrial waste included heavy metals, pesticides, fertilizers, organic chemicals, and radioactive materials. This had a significant impact on aquatic life, human health, and water quality in the region. In the 1980s, governments and industries began to recognize the environmental harm caused by industrial activities along the Rhine, and joined efforts to reduce pollution and adopt cleaner production methods. The efforts led to the establishment of the International Commission for the Protection of the Rhine in 1950s and the Rhine Action Programme in the 1980s, which aimed to achieve a sustainable and cleaner river system.
