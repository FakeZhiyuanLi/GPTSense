Unabsorbed matter and waste products are excreted from the body through the process of excretion. Excretion primarily occurs through the urinary system, which includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. The kidneys filter waste products from the blood and produce urine, which is then transported through the ureters to the bladder for storage. When the bladder is full, urine is expelled from the body through the urethra. Other organs involved in excretion include the lungs, which remove carbon dioxide and other gases, and the skin, which eliminates sweat and other wastes.
