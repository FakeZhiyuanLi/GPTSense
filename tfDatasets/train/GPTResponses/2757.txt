The preservation of written musical scores and the advancement of technology in reproducing and sharing music have allowed classical musicians to perform music from many centuries ago. Written scores provide a blueprint of the composer's intent, enabling musicians to recreate the music as closely as possible to the original composition. Additionally, advancements in technology, such as audio recordings and digital sheet music, make it easier to access and share the music with a wider audience. The mastery of historical performance practices and the study of styles from different eras also contribute to the ability to perform music from many centuries ago.
