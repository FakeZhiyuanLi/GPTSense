To prevent the adoption of reservations, a treaty must explicitly state that reservations are not allowed, or only certain types of reservations are allowed under specific circumstances. Additionally, the treaty may stipulate that any reservation made must be consistent with the object and purpose of the treaty. This ensures that the essence of the treaty is not compromised by individual countries' reservations. The treaty may also require unanimous agreement among parties before allowing any reservations to be made, or provide a mechanism for resolving disputes or objections to reservations.
