When the migratory movements of the Slavs ended, their society became more settled and organized. They established permanent settlements, built fortified towns and villages, and began to engage in agriculture, animal husbandry, and trade. With the development of a more stable economy, social hierarchies emerged, and rulers and nobles emerged who held power and authority over the common people. The Slavic tribes also began to form alliances and federations, creating regional polities such as the Principality of Kiev and the Kingdom of Poland. Additionally, Slavic culture and religion began to evolve, with the adoption of Christianity in the 9th and 10th centuries contributing to the development of a unique Slavic identity.
