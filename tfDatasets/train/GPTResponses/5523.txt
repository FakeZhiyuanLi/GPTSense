Queen Victoria endorsed Benjamin Disraeli's policy of imperial expansion and the establishment of the British Empire. Disraeli believed that Britain's strength and prosperity lay in its overseas territories and sought to expand its colonies and influence around the world. Victoria supported this policy and played an active role in promoting British interests overseas. She was particularly proud of her role as Empress of India after the British government assumed direct control over India in 1858.
