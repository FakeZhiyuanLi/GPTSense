Low German varieties are often classified as dialects of standard German because they share many linguistic features with standard German, including vocabulary, syntax, and grammar. Additionally, they are spoken in regions where standard German is the official language and have been influenced by standard German over time. However, some linguists argue that Low German varieties are distinct enough to be considered separate languages, as they have unique vocabulary, grammar, and syntax that differ significantly from standard German.
