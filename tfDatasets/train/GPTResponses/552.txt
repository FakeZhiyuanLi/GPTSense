that suffering is caused by craving and attachment to worldly things. This means that our desire for pleasure, possessions, status, and relationships can lead to suffering when we do not get what we want or lose what we have. It also means that we can reduce our suffering by letting go of these attachments and living in the present moment with acceptance and equanimity. This truth teaches us to cultivate detachment, mindfulness, and compassion in order to find happiness and inner peace.
