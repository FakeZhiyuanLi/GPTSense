Most of the great literary figures of the Hellenistic period studied in Alexandria, which was considered the cultural and intellectual center of the ancient Mediterranean world. The Library of Alexandria, founded in the 3rd century BC, was one of the largest and most significant libraries of the ancient world and attracted scholars, philosophers, and writers who contributed to the development of Hellenistic literature. Writers such as Callimachus, Theocritus, Apollonius of Rhodes, and Aristarchus of Samothrace were among those who studied and worked in Alexandria during the Hellenistic period.
