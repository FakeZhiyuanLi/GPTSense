The type of capacitor that absorbs radio frequency interference is called a "RFI capacitor" or a "suppression capacitor". These capacitors have a special design and construction that allows them to effectively absorb and suppress high-frequency noise and interference in electronic circuits. They are typically used in power supplies, filters, and other electronic equipment to improve performance and reduce electromagnetic interference.
