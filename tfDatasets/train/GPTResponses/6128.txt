The NIOSH (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) standard for uranium exposure over an 8-hour workday is 0.05 milligrams per cubic meter of air (0.05 mg/mÂ³). However, it is important to note that exposure to any level of uranium can be harmful and precautions should always be taken to minimize exposure.
