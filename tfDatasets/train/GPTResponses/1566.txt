Caged birds do not display any behavior that corresponds with migratory direction in nature. As they are kept in captivity, they are unable to undertake their natural migratory activities. However, it is essential to note that it is not humane to keep birds in cages or restrict their natural behavior in any way. They should be allowed to fly and migrate freely in their natural habitats.
