1. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) - This is a process that uses a combination of methods such as using natural predators, crop rotation, mechanical controls, and targeted pesticide application.2. Use of bio-pesticides – Bio-pesticides are designed to be less harmful to the environment compared to traditional pesticides.3. Avoid applying pesticides in high-risk areas - Do not apply pesticides near waterways, important wildlife habitats, or areas where people and animals are present.4. Appropriate use of protective clothing – Protective clothing should be used to reduce exposure to pesticides by individuals who apply pesticides.5. Follow guidelines for safe handling and storage - Store and handle pesticides safely to prevent contamination of food, water or the environment.6. Increase education on safer use of pesticides - Farmers and consumers must be educate on proper pesticide application, how to avoid exposure to pesticides and how to safely dispose of pesticides.7. Use of beneficial insects - Beneficial insects can be used to prevent pest outbreaks, maintain balance of pest population, and reduce the need for pesticide application.8. Use of genetically modified crops – Genetically modified crops can be designed to be resistant to pests, making targeted pesticide applications more effective.9. Soil testing- Testing of soil samples can be done and fertilizers can be used efficiently to reduce the need for pesticides.10. Research into alternative methods of pest control - Research into alternative methods of pest control can reduce the need for pesticides. This includes the use of cover crops, soil health, plant breeding and other strategies that can help crops protect and defend themselves against pests.
