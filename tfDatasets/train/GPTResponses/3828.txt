The videoconferencing system typically manages conferencing creation through a centralized control hub or dashboard that allows users to schedule and set up meetings, invite participants, and manage various aspects of the call such as audio and video settings, screen-sharing options, and recording capabilities. The specific location and functionality of these tools may vary depending on the system being used, but centralized management is a common feature across most videoconferencing platforms.
