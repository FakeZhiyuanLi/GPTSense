The FAA regulates altitudes for different types of airspace. Below are the general altitude regulations:- Class A airspace: From 18,000 feet MSL up to and including FL600 (60,000 feet MSL)- Class B airspace: Surface to a ceiling that varies from airport to airport, but typically up to 10,000 feet MSL- Class C airspace: Surface to 4,000 feet above airport elevation (charted in MSL)- Class D airspace: Surface to 2,500 feet above airport elevation (charted in MSL)- Class E airspace: Generally starts at either the surface or 700 feet AGL and goes up to either 1,200 or 14,500 feet MSL, depending on location and other factors- Class G airspace: Generally, there is no controlled airspace below 1,200 feet AGL, though it varies by location. Above 1,200 feet AGL, Class G airspace extends upwards to the base of the overlying Class E or Class A airspace.Note that these are general guidelines and may vary based on specific airspace designations and geographic locations. It is important for pilots to reference the appropriate regulations and charts for their specific flight operation.
