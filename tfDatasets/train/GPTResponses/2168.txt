The discovery of alternative splicing caused the model that one gene makes one protein to be refined. Alternative splicing is a process in which different exons of a gene can be included or excluded from the final messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript, resulting in multiple proteins being produced from the same gene. Therefore, a single gene can encode multiple proteins, leading to the refinement of the one gene-one protein model to one gene-many proteins.
