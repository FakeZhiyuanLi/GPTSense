Italians did not "discover" the code of Justinian as it was initially created and promulgated by the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I in the 6th century. However, copies and translations of the code were made and studied by scholars in Italy during the Middle Ages, particularly in the 11th and 12th centuries.
