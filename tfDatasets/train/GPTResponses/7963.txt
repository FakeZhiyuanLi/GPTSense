The IEEE 802.3af Power over Ethernet (PoE) standard specifies a method for transmitting power over Ethernet cables, allowing for devices to receive power without the need for a separate power source. This enables easier deployment of network devices, such as wireless access points, IP cameras, and VoIP phones, as they can be powered through the same Ethernet cable that provides their connectivity. The standard specifies a maximum power delivery of 15.4 watts and a distance of up to 100 meters.
