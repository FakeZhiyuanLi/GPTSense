The political relationship between England and Scotland has been disputed at various points throughout history, but one major event was the Scottish independence referendum in 2014, which saw Scotland voting to remain part of the United Kingdom. Another significant dispute was the Act of Union in 1707, which united Scotland and England to form Great Britain, and which some Scots continue to view as a negative historical event.
