The Unicode Roadmap Committee is responsible for developing and maintaining the Unicode Standard, which is used to represent text in all languages and scripts across various computing platforms. The committee ensures that the standard is up-to-date, accurate, and comprehensive, and that it can be efficiently implemented by software developers and vendors. They also work to extend the standard to cover new scripts and characters, ensure interoperability with other encoding standards, and consult with experts and users to address emerging requirements and issues.
