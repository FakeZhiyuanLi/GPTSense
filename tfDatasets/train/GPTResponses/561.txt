The early Mahayana scriptures originated in the northern part of India, particularly in the areas of present-day Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. This region was an important center of Buddhism during the time of the Buddha and continued to be a hub of Buddhist activity for centuries after his passing. Some of the most significant early Mahayana texts, such as the Prajnaparamita Sutras, were likely composed in this region and later disseminated throughout the Buddhist world.
