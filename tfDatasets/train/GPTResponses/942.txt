The main focus of Pan-Slavism was to unite all Slavic peoples under a single political and cultural entity, primarily in the 19th and 20th centuries. The idea of Pan-Slavism originated in the Russian Empire and initially aimed to create a union of all Slavic countries and peoples. However, it later spread to other regions such as the Balkans and Czechoslovakia. The movement had a significant impact on Eastern Europe and played a role in the formation of Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia.
