It depends on which three empires you are referring to. If we are talking about the major empires of history, here are some possible answers:- The Western Roman Empire fell in 476 AD.- The Abbasid Caliphate, which succeeded the Umayyad Caliphate, gradually lost power and influence after the 10th century, but technically ended with the fall of Baghdad to the Mongols in 1258.- The Mongol Empire disintegrated into smaller khanates and states by the 14th century.- The Byzantine Empire, which was the Eastern Roman Empire, ended with the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453.- The Aztec Empire was conquered by the Spanish in 1521.- The Inca Empire was conquered by the Spanish in 1533.So, depending on which three empires you have in mind, they may have been gone by different years.
