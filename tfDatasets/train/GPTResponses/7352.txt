DNA changes or mutations can affect plants in various ways. Some of the effects of DNA changes on plants include:1. Growth and development: Mutations in DNA can result in changes in the growth and development of plants. For instance, some mutations can lead to abnormal plant structures, slower growth rates, or even death.2. Reproduction: DNA changes can also impact plant reproductive processes. Mutations can affect the formation of flowers, seeds, and fruits. Some mutations can result in sterile plants that cannot reproduce.3. Resistance to pests and diseases: Changes in DNA can also make plants more resistant to pests and diseases. Mutations can result in the production of chemicals that repel pests or toxins that kill harmful microorganisms.4. Adaptation to the environment: Mutations can also give plants an advantage in adapting to environmental changes. Certain mutations can allow plants to tolerate extreme temperatures, drought, or high salinity.Overall, DNA changes have a significant impact on the health, growth, and survival of plants. These genetic mutations can affect important plant processes and can either be beneficial or detrimental to the plant's survival.
