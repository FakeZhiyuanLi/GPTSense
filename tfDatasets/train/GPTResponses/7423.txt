The philosophy of St. Augustine of Hippo gave much to Christian thought of the time. Augustine's emphasis on the importance of grace and the role of the church in salvation influenced Christian theology and practices for centuries to come. His ideas on original sin, human will, and the nature of God continue to be studied and debated by scholars and theologians.
