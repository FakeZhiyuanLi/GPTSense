Melbourne grew as a major port for exporting agricultural products primarily due to its location and infrastructure. The city is situated on the coast of the southern state of Victoria in Australia, making it an ideal location for receiving and exporting goods via sea transport.Further, Melbourne’s port infrastructure was developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to cater to the growing demand for agricultural exports. The construction of breakwaters, wharves, and warehouses allowed for larger ships to be accommodated, effectively increasing the port’s capacity and streamlining the export process.The introduction of refrigeration technology in the early 20th century also played a significant role in Melbourne’s growth as a major port for agricultural products. Refrigeration allowed for exports of perishable goods such as meat, dairy products, and fresh produce, which were previously limited by the lack of a reliable preservation method.Finally, the Australian government’s trade policies also helped to bolster Melbourne’s port trade. The government actively encouraged the export of agricultural products and implemented policies such as subsidies for transport and storage to encourage farmers to increase production and exports.Overall, Melbourne's location, infrastructure, technological advancements, and government support all contributed to its growth as a major port for exporting agricultural products.
