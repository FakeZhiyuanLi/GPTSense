Charanjit Singh's 1982 album "Ten Ragas to a Disco Beat" features a unique arrangement that combines traditional Indian classical music with electronic disco music. It is believed to be one of the earliest examples of acid house music, as it uses a Roland TB-303 synthesizer to create the signature sound of the genre. Singh's innovative approach to blending different musical styles has since been recognized as a pioneering achievement in the history of electronic dance music.
