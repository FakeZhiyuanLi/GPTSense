A conventional bulb darkens over its lifetime due to the gradual accumulation of dirt, dust, and other contaminants on the bulb's surface. Additionally, the tungsten filament that produces the light slowly evaporates and deposits onto the inside of the bulb, creating a blackening effect that reduces the brightness and increases the temperature of the bulb.
