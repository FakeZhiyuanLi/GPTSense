?Land use and property use are typically regulated by local governments, which have zoning and land use ordinances that specify how land and property can be used within their jurisdiction. These ordinances are enforced by local planning departments and zoning boards. In some cases, state or national regulations may also dictate the allowable use of land or property, particularly when it comes to environmental or safety concerns. In general, the decision-making process for land and property use involves a mix of public input, expert opinion, and political considerations.
