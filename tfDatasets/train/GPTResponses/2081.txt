Flooding, property damage, and loss of life can be caused by a variety of factors such as heavy or prolonged rainfall, rapid snowmelt, coastal storm surge, tsunamis, dam or levee failures, urbanization, deforestation, and climate change. These factors can lead to excessive water runoff, overflowing rivers, flash floods, landslides, and mudflows, which can destroy buildings, homes, and infrastructure, displace people, and cause injuries and fatalities. Additionally, poor land management, inadequate drainage systems, and development in flood-prone areas can exacerbate the impacts of natural disasters, leading to more severe flooding, damage, and loss of life.
