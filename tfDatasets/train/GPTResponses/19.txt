The natural dam that the Rhine flows through is the Rhine Gorge or Rhine Valley, also known as the Rhenish Massif or Rhenish Uplands. It is a geological formation consisting of steep cliffs and narrow valleys that were formed by the erosion of the river over millions of years. The Rhine Gorge is located in western Germany, stretching from the city of Bonn to Bingen and RÃ¼desheim.
