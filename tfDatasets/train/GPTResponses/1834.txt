The Romans built fortifications and watchtowers along the mountain passes to protect their empire from attacks by enemies and to monitor the movement of people and goods entering the territory. These fortifications were strategically placed at intervals to ensure that any enemy movement could be detected and dealt with in a timely and efficient manner. The Romans also built roads and bridges to improve communication and transport along the mountain passes.
