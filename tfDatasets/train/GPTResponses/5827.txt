It is a central belief of Christianity that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. This belief is based on the teachings of the New Testament, particularly the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Christians believe that Jesus is the incarnation of God, fully divine and fully human, and that through his death and resurrection, he provided salvation for humanity.
