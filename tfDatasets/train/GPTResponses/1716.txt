The early high middle ages in Germany were controlled by the Ottonian Dynasty, also known as the Saxon Dynasty, which lasted from 919 to 1024. The dynasty was named after its first emperor, Otto I, who was crowned Holy Roman Emperor in 962. The Ottonian Dynasty is recognized as a significant period in the history of Germany as it helped lay the foundation for a strong central government and territorial expansion.
