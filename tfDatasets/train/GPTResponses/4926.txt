One phenomenon that has rapidly spread due to economic increase is globalization - the interconnectedness of economies, societies, and cultures across the world. With increased economic growth and development, countries have had greater opportunities for trade, investment, and cultural exchange, leading to the growth of global markets, increased travel and migration, and the spread of information and ideas across borders. However, the effects of globalization have been unevenly distributed, with some individuals and countries benefiting more than others, leading to debates about the costs and benefits of economic integration.
