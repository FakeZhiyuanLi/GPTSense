The insulation property of clothing is important in cold climates. It helps to maintain body temperature by trapping heat against the skin and preventing cold air from penetrating the clothing layers. Clothing made from materials such as wool, down, and synthetic fibers like polyester are known for their insulation properties and are frequently used in cold weather apparel.
