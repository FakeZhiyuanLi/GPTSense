There is no specific event recorded in the year 1090 that directly influenced medieval Europe's adoption of the pointed arch. However, it is believed that the development of the pointed arch was a gradual process that occurred over several centuries and was influenced by a variety of factors such as the Islamic architectural influences in Spain and the Crusades.It is thought that the pointed arch was first used in Islamic architecture in the Middle East, and it was later introduced to Spain during the Islamic rule. The Christian architects working in Spain likely adopted this design element and brought it back to Europe, where it was gradually incorporated into Gothic architecture.Additionally, the Crusades brought European architects into contact with different architectural styles and techniques in the Middle East, which may have also influenced the development of the pointed arch.Therefore, while there may not be a specific event in the year 1090 that directly influenced the pointed arch, it can be seen as a result of a complex blend of cultural and historical factors over several centuries.
