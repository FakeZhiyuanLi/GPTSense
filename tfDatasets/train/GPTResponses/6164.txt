Writing was introduced after the evolution of language. The exact timeline of when writing was first developed is uncertain, but it is believed to have emerged independently in different parts of the world around 5000 years ago. The earliest known writing systems, such as cuneiform in Mesopotamia and hieroglyphics in Egypt, were developed to keep records and communicate information.
