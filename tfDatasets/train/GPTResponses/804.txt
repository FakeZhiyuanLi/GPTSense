The term "prehension" generally refers to an entity's ability to grasp, hold or seize objects or ideas. Regarding an entity's perceptions and relations, prehension can be understood as the way in which the entity "grasps" or "seizes" the world around it. This can include how it perceives and interacts with other entities, as well as how it understands and relates to the various objects, concepts, and events it encounters. In the context of philosophical or phenomenological inquiry, prehension is often used to describe the ways in which individuals or groups make sense of their experiences, and how they develop their own unique perspectives and worldviews based on those experiences.
