Partial migration refers to a situation where only a section of a population migrates to a new place while the others opt to stay behind in their original location. This type of migration is often driven by economic or social factors, where the migrants may be seeking better job opportunities or a better quality of life in the new location while the non-migrants may prefer to maintain their familiar surroundings, such as family ties, cultural traditions or a sense of community. It is for this reason that partial migration is often regarded as a slower process than full migration because it takes a longer time for a complete relocation of a group.
