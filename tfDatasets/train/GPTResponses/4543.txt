The technology that supports the drinking of chilled beer is refrigeration technology. This involves a refrigeration system composed of various components such as compressors, condensers, evaporators, and refrigerants that work together to create a cool environment that keeps the beer cold. Refrigeration technology can be found in beer coolers, kegerators, and commercial refrigeration systems used in bars and restaurants.
