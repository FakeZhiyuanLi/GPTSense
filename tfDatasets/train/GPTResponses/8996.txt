It is difficult to pinpoint the exact pastor of the earliest church labeled "baptist" as the origins of the Baptist denomination trace back to the 17th century and there were many Baptist churches that emerged during this time. However, some historians believe that John Smyth and Thomas Helwys were among the early pastors who established Baptist churches in England in the early 1600s.
