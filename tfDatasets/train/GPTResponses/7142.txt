In cubism, architecture was an interested base for creating abstract compositions using geometric shapes and forms that resembled buildings and structures. This interest in architecture was influenced by the modern urban environment and the rapid developments in technology and industry during the early 20th century. The cubist artists were fascinated by the juxtaposition of different elements in urban landscapes, such as buildings, bridges, and machinery, and sought to capture the dynamic, fragmented, and multi-perspective character of modern life through their art. They also incorporated architectural motifs, such as columns, arches, and facades, into their compositions as a way of exploring the relationship between form and space.
