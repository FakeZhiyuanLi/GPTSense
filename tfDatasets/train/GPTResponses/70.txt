The Merwede-Oude Maas, Waal, and Lek form the Delta region of the Netherlands, where numerous smaller rivers and streams converge before flowing into the North Sea. This region is one of the most densely populated and economically important areas of the Netherlands, containing large cities such as Rotterdam and Dordrecht, as well as extensive agricultural land and important transportation infrastructure.
