Edward's proposed marriage to Simpson caused a constitutional crisis in the United Kingdom in 1936. Simpson was an American divorcee, and at that time, the Church of England did not allow divorced individuals to remarry if their former spouse was still alive. As Edward was the King of the United Kingdom, his proposed marriage to Simpson caused a conflict because it violated the Church's teachings and the conventions of the British monarchy. In the end, Edward abdicated the throne to marry Simpson, and his younger brother, George VI, succeeded him as King. The crisis led to changes in British law and practices, including the Royal Marriages Act of 1772, which limits the freedom of members of the British royal family to marry.
