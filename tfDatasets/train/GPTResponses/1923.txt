``Spring forward, fall back'' is a mnemonic phrase used to help people remember which way to adjust their clocks when daylight saving time (DST) begins and ends. In spring, people move their clocks forward one hour, so they lose an hour of sleep and it feels like they are jumping forward in time. In fall, people move their clocks back one hour, so they gain an hour of sleep and it feels like they are falling back in time.
