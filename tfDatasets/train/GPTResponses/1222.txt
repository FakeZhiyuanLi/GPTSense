Janjevci are a Croatian ethnic group who historically lived in the town of Janjevo (also known as JanjevÃ«, Janjeva or Sveti Ivan) in Kosovo. Following the Kosovo War in the late 1990s, many Janjevci were forced to flee and have since resettled in other parts of Kosovo, Serbia, Croatia, and other countries. Today, there are estimated to be around 4,000 Janjevci living outside of Kosovo.
