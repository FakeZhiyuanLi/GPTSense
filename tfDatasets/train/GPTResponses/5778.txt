Napoleon's legal achievement was the Napoleonic Code, also known as the French Civil Code, which was first introduced in 1804. This code revolutionized the legal system in France by simplifying and unifying the law, and it had a significant impact on legal systems around the world. The Napoleonic Code placed a strong emphasis on individual rights and property ownership, and it served as a model for legal codes in countries such as Italy, Spain, and parts of Latin America. Today, the Napoleonic Code continues to influence legal systems in over a quarter of the world's jurisdictions.
