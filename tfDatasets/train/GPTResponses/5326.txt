Land-based surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems can be deployed by transportation vehicles and then mobilized into a fixed or mobile position. Here are the general steps for deploying land-based SAMs:1. Planning: Identify the location and type of SAM system needed, as well as the terrain, weather and other environmental factors that may affect deployment.2. Transport: Use specialized trucks, trailers, or cargo planes to transport the SAM system equipment to the deployment site.3. Assembly: Once the system is on-site, technicians assemble the various components to form a complete SAM system. This includes assembling the launchers, radar units, control centers, and other components.4. Site preparation: The deployment site must be leveled and stabilized to support the launchers and other equipment. This may include laying foundation pads, building trenches and access roads, and installing power and communication lines.5. Testing: Before the SAM system is put into operation, technicians conduct thorough testing to ensure that all components are working properly.6. Operation: Once the SAM system is operational, it can be moved or repositioned as needed to adapt to changing threats and mission requirements.
