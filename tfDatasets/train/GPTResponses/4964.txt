The alcohol and illegal drug habits of teens tend to be shaped by a combination of factors including peer pressure, family history of substance use, availability and accessibility of drugs and alcohol, mental health issues such as anxiety and depression, and the desire to fit in or rebel against societal norms. Additionally, media and social media influence can also play a role in shaping attitudes and beliefs about substance use.
