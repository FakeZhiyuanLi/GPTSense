No, candidates are not required to express belief in a specific religion in most countries, as religion is not a criterion for eligibility to run for public office. However, some countries may have certain requirements or expectations based on their political and cultural traditions. For example, in some Muslim-majority countries, candidates may be expected to be practicing Muslims or at least publicly identify as Muslim.
