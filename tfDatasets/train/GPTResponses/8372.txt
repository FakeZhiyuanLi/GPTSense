There are many groups that are isomorphic to cyclic groups. In fact, any finite cyclic group of order n is isomorphic to the group of integers modulo n under addition. Similarly, any infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to the group of integers under addition. Additionally, any subgroup of a cyclic group is also cyclic, so any such subgroup is isomorphic to a cyclic group.However, not all groups are isomorphic to cyclic groups. For example, the dihedral group of order 6 is not isomorphic to any cyclic group.
