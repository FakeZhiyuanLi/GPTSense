When a referee is out, wrestlers can continue to fight but should stop at regular intervals and wait for the referee to recover. If the referee is unable to continue, the wrestlers should wait for a replacement to arrive. In the meantime, the wrestlers should follow the rules of the match and avoid using illegal moves. They should also communicate with each other to prevent any misunderstandings or accidents. If necessary, the wrestlers can appeal to the audience or other officials for help in determining the outcome of the match.
