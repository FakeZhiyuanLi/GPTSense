Shia Muslims believe that the true successors of Prophet Muhammad were his cousin and son-in-law, Ali ibn Abi Talib, and his descendants. These successors are known as Imams among Shia Muslims. The Shia believe that the Prophet Muhammad designated Ali as his successor, and that each Imam after him was appointed by the previous Imam, based on divine guidance. The Shia recognize twelve Imams, with the twelfth Imam, Muhammad al-Mahdi, currently in occultation and awaited to return as the final Imam.
