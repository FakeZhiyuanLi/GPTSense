Byte order marks (BOMs) are forbidden in protocols using the UTF-8 standard. UTF-8 is a variable-length character encoding for Unicode that uses one to four bytes to represent each character. BOMs are not necessary in UTF-8 because the byte order is always specified as big-endian. If a BOM is used in a UTF-8 protocol, it may cause errors or be interpreted as part of the data, leading to incorrect results or failures.
