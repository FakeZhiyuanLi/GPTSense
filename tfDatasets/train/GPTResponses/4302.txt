Adolescence is a period of multiple transitions, including physical, cognitive, emotional, and social changes. These changes can occur at different rates and can vary from person to person. The entire adolescent period can last several years and involve a series of changes that are interconnected and influence each other. Therefore, it is important to consider adolescence as a period of multiple transitions rather than a single event.
