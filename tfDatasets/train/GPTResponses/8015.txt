The Europeans of the Dominican Order brought a strong religious and intellectual foundation to the group. They were trained in theology, philosophy, and other areas of academia, which helped in the spread of Christianity and the establishment of educational institutions. They also brought a disciplined and organized approach to missionary work, which helped in the institutionalization of the Church in the Americas. Additionally, the Dominicans brought a strong commitment to social justice and advocacy for the oppressed, which became a hallmark of their missionary work.
