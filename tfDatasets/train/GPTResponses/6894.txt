The Statute of Westminster was a set of laws passed by the British Parliament in 1931, which granted greater autonomy to Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Ireland within the British Empire. It established the principle of the equality of the self-governing dominions of the British Empire, and granted them the power to pass laws without the interference of the British Parliament. It also marked an important step towards the eventual independence of these countries.
