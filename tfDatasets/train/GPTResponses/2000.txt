The US Supreme Court has ruled that treaties do not have a privileged position over acts of Congress in several cases. One such case is Missouri v. Holland (1920), in which the Court held that a treaty could not override the power of Congress to regulate the hunting of migratory birds within state borders. Another case is Reid v. Covert (1957), in which the Court held that a treaty could not abrogate the criminal jurisdiction of US courts over US citizens. Additionally, in United States v. Belmont (1937), the Court held that an executive agreement (which is similar to a treaty but does not require Senate approval) between the US and the Soviet Union could be enforced over the objections of a state law that conflicted with the agreement, indicating that executive agreements may have a stronger position than treaties in some instances.
