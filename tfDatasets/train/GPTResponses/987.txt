The "pencil test" was administered primarily by white slave owners and white medical professionals during the era of slavery in the United States. The test was used to determine an individual's racial identity, with the belief that individuals with "too much" African ancestry would fail the test by not being able to hold a pencil in their hair. The test was also used as a means of justifying certain privileges and opportunities based on a person's perceived race.
