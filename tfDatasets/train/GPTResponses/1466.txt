According to a census conducted in 2010, approximately 54% of the Brazilian population identifies as Black or Mixed race, which includes people with African ancestry. However, it's difficult to determine exactly how many of these individuals are descendants of slavery. It's estimated that between 12 million and 15 million enslaved Africans were brought to Brazil between the 16th and 19th centuries, so a significant portion of the population likely has some ancestral ties to slavery.
