Whitehead challenged the traditional Western philosophy of substance dualism, which posits that the mind and body are two distinct entities that exist separately. He proposed a more holistic view of the world and rejected the notion of fixed, discrete substances, instead emphasizing the interdependence and interconnectedness of all things. This idea, known as process philosophy, holds that everything is constantly changing and evolving, and that events and entities are best understood in terms of their relationships and interactions with other things.
