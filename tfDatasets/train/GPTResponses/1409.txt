The use of the term "Middle East" as a region of international affairs began in the late 19th century and was initially used by British colonial officials to refer to the area between Europe and South Asia, including modern-day Iran, Iraq, and Palestine. The term gained widespread use during and after World War II, when the United States became more involved in the region and began to use the term in its international relations. Today, the Middle East typically refers to the region that includes Southwest Asia and parts of North Africa.
