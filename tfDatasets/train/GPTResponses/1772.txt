David Lloyd George's coalition government rejected the proposal for Irish self-government in 1921. Instead, they passed the Government of Ireland Act, which partitioned Ireland into Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland, with the former remaining part of the United Kingdom and the latter having limited self-government within the British Empire. This decision ultimately led to the Irish War of Independence and further tensions between Ireland and the UK.
