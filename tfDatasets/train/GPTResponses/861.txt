Gravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of spacetime that are caused by the acceleration of massive objects, particularly those involved in cataclysmic events such as black hole mergers and supernovae explosions. These waves propagate through the universe at the speed of light and can be detected by sensitive instruments, such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), which recorded the first direct detection of gravitational waves in 2015. The detection of gravitational waves provides a new way to study the universe and test Einstein's theory of general relativity.
