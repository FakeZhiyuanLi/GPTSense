Most animals do not use the energy of sunlight directly. Instead, they obtain their energy from organic molecules such as carbohydrates, proteins, and fats by consuming plants or other animals. These organic molecules are produced by photosynthesis, a process in which plants use the energy of sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into organic molecules. Most animals are either herbivores or carnivores, meaning they consume either plants or other animals respectively, to obtain the energy they need to survive. Some animals, such as some species of butterflies and beetles, do use the energy of sunlight directly by basking in the sun to raise their body temperature and increase their activity levels.
