The historical study of Cubism began in the early 20th century, specifically around the time that the movement was taking shape in Paris in the years leading up to World War I (1914-1918). The term "cubism" was first used by art critic Louis Vauxcelles in 1908 to describe a painting by Georges Braque that featured geometric shapes and forms. From there, Cubism quickly became a major artistic movement that had a profound influence on modern art and culture. Its key figures, including Pablo Picasso and Braque, continued to evolve their style and techniques throughout the early 20th century, creating a rich body of work that has been studied and celebrated for over a century.
