Avidya is a Sanskrit term that refers to ignorance, or the lack of knowledge and understanding. It is one of the central concepts in Hindu, Jain and Buddhist philosophy, where it is often used to describe the root cause of suffering and the cycle of rebirth. In Hinduism, avidya is seen as a fundamental obstacle to achieving moksha (liberation or enlightenment), which can only be attained by transcending ignorance through spiritual practice and wisdom. In Buddhism, avidya is regarded as one of the three poisons (along with desire and aversion) that bind individuals to samsara (the cycle of birth and death), and is considered the main cause of dukkha (suffering or dissatisfaction).
