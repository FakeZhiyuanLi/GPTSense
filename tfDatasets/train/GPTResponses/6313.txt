The use of conjunctions and transitional phrases in written and spoken discourse can indicate that Sanskrit and Prakrits existed together. For example, when comparing and contrasting different languages, a speaker or writer may use phrases such as "on one hand...on the other hand" or "in contrast to" to denote the coexistence of multiple linguistic systems. Additionally, the use of loanwords or borrowings from one language to the other can also demonstrate their interaction and intersection.
