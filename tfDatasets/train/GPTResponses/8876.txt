Darwin opposed the theory of special creation, which posited that God created each species separately and independently. This theory was championed by many religious leaders and scientists in the 19th century. Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection instead proposed that all species, including humans, evolved through the process of natural selection over millions of years, with no divine intervention.
