Dusky grouse are resident birds and do not typically migrate. They are found year-round in the same general area or range, although they may move to different elevations within their range according to seasonal changes in food availability and weather conditions. However, some dusky grouse populations in the far northern parts of their range may migrate short distances south for the winter, following the availability of food and suitable habitat.
