There are several ways to control when a movie can be shown:1. Digital Rights Management (DRM) technology can be used to limit when and how a movie can be played. This technology can restrict access to the movie based on time, geographic location, or other factors.2. By using specific film distributors, the owner of the movie can specify when and where the movie can be shown. The distributor will only release the movie to theaters or streaming services that agree to the terms of release, such as showing the movie at a specific time and only for a certain period.3. The owner of the movie can also choose to limit the movie's release to specific times of the year, such as holiday films only being released during the holiday season.4. If the movie is being shown in a theater, the owner can limit the showtimes to specific times of the day, such as only showing the movie during matinee hours.Overall, controlling when a movie can be shown requires a combination of technological solutions and contractual agreements.
