he called a "process" rather than as a collection of fixed and static entities. According to Whitehead, everything in the universe is in a constant state of flux and change, and nothing exists in isolation. Reality, he argued, is inherently relational and interconnected. This means that we cannot understand any part of reality in isolation from the whole rather, we must see it as part of a larger process of continual transformation and unfolding. Whitehead believed that this process could be understood through a new kind of metaphysics that emphasizes the dynamic nature of reality, one which takes into account the interdependence and interrelatedness of all things in the universe.
