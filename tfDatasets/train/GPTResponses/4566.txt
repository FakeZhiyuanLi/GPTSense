If an electrical current gets too high, copper can overheat and melt, causing damage to the circuit or device. This is because high current causes the copper to heat up and resist, which generates more heat, causing a destructive cycle. Additionally, excessive current can also cause oxidation or corrosion, which can degrade the copper and further affect its electrical conductivity. Therefore, it is essential to design electrical systems with appropriate copper wire size and to use protective circuits to prevent excessive current flow.
