One general concept that applies to elements of commutative rings is the notion of divisibility. Given two elements a and b in a commutative ring, we say that a divides b, denoted by a | b, if there exists another element c in the ring such that b = ac. This concept allows us to generalize the notion of prime and irreducible elements in rings, which have important applications in number theory and algebraic geometry.
