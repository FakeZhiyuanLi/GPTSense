Computer hardware is almost exclusively used for building new information processing systems. This includes devices such as central processing units (CPUs), motherboards, memory (RAM), hard drives, solid state drives (SSD), graphics cards, and input/output (I/O) devices such as keyboard, mouse, and monitor. These components are essential for the functioning of a computer and are combined to create a system capable of processing and storing information.
