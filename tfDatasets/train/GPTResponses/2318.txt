By the mid-20th century, the theory of evolution by natural selection proposed by Charles Darwin was widely accepted among scientists and the general public. This theory explained how species evolve over time through the process of natural selection, in which individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on those traits to their offspring. The theory of evolution by natural selection remains one of the most widely accepted scientific theories today.
