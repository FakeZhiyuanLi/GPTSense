analysis in social psychology.Individual cognition refers to the mental processes and abilities of an individual that influence their thoughts, behaviors, and emotions in response to their social environment. This includes perception, attention, memory, judgment, decision-making, and problem-solving.Collective behavior refers to the ways in which groups of individuals behave and interact in response to a shared social context or situation. This includes group norms, communication, influence, cooperation, conflict, and social movements.Both individual cognition and collective behavior are levels of analysis in social psychology because they focus on different aspects of human behavior and social interaction. Individual cognition explores how the mental processes of individuals shape their behavior, while collective behavior examines how social context and group dynamics influence behavior. Both are important for understanding how individual behavior and decision-making are influenced by larger social forces and how group behavior emerges from the interactions of individual members.
