presenting a subject with two stimuli that differ only slightly in intensity (such as two colors, two sounds or two weights) and asking the subject to identify which stimulus is stronger or different from the other. The difference between the two stimuli required for the subject to detect a noticeable difference is then used to calculate the jnd or the minimum difference (or just noticeable difference) required for detection.
