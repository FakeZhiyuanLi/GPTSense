There are several factors that contribute to an increase in fires during fall and winter months:1. Heating appliances: As the temperatures drop, people turn on their heating appliances such as space heaters, fireplaces, and furnaces, which can pose a fire hazard if not used properly.2. Cooking: During the holidays, people spend more time in the kitchen cooking and baking, which can lead to grease fires or other cooking-related accidents.3. Candles: Candles are popular during the fall and winter months for creating a cozy atmosphere, but they also pose a significant fire hazard if left unattended.4. Electrical issues: With more lights and electronics in use during the holiday season, there is an increased risk of electrical fires caused by overloaded outlets or faulty wiring.To prevent fires during the fall and winter months, it is important to practice safety measures such as regularly checking heating appliances, keeping flammable objects away from heat sources, and never leaving candles or cooking unattended.
