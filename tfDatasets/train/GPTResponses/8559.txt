Hermann Ebbinghaus was a German psychologist who is best known for his pioneering work in the field of learning and memory. He conducted experiments on human memory and retention, and discovered the "forgetting curve" which described how memory declines over time without reinforcement. Additionally, he coined the term "nonsense syllables" to refer to meaningless words used in memory experiments. His research is considered foundational to the study of cognitive psychology.
