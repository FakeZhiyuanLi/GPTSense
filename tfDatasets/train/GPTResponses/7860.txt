Tourism became the main source of Bermuda's economy in the 1970s. The island's beautiful beaches, warm climate, and rich history attracted a growing number of tourists from North America and Europe, who spent money on accommodations, food, souvenirs, and other tourist activities. The government and private sector invested heavily in developing the tourism industry, building new hotels, resorts, and attractions to attract visitors from around the world. Today, tourism remains a vital part of Bermuda's economy, along with banking, finance, and other services.
