King Edward the Confessor's canonisation was influenced by his reputation as a pious and just ruler who did a lot for the church during his reign. Additionally, many miracles were attributed to him following his death, which further bolstered his reputation as a saintly figure. It is believed that the intervention of Pope Alexander II, who was a personal friend of King Edward, also played a significant role in his canonisation.
