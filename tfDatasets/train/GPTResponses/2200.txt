There is no specific or defined value for the lowest error rate that occurs in eukaryotic cells, as it can vary depending on the type of error, the stage of the cell cycle, and other factors. However, in general, eukaryotic cells have multiple mechanisms for error correction and quality control, such as DNA repair pathways and checkpoints throughout the cell cycle, which help to reduce the frequency of errors and promote accurate genetic replication and cell division.
