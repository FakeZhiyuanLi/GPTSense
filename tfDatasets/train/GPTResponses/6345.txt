Patricia Crone, a historian and scholar of Islam, argued that the Umayyads regarded Islam as a particularly aristocratic faith. She claimed that the Umayyad dynasty, which ruled the Islamic empire from 661 to 750 CE, espoused an elitist view of Islam that emphasized the power and privilege of the ruling class. According to Crone, the Umayyads saw themselves as the rightful leaders of the Islamic world because they were descended from the Prophet Muhammad's tribe, the Quraysh, and therefore believed that they had a special religious status. They promoted an Arabic-centric form of Islam that privileged those who spoke Arabic and identified with Arab culture, while marginalizing non-Arab converts to Islam. This approach favored an urban, sophisticated, and worldly elite, rather than the pious and ascetic values that were often associated with early Islam.
