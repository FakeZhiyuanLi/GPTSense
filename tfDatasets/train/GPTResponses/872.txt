one would normally think of as a state of mind, but rather a state of ultimate liberation called Nirvana. This state is said to be free from all suffering and afflictions, and is achieved through the practice of the Eightfold Path which includes ethical conduct, mindfulness, and meditation. While there are different levels of meditative states that one can attain through meditation, ultimately these states are seen as temporary and not the end goal in and of themselves. Rather, the ultimate aim of Buddhist practice is to realize the nature of reality and achieve liberation from suffering.
