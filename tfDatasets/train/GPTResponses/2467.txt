A knot can also form when a branch dies and falls off the tree, leaving a scar on the trunk. As the tree grows and expands, the scar tissue may become filled with new growth, resulting in a knot. Additionally, a knot can form when two or more branches grow closely together and fuse, creating a bulge in the trunk. Knots can also form from insect damage or other forms of injury to the tree.
