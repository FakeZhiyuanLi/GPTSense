Cliques are defined as exclusive groups of people who share similar interests, behaviors, or background, and who tend to associate primarily with each other while excluding others. These groups can form in various settings, such as schools, workplaces, or social circles, and are often characterized by their close-knit nature and a sense of loyalty and conformity among members. Cliques can have both positive and negative effects on individuals and social dynamics, depending on the dynamics and behavior of the group.
