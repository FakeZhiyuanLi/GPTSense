State parties to a treaty must repeat the process for ratification and approval to adopt a formal amendment to the treaty. This often involves a formal agreement or resolution by the relevant governing body in each state, followed by a deposit of the ratified amendment with the depositary or secretariat of the treaty. The specific requirements for adopting a formal amendment may vary depending on the terms of the treaty and the domestic laws of each state.
