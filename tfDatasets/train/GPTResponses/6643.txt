When both the federal and state governments have regulations that overlap, it often causes confusion and conflict between the two. This can lead to disagreements over which regulations should take precedence and can cause delays in implementing policies. Additionally, businesses and individuals may face confusion as they try to navigate the different regulations. In some cases, legal challenges may arise as parties seek to challenge or enforce different regulations. Ultimately, the result of overlapping regulations can be increased complexity and inefficiency in government policy-making and implementation.
