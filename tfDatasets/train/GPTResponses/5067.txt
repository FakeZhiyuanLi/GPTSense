Small-scale farmers, subsistence farmers, and organic farmers are generally less dependent on capital, biotechnology, and energy. These types of farmers often rely on traditional and sustainable farming methods that prioritize soil health, crop diversity, and local resources over expensive inputs. They may also use techniques like crop rotation, composting, and natural pest management instead of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Additionally, they may cultivate crops that are adapted to the local climate and conditions, rather than relying on genetically modified seeds or high-tech irrigation systems.
