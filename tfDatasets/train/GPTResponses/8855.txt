There were several factors that caused the delay in the development and adoption of the electrical telegraph. One of the main reasons was the lack of understanding and knowledge about electricity and electrical circuits during the early 19th century. It took some time for scientists and engineers to develop the necessary technology and equipment to design and build a reliable telegraph system.Another reason was the lack of a standardized code for transmitting messages. Different telegraph companies used different systems, which made it difficult to communicate across different networks. It was only after the invention of Morse code in 1837 that a standardized code was developed, which allowed for more efficient transmission of messages.The high cost of building and maintaining telegraph lines was also a barrier to its widespread adoption. It required a significant investment of capital to lay thousands of miles of telegraph lines across the country, which many companies could not afford.Finally, there was also resistance from some industries, such as the postal service, which saw the telegraph as a potential competitor. As a result, it took some time for the telegraph to gain widespread acceptance and become a ubiquitous means of communication.
