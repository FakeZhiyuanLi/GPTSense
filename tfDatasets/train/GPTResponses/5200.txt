One possible nontrinitarian theologian who argues that God cannot approach evil spirits to redeem them is Arius, a 4th century Christian theologian who rejected the doctrine of the Trinity and taught that Jesus was a created being rather than co-equal with God. Arius argued that God was pure and holy, and therefore could not directly interact with evil or sinful beings. Instead, Arius believed that God used intermediaries or agents to communicate and act on his behalf, such as angels and prophets. Arius also rejected the idea of eternal damnation, instead teaching that sinners would eventually be purified and reconciled to God through a process of moral improvement and repentance. However, it is important to note that there are many different nontrinitarian theological perspectives, and not all nontrinitarians would necessarily agree with Arius on this or any other issue.
