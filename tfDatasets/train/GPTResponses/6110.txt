The most commonly used fuel in nuclear reactors is uranium-235, which undergoes fission and produces plutonium-239 as a byproduct. Other fissile materials such as uranium-233 and plutonium-241 can also be converted into plutonium-239 in a nuclear reactor. However, the production of plutonium-239 is tightly regulated due to its potential use in nuclear weapons.
