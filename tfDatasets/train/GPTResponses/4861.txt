One's self-esteem is identified as determining how a person views him or herself to a significant degree. Self-esteem is a person's overall evaluation or appraisal of their own worth or value. It is shaped by a combination of factors, including past experiences, social influences, and personal beliefs and attitudes. Having high or low self-esteem can significantly impact an individual's mental and emotional health, relationships, and overall well-being.
