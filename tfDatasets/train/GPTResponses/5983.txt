The Pan American Health Organization recommended that there is no scientific evidence to support the use of so-called "conversion therapies" or any other form of treatment to change a person's sexual orientation, and that such practices can cause significant harm to an individual's mental and physical health. Therefore, they recommend that governments, health professionals, and society at large should work to eliminate these practices and support the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals to live free from discrimination and prejudice.
