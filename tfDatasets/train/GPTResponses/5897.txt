Targets for non-manpad SAMs (Surface-to-Air Missiles) are typically acquired through a variety of means including:1. Radar Systems: Many SAM systems are equipped with long-range radar systems that can detect incoming aircraft from several miles away. These systems provide the necessary data required to track and lock onto targets.2. Electro-Optical Sensors: SAM systems may also be equipped with electro-optical sensors that use visual or thermal imaging to locate and track incoming aircraft.3. Forward Observation Posts: In some cases, SAM systems may have dedicated observation posts or teams on the ground that can spot incoming aircraft visually and relay their position to the SAM system.4. Intelligence: The SAM operator may have access to intelligence reports that provide information about enemy aircraft movements in the area. This allows them to anticipate where incoming aircraft may be coming from and prepare accordingly.5. Data Link: Some SAM systems may be equipped with data links that allow them to receive real-time information about incoming aircraft from other sources such as aircraft or ground-based radars.Ultimately, the specific methods used to acquire targets for non-manpad SAMs will vary depending on the system and the situation.
