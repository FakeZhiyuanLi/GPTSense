As the Commonwealth nominations continued, several key events and developments evolved. These included:1. Greater diversity in candidates: As the Commonwealth became more diverse, there was a corresponding increase in the number of candidates from previously underrepresented regions. This included countries from Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean, who had previously not been nominated as frequently as European or Commonwealth countries.2. Increased scrutiny of candidates: With the growth of international media and communication technologies, there was greater scrutiny of candidates during the nomination process. This led to more transparent processes and a greater emphasis on ensuring that candidates met the criteria for the position they were vying for.3. Enhanced collaboration: Commonwealth countries began to work together more closely during the nominations process to ensure that the best candidate was selected. This included sharing information on potential nominees and working to build consensus on the most suitable candidate.4. Greater political involvement: As the profile of Commonwealth nominations grew, politicians in member countries began to take a greater interest in the process. This led to increased lobbying and support for certain candidates, as well as a corresponding pushback from those who felt that the selection process was becoming too politicized.Overall, the evolution of Commonwealth nominations reflected the changing nature of the organization itself, as well as broader trends in international diplomacy and politics.
