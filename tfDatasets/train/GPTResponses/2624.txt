The United Nations Charter states that treaties must be registered with the United Nations in order to promote transparency, accountability, and cooperation among member states. By registering a treaty with the United Nations, member states demonstrate their commitment to fulfilling the treaty obligations and allow other member states to be aware of the treaty's existence and provisions. The registration process also helps to prevent conflicts or misunderstandings between member states regarding the interpretation and implementation of a treaty. Additionally, the United Nations maintains a public record of registered treaties, which serves as a valuable resource for researchers and academics studying international law and diplomacy.
