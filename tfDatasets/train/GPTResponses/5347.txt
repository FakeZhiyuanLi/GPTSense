Protestants reject the practices of praying to the saints, asking for their intercession, venerating their relics and statues, and celebrating their feast days as holy days of obligation. They believe that only Jesus Christ is the mediator between God and human beings, and that those who have died are either in heaven or hell and cannot intervene in human affairs. Protestants also hold that all believers are saints, and that the term should not be reserved solely for those who have been canonized by the Catholic Church.
