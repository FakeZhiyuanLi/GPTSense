The original purpose of the British Schools of Montevideo was to provide education to the children of British expatriates living in Uruguay. The schools were founded in 1857 by the British community in Montevideo, and initially served as a way to promote British culture and values among the community's children. Over time, the schools evolved to serve a broader population of students, including Uruguayan students and children from other expatriate communities. Today, the British Schools of Montevideo offer bilingual education in English and Spanish, and are considered among the top schools in Uruguay.
