The intermarriage between South Slavs, Germanic Gepids, and Avar invaders occurred in the Pannonian Basin, which is present-day Hungary and surrounding areas. The Avars established a powerful empire controlled by a nomadic warrior elite, and they conquered the Gepids and other regional powers in the 7th century. As they settled in the region and established their rule, they intermarried with local populations, including the South Slavs and remaining Gepids. This intermarriage led to cultural exchange and influenced the development of the local Slavic cultures.
