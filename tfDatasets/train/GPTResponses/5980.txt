The Orphan Drug Act (ODA) of 1983 provides incentives for the development of drugs for rare diseases, or diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Drugs that are subject to the ODA are those that are intended to treat rare diseases or conditions and have been designated as orphan drugs by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These drugs may be exempt from certain regulatory requirements and may receive financial incentives, such as tax credits and exclusive marketing rights, to encourage their development and commercialization.
