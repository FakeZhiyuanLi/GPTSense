Aspirin was first synthesized in 1897 by a German chemist named Felix Hoffmann who worked at the pharmaceutical company Bayer. Hoffmann was trying to create a medication that could relieve his father's rheumatism pain, and he discovered that acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), a derivative of salicylic acid found in willow bark, had pain-relieving properties. Bayer registered the name "Aspirin" as a trademark in 1899, and the drug quickly became one of the most popular pain-relievers and fever-reducers in the world.
