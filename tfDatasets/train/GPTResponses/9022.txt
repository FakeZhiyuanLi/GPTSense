Federalism typically includes a central or federal government, as well as regional or state governments. These governments may have their own legislative, executive, and judicial branches, and they may have some degree of autonomy and authority over their own affairs while still being subject to the overall authority of the federal government. Examples of federalist systems include the United States, Canada, Australia, and Germany.
