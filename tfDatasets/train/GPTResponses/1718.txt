biased and problematic.Racial and colonial definitions of the Middle East often stereotype and essentialize the region and its people, reducing them to monolithic categories and ignoring the diversity and complexity of their cultures, histories, and identities. These definitions have been shaped by colonialism, Orientalism, and imperialism, which constructed the Middle East as a passive and inferior Other to the West, promoting notions of white superiority, cultural superiority, and scientific progress.For example, the racial definition of the Middle East considers the region as a homogeneous entity composed of non-white people, who are often labeled as "Arabo-Muslims" or "brown-skinned Arabs." This definition ignores the ethnic, linguistic, and religious diversity of the Middle East, as well as the fact that many Middle Easterners are white or have white ancestry.Similarly, the colonial definition of the Middle East views the region as a colonial product, created and controlled by Western powers, who imposed their political, economic, and cultural systems on the region. This definition ignores the agency and resistance of Middle Eastern societies, as well as the indigenous traditions and institutions that preceded the colonial encounter.Overall, racial and colonial definitions of the Middle East perpetuate stereotypes, perpetuate power imbalances, and obstruct genuine understanding and engagement between the Middle East and the rest of the world.
