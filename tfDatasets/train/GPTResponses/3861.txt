When digesta moves into the small intestine, it triggers the release of enzymes and bicarbonate from the pancreas and bile from the liver/gallbladder. These enzymes include amylase, lipase, and proteases, which break down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, respectively. The bicarbonate neutralizes the acidic chyme from the stomach to create a more favorable environment for enzyme activity. The bile emulsifies fats, making them easier to digest and absorb.The small intestine also has finger-like projections called villi and microvilli, which increase its surface area for absorption. Nutrients like glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids are absorbed into the bloodstream through the walls of the small intestine, while water and electrolytes are absorbed into the bloodstream or lymphatic system. The remaining indigestible material called fiber or waste products form feces and are passed out of the body through the rectum and anus during defecation.
