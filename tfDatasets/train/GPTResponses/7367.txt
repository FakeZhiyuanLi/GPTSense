The first leader of a unified Greece is considered to be Alexander the Great, who conquered the city-states of Greece and went on to establish an empire that spanned much of the known world at the time. However, before Alexander, there were several leaders who sought to unite Greece under their rule, such as Philip II of Macedon and Sparta's King Agamemnon.
