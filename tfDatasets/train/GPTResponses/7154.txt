In very large congregations, elders may delegate responsibilities such as assisting with pastoral care, leading small groups and Bible studies, organizing events and outreach programs, overseeing finances, and managing the physical property and facilities of the church. They may also work closely with staff members and volunteers to ensure that the needs of the congregation are being met and that the church is effectively serving its community. Additionally, they may delegate specific tasks to deacons or other church leaders who are responsible for carrying out specific functions within the church.
