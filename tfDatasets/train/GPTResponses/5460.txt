Victorian Aboriginal groups were dispossessed between the years of 1835 and 1901. This period saw the arrival of European settlers in the area and the subsequent appropriation of land and resources that had traditionally belonged to Indigenous peoples. The dispossession of land and the forced removal of Indigenous people from their ancestral territories caused immense suffering and led to a range of social, cultural, and economic challenges for Victorian Aboriginal communities that continue to this day.
