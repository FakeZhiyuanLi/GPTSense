A criminal infringer is someone who has committed copyright infringement or trademark infringement in such a way that it is considered a criminal offense. To be prosecuted, the criminal infringer would have had to perform an act such as reproducing or distributing copyrighted material or using a trademark without permission, with the intent to profit from it or knowing that it would cause harm to the rightful owner. The infringement must also have been willful and deliberate, rather than accidental or unknowing. If found guilty, the criminal infringer may face fines, imprisonment, or both.
