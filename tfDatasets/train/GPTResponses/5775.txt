There is no fixed number of components that are used in assessment, as it depends on the type of assessment being utilized and the specific goals of the assessment. Some assessments may involve only one or two components, such as a multiple-choice test, while others may require a more comprehensive approach that incorporates multiple types of assessments, such as observation, interviews, standardized tests, and self-assessment. Additionally, different domains of assessment, such as academic, social-emotional, or vocational, may also require different types and numbers of assessment components.
