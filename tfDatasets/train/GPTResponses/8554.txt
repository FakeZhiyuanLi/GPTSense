Noether's theorem connects continuous symmetries to conserved quantities. It states that for every continuous symmetry in a physical system, there exists a corresponding conserved quantity. For example, the conservation of energy can be derived from the time translation symmetry of the laws of physics. Similarly, the conservation of linear momentum can be derived from the spatial translation symmetry. The conservation of angular momentum can be derived from the rotational symmetry of the laws of physics.
