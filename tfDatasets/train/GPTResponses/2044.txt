The MP3 compression format takes advantage of the fact that most audio signals have redundant and irrelevant information that can be discarded without significant loss in perceived sound quality. It also relies on the psychoacoustic masking phenomenon, where some sounds will mask other sounds that are close to them in time and frequency, making those sounds unnecessary for encoding. Additionally, the MP3 format uses a bit rate reduction technique that reduces the number of bits used to represent the sound data, which further reduces the file size.
