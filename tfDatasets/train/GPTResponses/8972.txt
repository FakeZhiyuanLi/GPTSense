The main components that play a role in asthma include:1. Inflammation: Inflammation of the airways causes them to swell and produce excess mucus, which makes it difficult to breathe.2. Airway hyperresponsiveness: The airways become overly sensitive to triggers, causing them to narrow and make it difficult to breathe.3. Constriction of muscles: The muscles surrounding the airways can tighten, further obstructing airflow.4. Environmental triggers: Exposure to irritants such as dust, pollen, pollution, and cigarette smoke can trigger asthma symptoms.5. Genetic predisposition: Asthma can run in families and certain genetic factors make individuals more susceptible to developing the condition.6. Immune system dysfunction: The immune system can overreact to triggers, leading to inflammation and constriction of the airways.
