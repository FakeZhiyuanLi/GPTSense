One of the most serious effects of exposure to pesticides is the increased risk of cancer. Studies have linked exposure to certain pesticides with various types of cancer including leukemia, lymphoma, brain cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and others. Pesticides can also cause other health problems such as reproductive and developmental disorders, respiratory problems, and neurological effects. Additionally, pesticide exposure can harm non-target species and disrupt environmental ecosystems.
