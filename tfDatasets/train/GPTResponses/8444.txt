One example of a lesser-known instrument taught at Eton is the bassoon. While the bassoon is not as commonly played as instruments like the piano or violin, it is an important member of the woodwind family and has a unique sound. Students at Eton have the opportunity to learn and play the bassoon as part of the school's music program.
