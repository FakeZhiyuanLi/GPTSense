Birds store energy in the form of fat, which is stored in their adipose tissue. This fat is utilized by the bird's body as a fuel source during periods of high energy demand, such as during long flights or times of food scarcity. Birds also have a specialized digestive system that allows for efficient absorption of nutrients from their food, which helps to maintain their energy levels over extended periods of time. Additionally, some species of birds are able to enter into temporary low-energy states, such as torpor, which allows them to conserve energy during periods of inactivity or unfavorable conditions.
