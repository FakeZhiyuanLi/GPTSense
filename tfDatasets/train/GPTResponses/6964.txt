The tropical weather on the east side of Bolivia allows for the growth of lush vegetation, including rainforests and savannas, as well as the cultivation of crops such as soybeans, corn, and coffee. It also supports a diverse range of wildlife, including species such as jaguars, monkeys, and toucans. The warm climate and ample rainfall also make this region attractive for tourists seeking outdoor activities such as hiking, birdwatching, and river rafting.
