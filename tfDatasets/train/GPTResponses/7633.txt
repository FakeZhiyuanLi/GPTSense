Galen believed that pneuma was a vital force that flowed through the body and was responsible for life and health. He believed that there were different types of pneuma, such as arterial pneuma that flowed through the arteries and venous pneuma that flowed through the veins. Galen believed that pneuma was produced in the lungs and circulated throughout the body, and that any imbalance or blockage of pneuma could result in illness or disease.
