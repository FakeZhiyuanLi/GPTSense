Several systems use a pair of trackers, including:1. Virtual reality systems - A pair of trackers are used to track the position and movement of the user's hands or other body parts inside a virtual environment.2. Motion capture systems - A pair of trackers are used to track the movement of actors or objects in a studio setting, which is then used to create computer-generated imagery for movies or games.3. GPS tracking systems - A pair of trackers can be used to track the location of vehicles, people or objects in real-time, allowing for better tracking and monitoring of assets.4. Eye tracking systems - A pair of trackers are used to track the movement of a user's eyes, which can be used in research studies, or to develop marketing and advertising campaigns.5. Robotics systems - A pair of trackers can be used to track the movement of robot arms or legs, allowing them to mimic human movement more accurately.
