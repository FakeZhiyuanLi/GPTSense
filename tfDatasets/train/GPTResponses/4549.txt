The hobby that champions the use of Old English is called "Anglo-Saxon reenactment" or simply "Saxon reenactment." It involves studying and recreating the lifestyle, culture, and language of the Anglo-Saxon period in England, which spanned from the 5th to the 11th century AD. Old English, also known as Anglo-Saxon, was the language spoken by the Anglo-Saxons during this time, and enthusiasts of Saxon reenactment often strive to learn and use this ancient language in their activities and conversations.
