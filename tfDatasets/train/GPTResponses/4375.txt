More fermentable sugars are added to beer during the brewing process to increase the alcohol content of the beer. When yeast consumes the sugars, it produces ethanol and carbon dioxide, which increases the alcohol content of the beer. Adding more fermentable sugars can also result in a drier taste and lighter body to the beer. This process is often used in the creation of stronger beers, such as barley wines or imperial stouts.
