The aim of the City and Guilds College when it was founded was to provide technical education and training for skilled workers and engineers in Britain. It was established in 1878 by the City and Guilds of London Institute with the intention of improving the quality of British industry by promoting practical education in science, engineering, and technology. The college was also meant to serve as a model for other technical institutions in the country.
