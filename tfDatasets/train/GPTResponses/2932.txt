Modern operating systems, such as Windows, macOS, and Linux, rely on UTC to manage time for various functions, such as system logs, scheduled tasks, and synchronization with network time servers. Additionally, many system utilities, such as backup and recovery software, also use UTC to ensure consistency and accuracy in timestamp-based metadata. Cloud computing platforms also rely heavily on UTC to coordinate distributed systems and maintain data consistency across multiple time zones.
