King Farouk was forced to abdicate in July 1952 after a military coup led by General Muhammad Naguib and Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser. He was sent into exile to Italy, where he lived a luxurious life until his death in 1965. He continued to claim the title of king and made several unsuccessful attempts to regain the throne.
