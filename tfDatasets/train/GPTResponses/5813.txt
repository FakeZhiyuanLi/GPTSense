The Athanasian Creed draws upon the teachings of the Nicene Creed, particularly the belief in the Trinity - the unity of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit as three distinct persons who are all equally God. It also emphasizes the belief in the incarnation of Jesus Christ, his death and resurrection, and the concept of eternal life. It is a concise summary of Christian beliefs that developed as a response to various heresies and controversies in the early Christian church.
