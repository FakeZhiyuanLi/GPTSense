The Hemudu and Liangzhu cultures were early Neolithic cultures that existed in the Yangtze River Delta region of southeastern China. They are known for their distinctive pottery styles, as well as for their advances in agriculture and the crafting of tools and implements. The Hemudu culture is believed to have existed from around 5000 BCE to 4500 BCE, while the Liangzhu culture emerged around 3300 BCE and lasted until around 2300 BCE. These cultures are considered important contributions to the early history and development of Chinese civilization.
