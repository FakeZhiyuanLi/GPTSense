Lactase is an enzyme that helps to break down the lactose sugar present in milk and other dairy products into simpler sugars, such as glucose and galactose, which our bodies can easily absorb and utilize. It is produced naturally in the small intestine of most mammals, including humans, but some people may have low levels of lactase or be lactose intolerant, which can cause digestive discomfort when consuming dairy products. Lactase supplements are available to aid in the digestion of lactose for those with lactose intolerance.
