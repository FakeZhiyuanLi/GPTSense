Atlantic City's lack of snowfall is due to its location in South Jersey and its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean. The ocean moderates the temperature, keeping it warmer than areas farther inland. This means that while other parts of the state may receive significant snowfall, Atlantic City typically only receives light dustings or none at all.
