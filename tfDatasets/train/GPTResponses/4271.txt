Microsoft described Kinect as a "revolutionary" motion-sensing input device for Xbox 360 that enabled users to control and interact with games and entertainment content using their body movements, voice commands, and hand gestures, without the need for a traditional controller. It was touted as a way to make gaming and media experiences more intuitive and immersive, as well as to expand the audience for console gaming beyond traditional gamers.
