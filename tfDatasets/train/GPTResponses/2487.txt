The Majuro Declaration for Climate Leadership addressed the issue of global climate change and its impacts on small island developing states (SIDS). It urged for urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit global temperature increase to below 1.5 degrees Celsius. The declaration also called for increased support and cooperation among nations to help SIDS adapt to the impacts of climate change such as rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and loss of biodiversity.
