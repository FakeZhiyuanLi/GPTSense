Buddhism is primarily based on the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama, also known as the Buddha, who lived in the Indian subcontinent approximately 2,500 years ago. However, Buddhist teachings and practices have evolved and diversified over time, and there are now many different schools and traditions within Buddhism that draw upon a variety of teachings and sources.
