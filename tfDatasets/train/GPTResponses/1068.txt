Slavic mercenaries settled in various parts of Europe during the early medieval period, including the Balkans, the Carpathian Mountains, and present-day Poland and Ukraine. Many Slavic warriors were hired by the Byzantine Empire to fight against the Avars and other enemies, and some settled in Byzantine-held territories like Greece and Bulgaria. Others migrated to areas further west, such as the Czech Republic and Germany, where they became part of local armies and societies. In the 9th century, some Slavic mercenaries were even hired by Charlemagne to fight against the Saxons in Germany.
