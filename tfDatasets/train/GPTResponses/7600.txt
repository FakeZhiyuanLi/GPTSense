Some a capella groups engage in vocal percussion, also known as beatboxing, to create rhythm and add complexity to their performance. Some groups also create instrumental sounds using only their voices, like mimicking guitar, bass or horns. Additionally, some a capella groups incorporate movement and choreography into their performances. Finally, some groups use theatrics, storytelling or comedic elements to enhance their performance.
