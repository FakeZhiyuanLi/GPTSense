The development that produced the first large fleet ships was the transition from sail to steam-powered ships during the Industrial Revolution. This allowed for the construction of larger, more efficient, and more powerful ships that could travel faster and carry heavier loads. This shift in technology also led to the creation of larger navies that could project more force across larger distances, resulting in the first large fleet ships. The first large fleet ships were built in the mid-19th century and quickly became a crucial factor in global military and economic power projection.
