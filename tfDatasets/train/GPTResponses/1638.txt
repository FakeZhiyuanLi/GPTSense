Many tubenosed birds, such as albatrosses and petrels, breed on remote islands in the Southern Ocean or in the North Pacific. These islands have little human disturbance and provide ideal nesting sites for these birds. Some species also breed on mainland coastal areas, where there are suitable breeding conditions.
