Non-intense feelings that lack a contextual stimulus are often referred to as "free-floating" or "generalized" emotions. These feelings are characterized by a sense of unease or discomfort that does not have a specific cause or trigger. They may be experienced as a low-level anxiety, a persistent sadness or melancholy, or a general sense of dissatisfaction or emptiness. People who experience these types of emotions may find it difficult to pinpoint the source of their feelings, which can make them harder to manage or resolve.
