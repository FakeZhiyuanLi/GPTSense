As a scientist, Darwin was curious about the patterns and processes that he observed in nature. He wondered why there was so much diversity and complexity in the natural world, and why certain species were more successful than others. He was also interested in understanding how different species were adapted to their environments, and how they evolved over time. These questions led him to develop his theory of evolution, which explained the patterns that he observed by proposing that species slowly change over time in response to changes in their environment, and that natural selection plays a key role in shaping the course of this process. By studying the natural world in detail, Darwin was able to uncover many of the underlying mechanisms that govern the evolution of life on Earth, and his work has had a profound impact on our understanding of biology and the natural world.
