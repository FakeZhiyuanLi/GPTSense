Some people believe that affirmative action should be based on socioeconomic status, rather than race. This approach would prioritize individuals from low-income and disadvantaged backgrounds, regardless of their race, and provide them with opportunities and resources to succeed. Others suggest that affirmative action should be based on merit, such as academic achievement or job qualifications, to ensure that the most qualified individuals are selected regardless of their race or socioeconomic status. Ultimately, the basis for affirmative action varies depending on individual perspectives and goals.
