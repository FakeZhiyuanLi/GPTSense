One of the great agricultural challenges that farmers face is climate change and its impact on the weather patterns, soil quality, and crop productivity. Climate change brings about extreme and unpredictable weather conditions like droughts, floods, heatwaves, and extreme cold, which can damage crops, affect the soil structure and degrade land quality. The changing climate is also causing pests and diseases to spread more rapidly, which is affecting crop yields and productivity. As a result, farmers have to adopt new techniques and technologies to mitigate the effects of climate change and ensure sustainable agricultural practices.
