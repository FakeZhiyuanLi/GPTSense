A large percentage of experts on the modern Middle East began their training in universities and academic institutions in the United States, Europe, and the Middle East itself. Many of these experts have degrees in Middle Eastern studies, international relations, history, anthropology, sociology, and political science. They often have diverse language skills, including fluency in Arabic, Persian, Turkish, and other regional languages. Additionally, some have gained practical experience through field research, working for governmental or non-governmental organizations, or living and studying in the Middle East.
