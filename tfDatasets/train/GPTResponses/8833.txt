There were several people who disputed Darwin's estimate of the age of the Earth and his theory of gradual evolution, including:1. Bishop James Ussher - In the 17th century, Bishop Ussher calculated the age of the Earth to be around 6,000 years old based on his interpretation of the Bible.2. Georges Cuvier - A French naturalist who proposed catastrophism, which suggested that the Earth had been subject to multiple catastrophic events that caused widespread extinctions and the rapid appearance of new species.3. Louis Agassiz - A Swiss-American naturalist who proposed the theory of glacial catastrophism, which suggested that the Earth had been repeatedly covered by massive glaciers that caused widespread extinctions and the rapid appearance of new species.4. Lord Kelvin - A British physicist who calculated the age of the Earth based on its cooling rate and estimated it to be around 20 million years old, which was much shorter than Darwin's estimate.5. William Thomson (later known as Lord Kelvin) - A British physicist who calculated the age of the Earth based on its cooling rate and estimated it to be around 20 million years old, which was much shorter than Darwin's estimate.
