Unicode was published as a standard for character encoding in computer systems. It was first published in 1991 by the Unicode Consortium, a non-profit organization that develops and promotes the use of Unicode. The standard aims to provide a universal set of characters that can be used across different languages and scripts, making it easier to exchange text and data between different systems and applications. Unicode has since become the de facto standard for character encoding in modern computing, with support for more than 143,000 characters across 154 scripts as of Unicode version 14.0.
