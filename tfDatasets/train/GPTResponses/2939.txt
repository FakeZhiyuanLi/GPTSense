The existence of discrete inheritable units was first suggested by Gregor Mendel in the mid-19th century, through his experiments with pea plants. He observed that certain traits were passed down in predictable patterns and postulated that there must be specific units, which he called "factors" (now known as genes), responsible for these traits. However, his work was largely ignored until the early 20th century, when it was rediscovered and became the foundation of modern genetics.
