1. Restrictive: Patents can restrict people from using or building upon certain inventions or ideas, even if they are not actually copying the original patented product or design.2. Limited time: While patents last a certain amount of time, they eventually expire, after which the ideas or products can be freely used by anyone who wants to. This creates pressure for inventors to constantly come up with new ideas and products in order to maintain their market position and income stream.3. Patent trolls: A common criticism of patents is that they can be used by so-called 'patent trolls' aka Non-Practicing Entities (NPEs), which are companies that buy patents and then file lawsuits against other companies for infringing on those patents. This practice can be incredibly costly and slow down innovation.4. Bureaucratic: The patent application process can be complicated and take a long time, leading some to argue that the bureaucracy involved in obtaining the patent can hinder rather than help innovation.5. Expensive: Patents can also be expensive to obtain and maintain, which can deter individuals and small businesses from seeking patent protection for their ideas and products.6. Overprotective: Some argue that patents are too restrictive and overprotective, giving too much power to large companies and stifling competition and innovation.
