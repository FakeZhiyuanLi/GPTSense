Biopesticides have seen rapid growth in development in recent years. Biopesticides are derived from natural materials, such as plants, bacteria, and fungi, and are used to control pests and diseases in crops. They offer several advantages over traditional chemical pesticides, including lower toxicity, greater specificity, and lower environmental impact. The market for biopesticides is expected to continue to grow as consumers demand safer and more sustainable agricultural practices.
