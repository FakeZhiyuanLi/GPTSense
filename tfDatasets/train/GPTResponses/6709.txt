During a countout in professional wrestling, if a wrestler is outside the ring and does not return to the ring within 10 seconds, they are counted out by the referee. If both wrestlers are outside the ring, the referee starts counting and whoever enters the ring first is declared the winner by countout. If neither wrestler makes it back into the ring by the count of 10, the match ends in a draw.
