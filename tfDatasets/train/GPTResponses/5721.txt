One example of a monarchy that the middle class could support was the constitutional monarchy in Britain during the 19th and 20th centuries. The monarchy was limited in its powers by a written constitution, and the middle class had a significant role in governing the country through parliament. The monarch was seen as a figurehead and symbol of national unity, but the real power was held by elected representatives who were accountable to the people. This system allowed for stability and continuity while also giving the people a voice in government.
