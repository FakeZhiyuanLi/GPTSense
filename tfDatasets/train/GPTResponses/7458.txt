One measure taken to keep society safe from improper pesticide use is the establishment of government regulations and guidelines. These regulations aim to ensure that pesticides are used safely and correctly, and that their use does not harm the environment or human health. Additionally, training and education programs are often offered to farmers and other pesticide users to promote proper use and handling of these chemicals. Regular monitoring and enforcement of regulations are also necessary to ensure compliance and penalize those who violate them.
