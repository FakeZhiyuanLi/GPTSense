Adolescence is viewed as the transitional period between childhood and adulthood, marked by physical, emotional, cognitive, and social changes. It typically begins with the onset of puberty and extends until the late teenage years or early adulthood, and is characterized by experimentation, risk-taking, self-discovery, and identity formation. Adolescence is a critical period of development that lays the foundation for adult life and can have a lasting impact on an individual's physical, mental, and social well-being.
