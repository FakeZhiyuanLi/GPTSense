The feature that survives in the Hill Lane area as evidence of the Didcot, Newbury, and Southampton Railway's work is a bridge that crosses over Hill Lane. It was built in the 1880s and is still in use today as part of the railway line that runs between Didcot and Southampton. The bridge is an example of the engineering achievements of the railway company and its importance in connecting the towns and cities along its route.
