A physical firewall typically consists of a piece of hardware that is designed to monitor and control network traffic. This device is typically installed between a network and the internet, and its purpose is to block unauthorized access, filter traffic, and prevent network attacks. Physical firewalls come in a variety of forms, including dedicated hardware appliances, software-based solutions, and network-facing routers or switches. They typically use a combination of rules, policies, and algorithms to monitor and filter incoming and outgoing traffic, and are often configured using a web-based interface or command-line interface (CLI). Physical firewalls may also include features such as intrusion prevention, content filtering, VPN capabilities, and threat intelligence integration.
