There is limited data available on the major causes of death in neonates in Eritrea. However, according to a study published in the Journal of Health, Population, and Nutrition, the leading causes of neonatal mortality in Eritrea were found to be asphyxia, preterm birth complications, and sepsis. Other factors such as low birth weight, lack of access to healthcare services, and poor maternal nutrition may also contribute to neonatal mortality in the country.
