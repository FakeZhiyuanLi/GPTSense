One type of indirect information that financial institutions and investors use to judge the risk is the credit rating of a borrower or an issuer. The credit rating is a score assigned by credit rating agencies that assess the creditworthiness of an individual or a company based on their financial history, current financial situation, and future prospects. A higher credit rating indicates a lower risk of default and a higher probability of the borrower or issuer fulfilling their financial obligations on time. Financial institutions and investors use credit ratings to evaluate the risk of lending money or investing in a particular security or bond.
