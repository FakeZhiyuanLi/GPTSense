According to Jewish tradition, the “blood of her purifying” for Mary after giving birth to Jesus would have been 40 days. Luke 2:22 states that after the birth of Jesus, Mary and Joseph took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord, as it is written in the Law of the Lord: “Every firstborn male is to be consecrated to the Lord,” and “to offer a sacrifice in keeping with what is said in the Law of the Lord: ‘a pair of doves or two young pigeons.’” This suggests that Mary’s purification period was 40 days, as required by Jewish law.
