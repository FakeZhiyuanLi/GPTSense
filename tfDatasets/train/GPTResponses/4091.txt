The FBI began to focus on civil rights issues in the 1950s and 1960s, during the height of the Civil Rights Movement. The agency became more involved in investigating cases of racial discrimination, police brutality, and violations of voting rights. This was largely due to the efforts of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, who sought to combat what he saw as a threat to national security posed by extremist groups and individuals advocating for racial segregation and discrimination. However, the agency's role in civil rights enforcement has been controversial, with criticism of its efforts to infiltrate and disrupt civil rights organizations, and its sometimes-violent tactics against activists.
