The middle ages were disparaged during the period of Enlightenment (17th and 18th centuries) when scholars and philosophers sought to reject the perceived superstition, backwardness, and ignorance of the medieval era and embrace the values of reason, science, and progress. This view was reinforced during the Romantic period (late 18th to mid-19th centuries) when artists and writers celebrated nature and individualism as a reaction against the industrialization and urbanization of modern society, further rejecting the perceived constraints and hierarchies of medieval life.
