The size of the Roman army increased significantly in the 3rd century. Before this period, the Roman army consisted of around 250,000 soldiers. However, during the 3rd century, the Roman army grew to over 400,000 soldiers at its peak, due to the need for more troops to defend the vast Roman Empire and its borders. This increase was primarily due to the expansion and increased threats on the western and eastern fronts.
