There are several possible causes of doubling of chromosome pairs, including:1. Cell division errors: During cell division, sometimes the chromosomes fail to separate properly, resulting in one cell ending up with double the number of chromosomes.2. Polyploidy: In some organisms, such as plants, having more than two sets of chromosomes (polyploidy) is a natural occurrence.3. Radiation exposure: Radiation exposure can cause mutations or errors in cell division, leading to doubling of chromosome pairs.4. Chemical exposure: Exposure to certain chemicals can also cause mutations or errors in cell division, leading to doubling of chromosome pairs.5. Genetic disorders: Some genetic disorders can cause an abnormal number of chromosomes, including doubling of pairs. For example, Down syndrome is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21.
