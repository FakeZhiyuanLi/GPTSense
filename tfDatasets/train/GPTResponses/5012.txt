After the formation of the ice sheets, various types of geologic activities continued to occur, including:1. Volcanic activity: Volcanoes continued to erupt and deposit new layers of volcanic ash and lava on top of the existing layers of ice and sediment.2. Glacier movement: The ice sheets continued to slowly move, carrying rocks and sediment along with them and eroding the underlying bedrock.3. Earthquakes: Tectonic activity still occurred, leading to earthquakes that could trigger volcanic eruptions or landslides.4. Sea level changes: The weight of the ice sheets caused the land underneath to sink, which led to changes in sea level and the formation of new coastlines.5. Weathering and erosion: The harsh climate continued to weather and erode rocks, shaping the landscape over time.Overall, while the formation of the ice sheets was a major geological event, it did not put an end to other types of activity that continued to shape the Earth's surface.
