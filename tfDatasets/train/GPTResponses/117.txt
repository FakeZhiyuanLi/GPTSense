The Scottish Parliament has the role of holding the Scottish Government to account. Specifically, this is carried out by the opposition parties in the Parliament, who scrutinize the government's policies and actions, ask ministers questions, and debate issues in committees and the chamber. Additionally, the Scottish Parliament has committees that specifically focus on holding the government to account, such as the Public Audit Committee and the Finance and Constitution Committee.
