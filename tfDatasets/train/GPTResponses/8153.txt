English mystics placed a great importance on the direct experience of God or the Divine. They believed in the possibility of an immediate and intimate union with God through contemplative prayer, meditation, and ascetic practices. They believed that this union was the highest goal of human life and could bring about a transformation of the soul, leading to a deeper understanding of the nature of God and the universe. English mystics also stressed the importance of humility, detachment from worldly distractions, and self-examination as essential aspects of the spiritual path.
