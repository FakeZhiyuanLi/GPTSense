is commonly referred to as Western classical music. This genre spans from medieval chants to contemporary orchestral works and includes pieces composed for various ensembles and instrumental combinations. The use of a printed score allows performers to read and interpret the composer's intention for each individual instrument, enabling them to merge their individual parts into a cohesive whole to form a complete and unified composition. The tradition of the printed score has been essential in the preservation and dissemination of Western classical music for generations, allowing musicians to perform works that may have been composed centuries earlier with accuracy and precision.
