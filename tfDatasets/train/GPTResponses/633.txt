People with dogs tend to exercise more, spend more time outdoors, and have stronger social connections than those who have cats or no pets. They also tend to have lower levels of stress and anxiety, and higher levels of happiness and well-being. In general, owning a dog can lead to a more active, fulfilling lifestyle.
