There is no evidence to suggest that a specific Egyptian god was worshiped in Athens. While there were cultural exchanges and influence between ancient Greece and Egypt, the Greek pantheon of gods and goddesses differed significantly from that of ancient Egypt. However, in later periods of Greek history, after the conquests of Alexander the Great, some aspects of Egyptian religion were incorporated into Greco-Egyptian cults in Alexandria and other cities.
