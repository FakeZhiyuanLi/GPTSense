Under the principle of jus cogens or peremptory norms of international law, acts or lack thereof that violate widely recognized international laws cannot be legalized or approved under any domestic law or legal system. Even if approved or authorized by national law or government officials, such acts remain illegal under international law and can be subject to international legal remedies, including prosecution and sanctions. Jus cogens principles include prohibitions against genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, slavery, torture, and racial discrimination, among others.
