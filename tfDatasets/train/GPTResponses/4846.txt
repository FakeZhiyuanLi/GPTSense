The short-term goal of open market operations is to influence the money supply by buying and selling government securities in the open market. This is done in order to manage short-term interest rates and stabilize financial markets. Through these operations, central banks can increase or decrease the amount of money in circulation, affecting the cost of borrowing, and ultimately affecting the overall level of economic activity.
