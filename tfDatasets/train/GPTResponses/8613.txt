There is no one person or group that is credited with founding Cork. The city's origins are believed to date back to the 6th century, when St. Finbarr founded a monastery at the site of what is now the city center. Over time, Cork grew into a major commercial and cultural center, with a rich history shaped by various kingdoms, invasions, and social and political movements.
