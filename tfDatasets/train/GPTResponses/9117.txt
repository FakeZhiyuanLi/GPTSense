Quantum mechanics was developed in the early 20th century by physicists such as Max Planck, Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, Erwin Schrodinger, and others. Much of the early development of quantum mechanics occurred in Germany, with key contributions also coming from the United States, Denmark, Austria, and other countries.
