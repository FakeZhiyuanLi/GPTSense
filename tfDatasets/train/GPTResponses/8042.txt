The Cold War officially ended in 1991 when the Soviet Union dissolved. This was a result of political and economic reforms in the Soviet Union under the leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev, as well as a variety of external pressures including economic sanctions, military buildup, and political pressure from the West. The end of the Cold War marked a significant shift in global power structures and led to a period of rapid change in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and other regions around the world.
