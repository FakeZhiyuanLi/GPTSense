Sucrose is produced in the leaves of a plant during the process of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplasts of leaves where carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air and water (H2O) from the soil are converted into glucose (a simple sugar). The glucose is then converted into sucrose for transport to other parts of the plant through the phloem.
