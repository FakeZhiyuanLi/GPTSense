The radical transformation of the object/subject matter of the obligations between the parties is a necessary condition for a claim of a fundamental change in circumstances to terminate a treaty. This means that there has been a significant and unforeseen change in the circumstances surrounding the treaty that make it impossible or impracticable for the parties to continue fulfilling their obligations as agreed upon in the treaty, and that this change was not anticipated or taken into account by the parties when the treaty was made.
