Theorists believe that cognitive activity required for emotion includes the interpretation and appraisal of incoming sensory information, identification and categorization of the emotion being experienced, generation and evaluation of possible responses to the emotion, and regulation of the intensity and expression of the emotion. In other words, the cognitive activity involved in emotion includes perception, attention, memory, reasoning, decision-making, and self-regulation.
