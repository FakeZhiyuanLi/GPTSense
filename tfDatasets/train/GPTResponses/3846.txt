The Monarch Butterfly (Danaus plexippus) has symbolic significance to Mexicans. It is considered a cultural and natural heritage symbol that represents the return of the souls of deceased loved ones during the annual Day of the Dead celebrations. The butterflies migrate to Mexico each year from Canada and the United States, arriving in November when Mexicans honor their ancestors.
