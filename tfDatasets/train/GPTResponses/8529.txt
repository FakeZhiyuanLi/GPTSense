UTF-8 is a character encoding protocol that is used to represent text in computers. It is distinguished from other protocols by the following characteristics:1. Variable length encoding: UTF-8 uses a variable-length encoding method, which means that each character can be represented by one to four bytes. This allows it to represent a wider range of characters than fixed-length encoding methods, such as ASCII or Latin-1.2. Compatibility with ASCII: UTF-8 is compatible with ASCII, which means that ASCII characters can be represented using a single byte in UTF-8. This ensures that ASCII text can be easily read and written in UTF-8.3. Byte order: UTF-8 is a byte-oriented protocol, which means that the byte order of the protocol is fixed. This is in contrast to protocols such as UTF-16, which can be represented in both big-endian and little-endian byte orders.4. Widely used: UTF-8 is widely used and supported by many operating systems, programming languages, and applications. This makes it a popular choice for encoding text data.All these factors combine to make UTF-8 a distinctive character encoding protocol that can be easily distinguished from other protocols.
