William Miller (1782-1849) was an American preacher and founder of the Millerite movement, also known as Adventists. He preached that the Second Coming of Jesus would occur on October 22, 1844, based on his interpretation of biblical prophecies. This belief became known as the Great Disappointment when the predicted date came and went without any visible sign of Jesus' return. Despite this disappointment, Miller's teachings continued to influence a number of later religious groups, including the Seventh-day Adventist Church.
