The Prunus spinosa tree commonly sheds its leaves in autumn, much sooner than many other deciduous trees. The exact timing of leaf fall can vary depending on climate conditions and geographic location. In colder regions, the leaves may fall earlier in the season, while in warmer regions, they may persist for a bit longer.
