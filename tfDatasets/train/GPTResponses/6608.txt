There is no one specific group that universally condemns mixed-faith marriages. However, various religious organizations may discourage or condemn such marriages within their own faith communities. For example, some conservative Christian denominations may discourage or condemn interfaith marriages because they believe in the importance of shared religious beliefs and values within a marriage. Similarly, some Orthodox Jewish communities may discourage or forbid intermarriage because they believe in the importance of maintaining a Jewish heritage and tradition. However, many other religious and secular groups support and encourage mixed-faith marriages, believing that love and mutual respect can transcend religious differences.
