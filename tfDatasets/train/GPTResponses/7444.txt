Many garment workers endure poor working conditions such as long working hours, low pay, lack of job security, no paid leave or sick leave, verbal and physical abuse, inadequate ventilation, poor lighting, and exposure to hazardous chemicals. They may also work in cramped spaces with insufficient breaks and no access to clean water or toilets. Many workers also face discrimination, harassment, and forced labor. These conditions can lead to physical and mental health problems as well as poverty, with workers struggling to make ends meet despite their taxing labor.
