Classical and Vedic Sanskrit are often viewed as two distinct forms of Sanskrit language. Classical Sanskrit is the language of the ancient Indian texts such as the Ramayana and Mahabharata, while Vedic Sanskrit is the language of the Vedas, which are the oldest sacred texts of Hinduism. Classical Sanskrit is a more refined and polished form of the language, while Vedic Sanskrit is considered to be more archaic and complex. Both forms of Sanskrit are highly revered and studied for their linguistic and philosophical value.
