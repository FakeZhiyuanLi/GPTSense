The focus of De Revolutionibus by Nicolaus Copernicus was his hypothesis that the Sun, not the Earth, was the center of the universe and that the Earth and other planets revolved around it. This heliocentric theory challenged the prevailing geocentric theory of the universe and revolutionized astronomy and physics. Copernicus' work laid the foundation for scientific inquiry and the modern scientific worldview.
