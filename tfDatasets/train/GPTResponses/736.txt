In Chinese Buddhism, the most popular meditation practice is Chan or Zen meditation, which emphasizes mindfulness, concentration, and self-awareness. It is often practiced through seated meditation and involves focusing on the breath, body sensations, and stillness of the mind, with the ultimate goal of attaining enlightenment or insight into the nature of reality. Another popular form of meditation in Chinese Buddhism is Pure Land meditation, which involves visualization and chanting to invoke the assistance of particular deities and to connect with the Buddha Amitabha's Pure Land.
