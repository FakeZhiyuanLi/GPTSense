The physical symmetry hidden behind special relativity can be expressed by various groups, such as:1. Lorentz group - This is the most well-known group associated with special relativity. It describes the transformations of coordinates between different inertial frames of reference.2. Poincar√© group - This group includes translations, rotations, and boosts, such as those associated with particles traveling at high speeds.3. Conformal group - This group includes transformations that preserve angles, such as scaling and inversion.4. Gauge group - This group describes transformations that do not affect measurable quantities, such as changing the phase of a wave function.All of these groups play an important role in describing the symmetries of physical systems in special relativity.
