The window for the Battle of Britain replaced traditional window glass that was destroyed during the bombings of World War II. The window was made of multiple layers of glass with a plastic interlayer, which helped to reduce the impact of shattering glass and limit the amount of debris and injuries caused by the bombings. It was also known as "blast-proof glass" or "anti-blast glass".
