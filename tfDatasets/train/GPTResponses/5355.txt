If an RPG (rocket-propelled grenade) is fired at a steep angle, anyone within the vicinity of the impact zone could be in danger. This includes individuals on the ground, in buildings or vehicles, or even in nearby aircraft. The blast and fragmentation effects of an RPG can cause significant damage within a wide radius, potentially causing injury or death to anyone within range.
