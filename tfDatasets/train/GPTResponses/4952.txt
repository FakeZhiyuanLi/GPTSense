The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) is the global agreement that gives sovereign national rights over biological resources. It is an international treaty signed by 196 parties, including countries and the European Union, to promote the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. The CBD recognizes the sovereign rights of states over their own biological resources, and encourages them to conserve and sustainably use these resources while also ensuring equitable sharing of benefits arising from their use.
