is known as the Radical Reformation, which emerged in the 16th century as a breakaway movement from the Catholic Church. This movement rejected both the hierarchical structure and the sacramental theology of the Catholic Church, instead emphasizing the primacy of individual faith and the authority of the Bible. One of the key figures in the Radical Reformation was Menno Simons, after whom the Mennonite denomination is named. Another important figure was Conrad Grebel, who is often credited with being the founder of the Anabaptist movement. Baptist origins can be traced back to the Anabaptist movement, which emerged in Switzerland in the early 16th century.
