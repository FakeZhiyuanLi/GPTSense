Heartwood contains natural deposits of compounds called extractives that can change its color. There are different types of extractives that can be present in different tree species, but some common examples include tannins, lignins, and resins. These compounds can create colors ranging from pale yellow, reddish-brown, to dark black. The amount and type of extractives present determine the final color of the heartwood. Over time, the heartwood may also undergo additional chemical changes that further alter its color.
