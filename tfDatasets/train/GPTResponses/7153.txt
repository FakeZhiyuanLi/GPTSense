During the Civil War, New Haven built a series of earthwork fortifications known as the New Haven Defense System. This system included a series of redoubts, batteries, and entrenchments strategically placed around the outskirts of the city. The largest and most well-known fort in this system was Fort Hale, located on the eastern shore of New Haven Harbor.
