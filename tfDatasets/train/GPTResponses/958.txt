The most at risk in these countries are the people's health, livelihoods, and overall well-being. The lack of access to clean water, sanitation facilities, and healthcare services puts people at high risk of water-borne diseases, malnutrition, and other health issues. Additionally, the ongoing conflict and displacement of people has disrupted farming and other livelihoods, exacerbating poverty and food insecurity. The education of children is also at risk as schools are often disrupted or destroyed in conflict situations. Overall, the humanitarian crisis in these countries is complex and multifaceted, with a multitude of interconnected risks and challenges.
