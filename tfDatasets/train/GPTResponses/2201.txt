There are several causes of death for birds during migration, including:1. Weather - severe storms or sudden changes in weather can make it difficult for birds to fly and find food, leading to exhaustion and death.2. Habitat destruction - loss of suitable habitat and food sources along migration routes, due to human activities such as urbanization and deforestation, can also lead to bird mortality.3. Predation - birds are vulnerable to predation by other animals during migration, especially when they are exhausted and weak.4. Collision with man-made structures - birds can collide with buildings, wind turbines, power lines, and other structures during migration, leading to fatal injuries.5. Disease - outbreaks of diseases can affect migration, by weakening or killing birds en route or spreading to new populations.
