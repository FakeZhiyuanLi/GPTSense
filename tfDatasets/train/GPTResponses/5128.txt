The mass of the object is an important aspect that affects both linear and angular movements. The greater the mass, the more force is required to move or rotate it. This is known as inertia, which is the resistance of an object to changes in its motion. Higher mass objects will also experience less acceleration than lower mass objects, given the same amount of force applied. Therefore, mass plays an important role in determining the speed and distance of linear movement and the speed and angular displacement of rotational movement.
