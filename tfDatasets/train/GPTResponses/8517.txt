The group theory concept of "Composition series" describes finite simple groups as the building blocks for all finite groups. A composition series of a finite group G is a chain of subgroups{e} = G0 < G1 < G2 < ... < Gn = Gsuch that each Gi+1 is a maximal normal subgroup of Gi, and Gi/Gi+1 is a simple group (cannot be further decomposed into nontrivial normal subgroups).The Jordan-HÃ¶lder theorem states that any two composition series of G have the same length, and the simple groups appearing in the series are unique up to reordering and isomorphism.Therefore, any finite group can be expressed as a product of simple groups, which are the "building pieces" for all finite groups. This is known as the "theorem of finite groups composition".
