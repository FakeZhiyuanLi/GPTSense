The result of karma is called "karmaphala" or "fruit of action". It implies the consequences or outcomes that arise from one's actions, thoughts, and intentions. The karmaphala can be positive or negative, depending on whether the action was virtuous or sinful, respectively. It is believed that one's present situation in life is a result of the accumulated karmaphala from previous actions, and one's future is determined by the current actions that are being performed.
