The trade of ivory was once centered on Mogadishu in East Africa. Mogadishu was a major hub for ivory trade, as the city was strategically located on the coast of the Indian Ocean and connected to the interior of East Africa by trade routes. Ivory was traded with Arab and Indian merchants who sailed to Mogadishu to exchange goods such as textiles, spices, and other luxury items for ivory. The demand for ivory was fueled by its use in carved art pieces and crafts, and it was considered a symbol of wealth and prestige in many cultures. However, this trade has been largely banned due to the global conservation efforts to protect elephants, which are the main source of ivory.
