The rainbow-like color striations in poultry meat are caused by a condition known as "iridescent feather" or "iridescent plumage." This occurs when light reflects off the microscopic plate-like structures in the feathers, creating a rainbow or iridescent effect. The condition can also occur in the skin, causing the meat to appear rainbow-like. Iridescent feathers and skin are not harmful to eat but are considered aesthetically unappealing by some consumers.
