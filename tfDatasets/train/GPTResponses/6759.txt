There is some similarity between "no contest" and a draw in that both imply that the outcome of the contest was inconclusive, and neither participant won. However, a draw typically occurs when there is no clear winner, but both participants have completed the contest according to the rules, while a no-contest occurs when the contest is not fully completed due to some unforeseen circumstances, such as a technical issue or injury. Additionally, a no-contest may also result in the contest being declared null and void or having to be rescheduled, while a draw typically means that both participants receive some form of acknowledgement or reward for their performance in the contest.
