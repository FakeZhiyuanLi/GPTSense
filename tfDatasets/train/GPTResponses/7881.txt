Prior to the Order in Council method, Royal Assent was granted through the traditional process of the Crown's representative, the Lieutenant Governor, formally consenting to bills passed by the Isle of Man's Parliament, the Tynwald. Once the Lieutenant Governor gave his consent, the bill became an Act of Tynwald and was passed into law. This process is still in use for certain types of legislation, such as the annual budget.
