Sanskrit was originally used as a language of communication in ancient India. It was the primary language used for Hindu and Buddhist religious texts, as well as for philosophical and literary works, scientific dissertations, and legal codes in ancient India. It served as a lingua franca throughout the Indian subcontinent, and was spoken by scholars and elites across various regions of India. It was also widely used in trade and commerce, and was the language of the ruling classes in many ancient Indian kingdoms. Over time, Sanskrit became a language of scholarship and intellectual discourse, and was studied by students across different parts of the world.
