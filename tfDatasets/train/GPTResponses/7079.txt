The input of DC motors is generally switched by a switch or a transistor. In electronic circuits, a transistor is commonly used as a switch to control the flow of current to the motor. The switch is turned on and off by applying a signal to its base (or gate for some transistors), which allows the current to flow through the motor. The frequency and duration of the signal determine the speed and direction of the motor.
