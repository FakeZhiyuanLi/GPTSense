Federalism is a system of government in which power is divided between a central government and smaller regional governments, such as states or provinces. Each level of government has its own set of responsibilities and powers, and there is a clear delineation of authority and jurisdiction. In a federal system, the central government and regional governments are separate but equal, and they work together to provide governance and promote the common good.
