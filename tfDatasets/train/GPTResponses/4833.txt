The most common source of ionization for clouds of gas in the galaxy is the ultraviolet radiation emitted by hot, massive stars. When this radiation hits the gas, it strips electrons from the atoms and ionizes them, creating a plasma of charged particles. This plasma emits light in various wavelengths, including visible light, which makes the cloud glow. Other sources of ionization can include supernovae, cosmic rays, and shock waves from fast-moving gas.
