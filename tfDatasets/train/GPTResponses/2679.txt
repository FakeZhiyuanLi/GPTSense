The sequence of one strand of DNA completely specifies the sequence of its complement because of the specific pairing rules of the four nucleotide bases that make up DNA. Adenine (A) always pairs with thymine (T), and cytosine (C) always pairs with guanine (G). Therefore, if the sequence of one strand is known, the complementary strand can be inferred by pairing A with T and C with G. This results in a precise and complete replication of the genetic information encoded in the original strand. This specific pairing of nucleotide bases is the basis for the fidelity of DNA replication and the inheritance of genetic information.
