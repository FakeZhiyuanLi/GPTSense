Newer computer drives, such as hard disk drives and optical drives, use brushless DC motors (BLDC) instead of stepper motors. BLDC motors offer better efficiency, higher torque, and better speed control compared to stepper motors. They also have a longer lifespan and are less susceptible to wear and tear since they don't require brushes to transfer power. Additionally, BLDC motors allow for smoother operation and less noise compared to stepper motors.
