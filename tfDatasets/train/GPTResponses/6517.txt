There have been several kings in history who have focused more on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. However, one notable example is George VI, who became king of the United Kingdom in 1936 after his brother, Edward VIII, abdicated the throne. George VI was known for his strong sense of duty and his determination to serve his country during a time of war and hardship. He prioritized his royal duties and official engagements over extravagant social events, and was admired for his steadfastness and commitment to public service.
