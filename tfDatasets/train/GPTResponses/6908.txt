An opt-in class action is a legal proceeding where a group of individuals who have been affected by a common issue, such as a defective product, can join together to take legal action against the responsible party. In an opt-in class action, the individuals must actively choose to join the lawsuit by filling out a form or taking some other affirmative step to become part of the class. This is in contrast to opt-out class actions, where affected individuals are automatically included unless they take action to opt out. Opt-in class actions are relatively rare and are typically used for cases involving smaller groups of individuals, such as employees of a particular company or members of a particular organization.
