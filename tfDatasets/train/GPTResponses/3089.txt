The resource that traditionally comprised Somali wealth is livestock, particularly camels, cattle, and goats. Somalia has a pastoral economy, and livestock has been the primary source of income, food, and social status for Somalis for centuries. The Nomads in Somalia have a specific culture based on the care and husbandry of camels, cattle, and goats, which are used for milk, meat, and skins. The social status, wealth, and power in Somali communities are often determined by the size and quality of their livestock herds.
