The Edict of Fontainebleau (also known as the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes) was issued by King Louis XIV of France in 1685. It ordered the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, which had granted religious tolerance to Protestants (also known as Huguenots) in France. The Edict of Fontainebleau effectively prohibited Protestantism in France and forced Huguenots to convert to Catholicism or flee the country. This led to the mass emigration of Huguenots from France, causing a significant loss of skilled workers and intellectuals. The edict remained in effect until it was officially repealed in 1787.
