The portion of the world that is considered most at risk for the rapid spread of avian flu is Southeast Asia, particularly countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, and Cambodia. These countries have large populations of domestic poultry, which increases the likelihood of human exposure to the virus. Additionally, many of these countries have limited resources and infrastructure to effectively respond to an outbreak, which can lead to further spread of the virus.
