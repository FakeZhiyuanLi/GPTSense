Diesel fuel is no longer used as a release agent for transporting asphalt due to several concerns. Firstly, diesel fuel is a non-renewable resource that contributes to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Secondly, diesel fuel is a hazardous material that poses a risk to the environment and human health if spilled during transportation. Thirdly, using diesel fuel as a release agent can result in asphalt mix contamination and reduced quality of the final product. Furthermore, the use of diesel fuel can cause the asphalt to stick to the truck bed, resulting in delays in transportation and increased costs for cleaning and maintenance. Therefore, alternative and more environmentally friendly release agents are used for transporting asphalt today.
