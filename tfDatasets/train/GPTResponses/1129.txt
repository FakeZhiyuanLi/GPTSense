Henry VIII took direct royal control over the English church in 1534, when he passed the Act of Supremacy, declaring himself as the supreme head of the Church of England. This allowed him to dissolve monasteries, confiscate church property, and appoint bishops and clergy. Prior to this, the Church in England had been under the authority of the Pope in Rome.
