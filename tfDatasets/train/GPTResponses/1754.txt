Theoretical linguists began to turn away from traditional phoneme concepts in the mid-20th century, particularly with the emergence of generative phonology as a new approach to phonological analysis. This approach challenged the traditional notion of phonemes as discrete and invariant units of sound, and instead proposed the existence of abstract underlying representations that are subject to various types of phonological rules and constraints. The development of acoustic phonetics and advanced technology also allowed for more detailed analyses of speech sounds, which further revealed the variability and complexity present in phonetic patterns.
