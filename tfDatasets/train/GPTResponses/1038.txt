Richard III was originally buried in Greyfriars Friary in Leicester, England, after his death in the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. However, the friary was later demolished and his remains were lost for centuries. In 2012, archaeologists discovered a skeleton in a parking lot in Leicester that was later confirmed to be Richard III. In 2015, his remains were re-interred in Leicester Cathedral.
