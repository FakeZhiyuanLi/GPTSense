The bulk of Masonic rituals consist of a series of allegories and symbols, which are used to teach moral lessons and impart wisdom to the members. These rituals typically involve the use of certain ceremonial tools and clothing, as well as recitations of specific words and phrases. They are designed to help Masons understand the importance of brotherhood, charity, and self-improvement, as well as the role these principles play in building a better society.
