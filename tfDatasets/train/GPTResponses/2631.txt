The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) was created for the sake of comparing English dialects, as well as phonetic transcription of any language. The IPA is a standardized system of phonetic symbols and notation used to represent the sounds of spoken language. It was developed in the late 19th century by a group of linguists and scholars to provide a consistent and accurate way of transcribing the sounds of any language. The IPA is now widely used in linguistics, speech therapy, and language teaching.
