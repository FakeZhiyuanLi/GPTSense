English Freemasonry spread to France in the early 18th century, around 1725. However, it did not gain widespread acceptance until the 1730s. The first Masonic lodge in France was established in Dunkirk in 1721, but it was not recognized by the Grand Lodge of England until 1728. Freemasonry then spread to other French cities such as Paris, Lyon, Marseille, and Toulouse.
