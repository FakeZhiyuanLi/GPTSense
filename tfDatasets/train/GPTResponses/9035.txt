Asthma can be classified based on the severity of symptoms and how often they occur. Here are some ways asthma can be classified:1. Mild intermittent asthma - Symptoms occur less than twice a week, with no symptoms between flare-ups.2. Mild persistent asthma - Symptoms occur more than twice a week but less than once a day, and may limit activity.3. Moderate persistent asthma - Symptoms occur daily, require daily medication, and may limit daily activities.4. Severe persistent asthma - Symptoms occur throughout the day and require aggressive, ongoing medication.Asthma can also be classified based on triggers, such as exercise-induced asthma or occupational asthma (caused by specific workplace irritants). Additionally, some people have allergic asthma, where symptoms are triggered by exposure to allergens.
