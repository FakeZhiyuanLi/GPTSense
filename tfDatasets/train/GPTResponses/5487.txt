Intellectual property laws and patent protections have been accused of reducing access to medicines in developing countries. These laws have allowed pharmaceutical companies to hold exclusive rights to the production and distribution of certain drugs, making them unaffordable for many people in developing countries who cannot afford to pay the high prices set by these companies. Additionally, trade agreements and policies that prioritize corporate profits over public health have also been criticized for limiting access to affordable medicines.
