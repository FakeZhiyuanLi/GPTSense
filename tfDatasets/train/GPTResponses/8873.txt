Here are some possible reasons why people began leaving Alsace:1. War and political conflicts: Alsace was frequently the site of military conflicts between France and Germany. The Franco-Prussian War in 1870-71 and World War I caused widespread destruction and displacement of people. After World War II, many Alsatians were evacuated or forcibly expelled by the French government because of their perceived collaboration with the Germans during the war.2. Economic hardship: Alsace was an agricultural region for much of its history, but the Industrial Revolution brought changes that affected the way of life for many people. The decline of traditional industries such as textiles, mining, and farming forced some people to seek better opportunities elsewhere.3. Religious persecution: Alsace was a predominantly Catholic region, but it also had a significant Protestant minority. Religious tensions have flared up at various times in history, especially during the Reformation and subsequent conflicts between Catholics and Protestants. Some Alsatians chose to emigrate to escape religious discrimination or persecution.4. Population growth: As the population grew in Alsace in the 19th and early 20th centuries, it became more difficult to sustain a livelihood for everyone. Many families had to split up and send some members abroad to find work or start a new life.5. Cultural assimilation: Alsace has a distinct culture and dialect that sets it apart from other parts of France and Germany. However, during periods of political domination and colonization, Alsatians were forced to adopt the language and customs of their rulers. Some people chose to leave to preserve their cultural identity and heritage.
