High tariffs protected domestic industries and manufacturers by making imported goods more expensive and less competitive in the market. This allowed domestic producers to charge higher prices for their goods, which in turn helped them to earn more profits and invest in further expansion of their businesses. High tariffs were also used to protect national interests by controlling the flow of goods and protecting local jobs.
