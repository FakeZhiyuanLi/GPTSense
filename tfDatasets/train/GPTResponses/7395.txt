is known as the "invisible hand" of the market. This theory, popularized by Adam Smith in his book "The Wealth of Nations," suggests that in a free market economy, self-interest and competition among individuals and businesses will naturally lead to a harmonious balance of social and economic outcomes. This meant that guilds, which had historically served as powerful trade associations with the ability to regulate prices and production, were seen as a hindrance to the efficient functioning of the market. As a result, guilds started to lose their legal and social standing, and by the 19th century, they had largely been replaced by modern trade unions and professional organizations.
