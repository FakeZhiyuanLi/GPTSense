The Christian religion is responsible for building many of the western-style schools in Nigeria. Catholic, Anglican, Methodist, and Presbyterian churches began missionary work in Nigeria in the mid-19th century, and they were instrumental in establishing schools throughout the country. These schools contributed significantly to education in Nigeria, particularly in the areas of literacy and numeracy.
