During World War II, the British feared that the use of radio signals and transmissions could provide guidance to the German air force. The Germans were known for their advanced radio technology and the British believed that the Germans could intercept their radio transmissions and use the information to track and target their planes. To counter this, the British developed new methods of radio communication, such as changing frequencies and using coded messages, to keep their communications secret and prevent the Germans from obtaining valuable information.
