If current building trends continue, it is possible that particle and fiber board may replace traditional wood materials in certain applications such as furniture, cabinets, and interior finishes. This is due to the cost-effectiveness and sustainability of these engineered wood products. However, it is unlikely that they will replace all traditional wood materials in the construction industry as there will still be a demand for high-quality and durable solid wood products in structural and exterior applications.
