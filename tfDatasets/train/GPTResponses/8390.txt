Insulin resistance refers to a condition where the body's cells become less responsive to the hormone insulin. As a result, glucose cannot enter the cells efficiently, leading to high blood sugar levels. This can ultimately result in Type 2 diabetes if left untreated.Leptin resistance occurs when the brain becomes less responsive to the hormone leptin, which plays a role in energy balance and appetite regulation. This can lead to overeating and obesity.Both insulin resistance and leptin resistance can have a negative impact on the function of these hormones, leading to abnormal glucose and energy metabolism. It can also lead to a host of related health problems, such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic syndrome.
