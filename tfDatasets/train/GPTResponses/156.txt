Question periods in the debating chamber are typically set aside for a specific period of time during a legislative session for Members of Parliament or Members of Congress to ask questions of government officials or cabinet ministers. This time is designated to allow elected representatives to hold the government accountable for its actions and policies. The length of time for question periods can vary depending on the rules of each parliament or congress. For example, in Canadian parliament, question periods are held every weekday for a total of 90 minutes.
