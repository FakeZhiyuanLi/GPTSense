One of the defining ideological movements of the twentieth century was communism, which sought to establish a classless society where the means of production were owned and controlled by the workers. Communism emerged as a political and economic system in the early 1900s, and shaped the political landscape of many countries throughout the century, including the Soviet Union, China, Cuba, and Vietnam. Despite its promise of equality and social justice, communism led to authoritarian regimes and widespread human rights abuses in many of these countries, and its influence on global politics has declined in recent decades.
