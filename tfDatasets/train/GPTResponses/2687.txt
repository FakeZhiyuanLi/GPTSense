Jan Hus was burned at the stake for heresy on July 6, 1415, following his trial at the Council of Constance. He refused to renounce his beliefs and teachings, which were deemed heretical by the Catholic Church. His death became a symbol of resistance and reform against the corrupt practices of the Catholic Church in Europe.
