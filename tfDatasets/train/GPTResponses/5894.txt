One major hurdle when studying different cultures is the potential for cultural bias and ethnocentrism, where one's own cultural perspective may lead to judgments or misunderstandings of other cultural practices and beliefs. Additionally, cultural differences in language, values, and social norms may require a significant amount of cross-cultural communication and interpretation to accurately understand and appreciate. Finally, gaining access to certain cultural groups, particularly those that may be marginalized or remote, can also be a challenge for researchers.
