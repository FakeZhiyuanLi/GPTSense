The three parts that make up the CPU are:1. Control Unit (CU): The control unit manages the flow of data between the memory and the processing unit. It also interprets instructions and directs the execution of operations.2. Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU): The ALU is responsible for performing mathematical operations and logical comparisons such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and Boolean operations.3. Registers: Registers are small, high-speed memory storage locations within the CPU used to temporarily store data during processing. There are different types of registers for different purposes, such as the program counter, instruction register, and general-purpose registers.
