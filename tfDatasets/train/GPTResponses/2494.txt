The score determines the various parts of a musical composition including the melody, harmony, rhythm, dynamics, tempo, instrumentation, and expression. It outlines the pitch of each note, including the key signature and time signature. The score also includes details about articulations, slurs, and other musical markings that indicate how notes should be played, and how various parts should be coordinated to create a cohesive and musical whole. The score is like a musical blueprint that helps musicians come together to perform a piece of music in a unified manner.
