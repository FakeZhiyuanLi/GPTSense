The French colony that had moved towards political independence during the Revolutionary War was Haiti. In 1791, enslaved Africans and Afro-descendants on the island began a massive revolt against the French colonial authorities. Led by Toussaint Louverture and other revolutionary leaders, the Haitian people eventually succeeded in gaining their independence from France in 1804. The Haitian Revolution had a significant impact on the course of the Revolutionary War, as the French were forced to divert resources and attention to their colony in the Caribbean.
