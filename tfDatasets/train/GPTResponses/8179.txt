Sichuan's natural gas reserves are often used for power generation and heating purposes. The gas is also used as a feedstock for the production of chemicals and fertilizers, as well as for transportation fuel. Some of the natural gas is exported to other provinces in China and other countries. Additionally, investments are being made to utilize the natural gas reserves for the development of the petrochemical industry and to create new industries, such as hydrogen production.
