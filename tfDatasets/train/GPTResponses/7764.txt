Discrimination policies have existed throughout history, but modern discrimination policies began to emerge in the mid-20th century during the Civil Rights Movement in the United States. This included the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibited discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in employment and public accommodations. Other countries also began implementing discrimination policies during this time period as well, such as the UK's Race Relations Act of 1965.
