Some animals, such as rabbits, rodents, and koalas, pass their food through their gut twice because they have a specialized digestive system designed to extract as many nutrients as possible from their diet. These animals are known as hindgut or foregut fermenters, depending on where the fermentation process takes place.In hindgut fermenters, such as rabbits, the fermentation process occurs in the cecum, a blind pouch located at the beginning of the large intestine. The partially digested food (known as cecotropes) passes out of the cecum and is re-ingested, allowing the animal to extract more nutrients before elimination.In foregut fermenters, such as koalas and some species of rodents, food is fermented in a specialized stomach chamber before passing through the rest of the digestive system. The partially digested food (known as fecal pellets) is then excreted, and the animal re-ingests it to further break down the tough cellulose in their diet.Overall, passing food through the gut twice allows these animals to extract as many nutrients as possible from their diet, as well as to recycle certain nutrients that may be limited in their environment.
