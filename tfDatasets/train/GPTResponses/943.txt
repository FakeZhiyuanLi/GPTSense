The term "bugs" was first used in the context of engineering and technology by Thomas Edison in the late 19th century. He used the term to refer to flaws and difficulties that were encountered while developing and testing his electrical inventions. The famous incident of an actual bug being found in a computer's circuitry happened in 1947 when a moth was discovered in the Harvard University's Mark II computer. This incident is often cited as the origin of the term "debugging" and "bugs" in the context of computer programming.
