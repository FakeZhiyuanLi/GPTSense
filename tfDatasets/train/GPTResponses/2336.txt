The origin of bottom nappe structure can be traced back to the work of mathematician Leonhard Euler in the 18th century. Euler was interested in the geometry of surfaces and how they could be described mathematically. He discovered that a surface can be described as a set of curves, known as lines of curvature, that are perpendicular to the direction of the surface normal.The concept of bottom nappe structure specifically refers to a type of surface known as a ruled surface. A ruled surface is generated by moving a straight line through space while keeping it fixed at both ends. When the line is moved in a specific way, it creates a surface with a characteristic pattern of curves called a bottom nappe.The term "nappe" comes from the French word for "sheet" or "tablecloth". The bottom nappe structure is so named because it resembles the folds and creases of a tablecloth draped over a surface. This structure is commonly found in various natural and engineered objects, such as seashells, airplane wings, and sails.
