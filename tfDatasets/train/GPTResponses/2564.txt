If the sapwood layer doesn't increase in volume as the tree grows bigger, it will become narrower and eventually may disappear. This is because the growth of the tree primarily occurs in the cambium layer, which produces new xylem and phloem cells that gradually push the old sapwood layer further inward. As a result, the sapwood layer may cease to function as a conduit of water and nutrients and be replaced by heartwood, which is denser and more durable.
