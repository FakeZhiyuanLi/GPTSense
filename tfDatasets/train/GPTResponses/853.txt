people think of them or seek validation from others. They realize that their worth and value come from within, and they no longer feel the need to live up to society's expectations or conform to its standards. Instead, they focus on living their lives authentically and aligning with their true purpose and values. They also develop a deep sense of compassion and connection with others, recognizing that we are all interconnected and ultimately, one.
