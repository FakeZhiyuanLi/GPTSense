The popular capitalization structure and standard used by many British publishers and U.S. newspapers is called title case or headline style. In this style, the first letter of each word in a title or headline is capitalized except for prepositions and conjunctions with fewer than four letters. For example, "The Rise of Social Media Marketing" is a title that follows title case or headline style.
