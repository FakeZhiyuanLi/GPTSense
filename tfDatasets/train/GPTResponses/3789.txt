Anthropology is the discipline that makes use of ethnography. Ethnography is a core method in cultural anthropology for studying and documenting the beliefs, practices, and customs of different cultures and societies. It involves living with a community or group of people for an extended period, observing and participating in their daily activities, and collecting data through interviews, surveys, and participant observation. Ethnography allows anthropologists to gain a deep understanding of the social and cultural dynamics of a group, and to describe, interpret, and analyze their way of life in a holistic and nuanced manner.
