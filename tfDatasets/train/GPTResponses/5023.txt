There is no specific event that caused people to misname Antarctica. However, there are some theories and historical accounts that suggest that early explorers and navigators mistook Antarctica for a collection of islands instead of a continent. Some explorers also named certain parts of Antarctica after themselves or their sponsors, causing confusion and inconsistency in the naming convention. Additionally, the area was not officially named until the 1800s, and different countries and explorers had their own names for the region, adding to the confusion.
