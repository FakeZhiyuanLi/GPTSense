There were several factors that led to the rediscovery of ancient texts by Byzantine scholars. One of the main factors was the Renaissance in Western Europe, where there was a renewed interest in classical learning and literature. This interest spread to Byzantium, and scholars began to seek out ancient manuscripts and texts in order to study and translate them.Additionally, the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire in 1453 led to a mass exodus of scholars, many of whom carried ancient texts with them into Europe. These texts were then studied and translated by European scholars, leading to a resurgence in interest in classical literature and knowledge.Finally, the Byzantine Empire itself had a long tradition of scholarship and learning, and many ancient texts had been preserved and copied by Byzantine scholars over the centuries. It was this tradition of scholarship and preservation that allowed these ancient texts to be rediscovered by later generations.
