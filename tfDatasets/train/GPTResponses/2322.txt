There is no clear-cut answer to this question because it depends on the country and its system of government. In the United States, for example, the Constitution outlines which powers belong to the central government (federal) and which belong to the states. There are some subjects where both the federal and state governments have the power to make laws, such as taxation, criminal justice, and education. However, in other areas such as immigration and foreign policy, the federal government has exclusive authority. Similarly, in a parliamentary system, the central legislative body would have certain exclusive powers while the state or regional legislatures would have their own areas of authority. Ultimately, the division of legislative powers varies widely depending on the country and its system of governance.
