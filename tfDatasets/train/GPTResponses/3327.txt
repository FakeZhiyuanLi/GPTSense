The provisional government of the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia was assembled by the Yugoslav Partisans, specifically by their leader Josip Broz Tito, in November 1944. The government included representatives from all the major ethnic groups of Yugoslavia, including Serbs, Croats, Muslims, Slovenes, and Macedonians. Some of the key figures in the government included Edvard Kardelj, Milovan Djilas, and Boris Kidric.
