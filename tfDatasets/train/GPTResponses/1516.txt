Semipalmated Sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) breed in the Arctic regions of North America and migrate southwards towards South America during the nonbreeding season. They undertake one of the longest migrations of any bird species, traveling between 5,000 and 14,000 kilometers each way. During migration, they can be found along the coasts and wetlands of North and South America, with some individuals crossing the Atlantic Ocean to reach their wintering grounds.
