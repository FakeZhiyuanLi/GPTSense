Alternative splicing and coding sequences are distributed throughout the pre-mRNA molecule in a non-random manner. Alternative splicing sites are usually located in introns, although some can be located in exons. Exons contain coding sequences (also called protein-coding regions or open reading frames), which are the parts of the mRNA molecule that are translated into protein. Therefore, coding sequences are primarily located in exons, although they can also overlap with introns in some cases. The distribution of alternative splicing and coding sequences is influenced by various factors, including the length and position of introns and exons, the presence of regulatory elements such as enhancers and silencers, and the influence of splicing factors and other post-transcriptional regulatory proteins.
