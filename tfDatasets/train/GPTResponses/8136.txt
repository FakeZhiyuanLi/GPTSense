Having leaves allows plants to absorb nutrients through the medium of air. The leaves contain tiny pores called stomata, which allow for the exchange of gases, including the uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2) for photosynthesis and the release of oxygen (O2). Along with gases, the leaves also absorb water and minerals from the soil through their root system, which are then transported to the rest of the plant through the vascular tissue. The process of photosynthesis enabled by the leaves is vital for the growth and survival of most plants.
