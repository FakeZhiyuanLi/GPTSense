The environmental performance of CFLs is generally better than that of incandescent bulbs. CFLs use significantly less energy than incandescents, which translates to lower greenhouse gas emissions and a reduced impact on the environment. They also last longer, which means fewer bulbs end up in landfills. However, CFLs do contain small amounts of mercury, a toxic substance, and need to be disposed of properly. With the increasing availability and affordability of LED bulbs, experts recommend choosing those over CFLs for even better environmental performance.
