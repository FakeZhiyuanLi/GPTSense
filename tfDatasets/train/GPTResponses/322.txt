The term "Prime Minister" was first mentioned in a government document in the UK in the Treaty of Union, which was signed on July 22, 1706. Specifically, the treaty referred to the Scottish representative who would be appointed to negotiate with the English government as the "Prime Minister" of Scotland. However, the modern role of the Prime Minister as the head of government did not fully develop until the 19th century.
