Generosity or giving is one of the ten meritorious deeds in Buddhism. It involves giving to others with a kind and altruistic heart and can be done through acts of charity, volunteering, or simply offering emotional support to someone in need. Generosity is highly regarded in Buddhism as it leads to positive karma and helps one cultivate compassion and selflessness.
