The hygiene hypothesis posits that a lack of early childhood exposure to infectious agents contributes to higher rates of allergies and autoimmune diseases. Here are some pieces of evidence that support this hypothesis:1. Increase in incidence of allergies: Studies have shown that there has been an increase in the incidence of allergies and related conditions in developed countries, where hygiene and cleanliness are emphasized.2. Reduced exposure to microorganisms: Children born in clean environments with reduced exposure to microorganisms tend to have a higher incidence of allergies compared to those born in less clean environments who have greater exposure to microorganisms.3. Rural vs. urban living: Children growing up in rural areas with more exposure to livestock and dirt tend to have lower rates of allergies and asthma compared to those growing up in urban environments.4. Migration and prevalence of diseases: People who migrate from low-prevalence areas for certain diseases to high-practicing areas, such as from south Asia to the UK, tend to have higher rates of allergic diseases.5. Antibiotic use: Antibiotics can upset the balance of intestinal microbiota which can have negative effects on immune function and increase the risk of allergies and asthma.Overall, the evidence suggests that early childhood exposure to microorganisms plays an important role in shaping the immune system and reducing the incidence of allergies and autoimmune diseases.
