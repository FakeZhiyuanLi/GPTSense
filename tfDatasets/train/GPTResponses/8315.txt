is called reverse discrimination, where individuals who might be more qualified for a particular job or educational opportunity lose out because of their race or gender. This can create resentment and animosity among those who feel they have been unfairly denied opportunities because of their race or gender, and can even lead to a backlash against the entire affirmative action policy. Additionally, affirmative action can lead to tokenism, where employers or schools simply hire or admit a certain number of individuals from underrepresented groups to meet a quota without truly valuing diversity or creating an inclusive environment. Finally, affirmative action can perpetuate stereotypes by assuming that individuals from certain races or genders are automatically disadvantaged or need special treatment to succeed.
