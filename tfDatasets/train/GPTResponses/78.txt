Civilization and Modernization: Western powers claimed that they were bringing progress, modernization, and civilization to the "backward" Eastern countries. They believed that their superior way of life could help uplift the Eastern people.2. White Man's Burden: This was a concept that justified Western imperialism as a moral obligation. The idea was that the Western powers had a duty to spread their knowledge, religion, and culture to the less fortunate Eastern people.3. Economic Interests: The West sought to expand their markets and control resources in the East. They believed that they could benefit economically by extracting raw materials, exploiting labor, and opening new markets.4. Military Power: The West also used their military power to assert control over the Eastern territories. They conquered and colonized many Eastern countries using their military might.5. Racism and Orientalism: Orientalism is a set of beliefs and prejudices that Western people held about Eastern cultures. The West viewed the East as inferior, exotic, and mysterious, and used these stereotypes to justify their control over Eastern territories.
