Jules Ferry believed that the "higher races" had a duty to civilize and educate the "inferior races." This concept came to be known as the "civilizing mission" or "mission civilisatrice." He saw it as a moral obligation to spread European values and culture around the world, particularly in French colonies. This belief in European superiority and its duty to spread its civilization was a foundation of European imperialism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
