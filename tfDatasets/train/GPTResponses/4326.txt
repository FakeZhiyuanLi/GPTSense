The Persian Gulf War was precipitated by Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had long claimed that Kuwait was a province of Iraq, and he cited Kuwaiti overproduction of oil and refusal to forgive Iraq’s debt as reasons for the invasion. The international community immediately condemned the invasion and called for Iraq’s withdrawal from Kuwait. The United States, under President George H.W. Bush, led a coalition of countries to intervene and force Iraq out of Kuwait. The war began on January 17, 1991, and ended 42 days later with Iraq’s surrender.
