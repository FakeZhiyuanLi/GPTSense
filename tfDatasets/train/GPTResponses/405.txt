The securitization markets supported by the shadow banking systems started to close down during the global financial crisis of 2008. The collapse of the subprime mortgage market led to a loss of confidence in securitized products, which caused investors to withdraw their funds and caused the shadow banking system to implode. This led to a credit crunch and the freezing of the global financial system, and it took several years for the markets to recover.
