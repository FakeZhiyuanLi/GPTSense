During different historical periods, the West may have viewed the East in various ways, depending on cultural, economic, and political factors. Here are a few examples:- Colonialism: During the age of imperialism in the 19th and early 20th centuries, European powers saw much of Asia, Africa, and the Middle East as territories that could be exploited and controlled for their resources, labor, and strategic value. The West often depicted the East as exotic, backward, and underdeveloped, justifying their expansionist policies as a "civilizing mission."- Orientalism: In the late 19th century, scholars and artists in Europe developed a fascination with the cultures and aesthetics of the East, especially as represented in India, China, and Japan. This led to the movement of Orientalism, which created a stylized image of the East that emphasized exoticism, sensuality, and mysticism. However, this portrayal was often superficial and ignored the complexities of the cultures it depicted.- Cold War: During the geopolitical standoff between the US-led West and the Soviet- and China-led East after World War II, the East was often seen as a monolithic bloc of communist countries that threatened the Western way of life. The West characterized the East as oppressive, totalitarian, and hostile, while the East saw the West as imperialist, decadent, and exploitative.- Globalization: In the contemporary era of globalization, the West and East are more interconnected than ever before, leading to greater cultural exchange, economic interdependence, and political collaboration. However, there are still areas of tension and difference, and the West may still view the East through the lens of stereotypes or prejudice, such as seeing East Asian countries as technologically advanced but socially conformist, or Middle Eastern countries as backwards and fanatical.
