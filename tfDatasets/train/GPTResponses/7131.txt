Large brushes are favorable for covering large areas quickly and efficiently. They are also effective for creating bold, expressive strokes and blending colors over large surfaces. Large brushes work well for applying washes or layers of paint to create a textured effect or to fill in large spaces with color. They are commonly used in painting and other forms of artistic expression.
