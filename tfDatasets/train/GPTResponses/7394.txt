Plants are able to stop and start dividing cells due to their ability to maintain a delicate balance between growth and development. This balance is controlled by various internal signals, such as hormones and gene expression, as well as external signals, such as light and temperature. When conditions are favorable, plants will continue to divide and grow, but when conditions become unfavorable, such as during drought or cold temperatures, plants will often slow or stop their cell division in order to conserve resources and ensure survival. Additionally, plants may also halt cell division during periods of stress, such as when they are being attacked by pathogens or pests, as a way to divert resources towards defense mechanisms. Overall, plants have evolved complex regulatory systems that allow them to tightly control their growth and development in response to a variety of environmental stimuli.
