One practice that changed a great deal over the classical period was the use of instrumentation in music. During the Baroque era, composers primarily used string instruments such as violins, cellos, and a bass. However, in the classical period, composers began to incorporate woodwind and brass instruments, creating a more diverse range of sounds and textures in their music. Additionally, the use of the piano became more prevalent, and it became a popular solo instrument. This led to the development of the piano concerto as a popular genre. Overall, the classical period saw an expansion in the range of instruments used in music, allowing for a wider range of expression for composers.
