During the Heiji Rebellion, the two main clans involved were the Taira clan and the Minamoto clan. The Taira clan supported Emperor Go-Shirakawa, while the Minamoto clan supported his half-brother, Emperor Nijo. The rebellion was ultimately won by the Taira clan, leading to their dominance over the imperial court for the next several decades.
