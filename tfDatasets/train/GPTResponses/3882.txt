Digestion is the process by which the food we eat is broken down into simpler components that our body can absorb and use for energy, growth, and repair. This process involves various organs in the digestive system, including the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small and large intestines, liver, pancreas, and gallbladder. Digestion begins in the mouth with the mechanical and chemical breakdown of food by enzymes and saliva, and continues in the stomach and intestines with further breakdown and absorption of nutrients. The waste products are then eliminated from the body as feces.
