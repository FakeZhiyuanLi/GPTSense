The BBC did not cease broadcasts during World War II. In fact, the British government used the BBC as its primary means of communication with the public during the war. The BBC broadcasted news, propaganda, entertainment, and other programs to boost morale and keep people informed during the conflict. However, the broadcasting schedule and content were heavily monitored and controlled by the government, particularly during the early part of the war.
