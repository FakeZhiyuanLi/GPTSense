Some of the DJs who brought the Ibiza sound to UK clubs in late 1987 include Paul Oakenfold, Danny Rampling, Nicky Holloway, and Johnny Walker. These DJs were known for frequenting the clubs in Ibiza during the summer season and bringing back their knowledge and music to the UK, which helped to popularize the Balearic sound and the rave culture.
