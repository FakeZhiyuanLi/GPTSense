The principle of maximum effectiveness interprets the language of treaties as having the effect of establishing the maximum obligations between parties, in order to ensure that the treaty is effectively implemented and its objectives are fully achieved. This principle is based on the idea that parties to a treaty intend to create legally binding obligations that are as comprehensive and effective as possible, and that treaty provisions should be interpreted in a way that gives full effect to their purpose and objectives. Thus, if a treaty provision can reasonably be interpreted in different ways, the interpretation that best furthers the treaty's purpose and objectives should be preferred.
