Today, there are several populations that are considered to be descended from the Vlachs, including:1. Romanians: The largest Vlach-descended population is that of Romanians, who live primarily in Romania but also in Moldova, Ukraine, and other neighboring countries.2. Aromanians: A smaller Vlach-descended population is that of the Aromanians, who are also known as Macedo-Romanians, and primarily live in Greece, Albania, and North Macedonia.3. Megleno-Romanians: Another Vlach-descended group are the Megleno-Romanians or Meglen Vlachs, who live in the Golo Brdo region of North Macedonia and Greece.4. Istro-Romanians: The Istro-Romanians are also a Vlach-descended population that live in a region of Istria, Croatia.5. Morlachs: The Morlachs were a Vlach-descended group that existed in the Dalmatian region of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina in the past, but their descendants have assimilated into other populations over time.
