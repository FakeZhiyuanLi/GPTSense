Most western languages use punctuation marks, such as periods, commas, semicolons, colons, and exclamation marks, to add clarity to their written form. They also use capitalization at the beginning of sentences and proper nouns, as well as paragraph breaks to organize their writing into manageable sections. Additionally, some languages use accent marks or diacritical marks to indicate pronunciation or differentiate between similarly spelled words.
