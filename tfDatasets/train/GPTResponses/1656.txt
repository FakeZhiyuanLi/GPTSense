The king's privileges were specified by the laws and traditions of the particular kingdom or monarchy, as well as the specific powers granted to the king by the constitution or governing documents of that country. These privileges could include the right to make decisions about war and peace, to appoint and remove government officials, to issue pardons and leniencies, to levy taxes and collect revenue, and to enact laws and regulations without the approval of a legislative body. In some cases, the king's privileges were also influenced by the religious or cultural traditions of the kingdom, such as the role of the monarch as a religious leader or the use of royal ceremony and protocol.
