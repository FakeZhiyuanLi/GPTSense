Plato used a method of inquiry known as dialectical reasoning to understand political systems. This involved engaging in discussion and debate with others in order to arrive at a deeper understanding of the nature of political systems and their impact on society. He also believed in the importance of studying history and examining the works of previous philosophers and scholars in order to gain insight into the workings of political systems. Additionally, Plato emphasized the importance of individual moral development and the role of education in shaping virtuous citizens capable of participating in and contributing to a just society.
