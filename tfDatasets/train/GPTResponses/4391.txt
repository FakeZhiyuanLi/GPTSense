Girls who are malnourished may start menstruating later or have irregular menstrual cycles, while those with high-fat diets may start menstruating earlier than expected. This is because malnutrition can cause delayed puberty and hormonal imbalances, while a high-fat diet can lead to increased levels of estrogen and earlier onset of puberty. However, it's important to note that each person's body and genetics play a role in the timing of their first period, and there are many other factors that can affect menstrual health beyond just diet.
