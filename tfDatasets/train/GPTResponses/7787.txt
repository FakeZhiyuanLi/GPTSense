The era that utilized Greek theories was the Renaissance (14th-17th century). During this time, Greek texts on philosophy, mathematics, and science were rediscovered and studied by scholars, leading to a revival of interest in ancient Greek thought and a renewed emphasis on humanistic values. Many Renaissance intellectuals saw themselves as building upon the legacy of ancient Greece and sought to revive its intellectual traditions.
