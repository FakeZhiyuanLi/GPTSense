Patent law originated in Italy in the 15th century with the granting of exclusive rights to inventors of machines. The concept of patent law was later adopted by other European countries, including England, where the famous Statute of Monopolies was enacted in 1623. The United States enacted its first patent law in 1790, which granted exclusive rights to inventors for a period of 14 years. Since then, patent laws have been developed and adapted in many countries around the world.
