Old English is similar to modern German in terms of vocabulary and grammar structure. It also has some similarities to other Germanic languages such as Dutch, Swedish, and Danish. However, it is important to note that Old English is a distinct language that is no longer spoken, and modern English has undergone significant changes in vocabulary, spelling, and grammar since its Old English origins.
