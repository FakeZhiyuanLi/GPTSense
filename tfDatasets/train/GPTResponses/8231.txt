Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann first discovered nuclear fission in 1938. Hahn wrote the first paper about their discovery, but it was edited by Lise Meitner, who had fled Nazi Germany and was working in Sweden at the time. Meitner recognized the significance of the discovery and made significant contributions to the interpretation of the experimental results.
