A dialect is a variation of a standard language that is spoken by a regional or cultural group. The standard language is a form of a language that represents a norm or a common way of speaking that has been established by the society for communication purposes.In general, dialects deviate from the standard language in terms of pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. However, while dialects may differ from the standard language, they are not considered inferior or incorrect, but rather an alternative way of speaking.The relationship between a dialect and the standard language is therefore one of variation rather than opposition. Dialects are an important part of the linguistic diversity and cultural heritage of a society, and they often reflect the unique history and social identity of a region or cultural group.
