Many historical linguists consider Modern Greek to be a dialect of the Greek language, specifically the southern Greek dialects. It is derived from the Koine Greek language, which was the common language spoken during the Hellenistic period and the early Byzantine Empire. Modern Greek also shows influence from other languages, including Ottoman Turkish and Venetian Italian, due to the country's history of foreign rule and cultural exchange.
