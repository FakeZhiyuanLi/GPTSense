The Ancient Greeks were the first to lay out city plans on a grid system, but the Romans are credited with popularizing the concept through their widespread use of grid-based military camps and cities. In modern times, numerous cities, including New York City and Chicago in the United States, were designed or redesigned using grid plans. Therefore, it is difficult to attribute the grid plan to a specific person or group.
