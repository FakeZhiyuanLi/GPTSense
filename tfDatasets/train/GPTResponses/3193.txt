The fibers in the latewood of good oak are typically smaller and denser, with thicker cell walls than those in the earlywood. These fibers are primarily made up of cellulose and lignin, which provide strength and rigidity to the wood. Additionally, oak latewood may also contain more tannins, which contribute to its hardness and durability.
