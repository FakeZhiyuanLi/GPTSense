Charles Darwin believed that species and varieties (or subspecies) were different levels of classification within the same continuum of variation. He believed that varieties arise from the same natural processes as species, such as competition and adaptation to local conditions. However, he also believed that species are defined by reproductive isolation, meaning that they cannot interbreed and produce fertile offspring with other species. In contrast, varieties may interbreed and exchange genetic material with other varieties. Overall, Darwin's concept of evolution through natural selection explains both the similarities and differences between species and varieties.
