The larger anti-aircraft guns, also known as heavy AA guns, were an integral part of the Soviet Union's defense system against enemy aircraft during World War II. However, the introduction of more advanced and sophisticated technology, such as surface-to-air missiles and radar systems, eventually led to the disappearance of these guns from the Soviet arsenal. The need for faster and more mobile defense systems against aerial threats rendered the heavy AA guns obsolete and impractical. As a result, the Soviet Union gradually phased out these guns and shifted towards more advanced defense technologies.
