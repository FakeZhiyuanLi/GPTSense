The Imperial Institute was designed by T. E. Collcutt and was completed in 1893. However, it was not a victim of imperial expansion in the 1950s and 1960s. The building was repurposed and eventually demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to make way for new developments, including the Queen's Tower and the Imperial College London's new library.
