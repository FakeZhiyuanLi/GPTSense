As technology advances, another higher bit rate that is beginning to spread is 5G internet. 5G technology offers much faster internet speeds and lower latency, which is important for applications like virtual reality, autonomous vehicles, and smart cities. It provides download speeds up to 20 times faster than 4G LTE, allowing for faster downloads, high-quality video streaming, and efficient data transfer. 5G technology is already being implemented in many areas around the world, and it is expected to become more widespread in the years to come.
