There are a few other nutrients that may be lacking in traditional Chinese diets compared to diets in the Western world:1. Calcium: Dairy products are not a significant part of traditional Chinese diets, and as a result, intakes of calcium may be lower.2. Vitamin D: Sun exposure is limited in many parts of China, which can make it challenging to get enough Vitamin D from sunlight. Plus, food sources of Vitamin D (like fortified milk and oily fish) are typically not consumed in high amounts.3. Fiber: Traditional Chinese diets are rich in rice and noodles, but may not include as many whole grains, fruits, and vegetables as Western diets. Consequently, individuals may have lower intakes of dietary fiber.4. Omega-3 Fatty Acids: Fish consumption in China is generally lower than in Western countries, which may result in lower intakes of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids.5. Iron: While iron is found in many foods in Chinese diets, the absorption rate of iron is lower due to the presence of phytates in plant-based foods, a substance that can limit iron absorption. Iron from meat sources is typically absorbed more efficiently into the body.
