Humans have used domesticated poultry for thousands of years, with evidence of domesticated chickens found in China dating back to 10,000 BC. In ancient civilizations, such as ancient Egypt and Greece, chickens were considered sacred and used for religious ceremonies. Domesticated turkeys were first used by indigenous peoples in present-day Mexico around 800 BC. Ducks and geese were also domesticated in ancient times for their meat and eggs. Overall, poultry domestication has been a crucial aspect of human agriculture and food production for many centuries.
