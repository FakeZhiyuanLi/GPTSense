Videoconferencing can help a person by allowing them to communicate with others in a remote location without physically having to travel. This can save time, money, and resources while still enabling effective communication and collaboration. Additionally, it can improve work-life balance by reducing the need for time-consuming travel. Videoconferencing can also be beneficial for individuals who have limited mobility or live in isolated areas, as it provides access to real-time communication with others.
