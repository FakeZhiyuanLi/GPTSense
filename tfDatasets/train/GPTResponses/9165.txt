The Constitution originally provided for the structure and powers of the federal government of the United States, including the separation of powers between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, the establishment of a system of checks and balances, and the protection of individual rights through the Bill of Rights. Additionally, it established federalism and the supremacy of federal law over state law, and provided a mechanism for amending the Constitution as needed.
