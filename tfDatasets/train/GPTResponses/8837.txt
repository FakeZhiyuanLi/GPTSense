When Frankish rulers established the system of feudalism, a hierarchical social system was created where power and influence were concentrated in the hands of a group of lords and nobles. These lords were the wealthiest and most powerful individuals in society and held vast amounts of land and resources.In return for their lands and resources, the lords would grant these to their vassals, who were usually knights or warriors. The vassals were required to show loyalty and provide military service to their lords in exchange for protection and resources.Under this system, the power of the king gradually diminished as lords became more powerful and controlled their own territories. This led to a decentralization of power and the emergence of many small, independent states throughout Europe.Feudalism also had significant cultural and economic impacts. Social mobility was restricted, as individuals were born into their social class and had limited opportunities for advancement. Furthermore, the agricultural nature of feudalism led to the development of a rural, agrarian economy that was largely self-sufficient and isolated from the outside world.
