Teeth are primarily used for biting, tearing, grinding, and chewing food in order to break it down into smaller pieces that can be more easily digested. They also play a role in speech, allowing us to articulate certain sounds by controlling the flow of air through our mouths. Additionally, teeth help support the structure of the face and contribute to overall facial aesthetics.
