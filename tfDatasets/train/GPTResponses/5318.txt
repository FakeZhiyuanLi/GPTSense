Surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) were first developed in Germany during World War II. The first operational SAM system was the German Wasserfall missile, which was designed to intercept Allied bombers. However, it was not very successful and was only deployed a handful of times. After the war, the Soviet Union and United States developed their own SAM systems, which became a crucial part of their respective air defense strategies during the Cold War.
