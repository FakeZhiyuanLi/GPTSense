If a treaty is in violation of a peremptory norm (also known as a jus cogens norm), it will be considered void and unenforceable under international law. Peremptory norms are fundamental principles of international law that are considered non-negotiable and universally accepted, such as the prohibition of genocide, slavery, and torture. Any treaty that contradicts these norms will not be recognized as legally binding and may be challenged by states or other actors in the international community.
