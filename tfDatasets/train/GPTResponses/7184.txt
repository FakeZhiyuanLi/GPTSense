Using AC power on a DC motor will cause the motor to rotate in one direction and then abruptly stop. This is because an AC waveform changes direction 50 or 60 times per second (depending on the power source), causing the motor to rapidly change direction and causing it to stall. Additionally, AC power can damage the motor's internal components due to the high frequency and voltage spikes in the waveform. Therefore, a DC power source or a rectifier is necessary to provide the correct power source for a DC motor.
