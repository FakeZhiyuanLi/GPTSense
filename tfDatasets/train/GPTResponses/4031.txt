Duel dating typically involves using both the Julian calendar and the Gregorian calendar to show the date. This is often done in historical documents or records to indicate the difference between the old Julian calendar (which was replaced by the Gregorian calendar in the 16th century) and the new calendar system. For example, a date might be written as "January 13, 1641/42" to show that it falls in the period when both calendars were in use and could be interpreted as either 1641 or 1642 depending on which calendar was being used.
