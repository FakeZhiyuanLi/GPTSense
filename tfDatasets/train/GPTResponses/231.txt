The book "Credit Models and the Crisis: A Journey into CDOs, Copulas, Correlations, and Dynamic Models" by Damiano Brigo, Andrea Pallavicini, and Roberto Torresetti was published in 2010. However, it is important to note that these authors were active in warning about risks associated with CDOs and other financial instruments well before the 2008 financial crisis.
