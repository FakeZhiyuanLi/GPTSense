Shias believe that the divine position of Imamah is mentioned in several Quranic verses, including:- Verse of Wilayah (5:55): "Only Allah is your Vali and His Messenger and those who believe, those who keep up prayers and pay the poor-rate while they bow."- Verse of Mubahilah (3:61): "And whoever disputes with you concerning him after the knowledge that has come to you, say, 'Come, let us call our sons and your sons, our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves, then make prayer supplication (together) and lay the curse of Allah upon the liars.'"- Verse of Purification (33:33): "Verily, Allah desires to keep away all impurity from you, O people of the household (Ahlulbayt), and purify you with a thorough purification."Shias interpret these verses as indicating that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him and his family) was commanded by Allah to appoint specific individuals as his successors and leaders of the Muslim community, and that this divine appointment continued after his death in the form of the Imams who are designated by Allah.
