Ahmad Maher?No, the assassination of Hassan al-Banna was not a retaliation for the prior assassination of Ahmad Maher. The two events occurred in different contexts and were not related. Ahmad Maher was assassinated in 1945 by members of the Muslim Brotherhood as part of their struggle against the British occupation of Egypt. In contrast, Hassan al-Banna was assassinated in 1949 by unknown assailants, possibly as part of a power struggle within the Muslim Brotherhood or a reaction to their growing influence in Egyptian society.
