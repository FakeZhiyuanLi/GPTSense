The primary incentive for asset managers to expand their assets under management is to increase their revenue and profits. As asset managers earn fees based on a percentage of the assets under their management, growing their assets under management can significantly increase their income. Additionally, expanding their assets under management can enhance their reputation within the industry, increasing the likelihood of attracting new clients and retaining existing ones. Finally, asset managers may also seek to expand their assets under management to achieve economies of scale, which can lead to cost efficiencies and lower operating expenses.
