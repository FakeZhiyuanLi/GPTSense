The Sanskrit word karma is derived from the root kri, which means "to do" or "to act". Karma literally means "action" or "deed". In Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism, karma refers to a person's actions and the consequences of those actions. It is believed that a person's present life and future experiences are determined by their past deeds. Therefore, by doing good deeds or accumulating good karma, one can improve their chances of a better life in the future.
