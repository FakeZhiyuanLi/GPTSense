A typical pommel horse exercise consists of various swings, circles, and flairs around and between the two pommels. The exercises are done with constant momentum and fluidity, requiring the gymnast to maintain their balance while transitioning between different postures. The routine usually includes a combination of different elements, such as scissor movements, Russian Circles, and traveling sequences in a forward or backward direction. The routine ends with a dismount, which can be a simple hop off or a more complex skill such as a handstand somersault.
