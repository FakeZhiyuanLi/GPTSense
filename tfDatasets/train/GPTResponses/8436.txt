There are several methods used for error correction of transferred data, including:1. Parity Checking: In this method, an extra bit is added to each block of data, which is used to detect errors.2. Checksums: A checksum is a numerical value calculated by taking the sum of all the bytes of data in a message. The checksum is transmitted along with the data, and the receiver can calculate the checksum to check if the transmitted data is correct.3. Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC): This method involves generating a checksum code based on the contents of the data block. This code is sent along with the data, and the receiver can use the same algorithm to generate its own checksum and compare it with the one received.4. Hamming Codes: Hamming codes are a type of error-correcting code that can detect and correct single-bit errors in transmitted data. They do this by adding extra bits to the data that are used to check for errors and correct them if necessary.
