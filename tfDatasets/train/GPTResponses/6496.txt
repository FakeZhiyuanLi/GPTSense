The French attempt to create co-masonic lodges dates back to the early 20th century, with the creation of Le Droit Humain, or the International Order of Co-Freemasonry. This organization was founded in Paris in 1893 by Dr. Georges Martin and Marie Deraismes, and it aimed to offer initiation and Masonic training to men and women on an equal basis.
