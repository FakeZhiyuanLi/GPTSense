Herbivores rely on a process called fermentation to break down cellulose in order to obtain essential nutrients. This process occurs in a specialized chamber in the digestive system called the rumen, which is found in ruminants such as cows, sheep, and deer. The rumen contains billions of microorganisms such as bacteria, protozoa, and fungi, which break down the cellulose into simpler compounds like glucose, which can then be absorbed by the herbivore's body. This process allows herbivores to extract essential nutrients like carbohydrates, proteins, and fats from otherwise indigestible plant material.
