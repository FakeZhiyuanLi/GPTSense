The United States Constitution exemplified modern federalist government as it established a strong federal government that shares powers with the state governments. This document created a system of checks and balances between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government, and laid out specific rights and protections for citizens. The Constitution was ratified in 1788 and has remained the foundation of the U.S. government ever since.
