Evolutionary phonology is an integrated approach to language that seeks to better understand the evolution of the sound systems of languages across time and space. This interdisciplinary field combines theories and methods from traditional linguistics, evolutionary biology, anthropology, psychology, and neuroscience to explore the role of selection and other evolutionary processes in shaping the phonological systems of languages over generations. By studying the genetic and cultural processes that have led to the development of different sound systems in different languages, evolutionary phonology aims to provide insights into the mechanisms of language evolution and the complex interplay between biology, culture, and behavior in shaping human communication.
