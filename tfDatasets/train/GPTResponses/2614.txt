Government funds and resources are diverted into capital projects by corrupt public officials, resulting in economic distortions. These capital projects may not be necessary or may be implemented poorly, leading to waste and inefficiency. Additionally, funds that would have gone towards social services, education, and healthcare may be stolen or misused, resulting in the further marginalization of already vulnerable groups. The lack of public services and infrastructure can also discourage investment and hinder economic growth. Ultimately, corruption in the public sector can lead to a breakdown of trust in government and a loss of confidence in the economy.
