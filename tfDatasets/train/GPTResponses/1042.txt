The earliest device to help count was the abacus, which dates back to ancient times, around 500 BCE. It was used for basic arithmetic calculations and was made up of a wooden frame with wires or rods that held small wooden or ceramic beads. The position of the beads on the wires represented different numerical values, and users would move them around to perform calculations. The abacus is still used today in some parts of the world as a tool for teaching and learning arithmetic.
