Roland Faber and Catherine Keller combine Whitehead's theories of process philosophy and panentheism with postmodern and poststructuralist theories such as deconstructionism, feminist theory, and critical theory. They also incorporate ecological and environmental concerns into their understanding of Whitehead's ideas. Additionally, they draw on the work of other philosophers, such as Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, to expand upon and enrich Whitehead's philosophy.
