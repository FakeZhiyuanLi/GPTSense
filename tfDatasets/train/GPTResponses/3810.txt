Some animals that still use the external digestion system include:1. Spiders - they inject digestive enzymes into their prey and then suck the liquefied food out of the prey.2. Scorpions - they use their pincers to crush their prey and then release digestive enzymes onto it, waiting for the liquefied food to be absorbed.3. Certain species of octopuses - they use their beak to bite their prey and then release digestive enzymes to break down the prey's tissues.4. Sea anemones - they catch their prey with their tentacles and release digestive enzymes onto the prey, absorbing the liquefied food.5. Certain species of cnidarians, such as jellyfish and hydras - they capture their prey with their tentacles and release digestive enzymes to break down the prey's tissues.
