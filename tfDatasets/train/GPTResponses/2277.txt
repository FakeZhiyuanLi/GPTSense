In Islamic tradition, the successor or leader of the Muslim community after the demise of a prophet is typically determined by the consensus of the people or the ruling council of leaders (known as the shura). In some cases, a designated successor may be named by the prophet before their passing. The specific process for selecting a successor may vary depending on the specific circumstances and cultural traditions of each Muslim community.
