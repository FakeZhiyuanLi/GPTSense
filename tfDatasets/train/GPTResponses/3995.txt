A counterpart document to the national strategy and action plan for critical infrastructure would be the sector-specific plans for critical infrastructure. These plans provide detailed guidance and recommendations for securing and protecting specific critical infrastructure sectors, such as transportation, energy, and water systems. They outline specific threats and vulnerabilities and detail strategies for risk management, incident response, and resilience. Sector-specific plans are developed in collaboration with government agencies, industry stakeholders, and other key partners to ensure a coordinated approach to protecting critical infrastructure.
