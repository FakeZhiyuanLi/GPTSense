Advancements in science and technology, particularly in fields such as physics, engineering and materials science, have enabled the development of instruments with increasingly precise measurements and capabilities. This has allowed for more accurate and detailed descriptions and specifications of instruments, as their functionality and performance can now be clearly defined and quantified. Additionally, the growth of standardized measurement and testing protocols has further facilitated the ability to describe and compare instruments across different applications and industries.
