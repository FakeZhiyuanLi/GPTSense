Gorbachev's opponents were generally hardliners who believed in the preservation of the Soviet system, including its centralized planning and authoritarian rule. They opposed Gorbachev's policies of glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring) which aimed to introduce market-oriented economic reforms, political pluralism and greater freedom of expression. They feared that these reforms would lead to the disintegration of the Soviet Union and undermine the Communist Party's authority. Some of these opponents were members of the old guard within the Soviet leadership, military officials, and conservative intellectuals who believed in the superiority of the Soviet system over Western democracy.
