Phylogenetics uses genetic data, such as DNA sequences, to determine plant categories. By comparing the genetic differences and similarities among different plant species, phylogenetic relationships can be inferred, and plants can be organized into categories based on their evolutionary history. This approach has led to the development of the current system of plant classification, which is based on the evolutionary relationships among plants rather than on their physical characteristics.
