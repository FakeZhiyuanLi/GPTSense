Re-formulations of active ingredients refer to the process of modifying or changing the chemical composition or structure of the active ingredient in a medication or product. This may involve altering the formulation of the active ingredient to improve efficacy, safety, or stability, or to reduce side effects or toxicity. Re-formulations may also be necessary to adapt to changes in regulations or manufacturing processes, or to address issues with drug shortages. Overall, re-formulations are an important part of pharmaceutical research and development, as they enable the development of safer, more effective products that meet the needs of patients and consumers.
