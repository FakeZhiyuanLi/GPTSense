Parallel capacitors act as filters by smoothing out the fluctuating current in order to deliver clean power for control circuits. They store electrical energy when the power supply is providing excess current, and release it when the demand for current increases. This helps to reduce the ripple and noise in the electrical system, allowing control circuits to operate more reliably and accurately. The capacitors also help to stabilize the voltage across the circuit by providing a low impedance path for the high-frequency current. This results in a more stable and consistent power supply, which is essential for sensitive electronic components.
