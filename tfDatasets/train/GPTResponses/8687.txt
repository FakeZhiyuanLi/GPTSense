In the introduction to "On the Origin of Species," Darwin viewed vestiges as evidence of evolution. He noted that some structures in animals and plants, such as wings of flightless birds or the rudimentary hind limbs of whales, had no apparent function in their current form but resembled structures found in other, related species. He believed that these vestigial structures were remnants of adaptations that were useful to the ancestors of those species, but were no longer necessary in the current environment. By studying vestigial structures, Darwin argued that one could trace the evolutionary history of a species and its relationship to other species. Overall, Darwin viewed vestiges as important clues that helped support his theory of evolution by natural selection.
