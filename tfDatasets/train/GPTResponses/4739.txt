Maintain financial stability - The central bank would need to continue monitoring and regulating the financial system to prevent any systemic risks from arising.2. Currency management - The central bank would need to manage the national currency, including ensuring its stability and availability.3. Conduct monetary policy - Even with zero inflation, the central bank may still need to adjust its monetary policy to ensure economic stability and growth.4. Support the government - The central bank may still be called upon to provide financial support to the government during times of crisis or economic downturn.5. Manage the payment system - The central bank would need to oversee and regulate payment systems to ensure smooth and efficient transactions.
