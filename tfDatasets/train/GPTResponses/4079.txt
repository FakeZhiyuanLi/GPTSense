?Some cultures attempt to regulate the expression of sadness or fear in boys. This has traditionally been done with the belief that boys should be tough and strong, and showing vulnerability is seen as a weakness. As a result, boys may be encouraged to hide their emotions or repress them in order to fit into these cultural expectations. However, this can have negative impacts on their mental health and ability to form relationships in the future. It is important for cultures to promote healthy emotional expression among boys and encourage them to seek support when needed.
