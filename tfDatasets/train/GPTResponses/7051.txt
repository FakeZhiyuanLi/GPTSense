1. Scalability: As peer-to-peer systems rely on distributed network architectures, their configurations require more complexity to achieve scalability. Configurations need to accommodate growing numbers of peers while also ensuring that the system remains efficient and responsive.2. Data Management: P2P systems often involve the sharing of large amounts of data. This data needs to be efficiently managed across the network, and different data types may require different configurations to ensure their smooth sharing.3. Security: As P2P systems are decentralized, their security needs differ from those of centralized systems. They require more complicated network configurations to ensure that they remain secure from malicious activities and attacks.4. Routing: Routing of data in P2P systems is a complex task that requires sophisticated algorithms to ensure efficient and reliable delivery. Configurations need to ensure that the routing algorithms are well-tuned and able to handle different types of network conditions.5. Availability: P2P systems often operate across multiple devices and networks, and their configurations need to ensure that they remain available across all these different environments. This requires careful planning of network components and protocols to achieve robustness and redundancy.6. Performance: P2P systems can suffer from performance issues due to the lack of centralized control. As such, system configurations need to optimize network bandwidth and ensure low latency and high-speed data transfer.
