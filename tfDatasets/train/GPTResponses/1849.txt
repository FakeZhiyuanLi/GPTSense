The decrease in the volume of water transported from the roots to the upper parts of the tree due to gravity is the factor that leads to thinner sapwood higher up a tree. As water travels upwards, it faces more and more resistance due to gravity, and this results in a decrease in the volume of water transported to the upper parts of the tree. As a result, the sapwood in the upper parts of the tree becomes thinner to accommodate the reduced water flow.
