The Group of Eight, also known as G8, was an international forum comprising the world's leading developed economies. The group included Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The group was established in 1975 to discuss issues related to global economies, security, and political matters. However, Russia was expelled from the group in 2014 due to the annexation of Crimea, and the group now operates as the G7.
