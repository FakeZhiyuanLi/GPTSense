Sir Robert Peel, the Prime Minister, was initially opposed to the idea of a foreign prince coming in to marry the Queen. He feared that this would create a power imbalance in the British government, with the Queen influenced by a foreigner.3. Some members of the British aristocracy were also against the match, as they didn't want a foreign prince to become so influential in the British court.4. Some members of the public were skeptical of the match as well, as they didn't know much about Prince Albert or his family.Despite the opposition, the couple eventually received widespread approval and went on to have a happy marriage.
