The pointed arches, steep gables, pinnacles, spires, and flying buttresses are the architectural elements that enhance the vertical look of the exterior of Gothic construction. The height and slenderness of these elements create an impression of upward movement, accentuating the verticality of the building. The use of vertical lines in the decoration and ornamentation, such as tracery, finials, and crockets, also contributes to the Gothic vertical aesthetics. The play of light and shadow on the intricate stonework of Gothic buildings further emphasizes the height and depth of the vertical planes.
