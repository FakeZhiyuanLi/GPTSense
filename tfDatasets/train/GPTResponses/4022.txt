Congress passed the Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act in 1968, also known as the Wiretap Act, which made it illegal to wiretap or intercept any oral or electronic communication without a court-issued warrant. This law has been amended several times over the years, most recently in the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, which expanded government surveillance powers but also included additional privacy protections for certain types of communications.
