One example of a code of law in ancient India is the "Laws of Manu" or "Manusmriti," which is believed to have been written between 200 BCE and 200 CE. This text lays out the social and legal framework for ancient Indian society, including guidelines for caste, marriage, inheritance, and criminal punishments. It also establishes dharma, or moral duty, as a key principle for individuals to follow in their daily lives.
