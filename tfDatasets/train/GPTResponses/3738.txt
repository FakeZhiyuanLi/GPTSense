The most influential device that interpreted characters is the optical character recognition (OCR) technology. This technology has revolutionized the process of digitizing printed texts and converting them into editable digital format by automatically identifying and translating printed text into machine-readable code. OCR technology has been instrumental in the development of various applications, including e-books, search engines, and digital archives, that rely on the digitization of printed materials.
