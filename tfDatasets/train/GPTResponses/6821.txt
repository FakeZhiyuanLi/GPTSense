Royals were usually expected to marry other members of royalty or noble families in order to form political alliances and strengthen bonds between different kingdoms or regions. Marriages were often arranged by their families or political advisors and were primarily based on political advantages rather than personal preferences or feelings. In some cases, royals were also expected to marry within their own family to maintain the purity of their bloodline and prevent any potential inheritance disputes.
