Turkey officially adopted the Gregorian calendar on January 1, 1927, as part of a series of modernization and secularization reforms under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk. Prior to that, Turkey had used the Islamic lunar calendar for religious and traditional purposes, and the Julian calendar for official and administrative purposes.
