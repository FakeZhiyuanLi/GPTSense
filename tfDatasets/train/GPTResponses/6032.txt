Ducks have been domesticated by humans for thousands of years, with evidence suggesting that they were domesticated in China as early as 4,000 years ago. Ducks were also kept for their meat and eggs by the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. The exact timeline of when ducks were widely kept as pets or for decoration is not known, but it is believed to have been a common practice for centuries.
