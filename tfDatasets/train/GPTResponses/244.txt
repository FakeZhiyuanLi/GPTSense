Samsara is a Sanskrit word that refers to the concept of cyclic existence, specifically the cycle of birth, death and rebirth in Hinduism, Buddhism, and other Indian religions. It is the belief in the continuous cycle of birth, death, and reincarnation until one achieves enlightenment and is freed from the cycle. Samsara is also synonymous with the idea of suffering through attachment and desire, and the ultimate goal is to break free from this cycle of suffering and achieve spiritual liberation.
