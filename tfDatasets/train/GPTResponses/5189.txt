The goddess worshipped in Ephesus before Mary was the Greek goddess Artemis (also known as Roman goddess Diana). The Temple of Artemis in Ephesus was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. It was later converted into a church dedicated to the Virgin Mary after Christianity became the dominant religion in the region.
