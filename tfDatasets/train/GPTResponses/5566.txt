There is currently no conclusive evidence that points to parenting or childhood play as determining factors for sexual orientation. While some studies have suggested that certain parenting styles or childhood experiences may be associated with a higher likelihood of identifying as LGBTQ+, the research is not definitive and the exact causes of sexual orientation remain unclear. Sexual orientation is likely influenced by a complex interplay of genetic, biological, and environmental factors.
