If the resolution is too high in an HDTV storage and transmission system and the compression technique used is not able to handle it, it may result in a loss of quality and clarity in the image. The image may appear pixelated or distorted, leading to an unsatisfactory viewing experience. Additionally, the file size of the video may increase, making it difficult to store or transmit efficiently. Therefore, it is essential to choose the appropriate compression technique based on the resolution and file size to ensure optimal viewing quality and efficient storage and transmission.
