Debates on proposed motions by an MSP are conducted in order to allow for thorough discussions and considerations of the pros and cons of the proposed motion. Through debates, different perspectives and insights are shared, allowing the MSPs to make informed decisions on whether to pass or reject the proposed motions. Debates also provide a forum for MSPs to raise concerns, ask questions and seek clarifications on the proposed motion before making a decision, ensuring that decisions made are well thought out and represent the interests of their constituents.
