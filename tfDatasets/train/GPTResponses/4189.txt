In Texas, there are different types of municipal elections that can be held, depending on the type of municipality:1. General Elections: These are held every two years on the first Tuesday in May in urban municipalities, and on the first Tuesday in November in suburban and rural municipalities. Voters elect mayors and city council members.2. Special Elections: These are held when a vacancy occurs in a mayor or council member position between general elections. The election is held to fill the remainder of the term.3. Joint Elections: These are held when the same polling location and ballot is used for multiple jurisdictions, such as school districts, municipal utility districts, or community college districts.4. Runoff Elections: These are held if no candidate receives a majority of votes in a general election. The two candidates with the most votes advance to a runoff election, which is typically held a few weeks after the general election.5. Bond Elections: These are held to approve or reject proposed bond measures for public works projects, such as infrastructure improvements, parks, or public buildings.
