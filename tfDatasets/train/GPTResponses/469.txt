The Bill of Rights did not incorporate a specific body into the government. It was a set of amendments to the United States Constitution that established several rights and protections for individual citizens, such as freedom of speech, religion, and the press, the right to bear arms, protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, and the right to a fair trial. These rights were incorporated into the government as a whole, ensuring that the government would respect and protect these fundamental freedoms for all citizens.
