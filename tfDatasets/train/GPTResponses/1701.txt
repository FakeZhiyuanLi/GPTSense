The loss of political and economic power, as well as military strength, led to the differentiation between the Western Roman Empire and the new kingdoms. The collapse of the Roman economy and the inability of its armies to defend the empire against external threats caused the Western Roman Empire to lose its authority and control over its territories. As a result, various Germanic tribes and other groups established their own kingdoms and ruled over their respective territories. This marked the beginning of the Middle Ages and the period of feudalism in Europe.
