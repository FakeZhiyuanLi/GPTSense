Reception statutes are laws enacted by individual states that govern the application of common law principles in that state. These statutes usually affirm that common law principles and the English legal system are binding in the state, except where they are inconsistent with state law. Reception statutes are meant to provide stability and continuity in the legal system by ensuring that common law principles can be applied consistently across all jurisdictions. They also help to ensure that the legal system is responsive to changing circumstances and new developments in the law.
