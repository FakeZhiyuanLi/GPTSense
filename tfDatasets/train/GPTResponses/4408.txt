The bitterness in beer is generally measured using the International Bitterness Units (IBU) scale. This measures the amount of iso-alpha acids (bittering compounds) in the beer. A higher IBU score indicates a more bitter beer, while a lower score indicates a less bitter beer. The IBU is determined by adding a measured amount of hops to boiling wort, then measuring the concentration of iso-alpha acids in the resultant liquid.
