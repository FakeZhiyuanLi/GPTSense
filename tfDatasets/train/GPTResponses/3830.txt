Infected plant cells undergo a variety of changes depending on the type of infection. Generally, they will show signs of stress and damage such as wilting, chlorosis (yellowing of leaves), and necrosis (death of tissue). The infected cells will also trigger an immune response, which may involve the production of antimicrobial chemicals, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and systemic acquired resistance (SAR) signaling molecules. In some cases, infected cells may undergo programmed cell death (PCD) as a means of limiting the spread of the pathogen. Ultimately, the fate of infected plant cells depends on the severity and type of infection, as well as the interventions used to control it.
