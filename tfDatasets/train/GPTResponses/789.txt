The materialistic view of matter posits that matter is the fundamental substance that makes up all objects in the physical world. According to this view, all objects are made up of material particles that interact with each other through physical forces. Therefore, other objects in the world are seen as collections of these material particles, and their properties and behaviors are ultimately determined by the properties and behaviors of these particles. Overall, the materialistic view of matter emphasizes the importance of physical causation and reductionism in understanding the nature of the physical world.
