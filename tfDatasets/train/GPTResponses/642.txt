multidisciplinary programs?In the 20th century, anthropology departments expanded into multidisciplinary programs, incorporating various fields like archaeology, linguistics, cultural studies, and social sciences. This trend was driven by the realization that anthropological research requires the collaboration of different academic disciplines to address complex social and cultural issues. Anthropologists recognized the importance of incorporating other perspectives into their research, including those from history, biology, economics, and political science. This interdisciplinary approach allowed anthropologists to develop a more comprehensive understanding of human behavior and societies, leading to the emergence of new fields like medical anthropology, visual anthropology, and digital anthropology. Additionally, the expansion of anthropology departments into multidisciplinary programs enabled students to acquire a broad range of skills and knowledge, making them more competitive in various fields.
