Some people say that the social stigma and discrimination associated with tuberculosis is even worse than the effects of the disease itself. This is because people with tuberculosis are often labeled as "dirty" or "dangerous" and are avoided by others, making it difficult for them to seek medical care or support. Additionally, people with tuberculosis may face barriers to education or employment due to their health status, further exacerbating the negative impact of the disease.
