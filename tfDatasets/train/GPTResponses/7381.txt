ANSI (American National Standards Institute) has developed standards in a wide range of areas, including information technology, telecommunications, construction, and many other industries. It is difficult to pinpoint a specific set of standards that ANSI was developed from since the organization has evolved over time and has been influenced by various factors. However, it can be said that ANSI standards have generally been developed from a combination of industry best practices, government regulations, and scientific research. Additionally, ANSI standards are often developed in collaboration with other organizations and stakeholders, such as trade associations, government agencies, and consumer groups.
