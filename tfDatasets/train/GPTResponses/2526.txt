Many birds migrate to escape harsh winters or droughts in their breeding or nesting grounds and seek more favorable conditions in other regions with abundant food and water. Some birds also migrate to take advantage of breeding opportunities or to avoid predators. The instinct to migrate is also believed to be a survival strategy that allows birds to maintain genetic diversity and avoid competition for resources with other bird species.
