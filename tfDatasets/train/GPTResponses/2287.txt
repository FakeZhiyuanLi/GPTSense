One example of an invisible genetic trait is carrier status for a recessive genetic disorder. This means that a person may inherit a copy of a mutated gene from one parent, but because it is recessive, it does not cause the disorder in the carrier. However, if the carrier has children with another carrier or with someone who has the disorder, there is a chance their child could inherit two copies of the mutated gene and develop the disorder. An example of this is sickle cell trait, where carriers do not have sickle cell disease but can pass it on to their children.
