Historical musical instruments and performance practices have often disappeared over the years due to changing tastes, advancements in technology, and other factors. However, there has been an ongoing effort to recreate these instruments and practices in order to perform music from specific periods.For example, the lute was a popular instrument during the Renaissance and Baroque periods, but it fell out of favor and was largely forgotten by the 19th century. In the early 20th century, there was a revival of interest in early music, and luthiers began working to recreate historical lutes based on surviving examples and historical documents.Similarly, performance practices have also been recreated in order to better understand the music of the past. For example, Baroque music was often performed with ornamentation, but this was largely lost in the 19th century. By studying historical treatises and manuscripts, musicians have been able to recreate the ornamentation and other performance practices that were common during the Baroque period.Overall, the recreation of historical instruments and performance practices has allowed us to better understand and appreciate the music of the past, and has given us new insights into the evolution of music over time.
