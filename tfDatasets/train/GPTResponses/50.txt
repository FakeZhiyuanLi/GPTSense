It depends on the rules and procedures of the particular parliament. In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, members of the public can request to address Parliament through their Member of Parliament (MP) or through the Parliamentary Petitions website. In other countries, such as the United States, invitations to address Congress are typically extended by members of Congress or Congressional committees. In some cases, religious leaders may be invited to address Parliament by the Speaker or other parliamentary officials. Ultimately, the decision rests with the parliamentary authorities.
