Research suggests that music therapy can be effective in improving the mood and emotional well-being of people with Alzheimer's. Music can help to stimulate memories and emotions, promoting social interaction and reducing feelings of isolation and depression. Art therapy and reminiscence therapy may also be helpful as they can provide a creative outlet for expression and help to bring back positive memories and feelings.
