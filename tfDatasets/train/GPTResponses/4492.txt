The Founding Fathers had faith in the military groups such as the Continental Army, which was commanded by George Washington during the Revolutionary War. They also believed in the need for a strong national defense and the importance of a well-regulated state militia. Additionally, they were wary of a standing army and believed in civilian control over the military.
