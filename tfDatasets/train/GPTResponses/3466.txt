During the 18th century, the commonly accepted temperament was rationalism and a belief in scientific progress. This was known as the Age of Enlightenment, characterized by a focus on reason, liberty, and equality. People were encouraged to think critically and to question traditional authority. This led to significant advances in science, philosophy, and political theory. The Enlightenment also promoted a belief in the inherent goodness of humanity and the potential for progress and improvement through education and rational thought.
