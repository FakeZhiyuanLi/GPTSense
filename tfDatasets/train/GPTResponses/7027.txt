The main problem with applying early electric motors to industry was that they were not very efficient and had low power outputs. They required large and expensive equipment, and they were unreliable and difficult to maintain. Early electric motors also had a tendency to overheat, which made them unsuitable for many industrial applications. Additionally, the availability and reliability of electrical power sources was limited, which further hampered their widespread application in industry.
