The abbey that was significant to Norman Kings was the Westminster Abbey, which was built by King Edward the Confessor in the 11th century. It became the coronation church of the Norman Kings and was used for royal weddings, funerals, and other important events. The Abbey is also the final resting place of many monarchs, including William the Conqueror and Queen Elizabeth I.
