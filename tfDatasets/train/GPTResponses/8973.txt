The Epirus Revolt of 1854 was primarily led by members of the Greek community in the region, including leaders such as Spyridon Tositsas and Dimitrios Grivas. However, it was also supported by some Albanian and Aromanian residents of the area. It is difficult to identify one specific person who "stirred up" the revolt, as it was the result of longstanding tensions and grievances among the different ethnic communities in Epirus.
