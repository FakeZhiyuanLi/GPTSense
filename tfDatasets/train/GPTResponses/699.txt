Conformation shows are also known as dog shows, where purebred dogs are judged based on their conformity to breed standards. The shows focus on the physical appearance of the dog, including their structure, coat, movement, and overall health. Conformation shows are popular events for dog enthusiasts and breeders and provide an opportunity for breeders to showcase their best dogs and potentially sell them to other breeders or pet owners.
