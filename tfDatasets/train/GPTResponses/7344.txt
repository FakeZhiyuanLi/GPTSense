Independent multiphase winding sets have the advantage of providing greater flexibility in terms of adjusting the phase angle and current flow in each winding set. This makes it easier to optimize the characteristics of the motor for different operating conditions, such as rotational speed, torque, and power efficiency. Additionally, independent winding sets can improve the motor's reliability and durability, as faults in one winding set are less likely to affect the entire motor. Finally, independent winding sets may also reduce the overall size and weight of the motor, as they allow for higher power density without compromising performance.
