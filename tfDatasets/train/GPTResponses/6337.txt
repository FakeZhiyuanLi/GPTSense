In the Seattle area, atmospheric rivers are commonly called "Pineapple Express." This term refers to a weather pattern that brings warm, humid air from the tropics, typically from Hawaii, to the Pacific Northwest. The moisture from these systems often results in heavy rainfall, flooding, and landslides in the region.
