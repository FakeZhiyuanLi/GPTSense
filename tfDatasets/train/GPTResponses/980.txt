In emergency situations, physicians usually perform a quick physical examination of the patient to check for any signs of immune system dysfunction such as swollen lymph nodes, skin rashes, or fever. They may also order lab tests to evaluate the patient's blood count, white blood cell count, and levels of immunoglobulins, antibodies, and other immune system markers.If there is a need for further investigation, the physician may recommend imaging studies such as ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI to assess the patient's immune system organs such as the spleen, lymph nodes, thymus, and bone marrow. In some cases, the physician may also perform a biopsy of the affected organ to obtain a sample for laboratory analysis. These tests can help the physician determine the underlying cause of the immune system dysfunction and devise a suitable plan for treatment.
