The determination between patois and creole French is usually determined by the level of linguistic complexity and the degree of African influence. Patois is typically characterized by a simplified version of the French language, with a significant amount of local vocabulary and grammar. It is often spoken by rural or working-class communities with limited education.Creole French, on the other hand, is a complete language system that has developed from a mixture of French and African languages. It has a more complex grammar, a standardized orthography, and has been recognized as an official language in some countries. Creole French is typically spoken in urban areas and is associated with a more diverse population.
