In Buddhism, rebirth into consecutive lives is determined by one's actions, thoughts, and intentions in the previous life. This is known as the law of karma. The nature of one's rebirth is based on the accumulated karmic forces, which can either be positive (merit) or negative (demerit). The aim of practicing Buddhism is to accumulate good karma to attain a better rebirth, ultimately leading to the end of the cycle of rebirths and achieving enlightenment.
