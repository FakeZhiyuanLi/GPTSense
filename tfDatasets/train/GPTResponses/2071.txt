One subfield of modern phonology that crosses over with phonetics is acoustic phonetics. Acoustic phonetics is concerned with analyzing the physical properties of sounds, such as frequency, amplitude, and duration, as well as the way they are produced and perceived. This involves measuring and analyzing speech signals recorded from speakers and using specialized software to identify and quantify the characteristics of the sounds. The insights gained from acoustic phonetics can be used to improve our understanding of phonological phenomena, such as vowel and consonant systems, stress patterns, and intonation.
