The Melbourne financial crisis was a contributing factor to the banking crisis that occurred in Australia in 1893. The crisis began in Melbourne with the collapse of several banks due to speculation and a decline in land prices. This created a chain reaction that spread to other parts of Australia, leading to bank failures, unemployment, and a severe economic downturn. The crisis was exacerbated by a global depression and a decline in demand for Australia's primary exports. The banking crisis had a significant impact on the Australian economy, contributing to a period of economic stagnation that lasted until the early 1900s.
