Code pleading was gradually replaced by modern notice pleading in the 20th century, starting in the late 1930s and continuing through the 1940s and 1950s. The adoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in 1938 marked a significant shift toward notice pleading in federal courts, which was later adopted by many state courts. By the 1960s, notice pleading had become the dominant approach in most jurisdictions.
