Marshal law was declared in Burma (now Myanmar) in 1989 after a military coup by the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), which seized power from the civilian government. The coup was largely motivated by a desire to maintain control over the country and prevent opposition groups from gaining power. Martial law allowed the military to crack down on dissent, restrict freedom of speech and assembly, and imprison or execute political opponents without trial. The declaration of martial law marked the beginning of a period of military rule that lasted for decades in Burma.
