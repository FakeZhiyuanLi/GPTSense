The most commonly used transliteration scheme on the internet is the Romanization of the Cyrillic alphabet. This scheme uses Latin characters to represent the sounds of the Cyrillic alphabet used in Slavic languages such as Russian, Ukrainian, and Bulgarian. It is also known as the "ISO transliteration" or "GOST transliteration" and is often used in email addresses, domain names, and online discussions. Some variations of this scheme also exist, depending on the language and the context in which it is used.
