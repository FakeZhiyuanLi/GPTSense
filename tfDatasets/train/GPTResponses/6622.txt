the federal government wants to regulate. This concept is known as preemption. Preemption means that a higher level of government law can override a law of a lower level of government. In other words, when there is a conflict between state and federal law, the federal law takes precedence over the state law.The concept of preemption allows for consistency and uniformity in the regulation of insurance, as it prevents states from enacting laws that contradict federal laws. Preemption also ensures that insurers and policyholders are subject to the same rules and regulations wherever they operate in the country.However, preemption can be controversial, as it can limit a state's ability to regulate the insurance industry within its borders. This can be seen as taking away state authority and creating a centralized form of governance. As a result, there is ongoing debate about the extent to which preemption should be used in the regulation of insurance and other areas of law.
