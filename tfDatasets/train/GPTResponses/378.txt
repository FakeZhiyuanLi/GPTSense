The primary reason for maintaining the separation between gorillas and humans is to prevent the spread of diseases since humans and gorillas have different immune systems. Also, gorillas are wild animals and can be dangerous if they feel threatened or become aggressive towards humans. Therefore, it is essential to maintain a distance between gorillas and humans for the safety of both parties. Protected areas such as national parks and sanctuaries have strict rules and guidelines to prevent interactions between gorillas and humans.
