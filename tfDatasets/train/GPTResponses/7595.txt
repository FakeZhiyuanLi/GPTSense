The standard for transferring data to and from earlier types of smartphones included using cables or infrared ports. Some smartphones also had memory card slots that users could insert to transfer files. Bluetooth was also available but was not commonly used as it was slow and could not handle large files. Data transfer through Wi-Fi and cloud storage became more popular in later smartphone models.
