The quotient of the free group over the generators of the group can be any group that can be obtained by imposing certain relations on the generators. In other words, the quotient group is obtained by identifying certain elements of the free group as equivalent and then removing them. For example, if the generators satisfy the relation $ab=ba$, then the quotient group would be the abelian group generated by $a$ and $b$. Similarly, if the generators satisfy the relation $a^2=b^3$, then the quotient group would be the group generated by $a$ and $b$ subject to the relations $a^2=b^3=1$. This group is isomorphic to the dihedral group of order 6. Thus, the possible quotient groups depend on the relations imposed on the generators.
