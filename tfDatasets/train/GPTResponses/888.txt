we call cognitive biases. These biases are implicit assumptions or mental shortcuts that our brains make without us realizing it. They are based on our experiences, socialization, and cultural background, and they filter the information we receive and how we interpret it. As a result, we tend to see the world through a particular lens, which can limit our ability to see alternative perspectives or challenge our preconceived notions. This is why it is important to be aware of our biases and to try to stay open to new ideas and evidence.
