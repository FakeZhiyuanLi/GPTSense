The issue of Scottish independence remained an important issue in Scottish national identity for many years. The desire for Scotland to be an independent country separate from the United Kingdom has been a prominent political issue for decades, with the Scottish National Party (SNP) campaigning consistently for independence. In 2014, a referendum was held on Scottish independence, with 55% of voters choosing to remain in the UK. However, the issue remains a key part of Scottish politics and national identity.
