One argument that is commonly used to try and refute the benefits of affirmative action as it relates to the compensation argument is that it is unfair to use race as a factor in determining who gets hired or promoted, as it takes away from the merit-based system that should be in place. Supporters of this argument often suggest that affirmative action gives minorities an unfair advantage over white candidates who may be equally qualified or even more qualified for a job or promotion. They argue that affirmative action is reverse discrimination and should be abolished to create a level playing field for all candidates, regardless of race.
