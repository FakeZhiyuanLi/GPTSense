The Great Persecution, also known as the Diocletianic Persecution, began in the Roman Empire in 303. It was a campaign against Christians initiated by Emperor Diocletian and intended to destroy their religion. It included the burning of Christian texts, the destruction of Christian buildings, and the execution of Christian leaders. The persecution was one of the most severe and prolonged of its kind and lasted until 311 when Emperor Galerius issued an edict of toleration.
