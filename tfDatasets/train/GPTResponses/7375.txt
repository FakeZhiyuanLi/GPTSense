is available in their local environment. For example, Inuit people in the Arctic regions use animal hides and fur to make warm winter clothing, while people in tropical regions use light, breathable fabrics such as cotton or silk to make comfortable clothing suitable for hot weather. Other materials used for clothing include plant fibers such as hemp, flax, and nettles which are used to make linen, and silk from silkworms. Additionally, synthetic materials such as nylon and polyester have become popular for their durability and affordability. The type of clothing worn in a particular culture and climate is often influenced by religious, social, or practical factors.
