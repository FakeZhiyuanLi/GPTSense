Most eukaryotic open reading frames (ORFs) contain coding sequences for proteins. These coding sequences are made up of nucleotide triplets (codons) that specify the sequence of amino acids in the protein. The ORFs also typically contain untranslated regions (UTRs) on either end of the coding sequence, which contain regulatory elements that control the expression of the gene. In addition, many eukaryotic ORFs contain introns, which are non-coding regions that must be removed from the pre-mRNA transcript before translation into protein.
