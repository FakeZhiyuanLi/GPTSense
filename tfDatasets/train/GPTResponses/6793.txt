An airtight envelope or container that encloses the filament and protects it from oxygen is called a bulb. The air inside the bulb is typically vacuumed out, leaving no air or gas. The enclosure is made of glass or other materials that are airtight and gas-resistant. A base and lead wires assist in holding the enclosure together and making electric connections to the filament. A tiny glass stem is fused to the enclosure that gets burnt and the filament's ends are fused to a pair of wires. The lamp is then filled with an inert gas, such as argon or nitrogen, to protect the filament from oxidizing (burning up) and corroding. The gas inside the bulb does not leak out because the bulb is airtight.
