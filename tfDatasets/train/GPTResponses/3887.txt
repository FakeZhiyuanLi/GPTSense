There are two ways that food is broken down:1. Mechanical digestion: This process involves physical actions that break down food into smaller pieces. Mechanical digestion mainly takes place in the mouth and the stomach. In the mouth, teeth break down food into smaller pieces, and saliva moistens and softens food to prepare it for swallowing. In the stomach, muscular contractions mix and grind food into a liquid called chyme.2. Chemical digestion: This process involves the breakdown of food molecules into smaller molecules through chemical reactions. Chemical digestion mainly takes place in the small intestine. Enzymes produced by the pancreas and the small intestine break down proteins, carbohydrates, and fats into their respective building blocks, amino acids, glucose, and fatty acids, which can be absorbed by the body.
