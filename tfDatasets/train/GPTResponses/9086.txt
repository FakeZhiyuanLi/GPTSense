The Baptist movement, founded by John Smyth and Thomas Helwys, promoted strict immersion baptism. The movement believed that baptism should be done by full immersion in water, as this symbolized the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. This belief remains a fundamental tenet of Baptist theology to this day.
