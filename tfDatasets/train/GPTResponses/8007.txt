The Destroyers for Bases Agreement was reached between the United States and the United Kingdom in 1940 during World War II. Under the agreement, the United States agreed to transfer fifty old destroyers to the United Kingdom in exchange for the right to establish U.S. naval bases on British territories in the Caribbean, Bermuda, and Newfoundland. This agreement helped to bolster the British fleet and enable them to better defend against German attacks. It was seen as a symbol of closer cooperation between the two nations and marked the beginning of the United States' increased involvement in World War II.
