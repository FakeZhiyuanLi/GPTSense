The FBI began investigating espionage during World War I, but it wasn't until the start of World War II that espionage became a major concern for the agency. In 1940, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Espionage Act, which made it illegal to provide classified information to foreign governments. Since then, the FBI has played a leading role in investigating and prosecuting cases involving espionage and the theft of sensitive information.
