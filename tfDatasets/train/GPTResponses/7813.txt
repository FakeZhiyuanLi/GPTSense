The need for Bermuda's salt diminished due to several factors such as technological advancements in refrigeration which allowed for better preservation of food without the need for salt, the shift from traditional food preservation methods to more modern ones, and the availability of cheaper and easily accessible sources of salt from other regions. Additionally, changes in Bermuda's economy and focus on tourism reduced the demand for salt as a primary export commodity.
