The concept of habeas corpus, or the right to be free from arbitrary detention or imprisonment, exists in many legal systems around the world. In the United States, the writ of habeas corpus is protected by the Constitution and is seen as a fundamental civil liberty. In other countries, such as Canada, Australia, and India, there are similar legal protections for the right to habeas corpus. In Europe, the European Convention on Human Rights guarantees the right to habeas corpus for citizens of member states.
