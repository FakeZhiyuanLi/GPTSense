The support of Asoka and his descendants led to the construction of several important structures in India, including temples, monasteries, and stupas. Some of the most significant structures built during this period include the Mahabodhi Temple in Bodh Gaya, the Great Stupa at Sanchi, and the Ajanta Caves. These structures are considered to be some of the finest examples of Indian art and architecture and have played an important role in the development of Buddhist art and culture in India.
