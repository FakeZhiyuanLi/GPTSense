The retail industry benefits from DST (Daylight Saving Time) as it provides an extra hour of daylight for consumers to shop after work, which can increase foot traffic and sales. This is particularly true for stores that specialize in outdoor activities, such as sports equipment, gardening or home improvement stores, as people have more daylight hours to work on outdoor projects or take part in outdoor activities. Additionally, the longer evenings allow for more time for leisure activities, which could lead to increased spending on entertainment, dining out, and other related purchases.
