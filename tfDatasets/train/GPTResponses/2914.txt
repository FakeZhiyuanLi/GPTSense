Hawala is an alternative remittance system used for transferring funds between individuals or entities. It is an informal system that operates outside of traditional banking channels, allowing for greater flexibility and speed in transferring money. In the hawala system, a person deposits money with a hawala dealer or broker, who then arranges for the funds to be transferred to the recipient through a network of contacts and counterparts across regions and countries. The system is often used in parts of the world with limited access to formal banking services or where traditional banking systems are unreliable or untrustworthy. However, hawala can also be used for illicit purposes, such as money laundering and funding illegal activities.
