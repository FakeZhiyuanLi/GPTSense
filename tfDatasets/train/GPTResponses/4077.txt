Economists study emotion in relation to decision-making and how it affects economic behavior. They explore how emotions such as fear, optimism, greed, and trust shape individual and collective economic decisions, including financial investments, consumption patterns, and organizational behavior. Additionally, economists investigate how emotional responses to economic policies, news, and events affect market outcomes. They also examine how social norms and culture influence emotional responses to economic stimuli and how such responses contribute to economic outcomes.
