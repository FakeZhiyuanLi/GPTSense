There are some differences in how squabs (young pigeons that have not yet flown) are treated compared to adult pigeons. Here are a few examples:1. Squabs are often raised in captivity for meat production. They are kept in special facilities that are designed to provide the right nutrients and care for their growth. Some of these facilities are quite large and can house thousands of birds at once.2. Squabs have a softer, milder flavor than adult pigeons, so they are often used in gourmet cuisine. They are considered a delicacy in some cultures and can be quite expensive.3. Squabs are smaller and more delicate than adult pigeons, so they require special handling when they are being prepared for cooking. They are usually not plucked like adult pigeons, but are skinned instead. This helps to preserve the delicate flesh and prevent it from tearing.4. Squabs are sometimes used as show birds in pigeon competitions. They are judged on their size, shape, and coloration, just like adult pigeons. Some breeders specialize in producing high-quality squabs for these competitions.Overall, squabs are treated differently from adult pigeons because of their unique characteristics and uses. While some people may find it uncomfortable to eat young birds, others consider them a delicacy and a cultural tradition.
