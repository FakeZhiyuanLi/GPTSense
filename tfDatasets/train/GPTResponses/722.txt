Pratītyasamutpāda is a Sanskrit term that is typically translated into English as "dependent arising" or "dependent origination". It refers to the Buddhist concept that all phenomena arise in dependence upon other phenomena, and that nothing exists independently or self-sufficiently. According to this doctrine, everything in the universe is interconnected and interdependent, and arises and ceases due to various causes and conditions. This principle is central to Buddhist philosophy and is considered one of the key insights leading to the liberation from suffering.
