The court of Song was not defeated by a single person or incident. It refers to the ruling government of the Song dynasty in China (960-1279), which came to an end after various military defeats and invasions by the Mongols under the leadership of Kublai Khan. However, some notable battles that contributed to the downfall of the Song dynasty include the Battle of Yamen in 1279, where the Mongols decisively defeated the Song navy, and the Battle of Kaifeng in 1232, where the Mongols captured the Song capital.
