A typical argument in favor of affirmative action is that it is necessary to address past and current discrimination and promote diversity in order to achieve equality and fairness in society. Affirmative action policies provide opportunities to historically underrepresented groups, such as women, people of color, and those with disabilities, by considering their race, gender, or other factors in the hiring and admission processes. This promotes a more inclusive and diverse workforce and educational environment, which can bring different perspectives, experiences, and ideas to the table, ultimately resulting in better decision-making and innovation. Additionally, affirmative action is seen as a way to redress the effects of discriminatory policies and practices that have disadvantaged certain groups for generations.
