Water is transported into plants through a process called transpiration. Transpiration is the loss of water vapor from plants through small pores in their leaves called stomata. This loss of water vapor creates a negative pressure or tension in the plant tissues, which pulls water up through the plant's roots from the soil. This process is facilitated by tiny tubes called xylem, which transport water and minerals from the roots to the rest of the plant. The movement of water through the xylem is driven by the transpiration process and is aided by the cohesive properties of water molecules, which can stick together and form long chains that allow water to be pulled up through the plant like a straw.
