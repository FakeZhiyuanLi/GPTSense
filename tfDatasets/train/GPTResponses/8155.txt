The year 1543 is considered to be the beginning of the scientific revolution because it was the year that Nicolas Copernicus published his book, "On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres," which introduced the heliocentric theory, challenging the long-held geocentric theory. This marked a significant shift in scientific thinking and sparked major advances in scientific inquiry in the centuries that followed.
