The characteristic that determined the proportions of the bricks is the practicality and durability of the final product. The size and shape of the bricks were designed to facilitate their handling, transportation, and placement in construction projects. They needed to be sufficiently large and sturdy to provide stability to the structure but still manageable enough for workers to lift and maneuver. Additionally, the proportions of the bricks needed to be consistent to ensure their compatibility with other blocks and masonry units. The standard brick size has evolved over time, but the most common proportions are roughly 8 inches long, 4 inches wide, and 2.25 inches high.
