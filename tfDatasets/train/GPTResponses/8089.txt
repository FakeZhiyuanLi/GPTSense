The Catholic Church's condemnation of 1277 was not written by a single individual. It was a series of edicts issued by various bishops and theologians, many of whom remain unidentified. Some of the most notable condemnations were made by Bishop Etienne Tempier of Paris and the Dominican theologian Thomas Aquinas.
