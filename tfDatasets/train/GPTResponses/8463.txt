Darwin proposed that these diverse features could be explained by natural selection. According to his theory of evolution, individuals with certain advantageous traits would be more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on those traits to their offspring. Over time, this could result in the evolution of new and diverse characteristics, such as antlers on deer or bright feathers on certain male birds, that help individuals compete for mates, find food, or avoid predators.
