Some villages are considering becoming car free zones for a number of reasons:1. Reducing pollution: Cars are a major source of pollution, releasing harmful emissions into the air that contribute to climate change and harm human health. Reducing or eliminating cars in villages can improve air quality and reduce emission levels.2. Promoting physical activity: By reducing reliance on cars, people may be encouraged to walk or cycle more frequently, promoting physical exercise and healthier lifestyles.3. Improving safety: Cars are a common cause of accidents, and reducing their use in villages can make the area safer for pedestrians and cyclists.4. Enhancing community life: A car-free village can create a more communal and sociable atmosphere, with public spaces becoming more pedestrian-friendly and encouraging community interaction.5. Reducing traffic congestion: Cars can cause traffic congestion, and reducing their use in villages can ease this problem, making the community more efficient and convenient for everyone.
