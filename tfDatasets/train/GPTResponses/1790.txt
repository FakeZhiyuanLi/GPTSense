Regulatory regions on different chromosomes operate through a process called chromosome conformation capture (3C) in order to allow regions on different chromosomes to come into contact with one another. 3C is a technique that maps physical interactions between different regions of the genome by cross-linking and digesting DNA, followed by ligation of cross-linked fragments. This leads to the formation of 3C libraries, which enable researchers to infer the positions and frequency of interactions between different regions of the genome.Further analysis of 3C libraries using other techniques, such as chromosome conformation capture carbon copy (5C) or high-throughput sequencing (Hi-C), can help to identify the nature of these interactions, such as chromatin looping between regulatory regions on different chromosomes. These interactions allow for long-range genomic regulation of gene expression, whereby distant regulatory elements on separate chromosomes can come into contact with one another to facilitate the coordinated regulation of gene expression.
