Shia Nizari Ismailis have a hereditary Imamate, which means that their Imams are descended from Prophet Muhammad and his daughter Fatima, through a line of 49 Imams. The current Imam is His Highness Prince Karim Aga Khan IV. The Imam is considered the spiritual and temporal leader of the community and is responsible for interpreting and conveying the teachings of Islam to his followers. The Ismaili community places great importance on the guidance and leadership of the Imam in both personal and community matters.
