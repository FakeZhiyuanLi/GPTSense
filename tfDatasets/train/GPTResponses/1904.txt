The Third Crusade was launched in 1189 by European leaders, including Richard the Lionheart of England, King Philip II of France, and Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I, in response to the fall of the Kingdom of Jerusalem to Muslim forces. Its purpose was to recapture the Holy City from the Muslim forces and restore Christian control over the Holy Land. It was also intended to defend and expand the territories held by the Crusader States in the region.
