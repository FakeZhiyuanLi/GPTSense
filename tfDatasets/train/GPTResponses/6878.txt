The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure abolished the old system of pleading called "code pleading." This system required strict and technical legal language in pleadings and made it difficult for parties to present their cases effectively. The Federal Rules introduced a simpler and more flexible system that allowed parties to present their cases in plain language and simplified the process of discovery and pretrial procedures.
