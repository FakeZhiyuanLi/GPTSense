Groups consisting of symmetries of given arithmetic concepts are called symmetry groups. They are groups of transformations (such as reflections, rotations, translations, etc.) that preserve the properties of the arithmetic concept under consideration. Some examples of arithmetic concepts and their associated symmetry groups include:1. Addition: The symmetry group of addition is the group of integers under addition. This group is closed, associative, and has an identity element (0) and inverse elements for every element.2. Multiplication: The symmetry group of multiplication is the group of non-zero rational numbers under multiplication. This group is also closed, associative, and has an identity element (1) and inverse elements for every element.3. Symmetry of a shape: The symmetry group of a shape is the group of transformations (such as rotations, reflections, etc.) that preserve the shape's properties. For example, a square has rotational symmetry of order 4 (meaning it can be rotated 90, 180, or 270 degrees and still look the same) and reflectional symmetry across its diagonals.In general, the symmetry group of an arithmetic concept is the group of transformations that preserve the defining properties of that concept. These groups have important applications in group theory, geometry, and algebraic structures.
