The Dervish State was primarily centered in present-day Somalia and had significant support among the Somali people. However, it did not have any formal support from any other states or governments. In fact, it was at odds with European colonial powers, especially Britain, who sought to control the region. There were some Muslim countries (such as the Ottoman Empire and Afghanistan) that expressed sympathy for the Dervish cause, but they did not provide significant material support.
