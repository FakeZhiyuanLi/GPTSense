Stout and porter beers are typically brewed using strains of ale yeast, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Some brewers may also use specialized strains or blends of yeast specifically selected for their ability to produce rich, complex, and malty flavors commonly found in stout and porter beer styles.
