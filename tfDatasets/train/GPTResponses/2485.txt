A sample image or video with high compression or low bitrate can display good examples of compression artifacts. For example, a heavily compressed JPEG image, a low-quality YouTube video, or a video streamed over a slow internet connection. These types of samples may exhibit visible blocky or blurry distortions, color banding, loss of detail, and other types of compression artifacts.
