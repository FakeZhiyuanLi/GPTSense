The main function of the brain from an evolutionary-biological perspective is to ensure the survival and propagation of the organism. The brain has evolved over millions of years to perform a variety of complex tasks, including sensing the environment, processing information, making decisions, controlling movement, regulating the body's internal functions, and generating emotions and behaviors. These functions have contributed to the survival and success of humans and other species, allowing them to adapt to diverse environments and challenges. The brain's capacity for learning and memory has also been essential for acquiring and passing on knowledge and skills to future generations.
