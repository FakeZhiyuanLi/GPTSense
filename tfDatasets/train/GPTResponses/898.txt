When sunlight shines on a solar balloon, it heats up the air inside the balloon. This causes the air to expand and become less dense than the surrounding air, which makes the balloon rise. The solar balloon is designed to trap the sunlight and convert it into heat, which creates the air current inside the balloon that allows it to rise. As long as the balloon continues to heat up and rise, it will stay in the air. However, if the balloon cools down or loses heat, it will begin to descend to the ground.
