If a nuclear chain reaction in uranium-235 does not result in a burst of heat, it may result in the emission of gamma rays, which are high energy electromagnetic radiation. This reaction is known as gamma decay or gamma radiation. The energy released by the gamma rays can be used in various applications, such as medical imaging and radiation therapy. However, a nuclear chain reaction that does not result in heat is not very useful for energy production as the heat is what is used to generate electricity.
