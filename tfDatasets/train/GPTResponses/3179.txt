Autosegmental phonology evolved into the theory of Optimality Theory in the 1990s. Optimality Theory is a framework for analyzing phonological processes that emphasizes the ranking of constraints on the output of a phonological grammar. It is based on the idea that the grammar of a language consists of a set of constraints that are ranked relative to one another, and that the most optimal output is the one that best satisfies the constraints. Unlike autosegmental phonology, which had a more linear approach to phonological analysis, Optimality Theory emphasizes the interaction between different levels of linguistic representation.
