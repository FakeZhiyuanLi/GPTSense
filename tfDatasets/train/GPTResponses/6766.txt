There are no islands that have decided to return to British rule after receiving independence. Once a country or territory gains independence, it is considered sovereign and no longer under the control of the former colonizer. However, there have been instances where former colonies have maintained close ties with their former colonizer, such as the Commonwealth of Nations, a group of 54 countries, most of which are former British colonies.
