In many monarchies, the king or queen is not elected, but inherits the position through family lineage. This is known as a hereditary monarchy. In other cases, the king may be chosen by a council or group of nobles, as was the case in historical monarchies like the Holy Roman Empire. However, in modern times, most monarchies have evolved to be constitutional or parliamentary systems, where the monarch's role is largely symbolic and ceremonial, and the real power lies with elected officials and a constitution or body of laws.
