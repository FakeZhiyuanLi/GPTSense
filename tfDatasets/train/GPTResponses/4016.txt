The snare drum is often perceived as having a higher pitch than the bass drum, even though both drums have indefinite pitch. This is because the snare drum produces a higher frequency sound due to its smaller size and tighter heads. Additionally, the snare wires on the bottom of the drum add a high-pitched buzzing sound that contributes to its perceived pitch.
