Historically, many different groups and individuals have sent pirates to capture merchant ships. This includes governments, privateers, rogue traders, and criminal organizations. Some of the most famous pirate networks were established by European colonizers and slave traders in the Caribbean, while others were associated with Muslim states and seafaring cultures in the Mediterranean, Indian Ocean, and Southeast Asia. Modern piracy is often associated with organized crime syndicates operating off the coast of Africa or in other remote areas of the world where naval patrols are limited.
