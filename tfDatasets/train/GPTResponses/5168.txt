The Arctic Ocean warms the Arctic mainly through the transport of warm water. The ocean circulates warm water from the Atlantic into the Arctic, and this water contributes to the melting of sea ice and warming of the surrounding atmosphere. The warming of the ocean also increases the release of methane, which is a potent greenhouse gas, from the Arctic permafrost. Additionally, as the ice melts, more sunlight can be absorbed by the ocean, further contributing to warming. Climate change has caused the Arctic Ocean to warm at an alarming rate, leading to significant impacts on the region's ecology, indigenous communities, and global climate.
