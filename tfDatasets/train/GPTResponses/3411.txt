The ownership and control of vast estates and landholdings was an important power basis for the magnates. They derived their wealth and influence from their ownership of large tracts of land, which provided them with a steady source of income and allowed them to exert political influence over the surrounding communities. In addition, their control over the labor of peasants and serfs who worked on their estates gave them an additional source of power and prestige.
