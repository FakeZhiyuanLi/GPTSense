Hobson argued against imperialism in his book, "Imperialism: A Study," published in 1902. He believed that the main cause of imperialism was the excessive accumulation of wealth in the hands of a few individuals and companies, which led to the need to find new markets and resources for investment. This, in turn, led to the acquisition of colonies and the exploitation of the people and resources of those colonies.To rid the world of imperialism, Hobson argued for:1. A redistribution of wealth: Hobson believed that if wealth was distributed more equally, there would be less need for imperialism as there would be fewer wealthy individuals or companies seeking to expand their wealth.2. Democratic control of foreign policy: Hobson believed that foreign policy should be controlled by the people rather than a small elite, and that decisions about imperialism should be made democratically.3. The promotion of international cooperation: Hobson believed that instead of competing for resources and markets, nations should work together to address common problems and promote mutual prosperity.4. The development of international law: Hobson believed that international law should be developed to prevent nations from using military force to impose their will on others.Overall, Hobson argued that imperialism was a result of the economic system of capitalism and that it could only be eliminated by transforming that system and creating a more just and equitable world.
