Darwin justified his theory of evolution through natural selection with extensive observational and empirical evidence. He conducted extensive research on the characteristics of plants and animals, and gathered evidence from various sources such as fossils, comparative anatomy, embryology, and biogeography.He also conducted experiments and made detailed observations of animal behavior, which provided him with important insights into the mechanisms of natural selection. Through his research, Darwin was able to demonstrate how traits that confer a survival advantage to individuals become more prevalent in a population over time, leading to the evolution of new species.Additionally, Darwin's theory was supported by other scientists who made similar observations and provided additional evidence from various fields, such as genetics and biochemistry. Overall, the strength of the evidence supporting Darwin's theory of evolution and natural selection has allowed it to stand the test of time and continue to be widely accepted in the scientific community today.
