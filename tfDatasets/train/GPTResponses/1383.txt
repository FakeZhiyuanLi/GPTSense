they were using. For example, the term "light" was historically used in a more general sense to refer to both visible light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation, such as radio waves or microwaves. It was only later, as scientists began to understand the distinct properties and behaviors of these different forms of radiation, that the term "light" came to be more narrowly defined as referring specifically to visible light.Similarly, the term "element" was historically used to refer to any substance that could not be broken down into simpler components, including compounds. It wasn't until the rise of modern chemistry in the late 18th and early 19th centuries that scientists began to differentiate between elements and compounds, and to develop a more precise understanding of the ways in which different substances relate to one another.In general, as scientific knowledge has advanced, scientists have developed more precise and specific definitions for many terms that were previously used in more general or ambiguous ways. This has helped to clarify scientific discussions and ensure that communication between researchers is more accurate and effective.
