Black people in early America identified primarily as slaves or free blacks. Many were forcibly brought over from Africa and sold into slavery, while others were born into slavery. Slaves were considered property and were not granted the same rights as white people. Free blacks, on the other hand, had some legal protections, although they still faced discrimination and were often restricted in their employment and civil liberties. Additionally, some free blacks identified more strongly with their African roots and culture, while others assimilated to American culture.
