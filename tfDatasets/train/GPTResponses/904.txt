The fourth of the Buddha's Four Noble Truths is the eightfold path, which outlines the way to end suffering and achieve enlightenment. It consists of eight practices or areas of focus: right understanding, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.
