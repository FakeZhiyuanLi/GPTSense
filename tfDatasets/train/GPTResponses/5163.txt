Antarctica and Australia were joined together as part of a large supercontinent called Gondwana during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras, which ended about 65 million years ago. However, the exact timing of their separation is uncertain and has been the subject of scientific debate. Some studies suggest that Antarctica may have started to break away from Gondwana as early as 160 million years ago, while others suggest a more gradual process that continued until about 30 million years ago.
