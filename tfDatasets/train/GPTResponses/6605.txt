Federal law begins at the U.S. Constitution, which is the supreme law of the land. Laws are also created and passed by Congress, which is made up of the House of Representatives and the Senate. These laws are then signed into effect by the President, and enforced by government agencies such as the Department of Justice and the FBI.
