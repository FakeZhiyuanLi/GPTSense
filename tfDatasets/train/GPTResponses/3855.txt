Emile Durkheim, a French sociologist, discussed the idea of collective effervescence as a phenomenon that occurs when individuals come together in a social setting and experience a shared emotional and ecstatic state. He believed that this collective experience can strengthen social bonds and reinforce a sense of community and unity, which is important for maintaining social cohesion in societies.
