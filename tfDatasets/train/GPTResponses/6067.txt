Prakritisms are words or phrases that are borrowed from Prakrit, which is a group of ancient Indic languages. Prakritisms are commonly used in Indian regional languages, literature, and poetry, and are often associated with rural or folk contexts. Some common examples of Prakritisms in Indian languages include "jivan" (life), "dukh" (sorrow), and "sukh" (happiness).
