The number of legions in Roman times depended on various factors, including the size of the Roman army, the level of threat from external enemies, the logistical capacity to support and maintain the legions, and the financial resources of the Roman state. Other factors such as availability of manpower, recruitment policies, and strategic considerations also played a role in determining the number of legions. In general, the number of legions varied over time, with the peak being reached during the reign of Emperor Trajan, who commanded a maximum of 36 legions.
