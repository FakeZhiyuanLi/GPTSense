Differences in flora and fauna cannot be explained by differences in regions alone because there are multiple factors that affect the distribution and evolution of species. Environmental factors such as temperature, precipitation, soil types, and topography, as well as historical events such as glaciations or the formation of mountain ranges, all play a significant role in shaping the diversity and distribution of life on Earth. Additionally, human activities such as deforestation, pollution, and the introduction of non-native species can also have a significant impact on the flora and fauna of different regions. Therefore, in order to fully understand the differences in flora and fauna among regions, it is important to take into account a wide range of factors that interact to shape the natural world around us.
