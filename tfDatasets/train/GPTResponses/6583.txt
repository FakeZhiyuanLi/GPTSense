Incandescent bulbs are less efficient than most electric lighting. They operate by heating a filament with electricity until it glows and emits light. This process is relatively inefficient because a lot of energy is lost as heat rather than light. Most modern electric lighting, such as LED and fluorescent bulbs, use alternative methods to produce light that are much more efficient, resulting in less energy consumption and lower electricity bills.
