The primary goal of Tibetan Buddhism is to achieve enlightenment, also known as 'Buddhahood'. This is accomplished through various practices, such as meditation, compassion, ethical conduct, and the study of Buddhist teachings. The ultimate aim of Tibetan Buddhism is to free oneself from the endless cycle of rebirth and suffering, and to attain a state of lasting peace and happiness.
