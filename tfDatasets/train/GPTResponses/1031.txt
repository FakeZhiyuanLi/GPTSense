Studies have provided significant evidence that climate change is happening and is largely caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. Research has shown that greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide, are increasing the Earth's temperature and causing a range of impacts, including rising sea levels, more frequent and intense heatwaves, more intense storms, and changes in precipitation patterns. Studies have also suggested that the impacts of climate change are likely to worsen over time and that urgent action is needed to address this issue.
