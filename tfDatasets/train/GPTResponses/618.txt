is known as the Bodhisattva Ideal, which emphasizes the importance of compassion and service to others as essential qualities on the path to enlightenment. Mahayana schools also recognize the concept of sunyata or emptiness, which teaches that all phenomena are empty of inherent existence and that ultimate reality is beyond concepts or dualities. Additionally, Mahayana schools place great emphasis on the role of the Buddha-nature, which posits that all beings have the potential to become a Buddha and attain enlightenment. Some Mahayana schools also recognize the concept of the Three Bodies of the Buddha (trikaya), which includes the physical body of the Buddha, the body of bliss, and the body of true nature.
