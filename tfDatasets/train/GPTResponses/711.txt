Retrotransposons can produce RNA molecules that can be reverse transcribed into DNA and integrated into the genome. The DNA copies of retrotransposons are called retroelements or retrogenes. These retrogenes can accumulate mutations over time and evolve into new genes with different functions. Hence, retrotransposons play an important role in shaping the genetic diversity and evolution of organisms.
