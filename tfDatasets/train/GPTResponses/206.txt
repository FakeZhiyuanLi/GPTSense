Colonization reduced the power of many groups in the Congo River Basin, including the local tribes and kingdoms that had traditionally controlled the region. The Belgian colonial government, which controlled the territory from the late 19th century until the mid-20th century, implemented policies that favored European settlers and powerful local elites who were loyal to the colonial administration. This often led to the exploitation and oppression of the indigenous population, as well as the marginalization of traditional power structures. Furthermore, European powers and companies, such as King Leopold II's Congo Free State and the Union Mini√®re du Haut-Katanga, gained significant economic and political influence in the region, further eroding the power of local groups.
