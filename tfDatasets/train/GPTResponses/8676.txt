Unicode was designed for a round-trip format conversion to and from various character encoding schemes, such as ASCII, ISO-8859, and other legacy encodings. This means that any text encoded in ASCII, ISO-8859 or other such schemes can be converted to Unicode, and vice versa, without losing any information or changing the meaning of the text. This enables universal compatibility across various platforms, languages, and scripts.
