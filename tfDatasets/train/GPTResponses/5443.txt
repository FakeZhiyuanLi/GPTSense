The Treaty of Versailles, signed on June 28, 1919, was supposed to stop Germany from having anti-aircraft weapons. The treaty imposed strict limits on Germany's military capabilities, including restrictions on the number and type of weapons they were allowed to possess. However, these restrictions were later ignored by Germany, leading to the rearmament and militarization of the country in the years leading up to World War II.
