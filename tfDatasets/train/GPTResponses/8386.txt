Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that regulates the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins in the body. Its primary function is to lower blood glucose levels by facilitating the uptake of glucose by cells to be used for energy or stored as glycogen in the liver and muscles.Leptin is a hormone produced by the fat cells that regulates appetite and energy expenditure. It signals to the brain when the body has sufficient fat stores and reduces appetite while increasing energy expenditure. It also plays a role in regulating body weight and metabolism.
