Copper and nickel are often combined to create alloys that have various properties for different applications. The most common alloy of copper and nickel is called Cupronickel, which contains 75% copper and 25% nickel, and is utilized in the manufacture of coins and jewelry.Other copper-nickel alloys include Monel (65% copper, 33% nickel) which is used in marine and chemical industries because of its resistance to corrosion, and Constantan (55% copper, 45% nickel) which is used in thermocouples for temperature measurement, due to its consistent temperature coefficient of resistance.Overall, copper-nickel alloys have excellent thermal and electrical conductivity, good corrosion resistance, and are easily machinable, which makes them useful in a range of industries, including electronics, plumbing, and automotive.
