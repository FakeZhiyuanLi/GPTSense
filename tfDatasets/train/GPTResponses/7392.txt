The amount of gain in crops that can be attributed to the application of composted yard waste can vary depending on several factors such as the quality of the compost, the type of crop, soil conditions, and climate. However, studies have shown that the application of composted yard waste can enhance soil health, increase water-holding capacity, and provide essential nutrients to plants, resulting in improved crop yields ranging from 10 to 30 percent.
