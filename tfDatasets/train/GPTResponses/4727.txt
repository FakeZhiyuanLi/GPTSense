Some mammals switched to a more carnivorous or omnivorous diet. For example, early humans evolved to eat more meat and animal products. Other mammals, such as horses, evolved to eat more grass and other tough plant materials. The specific diet shift depends on the species and their environmental and evolutionary factors.
