In France, the parliament has the power to oust the prime minister through a vote of no confidence. This requires a majority of the members of the National Assembly (lower house of parliament) to vote against the prime minister and his or her government. If a vote of no confidence is passed, the prime minister and the government must resign, and the president will then appoint a new prime minister.
