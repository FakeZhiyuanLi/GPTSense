Processing data from input and output devices is typically done by a computer. Specifically, the computer's central processing unit (CPU) is responsible for receiving and interpreting input data, executing instructions based on that input, and sending output data to the appropriate output device. Other components, such as memory and storage devices, also play a role in processing and managing data from input and output devices.
