The substance that is absorbed by wine when grapes are fermented with their skins is called tannins. Tannins are naturally occurring compounds found in the skins, seeds, and stems of grapes that are released during fermentation. They contribute to the color, texture, and flavor profile of the wine, and also provide some health benefits such as antioxidant properties.
