The national system of honours and awards in the United Kingdom was established by King George V in 1917. He created the Order of the British Empire to recognize the contributions of civilians and military personnel during World War I. Since then, the system has been expanded and updated to include a wide range of honours and awards for individuals who have made significant achievements in various fields. It is overseen by the Honours and Appointments Secretariat, part of the Cabinet Office in the UK government.
