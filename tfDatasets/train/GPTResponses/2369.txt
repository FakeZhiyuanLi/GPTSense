The number of base pairs of DNA in the human genome was first estimated by Dr. James Watson, co-discoverer of the structure of DNA, in 1968. He estimated the human genome to be around 3 billion base pairs. However, it wasn't until the completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003 that the exact number of base pairs was determined to be approximately 3.2 billion.
