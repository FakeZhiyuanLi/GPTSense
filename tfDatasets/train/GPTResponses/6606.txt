The design element that allowed the use of large clerestory windows is the invention of the flying buttress in Gothic architecture. The flying buttress allowed for greater height and weight in the walls, which in turn allowed for larger clerestory windows. The buttresses provided extra support and stability to the walls, which allowed for more open and expansive designs, such as cathedral and church designs. The invention of the flying buttress allowed for a greater implementation of light and air in the design of large Gothic churches and cathedrals.
