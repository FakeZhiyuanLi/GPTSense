Swamping of a gene pool can be caused by a variety of behaviors, including:1. Gene flow: When individuals from one population move and breed with individuals from another population, genes can be introduced into the new population, changing the gene pool.2. Immigration: When new individuals migrate into a population, new genes can be introduced, altering the gene pool.3. Interspecies hybridization: When individuals from two different species mate, there may be gene flow between the species, changing the gene pool of both.4. Artificial selection: When humans selectively breed animals or plants for desired traits, this can cause genetic changes in the population.5. Natural disasters: When a natural disaster occurs, such as a flood or hurricane, it can cause a population to be drastically reduced and change the gene pool of the survivors.
