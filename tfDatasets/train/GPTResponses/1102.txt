A BIOS ROM (Read-Only Memory) is a type of firmware that is built into a PC's motherboard, usually in the form of a chip. It contains the basic input/output system (BIOS) that controls the boot process of the computer and provides low-level control over hardware components such as the CPU, memory, and storage devices. The BIOS ROM is non-volatile, meaning its data is retained even when the power is turned off, and can only be modified through a process called "flashing" with a BIOS update.
