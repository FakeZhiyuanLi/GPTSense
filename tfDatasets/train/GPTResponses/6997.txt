When a vacuum is used to create a bulb, tungsten is evaporated from the filament and deposited on the inner surface of the glass envelope. The deposited tungsten forms a grayish-black coating on the inside of the bulb. This coating is important because it prevents the tungsten from escaping into the vacuum and helps to increase the lifespan of the bulb.
