Prior to the changes made in the Burmese government, the United States had imposed economic and political sanctions on Myanmar. The US government had considered the military junta that ruled Myanmar as illegitimate and had condemned its human rights abuses, including the detention of political prisoners and suppression of democratic opposition. The US had also restricted trade and investment with Myanmar, citing concerns about the Burmese government's military ties and involvement in drug trafficking.
