Historically, people who were burned on a pyre included criminals, witches, and those who were seen as heretics or enemies of the state. In some cultures, the bodies of deceased rulers or important figures were also burned on pyres as a form of funeral or burial ritual. Today, pyres are rarely used for body disposal, but are still used in some cultures for traditional cremation rituals.
