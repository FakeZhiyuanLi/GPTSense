Apatheia is a Greek word that means "freedom from passion" or "absence of emotion." It refers to a state of being unaffected by emotions, desires, or external circumstances. In philosophy, apatheia is often associated with Stoicism, which advocates detachment and indifference towards things that are beyond our control.
