individuals with poorly controlled asthma are more susceptible to asthma attacks, respiratory infections, hospitalizations, and even death. They may also experience reduced lung function, impaired physical activity, anxiety, and depression. Poor asthma control can also lead to frequent use of rescue medication, which can cause side effects and affect overall quality of life. Additionally, individuals with poorly controlled asthma may also have increased healthcare costs due to frequent medical appointments, medication use, and emergency room visits.
