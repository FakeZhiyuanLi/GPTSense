The main factor that divides the weather patterns in Europe into a wet north and dry south is the presence of the Alps mountain range. The Alps act as a barrier between northern and southern Europe, causing a significant climatic difference. The Alps cause moist oceanic air from the North Atlantic to be uplifted, resulting in high levels of precipitation and a relatively mild climate in the north. In contrast, the southern side of the Alps is in a rain shadow, causing dry, warm summers and relatively mild winters with little precipitation. As a result, the north of Europe, especially northern and western parts, including the British Isles, Scandinavia, and parts of western Germany, are generally wetter than southern European regions, such as Italy, Spain, and Greece.
