When an enhancer binds an activator protein, it causes the recruitment of transcription factors and RNA polymerase II to the promoter region of the gene. This promotes the initiation of transcription and enhances the rate of transcriptional initiation by RNA polymerase II. The activator protein can also enhance transcription by modifying the chromatin structure of the gene, making it more accessible to transcription factors and RNA polymerase II. Therefore, the binding of activator protein to the enhancer enhances the expression of the target gene.
