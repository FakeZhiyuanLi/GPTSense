Technikons in South Africa started being integrated with traditional universities in the early 2000s. In 2002, the South African government announced a plan to restructure the higher education system, which included the merging of some technikons with traditional universities. The process of integration was completed in 2005. Today, many former technikons are now part of large comprehensive universities, offering a wider range of academic programs and services to students.
