The Renaissance was a time of great intellectual and artistic growth in Europe, leading to widespread questioning of traditional beliefs and practices. This posed a challenge for the Dominican Order, which was deeply rooted in traditional Catholic doctrine and scholastic philosophy. As humanism and individualism became more popular, the Dominicans struggled to maintain their relevance and authority. Additionally, the Protestant Reformation erupted during this time, further dividing and challenging the Catholic Church and its various orders, including the Dominicans.
