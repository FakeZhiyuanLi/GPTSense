When an inductive circuit is opened, the voltage across the inductor will experience a sudden spike, causing the voltage to rapidly increase. This is known as an "inductive kick" or "back EMF" (electromotive force) and is caused by the sudden collapse of the magnetic field around the inductor. Depending on the size of the inductor and the amount of current flowing through it, this voltage spike can be quite large and can potentially damage components in the circuit. Therefore, it is important to use proper circuit protection, such as diodes or capacitors, to control the spike and protect the circuit.
