Some historians argue that Wallace's concept of natural selection was different from Darwin's in a few key ways. One difference is that Wallace emphasized the role of environmental pressures and selective pressures in shaping the evolution of species, while Darwin focused more on competition between species and individuals as a driving force. Another difference is that Wallace saw natural selection as a more gradual and nuanced process than Darwin did, and he placed more emphasis on factors like genetic variation and adaptation to specific ecological niches. Additionally, some historians argue that Wallace's ideas about natural selection were more explicitly influenced by spiritual and metaphysical beliefs than Darwin's were, which may have led him to a slightly different interpretation of the mechanisms driving evolution.
