The prototype for the Ferranti Mark 1 was called the Manchester Mark 1, and it was developed by a team of engineers and scientists at the University of Manchester in England. The Manchester Mark 1 was first demonstrated in June 1948 and was the forerunner to the Ferranti Mark 1, which was the first commercially available general-purpose computer.
