One bike route recommended by the City of New Haven is the Farmington Canal Heritage Trail, which runs for over 80 miles through Connecticut and Massachusetts. In New Haven, the trail runs from the Yale Divinity School to Hamden, with additional sections currently under construction. The trail provides a safe and scenic route for cyclists, with dedicated bike lanes and off-road paths.
