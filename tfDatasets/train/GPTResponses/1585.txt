Highways designed for high-speed travel such as freeways, expressways, and toll roads are the types of highways that let commuters get to cities fast. These highways typically have limited access points and no intersections, allowing for high-speed travel without interruptions. Additionally, these highways often have multiple lanes and may incorporate features such as carpool lanes or dedicated lanes for vehicles with higher occupancy, enabling faster travel times for commuters.
