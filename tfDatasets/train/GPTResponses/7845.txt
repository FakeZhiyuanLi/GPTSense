If the House of Commons is not in session, the assent of a bill may be notified to the House of Commons by the Royal Commission. The Royal Commission is a group of three senior government officials (the Lord Chancellor, the Speaker of the House of Commons, and the Lord Chief Justice) who act as the Queen's representative. The Royal Commission can deliver the bill to the Clerk of the House of Commons, who will then notify the House of Commons of the assent by reading a message from the Queen at the next sitting of the House of Commons.
