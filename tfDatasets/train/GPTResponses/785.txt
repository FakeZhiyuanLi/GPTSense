he called "the classical scheme of education." This classical scheme, which Whitehead believed dominated education at the time, focused on memorization and the acquisition of knowledge in a narrow range of subjects. Whitehead argued that education should instead be focused on developing students' creativity and critical thinking skills, and should be centered on their interests and passions. He believed that students should be encouraged to explore a wide range of subjects and disciplines, and that schools should provide opportunities for hands-on learning and real-world experience. Overall, Whitehead believed that education should be empowering, challenging, and meaningful to students, rather than simply focused on imparting information.
