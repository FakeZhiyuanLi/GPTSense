the music is telling you to do. While it may give you the notes to play or sing, it doesn't always convey the nuances of the performance, such as the dynamics, phrasing, articulation, or interpretation. It also doesn't tell you how to produce the sound from your instrument or voice, or how to coordinate with other musicians if you're playing in an ensemble. Therefore, it's important for musicians to develop their own musical intuition and expression, and to learn from teachers, mentors, and other performers who can give them feedback and guidance.
