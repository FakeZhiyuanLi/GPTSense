Organisms inherit their genes from their parents through the process of reproduction. In sexual reproduction, an organism receives half of its genes from its mother and half from its father. These genes are passed down through the sex cells or gametes (sperm and egg). The genes contain the instructions for the development and characteristics of the offspring. In asexual reproduction, organisms inherit their genes from a single parent through cell division, where the genetic material is replicated and passed down to the daughter cells.
