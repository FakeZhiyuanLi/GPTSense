Italians may speak their regional language at home with family members, in informal settings with friends, in local community events and festivals, and during religious ceremonies in their region. In some cases, regional languages may also be used in official documents and communications in specific autonomous regions, such as the Valle d'Aosta, Friuli Venezia Giulia, and Trentino-Alto Adige/SÃ¼dtirol.
