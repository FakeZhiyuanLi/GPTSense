Haredi and Chassidic communities tend to avoid socializing and interacting with non-orthodox populations in order to prevent assimilation and intermarriage. They often live in separate neighborhoods, attend separate schools, and have their own social events and organizations, in order to maintain their religious and cultural traditions.
