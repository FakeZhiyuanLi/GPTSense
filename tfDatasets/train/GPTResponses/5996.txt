During the short peacetime in Europe, Napoleon turned his focus towards consolidating his power in France and expanding the French Empire beyond Europe. He sought to strengthen the French economy, reform legal and educational systems, and create a more centralized government. He also set his sights on establishing French influence in Africa, India, and the Caribbean by expanding colonial territories and establishing new trade relationships. Additionally, Napoleon sought to maintain control over the European continent by forming alliances and influencing political affairs in neighboring countries.
