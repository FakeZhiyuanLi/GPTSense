is known as analog technology. These systems used a type of electromagnetic radiation, called radio waves, to transmit video and audio signals from a broadcasting station to a television set. The analog technology used in television systems allowed the transmission of television signals using amplitude modulation (AM) or frequency modulation (FM) techniques. However, this technology had some limitations, such as lower picture and sound quality, limited channel capacity, and susceptibility to interference and noise. Several countries have now switched to digital television broadcasting systems, which are based on digital technology and offer improved picture and sound quality, more channels, and enhanced features.
