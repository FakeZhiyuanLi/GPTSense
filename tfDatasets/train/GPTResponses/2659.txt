Products cannot use any technology or design that is covered by an existing patent if they want to avoid infringing on patent rights. This means that they must conduct a thorough patent search and analysis to determine whether any existing patents cover the technology or design that they are planning to incorporate into their products. Additionally, products cannot use any trademarks, copyrighted materials, or trade secrets without obtaining the appropriate legal clearances and permissions.
