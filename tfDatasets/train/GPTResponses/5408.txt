The book considered to be the source of many Orthodox beliefs regarding Mary is "The Protoevangelium of James," which is also known as "The Infancy Gospel of James" or "The Birth of Mary." This non-canonical gospel, believed to be written in the second century, provides a detailed account of Mary's birth, childhood, and early life, including her miraculous conception and her parents' names (Joachim and Anne). It also includes the story of the Annunciation and Mary's acceptance of God's will, the birth of Jesus, and the involvement of angels and other miraculous events. The Protoevangelium of James emphasizes Mary's perpetual virginity, her status as Theotokos (God-bearer), and her role as the mother of all Christians.
