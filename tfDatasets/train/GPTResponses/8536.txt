Some of the variables that locally compact groups share and can be studied by harmonic analysis include:1. Fourier transform: The Fourier transform is a fundamental tool in harmonic analysis that maps a function defined on a group into its Fourier coefficients. Locally compact groups have a well-defined Fourier theory, and understanding the behavior of functions under the Fourier transform can be insightful in studying the structure of the group.2. Convolution: Convolution is an important operation in harmonic analysis that combines functions defined on a group. Locally compact groups have a well-defined convolution and it can be used to study properties such as amenability, regularity, and group actions.3. Representations: Representations are homomorphisms from a group into the space of linear operators on a vector space. Locally compact groups have a rich theory of representations, and harmonic analysis can be used to study properties such as irreducibility, unitarity, and the spectrum of the Laplacian.4. Plancherel formula: The Plancherel formula is a result in harmonic analysis that relates the L^2-norm of a function to its Fourier coefficients. Locally compact groups have a version of the Plancherel formula that relates the L^2-norm of a function to the Plancherel measure, which is a measure on the space of irreducible unitary representations.5. Heat equation: The heat equation is a partial differential equation that describes the diffusion of heat in a medium. Locally compact groups have a well-defined heat equation that can be used to study properties such as the Laplacian on the group, the heat kernel, and the behavior of functions under heat flow.
