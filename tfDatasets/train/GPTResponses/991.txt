The French Revolution of 1789 is regarded as a landmark event in the development of modern nationalism. It brought about the idea of popular sovereignty and the nation-state, where citizenship and national identity were based on a shared language, culture, and history. The French Revolution also popularized the idea of democracy and individualism, which spread throughout Europe and the rest of the world, shaping the modern concept of nationalism.
