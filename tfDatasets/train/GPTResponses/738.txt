Meditation is the primary means of cultivating mindfulness. Mindfulness is the practice of being aware of the present moment, without judgment or distraction. It involves focusing on your breath, thoughts, emotions, and sensations in the body. Over time, the regular practice of meditation can help improve focus, reduce stress, enhance your emotional well-being, and increase your overall sense of peace and contentment.
