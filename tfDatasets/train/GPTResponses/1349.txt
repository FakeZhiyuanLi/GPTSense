The Catholic Church is governed by the Pope, who is considered the spiritual leader and head of the Church. He is assisted by the College of Cardinals, who advise him and participate in major decisions related to the Church. In addition, there are bishops, archbishops, and other clergy who oversee individual dioceses, parishes, and other Church institutions. The Church also has various administrative bodies and departments that manage its operations and finances.
