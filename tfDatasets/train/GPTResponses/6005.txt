There are different accounts of whom Alexander the Great asked for when he was dying. According to some sources, he called for his generals and asked them to honor his corpse and continue his legacy. Other reports suggest that he named his general and friend, Perdiccas, as his successor, but this is disputed. It is unclear who was present at his deathbed and whom he specifically asked for.
