A solar chimney is usually made of concrete or other durable materials and consists of a tall, vertical shaft with a wide base opening and a narrow top. The walls of the chimney are designed to absorb and retain solar radiation, warming the air that passes through the chimney. The warm air rises, creating a natural draft that can be used to ventilate buildings and generate electricity through the use of turbines. Some solar chimneys also incorporate air filters and other technologies to improve the efficiency and performance of the system.
