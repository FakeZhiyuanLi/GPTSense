The common practice period is known as the time period from the mid-17th century to the early 20th century, during which Western classical music was dominated by a set of shared musical practices and conventions. This period is also sometimes referred to as the tonal era, as it is characterized by the use of tonality as the basis for musical harmony and structure.
