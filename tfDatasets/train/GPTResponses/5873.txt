The women in the Muslim communities of the Eritrean Lowland dress modestly according to Islamic tradition, covering their heads and bodies. They wear long dresses or tunics called "jalabiya," which typically cover their arms and legs, and a headscarf called a "hijab" or "shash" that covers their hair and neck. Some women may also wear a veil that covers their face, called a "niqab." The style and color of clothing may vary depending on the specific ethnic group or region within the Lowland.
