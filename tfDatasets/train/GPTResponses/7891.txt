The first byte is the initial set of 8 bits in a data transmission or memory address. It is the first unit of data that is transmitted or stored. The value of the first byte often determines how the rest of the data is interpreted or used. For example, in a binary file, the first byte may indicate the file type, while in a network packet, the first byte may indicate the protocol used for communication.
