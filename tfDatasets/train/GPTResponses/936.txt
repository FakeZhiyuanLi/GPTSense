Yugoslavia started to break apart in the early 1990s, with the first republics declaring their independence in 1991. The breakup became more pronounced in 1992 when the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was formed, consisting of Serbia and Montenegro, and the remaining republics proclaimed their independence. The breakup lasted until 2006 when Montenegro split from Serbia and declared independence.
