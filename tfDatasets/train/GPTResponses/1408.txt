David Bradley's candy shop in Atlantic City, New Jersey was flooded during a major storm in 1883. When the flood waters receded, the only candy he had left in his shop was taffy that had been soaked in salt water. To his surprise, customers loved the new salty sweet taste of the taffy and began to demand it. Bradley then began to sell "salt water taffy" as a new and unique candy in his shop, which quickly became popular and spread throughout the boardwalk.
