The amount of hydroelectric power that can be generated depends on various factors such as:1. The volume and flow rate of water available2. The height of the water drop or head3. The size and number of turbines and generators installed4. The efficiency of the power plantOn average, a small-scale hydroelectric power plant (generating less than 10 MW) can generate anywhere from 100 kilowatts to 10 megawatts, while a large-scale hydroelectric power plant (generating more than 10 MW) can generate up to several hundred megawatts or even gigawatts.The largest hydroelectric power plant in the world is the Three Gorges Dam in China, which has a capacity of 22.5 gigawatts. In the US, the Grand Coulee Dam in Washington state is one of the largest hydroelectric power plants with a capacity of 6.8 gigawatts.
