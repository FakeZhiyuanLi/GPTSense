Adolescence is defined socially as the period of life beginning with the onset of puberty and ending with the transition to adulthood, typically marked by the teenage years. This period is characterized by significant changes in physical, cognitive, and emotional development, as well as social and cultural identity formation. From a social perspective, adolescents are often viewed as being in a transitional phase between childhood and adulthood, and are expected to begin taking on more responsibility and independence, while still being subject to the rules and expectations of parents, teachers, and society at large. Adolescence is also a time when individuals begin to build social relationships outside of their family, navigating peer groups and exploring their own interests and identities as they begin to develop a sense of their own place in the world.
