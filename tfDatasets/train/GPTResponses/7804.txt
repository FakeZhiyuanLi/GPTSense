The type of chanting that is performed without metrical timing is called free chanting or non-metrical chanting. This type of chanting is characterized by a lack of a specific rhythmic pattern and instead is guided by the natural flow of the voice and the intention of the individual or group performing it. Free chanting is often used in spiritual or meditative practices where the focus is on the words, sounds, and emotions being expressed rather than adhering to a specific beat or tempo.
