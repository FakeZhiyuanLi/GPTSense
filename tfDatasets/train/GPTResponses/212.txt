Water towers and elevated tanks were built on many of the city's buildings to prevent high water pressures at lower elevations. These structures allow for water to be stored at higher elevations, which creates a gravity-driven flow of water throughout the building or the city's water supply system. By controlling the pressure of the water, the risk of burst pipes and other water-related damages is significantly reduced.
