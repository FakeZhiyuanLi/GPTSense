Theophrastus did not have ideas about fossils as he lived during the 4th century BC, long before the study of fossils began. Moreover, the concept of fossils as the preserved remains of ancient organisms did not become widely accepted until the 18th century. Therefore, Theophrastus could not have been proven false regarding his ideas about fossils.
