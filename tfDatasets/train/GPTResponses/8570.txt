Instructions are embedded in OpenType and TrueType font files, in the form of TrueType instructions or OpenType tables, typically located in the 'glyf' table. These instructions provide guidelines for the font renderer on how to adjust glyph shapes and spacing to output certain sequences of characters, such as ligatures or diacritics. The instructions are written in a specific code language known as the TrueType Instruction Set, which is compiled into machine-readable bytecode.
