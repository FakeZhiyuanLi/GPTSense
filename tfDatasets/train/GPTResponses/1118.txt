Homeostasis is the ability of an organism to maintain stable internal conditions despite changes in the external environment. It involves a complex set of physiological and regulatory mechanisms that work together to ensure that the body functions within a narrow range of parameters, including temperature, pH, and nutrient levels, among others. Examples of homeostatic processes in humans include maintaining blood glucose levels, regulating body temperature, and adjusting breathing and heart rate in response to changing conditions.
