When using shorter runway lengths, aircraft need to:1. Reduce weight: The maximum weight of the aircraft must be reduced to ensure that it is within the limits of the runway length available.2. Increase thrust: The aircraft's engine thrust should be increased to provide sufficient power to take off and climb quickly within the shorter runway length.3. Increase takeoff speed: The aircraft should take off at a higher speed to reach the required lift sooner.4. Use flaps and slats: The aircraft's flaps and slats should be extended to increase lift and reduce the takeoff distance.5. Apply brakes after landing: The pilot should apply brakes immediately after landing to reduce the ground roll and ensure that the aircraft can come to a complete stop within the available runway length.6. Deploy spoilers: The aircraft's spoilers should be deployed to reduce the lift and increase the stopping power during landing.
