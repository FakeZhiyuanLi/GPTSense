is conventionally called a self or an inherent existence. This means that there is no fixed or permanent essence or identity that can be attributed to a sentient being. Rather, our sense of self is a construct of our perceptions, thoughts, and experiences, and is constantly changing and evolving. This view is central to the Buddhist concept of emptiness, which emphasizes the impermanence and interdependence of all phenomena.
