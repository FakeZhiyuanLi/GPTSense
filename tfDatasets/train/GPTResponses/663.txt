The parliamentary model that other systems have been based on is the Westminster model, which is the system of governance used in the United Kingdom. It has influenced many other democracies such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada, India and many Commonwealth countries. It is characterized by a parliament that is elected by the people, a government formed by the political party or coalition that has the most seats in parliament, and a system of checks and balances between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government.
