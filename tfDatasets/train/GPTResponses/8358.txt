After radioactivity was realized, further scientific investigations were conducted to understand its properties and potential applications. Marie and Pierre Curie discovered two new radioactive elements, polonium and radium, and made significant contributions to the understanding of radioactivity. Other scientists also made significant discoveries related to radioactivity, such as the discovery of isotopes by Frederick Soddy. Radioactivity was also recognized as having potential applications in fields such as medicine, energy, and weaponry. However, the harmful effects of radioactivity on living organisms were also realized, leading to safety measures being implemented for workers in radioactive environments and for the disposal of radioactive waste.
