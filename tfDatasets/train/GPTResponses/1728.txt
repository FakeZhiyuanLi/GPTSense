is known as a passive third-party. This means that while they may have been contacted or offered something of value by the person committing the influence peddling crime, they did not actively participate or seek out the offer. In these cases, the passive third-party may not be charged with a crime, but they may be required to testify as a witness in the trial of the person committing the crime. However, if the passive third-party was aware of the wrongdoing and did nothing to report it, they may be considered complicit in the crime and can face legal consequences.
