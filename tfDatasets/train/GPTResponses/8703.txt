There were several languages that strongly influenced Czech:1. Old Church Slavonic: This is an ancient Slavic language that was used for liturgical purposes and had a significant impact on Czech vocabulary and grammar.2. German: Due to the close proximity of Czech lands to German-speaking territories, German had a significant impact on Czech vocabulary, especially in fields such as science, technology, and industry.3. Latin: Latin was the language of education and scholarship during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, and Czech scholars heavily borrowed from Latin vocabulary and grammar.4. French: French had a great influence on Czech literature and culture during the 19th century, when many Czech writers translated and adapted French works.5. English: In recent years, English has become increasingly influential on Czech, especially in the fields of business, technology, and media.
