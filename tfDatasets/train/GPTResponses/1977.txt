All genes contain a sequence of DNA that codes for a specific protein or RNA molecule, which is required for their expression. Additionally, genes require regulatory sequences, such as promoters and enhancers, that control when and where the gene is expressed. These sequences are recognized by transcription factors and other proteins that bind to the DNA and initiate transcription of the gene into RNA. Other elements, such as splicing sites and translation initiation codons, are also required for proper gene expression.
