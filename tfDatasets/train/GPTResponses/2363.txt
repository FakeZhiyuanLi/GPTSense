Orphan genes are genes that lack homologs in other genomes and appear to have arisen de novo, usually through gene duplication or transposable element-mediated mechanisms. The structure of orphan genes may vary greatly, but in general, they tend to have shorter coding sequences, fewer exons, and simpler regulatory regions compared to most eukaryotic genes. This is because they have not had time to evolve complex regulatory elements and are not subject to the same constraints as essential genes. Additionally, orphan genes may have less conserved protein domains and motifs and may evolve more rapidly than other genes. Overall, the structure of orphan genes is a reflection of their unique evolutionary history and origin.
