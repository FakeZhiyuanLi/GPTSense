In a synchronous motor, current is typically brought to the rotor through a set of slip rings and brushes. The slip rings are mounted on the rotor shaft and are connected to copper conductors (windings) that are wound around the rotor core. The brushes are mounted on the motor frame and serve to make contact with the slip rings.As the rotor rotates, the slip rings and brushes allow an electrical connection to be made between the rotating rotor windings and the stationary power supply, which provides the current needed to produce the magnetic field and allow the motor to operate synchronously with the AC power grid. The slip rings and brushes are designed to handle the high currents and voltages that are generated in the motor, and to maintain a reliable connection between the rotor windings and the power supply over long periods of operation.
