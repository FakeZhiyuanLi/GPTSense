The forced resettlement in Tajikistan took place during the Soviet era when the government attempted to increase agricultural production by forcing rural communities to relocate to larger collective farms. These collective farms were established to pool resources and labor for greater efficiency in farming. The government hoped that by consolidating small, scattered farms into larger ones, it would be easier to provide resources like tractors, fertilizers, and irrigation systems. This resulted in the forced relocation of thousands of people across Tajikistan, which caused significant disruption to communities, social fabrics, and traditional ways of life. Additionally, the Soviet government also implemented a policy of Russification, in which Russian-speaking communities were encouraged to settle in Central Asia, including Tajikistan, further contributing to the displacement of local populations.
