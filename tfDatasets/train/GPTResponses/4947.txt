During actual takeoff and landing, all electronic devices must be turned off and stowed properly in the overhead bin, under the seat in front of you, or in a designated storage area. This is because electronic devices can interfere with the plane's navigational and communication systems during critical phases of flight. It is important to follow the instructions of the flight crew and ensure all devices are turned off and stowed away before takeoff and landing.
