An example of passive solar design is having large windows on the south-facing side of a building to allow for maximum sunlight and heat during the winter months, while using shading devices such as overhangs or trees to block the sun during the summer months to prevent overheating. Another example is having thermal mass materials, such as concrete or brick, incorporated into the design to absorb and store heat during the day and release it at night.
