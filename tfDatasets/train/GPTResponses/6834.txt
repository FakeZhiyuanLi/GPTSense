The gas in a light bulb, typically argon or nitrogen, helps reduce the evaporation of the filament and slows down its decay, thereby increasing the lifespan of the bulb. It also helps to conduct electricity and improves the efficiency of the bulb. Additionally, the gas can affect the color and quality of the light produced by the bulb.
