Farmers and agricultural producers have the ability to make the choice of using less harmful pesticides. They can choose to use integrated pest management techniques, crop rotation, and biological controls, among other methods. Farmers and producers can also consult with agricultural experts and extension services to learn about alternative pest control methods and best practices for reducing pesticide use. Additionally, consumers can also play a role in encouraging the use of less harmful pesticides by choosing to buy products that are produced using sustainable and eco-friendly practices.
