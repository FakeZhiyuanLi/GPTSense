The Physician Financial Transparency Report, also known as the Open Payments Program, is part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and requires pharmaceutical and medical device companies to report their financial relationships with healthcare providers, including physicians and teaching hospitals. The report is intended to improve transparency and hold healthcare providers accountable for disclosing any financial relationships they may have with companies that provide products or services to patients. The Open Payments Program is managed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and includes information on payments made to healthcare providers for research, royalties, speaking fees, consulting fees, and other expenses.
