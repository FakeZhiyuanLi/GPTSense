One outgrowth of Smyth's movement was the development of the Baptist denomination, which emphasizes individualized, voluntary baptism and the separation of church and state. Another outgrowth was the growth of Congregationalism, which stresses the autonomy of each local congregation in congregational decision-making. Additionally, Smyth's ideas also helped to inspire the Christian revival movement, which had a significant impact on colonial North America.
