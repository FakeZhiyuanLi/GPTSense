Oklahoma's border was determined through several events and agreements over time. Here are some key events:- The Louisiana Purchase in 1803 transferred the territory that includes present-day Oklahoma from France to the United States- The Adams-On√≠s Treaty of 1819 between the United States and Spain established the Red River as the boundary between the two nations, which roughly corresponds to the southern border of Oklahoma- The Indian Removal Act of 1830 forced many Native American tribes to move from their ancestral lands in the southeastern US to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma)- The Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 organized the remaining Indian Territory as part of the US federal government's effort to open up more land for settlement and development- The Organic Act of 1890 created the Oklahoma Territory within Indian Territory, and the border between Oklahoma and the remaining Indian Territory was established along the 100th meridian. This border was later used as the dividing line between Oklahoma and Texas as well.So, there wasn't one single moment or event that determined Oklahoma's border, but rather a series of historical and political developments over time.
