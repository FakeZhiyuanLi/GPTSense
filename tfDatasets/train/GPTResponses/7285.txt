When John Knox returned to Scotland after studying under Calvin, he became a prominent leader of the Scottish Reformation. He began preaching against the Catholic Church and its practices, and his sermons and writings contributed to a growing movement of Protestantism in Scotland. Knox also helped to establish the Presbyterian system of church governance in Scotland, which emphasized the equality of all members of the congregation and the importance of local church leadership. He played a major role in the adoption of the Scots Confession, which articulated the beliefs of the Scottish Reformation.
