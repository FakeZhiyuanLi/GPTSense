Townhouses, condominiums, and apartment buildings can be found in both metropolitan areas and outside the city depending on the location and development plans. However, they are usually more prevalent in the metropolitan area due to the higher population density and demand for housing. In urban areas, developers often build high-rise apartment buildings, while in suburban areas, townhouses and condominiums are more common.
