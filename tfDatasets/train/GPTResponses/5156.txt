Ptolemy did not suggest that a southern land mass would preserve anything. He was an ancient Greek astronomer and geographer who lived from c. 90-168 AD. He is best known for his work on astronomy and geography, including his influential book Geographia, which presented a comprehensive study of the world's geography and included maps and descriptions of various regions. However, Ptolemy did not speculate about the existence of a southern continent or land mass, which was not officially discovered until the 17th century.
