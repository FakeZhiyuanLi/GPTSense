When exposed to air, uranium metal can form a layer of uranium oxide on its surface. This oxide layer can provide a protective barrier against further reaction with air or moisture. However, over time, the oxide layer can become thick and brittle, which can lead to cracking and further exposure of the uranium metal to air.
