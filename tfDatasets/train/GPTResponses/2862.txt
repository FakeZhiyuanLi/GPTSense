The typical definition of a gene categorizes genes by their function, which is to code and control the production of proteins in the body. Genes are the basic units of heredity and are responsible for passing on traits from parents to offspring. They are made up of sequences of DNA that determine the sequence of amino acids in a protein. Depending on their function, genes can be categorized as structural genes, regulatory genes, or genes that code for RNA molecules.
