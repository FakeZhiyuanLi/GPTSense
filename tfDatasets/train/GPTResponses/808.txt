The term "prime minister" was first used in its modern sense in Britain, and it was initially used in a negative manner to describe Sir Robert Walpole, who served as the first prime minister of Britain from 1721 to 1742. Walpole was criticized for his exercise of power and alleged corruption, and his opponents derided him by calling him the "prime minister" or "first servant" of the king, implying that he was subservient to the monarch and had too much influence over the government.
