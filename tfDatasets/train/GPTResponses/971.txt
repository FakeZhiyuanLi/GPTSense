There is no clear record of Britain attempting to purchase Somali lands from Ethiopia. However, in the late 19th and early 20th century, Britain had territorial interests in Somalia and neighboring Ethiopia. In 1884, Britain declared a protectorate over Somaliland, which included most of present-day Somalia, while Ethiopia managed to remain independent despite attempts by European powers to carve up the country. It is possible that Britain may have had discussions or negotiations with Ethiopia regarding territorial claims in the region, but there is no specific record of a purchase attempt.
