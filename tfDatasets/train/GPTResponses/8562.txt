The concept that relates measurements of time and velocity of two observers in motion relative to each other is known as time dilation and length contraction, which are the consequences of the theory of relativity. According to the theory of relativity, time and space are not absolute and are relative to the observer's frame of reference. As a result, measurements of velocity and time may differ depending on the observer's frame of reference. This phenomenon is important in the fields of astrophysics, space exploration, and particle physics.
