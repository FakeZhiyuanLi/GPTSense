There are several ways to block a network attack from a single IP address:1. Firewall: A firewall can be used to block traffic from a specific IP address or range of IP addresses.2. Intrusion Prevention System (IPS): An IPS can detect and prevent network attacks from a single IP address by monitoring network traffic and blocking any suspicious activity.3. Blacklist: A blacklist can be created to block traffic from a specific IP address or range of IP addresses. This can be done by using a third-party service or by configuring the network infrastructure to block traffic from the specified IP address.4. Routing: Network routers can be configured to block traffic from a specific IP address or range of IP addresses. This can be done by setting up an access control list (ACL) or by using other routing mechanisms.5. Denial of Service (DoS) protection: DoS protection mechanisms can be set up to detect and block network attacks from a specific IP address. This can be done by using rate limiters or other techniques that limit the amount of traffic that can be sent from a specific IP address.
