The writings of the ancient Persian prophet Zoroaster (also known as Zarathustra) led to the clerical belief in the divinity of light. Zoroaster's teachings emphasized the dualistic nature of existence, with good and evil forces in conflict. He taught that Ahura Mazda, the god of light, was the ultimate creator and source of all that is good, and that the forces of darkness and chaos were opposed to him. This belief in the power and purity of light came to be a central tenet of the Zoroastrian religion, and influenced the development of many other belief systems in the centuries that followed.
