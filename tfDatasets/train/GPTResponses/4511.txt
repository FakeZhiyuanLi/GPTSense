Old English strong verbs expressed the past tense by changing the vowel within the stem of the word. This process is called ablaut or vowel gradation. The past tense form of the verb was formed by changing the vowel within the root or stem of the verb. For example, the verb "sing" in Old English was "singen." The past tense form of this verb was "sang," in which the vowel in the stem was changed from "e" to "a." Similarly, the verb "give" in Old English was "giefan." The past tense form of this verb was "geaf," in which the vowel in the stem was changed from "ie" to "ea." This process of changing the vowel within the root of the verb was used to express the past tense in Old English strong verbs.
