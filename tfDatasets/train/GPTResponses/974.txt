Some alleles can give rise to different variations of traits or characteristics in an individual. For example, an allele for eye color can give rise to brown eyes, blue eyes, or green eyes depending on the specific allele present. Similarly, an allele for blood type can give rise to type A, type B, type AB, or type O blood. Different alleles can also determine traits such as height, skin color, hair texture, and susceptibility to certain diseases.
