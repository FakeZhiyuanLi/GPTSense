The NBA plays on professional-grade basketball courts made of hardwood, typically maple wood. These courts are specially designed and fabricated to meet the NBA's standards for size, shape, color, and texture. The court measures 94 feet long and 50 feet wide, with a hoop located 10 feet off the ground at each end of the court. The paint lines, logos, and other graphics on the court are also carefully crafted to ensure safety and visibility for players and officials.
