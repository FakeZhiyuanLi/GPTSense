Mesopotamian astronomical periods are still used in various fields such as astronomy, astrology, and archaeology. In astronomy, the Babylonian calendar, which is based on the 29.5-day lunar cycle, is still used in some parts of the world. Ancient Mesopotamian constellations, such as the ones that appear on the MUL.APIN tablet, are also still recognized and used by modern astronomers. In astrology, Mesopotamian planetary deities and their associated constellations are still used to interpret horoscopes. In archaeology, knowledge of Mesopotamian astronomical periods has helped researchers understand how ancient civilizations observed and recorded celestial events.
