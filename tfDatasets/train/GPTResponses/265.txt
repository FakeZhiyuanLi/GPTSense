The BBC's broadcast range originally reached approximately 30 miles from its studio. However, this range gradually increased with the development of more powerful transmitters and the establishment of new stations. Today, the BBC's broadcast range covers almost the entire United Kingdom and can be received in many parts of the world through various digital platforms.
