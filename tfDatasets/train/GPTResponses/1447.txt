The Hamidian massacres of Armenians were a series of massacres and pogroms conducted by Ottoman Empire authorities, with the approval of Sultan Abdulhamid II, against the Armenian population of the empire between 1894 and 1896. The main cause of the massacres was the growing nationalistic sentiment among the Armenians, which was seen as a threat to the Ottoman Empire's unity and sovereignty. The Ottoman authorities used the Armenians as a scapegoat for the empire's economic and political troubles and initiated a campaign of violence and repression against them. The massacres resulted in the deaths of an estimated 100,000 to 300,000 Armenians and forced many others to flee the country.
