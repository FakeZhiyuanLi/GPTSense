Video-conferencing allows multiple parties to communicate with each other by providing a virtual platform that connects them through live video and audio streams. The participants can see and hear each other in real-time, enabling them to interact and collaborate as if they were in the same physical conference room. Video-conferencing systems are designed to handle multiple feeds and display multiple participants on the screen simultaneously, allowing participants to engage in group discussions, presentations, and other collaborative activities. Most video-conferencing platforms also provide additional features such as chat, screen sharing, and file sharing, which further enhance the ability of the participants to communicate and collaborate with each other.
