The protein-coding sequence, also known as the coding region or codon region, comprises only a small part of the overall structure of a gene. It typically makes up less than 5% of the total DNA sequence of a gene. The remainder of the gene may contain regulatory regions, introns, and other non-coding sequences that play important roles in gene expression and function.
