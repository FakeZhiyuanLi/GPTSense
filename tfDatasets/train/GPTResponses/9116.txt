A common complication of chronic asthma is respiratory failure, which occurs when the lungs are unable to provide enough oxygen to the body or remove carbon dioxide efficiently. Asthma can also lead to bronchitis, pneumonia, and other respiratory infections. Long-term inflammation and damage to the airways can also result in structural changes, such as scarring and narrowing of the airways, which can further exacerbate breathing difficulties. Additionally, chronic asthma can increase the risk of developing other conditions, such as heart disease and depression, due to the strain it places on the body.
