One historic theory of the szlachta origins is that they were originally a warrior caste in medieval Poland, serving as horsemen in the armies of early Polish kings. This theory suggests that the szlachta descended from the Sarmatians, an ancient Iranian people who migrated into Eastern Europe around 200 BCE. According to this theory, the Sarmatians intermarried with local Slavic tribes and their descendants became the szlachta. However, this theory has been heavily debated and is not universally accepted by historians.
