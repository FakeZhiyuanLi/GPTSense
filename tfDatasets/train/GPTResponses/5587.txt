The expulsions from France occurred at different times throughout history. Some of the most significant expulsions were:- In 1306, King Philip IV of France expelled all Jews from the kingdom.- In 1685, King Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes, which had previously granted religious freedom to Protestants. The revocation led to the expulsion of thousands of Huguenots from France.- During World War II, the Vichy government in France collaborated with the Nazis and deported tens of thousands of Jews and other minorities to concentration camps.Therefore, it is not accurate to refer to a single year for the expulsions from France.
