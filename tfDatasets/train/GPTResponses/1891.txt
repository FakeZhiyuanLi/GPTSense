Executive Order 13526 aimed to enhance national security by improving the classification and declassification processes for national security information. It established a uniform system for classifying, safeguarding, and declassifying national security information, and it also aimed to reduce over-classification and promote transparency and accountability in the government's classification system. The order also directed agencies to regularly review and update their classification and declassification policies and procedures to ensure they were consistent with national security and public interests.
