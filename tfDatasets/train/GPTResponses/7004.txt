The idea that cells could be grown in vitro (in a laboratory dish) was first introduced by Ross Harrison in 1907. Harrison was an American biologist who succeeded in growing nerve fibers from a frog embryo in a dish for the first time. This breakthrough opened up the possibility for researchers to study and experiment on living cells outside of a living organism, leading to significant advances in the fields of cell biology and medicine.
