One of the issues with setting a single HDTV standard was the disagreement among technology companies, broadcasters, and governments over which standard to adopt. In particular, there were debates over whether to adopt the American-made Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) or the European-based Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) standard. This led to a delay in the adoption of HDTV in some countries and incompatibility issues between different regions. Additionally, the high cost of upgrading broadcast infrastructure to support HDTV also slowed the process.
