The original purpose of pancake motors was to have a compact and flat motor design that could produce high torque and power in a small package. This design was particularly useful for industrial and manufacturing applications where space was limited, such as in robotics, medical equipment, and automation systems. Pancake motors are also used in various consumer products like electric razors, power tools, and compact household appliances.
