Christianity was not widely adopted in Tibet, which is predominantly a Buddhist country. However, there were a few instances where Tibetan monarchs showed interest in Christianity as a means of expanding their influence and consolidating their power.In the 17th century, the fifth Dalai Lama welcomed Jesuit missionaries and allowed them to establish a mission in Tibet. The Jesuits provided Western education, medicine, and technology to the Tibetan elites, but their efforts were met with resistance from the Buddhist monastic authorities who viewed Christianity as a threat to their authority and teachings.In the 18th century, the Dzungar Khanate, a Mongolian nomadic tribe, invaded Tibet and brought with them a form of Christianity known as Nestorianism. The Dzungar Khanate imposed their religion on the Tibetans and destroyed many Buddhist monasteries. However, their reign was short-lived as the Qing dynasty intervened and expelled the Dzungars from Tibet.In the 20th century, a few Tibetan nobles like the Regent Reting Rinpoche and the aristocrat Tulku Tsultrim Nyima converted to Catholicism, but their conversions were not widely accepted by the Tibetan people or the Dalai Lama. Overall, Christian influence in Tibet has been minimal, with Tibetan Buddhism remaining the dominant religion.
