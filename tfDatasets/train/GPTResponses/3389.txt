During Dante's time, the Florentine Tuscan language was primarily used by the upper classes, including the nobility, wealthy merchants, and educated professionals such as doctors and lawyers. It was also used by writers and poets, who sought to elevate the language and create a literary tradition in Tuscan dialect. However, over time the language became more widespread and by the 14th century, it was the common language of Florence and surrounding areas.
