The theory of Social Darwinism justifies imperialism in part. Social Darwinism is the idea that certain races or nationalities are superior to others and that the stronger races have a natural right to dominate the weaker ones. This theory was used by imperial powers to justify their conquest and annexation of territories around the world, arguing that they were bringing civilization and progress to the inferior people they subjugated. This idea was especially prevalent during the late 19th and early 20th centuries when European nations were competing for colonies and territories across the globe.
