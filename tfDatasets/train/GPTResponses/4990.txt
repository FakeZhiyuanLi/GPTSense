These are all examples of human activities that have negative impacts on the natural environment and its biodiversity. Habitat destruction refers to the alteration or destruction of a natural habitat, which can result from activities such as infrastructure development, deforestation, and urbanization. Invasive species are non-native species that are introduced into an ecosystem and can outcompete or prey upon native species, disrupting the natural balance. Pollution refers to the release of harmful substances into the environment, such as chemicals, plastics, and greenhouse gases, which can harm wildlife and ecosystems. Human over-population occurs when there are too many people for an area to support, putting pressure on natural resources and leading to conflicts over land and water. Finally, over-harvesting refers to the unsustainable harvesting of natural resources, such as fishing, hunting, and logging, which can deplete populations and damage ecosystems.
