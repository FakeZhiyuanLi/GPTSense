There were a few factors that contributed to the early aircraft carriers being made up of conversions of ships that were previously cargo ships, cruisers or battlecruisers.Firstly, at the time when the first aircraft carriers were developed, there was no established design or specification for an aircraft carrier. The concept of using ships to launch and recover aircraft was still new and experimental. Therefore, existing ships were adapted and modified to suit this new role, as it was much quicker and more cost-effective than building new ships from scratch.Secondly, there was a shortage of funds and materials during the early years of aviation and naval development. New construction projects were often delayed or cancelled due to budget constraints and the need to focus resources on other areas of military development. Converting existing ships was a way to create aircraft carriers without the need for significant additional investment.Finally, the potential benefits of aircraft carriers were not yet fully understood, and their effectiveness in combat was still largely untested. Using existing ships as carriers allowed naval commanders to experiment with the concept of airpower at sea without making a major investment in new ships specifically designed for this purpose.
