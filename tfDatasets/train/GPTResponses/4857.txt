Infrared radiation has a short wavelength and low energy compared to other forms of radiation, such as X-rays and gamma rays. As a result, it does not penetrate walls and other obstacles well and is easily absorbed by materials. Therefore, devices emitting or receiving infrared signals, such as remote controls and sensors, are typically designed to work only within the same room or nearby area, and do not cause interference with devices in adjacent rooms.
