No, there are no mental health professionals who have programs to change sexual orientation. It is important to understand that sexual orientation is not a choice and cannot be changed. The American Psychological Association, along with numerous other professional organizations, has publicly stated that efforts to change sexual orientation are unethical and can cause harm to the individual. Instead, mental health professionals focus on supporting individuals in accepting and affirming their sexual orientation or gender identity.
