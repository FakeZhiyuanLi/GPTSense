It is not possible for me to know which specific funding organization utilizes the IUCN's classification of direct threats as there could be multiple organizations that refer to this classification. The IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) is a leading organization in the field of conservation, and its classification of direct threats is widely recognized and used by governmental and non-governmental organizations, as well as funding organizations, for identifying and addressing threats to biodiversity.
