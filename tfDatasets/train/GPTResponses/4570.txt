Copper is primarily extracted from two types of mines:1. Open-pit mines: These are typically large-scale operations where copper ore deposits are located close to the surface. The rock and soil overlying the copper ore are removed, and the ore is extracted using drilling, blasting, and excavation techniques.2. Underground mines: These are more complex and expensive to operate than open-pit mines. Underground mines are necessary when copper ore deposits are located deeper underground. The ore is extracted using a combination of drilling, blasting, and tunneling techniques. Underground mining may require the use of shafts or tunnels to access the ore deposits, which can be expensive and time-consuming.
