As an Islamic revivalist, Maududi wanted to change the hearts and minds of individuals by emphasizing the importance of Tawhid (the oneness of God), promoting the Islamic way of life, and exhorting people to follow the Quran and the Sunnah (the teachings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad). He believed in the power of education, preaching, and social and political activism to bring about a transformation in the minds and attitudes of people towards Islam. Maududi also emphasized the need for Muslims to take an active role in society, and to work towards establishing an Islamic state based on Islamic principles. His writings and speeches inspired a generation of Muslims to become more committed to their faith, and to take an active role in promoting Islamic values in their communities.
