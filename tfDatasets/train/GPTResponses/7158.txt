Edison's lamp, also known as the incandescent light bulb, became economically viable for power distribution due to several factors.1. Improved Material: Edison used carbonized bamboo filament in his bulb which lasted longer and was less expensive than previous materials used in other lamps.2. Standardization: Edison also standardized the bulb size, shape, and base, which made it easier to manufacture, install and replace.3. Power Plants: With the establishment of power plants, it became possible to generate and distribute electricity economically.4. Utility Companies: Utility companies were established to provide electricity to consumers on a large scale, making it more cost-effective for households and businesses to buy electricity.Overall, the combination of improved technology, standardized design, and utility companies allowed people to use Edison's lamp and electricity more easily and economically, making power distribution viable.
