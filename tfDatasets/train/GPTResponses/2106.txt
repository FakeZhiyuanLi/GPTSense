One example of horizontal gene transfer in eukaryotes is the transfer of chloroplast DNA from algae to plants, which occurred through endosymbiosis. This process involves one organism living inside the other and eventually becoming an integrated part of each other's genomes. As a result, plants inherited some of the genetic material from their algal ancestors, including genes involved in photosynthesis.
