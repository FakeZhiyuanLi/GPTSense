The other British states and colonies gradually adopted January 1 as the start of the new year during the 18th and 19th centuries, following the lead of England. However, some countries like Scotland continued to celebrate New Year's Day on January 1 and January 12 (known as "Old New Year" or "Daft Days") until the 20th century.
