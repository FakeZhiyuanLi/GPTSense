The process during brewing in which sugar is metabolized into alcohol is called fermentation. This process is typically carried out by adding yeast to a mixture of sugar and water, known as wort. The yeast consumes the sugar, producing alcohol and carbon dioxide as byproducts. This process continues until most of the sugar has been consumed or the alcohol concentration becomes too high for the yeast to continue metabolizing sugar.
