The capacitor on the second winding of a squirrel cage motor is used to provide a phase-shifted voltage that creates a rotating magnetic field within the motor. This phase shift allows the motor to produce torque and rotation even when there is no external force acting on the rotor. Essentially, the capacitor helps to start and run the motor by providing an additional boost of energy to the second winding. This is commonly known as a capacitor start/capacitor run motor.
