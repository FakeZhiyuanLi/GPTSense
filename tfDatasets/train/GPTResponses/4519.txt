Theorist Erik Erikson argued that not everyone fully achieves identity. He proposed that achieving a sense of identity is a crucial developmental task during adolescence, but that individuals may struggle with identity formation throughout their lives. In his theory of psychosocial development, Erikson described identity as an ongoing process of introspection, exploration, and commitment. He suggested that individuals who do not successfully navigate this process may experience feelings of confusion, isolation, and despair.
