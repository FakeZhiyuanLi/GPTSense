Textiles were particularly popular during the Song Dynasty (960-1279) in China. This period is often referred to as the "Golden Age" of Chinese textile production, as it saw the development of new techniques, designs, and materials for weaving silk and other fabrics. These textiles were highly prized for their intricate patterns, luxurious feel, and exquisite craftsmanship, and were exported to other parts of Asia, the Middle East, and Europe.
