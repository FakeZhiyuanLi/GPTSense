The mRNA matches the sequence of the gene's DNA coding strand because it is transcribed from the DNA coding strand during the process of transcription. The DNA coding strand serves as a template for the synthesis of mRNA, and the base pairs of the mRNA molecule are complementary to the base pairs of the DNA coding strand. This ensures that the information encoded in the DNA is accurately transferred to the mRNA, which can then be translated into a protein sequence. Therefore, the mRNA sequence reflects the sequence of the DNA coding strand.
