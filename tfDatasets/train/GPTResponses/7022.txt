Halogen bulbs decrease darkening over time due to a process called the halogen cycle. When the bulb is lit, halogen gas is released which reacts with the tungsten filament in the bulb, causing the filament to evaporate and deposit a coating on the inside of the bulb. This coating reduces the amount of light output and leads to the darkening of the bulb over time.However, the halogen cycle allows the halogen gas to redeposit the tungsten back onto the filament, preventing the coating from building up and reducing darkening over time. This process also allows the bulb to reach higher temperatures, resulting in better and brighter light output. Additionally, halogen bulbs operate at higher pressures, keeping the bulb clean and reducing the buildup of particles on the bulb's surface.
