Sports were introduced in Bermuda during the 1800s, primarily through British influence. Cricket and football (soccer) were the first sports to be established, with the establishment of the Bermuda Cricket Club in 1844 and the first football club, the St. George's Cricket Club, in the 1880s. Other sports, such as rugby, tennis, golf, and swimming, were introduced later by visiting British naval vessels and expatriate residents. Today, sports are an integral part of Bermudian culture, with the island's diverse landscape providing opportunities for a wide range of activities, including water sports, equestrian, and track and field.
