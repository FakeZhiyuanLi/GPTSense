Dialects are less frequently seen in urban areas, particularly in the regions of northern and eastern Germany. In contrast, rural regions and the southern parts of the country tend to have a higher prevalence of dialects. However, it is important to note that dialects can still be found throughout Germany, and regional variation in dialect use can be influenced by many factors, including age, education, and social class.
