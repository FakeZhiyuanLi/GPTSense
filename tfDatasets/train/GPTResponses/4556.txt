Copper has a high capacity for electrical conductivity due to its atomic structure. Copper atoms have a single valence electron in their outermost shell that is loosely held, allowing free movement of the electron within the metal lattice. This results in the ability of copper to conduct electricity and heat very efficiently. Copper also has a high electron mobility, meaning that the electrons can easily move through the metal structure with minimal resistance, resulting in low electrical resistance in copper. This makes copper an ideal material for electrical wiring and transmission lines.
