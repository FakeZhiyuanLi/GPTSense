The concept of relativity is of basic importance in modern physics, as it is central to our understanding of space, time, and gravity. Both the theory of special relativity and the theory of general relativity have provided new insights and predictions that have been confirmed through numerous experiments and observations. Without the concept of relativity, many phenomena in the universe would remain unexplained or misunderstood.
