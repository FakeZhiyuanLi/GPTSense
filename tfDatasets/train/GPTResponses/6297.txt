It is believed that the early speakers of Sanskrit came to India between 1500 BCE and 500 BCE. The exact timeline is uncertain, but archaeological and linguistic evidence suggests that Sanskrit originated in the region of the Indus Valley civilization and was brought by migrating tribes from the north-west. Over time, Sanskrit spread throughout the Indian subcontinent and became the language of the Hindu religion, as well as a major literary and scholarly language.
