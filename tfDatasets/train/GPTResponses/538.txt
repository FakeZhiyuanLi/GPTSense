Darwin's On the Origin of Species proposed the theory of natural selection, which is the mechanism by which evolution occurs. It suggested that organisms with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on those traits to future generations. This concept revolutionized the field of biology and had significant impacts on other fields such as anthropology, psychology, and sociology. The book provided a scientific explanation for the diversity of life on Earth and challenged the prevailing belief of creationism, which posits that all species were created in their current form. Darwin's theory of evolution has since become one of the most foundational and accepted principles of modern biology.
