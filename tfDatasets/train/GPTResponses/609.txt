Anthropology has developed many related terms over time. Here are a few examples:1. Ethnography: A detailed and systematic study of a specific cultural group or society.2. Cultural relativism: The principle that a person's beliefs and behaviors should be understood within their own cultural context rather than judged from outside perspectives.3. Ethnocentrism: The tendency to view one's own culture as superior to others and judge other cultures by one's own cultural standards.4. Emic/etic perspectives: Emic refers to an insider's perspective, while etic refers to an outsider's perspective. In anthropology, it is important to take both perspectives into account when studying a culture.5. Human universals: Traits or behaviors that are found in all human societies, such as language, emotion, and social organization.6. Kinship: The system of relationships among people based on descent, marriage, and other family ties.7. Cultural evolution: The idea that cultures change and develop over time, much like biological evolution.8. Participant observation: An ethnographic research method in which the researcher lives among and participates in the daily life of the people being studied.
