Many readers of Darwin's work did not fully appreciate the role of genetics in evolution. They also did not fully understand the mechanism of natural selection, and the importance of random genetic mutations in the process. Some readers also overlooked the concept of speciation, or the formation of new species over time. Lastly, some readers did not fully appreciate the vastness of geological time, which is necessary for evolutionary changes to occur.
