Both George III and George IV were opposed to the Methodist movement, which was growing rapidly in popularity during their reigns. They saw Methodism as a threat to the established Church of England and feared that its followers would challenge their authority. However, despite their opposition, Methodism continued to grow and exerted a significant influence on British society in the 18th and 19th centuries.
