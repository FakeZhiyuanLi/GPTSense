Cog-railways were built in the Alps starting from the late 19th century onwards. The first cog railway in the Alps was the Vitznau-Rigi-Bahn in Switzerland, which opened in 1871. Other notable cog railways built in the Alps include the Jungfrau Railway (opened in 1912) and the Gornergrat Railway (opened in 1898), both in Switzerland.
