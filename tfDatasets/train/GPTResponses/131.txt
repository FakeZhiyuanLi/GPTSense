The Fermat primality test can produce false positives when testing composite numbers that satisfy Fermat's Little Theorem. These numbers are called pseudoprimes to the base used in the Fermat test. For example, the number 341 is a pseudoprime to the base 2 because 2^340 â‰¡ 1 (mod 341), which satisfies Fermat's Little Theorem. Therefore, the Fermat primality test would mistakenly identify 341 as a prime number, even though it is actually composite (341 = 11 x 31).
