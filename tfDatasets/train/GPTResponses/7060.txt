The resistance of a filament is determined by several factors, including its length, cross-sectional area, and the material from which it is made. The longer the filament, the greater its resistance will be. Similarly, the smaller its cross-sectional area, the higher its resistance. Additionally, the material from which the filament is made can affect its resistance for example, materials with high resistivity, such as tungsten or nichrome, will have higher resistance than materials with lower resistivity, such as copper or aluminum. Finally, temperature can also affect the resistance of a filament, with higher temperatures generally resulting in higher resistance.
