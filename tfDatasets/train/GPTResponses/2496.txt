This is because regions near the equator generally have consistent daylight hours throughout the year due to their proximity to the equator, which experiences equal amounts of daylight during both the summer and winter solstices. Therefore, there is no need to observe daylight saving time (DST) to adjust for longer or shorter daylight hours as seasons change. Countries near the equator that do observe DST often do so for political or economic reasons, rather than for practical reasons related to daylight hours.
