One example of a cathedral in which simple cylindrical columns stand out more than the gothic features is the Basilica di San Lorenzo in Florence, Italy. The interior of the church features Romanesque-style columns that are made of green and white marble and stand out prominently against the plain walls and relatively simple decorative features. The church was consecrated in 393 AD and has been rebuilt several times since, with the current structure dating back to the 11th century.
