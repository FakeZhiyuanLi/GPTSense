The Marshall Islands has a presidential representative democratic republic system of government. The President is the head of state and head of government, and is elected by the unicameral legislature, the Nitijela, for a four-year term. The Nitijela is made up of 33 members who are elected by popular vote every four years. The government also includes a Cabinet, appointed by the President and approved by the Nitijela, which is responsible for implementing policies and carrying out executive functions. The judiciary is independent from the executive and legislative branches and includes a Supreme Court, High Court, and District Courts. The country has a decentralized system of governance, with power and decision-making authority vested in the traditional leaders of each of the 24 atolls and five islands that make up the country.
