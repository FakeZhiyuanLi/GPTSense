The Fermat primality test depends upon the Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if p is a prime number and a is any positive integer such that a is not divisible by p, then a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p). The Fermat primality test uses this theorem to check whether a given number n is prime or not by checking if a^(n-1) ≡ 1 (mod n) for randomly chosen values of a. If the congruency holds for a sufficient number of a values, then n is likely to be prime.
