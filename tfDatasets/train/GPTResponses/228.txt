There is no one single person who can be credited as the first to design architecture environmentally. The history of environmentally conscious architecture can be traced back to ancient times when people used natural materials and incorporated passive strategies to make their buildings comfortable and energy-efficient. However, many architects and researchers have contributed significantly to the development of environmental design principles over the years, such as Buckminster Fuller, Richard Buckminster Fuller, and Ken Yeang.
