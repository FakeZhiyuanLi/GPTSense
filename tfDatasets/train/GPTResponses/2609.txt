There is no definitive answer to this question as it will depend on the specific building codes and regulations for a particular jurisdiction. However, in general, the maximum allowable roof pitch for residential buildings is typically around 35 degrees (or a 7/12 pitch), while for commercial buildings it may be as high as 60 degrees (or a 20/12 pitch). It is always important to consult with local building officials and structural engineers to determine the appropriate roof pitch for a particular project.
