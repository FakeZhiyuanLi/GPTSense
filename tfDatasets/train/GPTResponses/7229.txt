Groupings of similar plants are called plant communities or plant guilds. These are collections of plants that grow together in a specific ecological habitat and share similar ecological requirements, such as soil type, sun exposure, and moisture levels. Plant communities can include various types of plants, including trees, shrubs, ground covers, and herbaceous plants, and can be characterized by different factors, such as climate, topography, and soil composition. Examples of plant communities include grasslands, wetlands, forests, and deserts.
