Aegean Islands: Islands such as Crete and Rhodes were important maritime and trading centers, and their seafaring culture helped shape Greek civilization.4. Anatolia: Greek colonies in present-day Turkey played an important role in spreading Greek culture, particularly through trade and cultural exchange.5.
