Hellenistic art is sometimes described as decadent because it followed the Classical period, which emphasized balance, proportion, and idealized representations of human figures. In contrast, Hellenistic art often featured more dramatic and emotional depictions of figures, with exaggerated expressions and movements that some critics saw as overly theatrical or even vulgar. Furthermore, Hellenistic art often included elements of realism, such as wrinkles, scars, and other imperfections, which further diverged from the idealized forms of the Classical period. Some commentators have argued that these changes reflected the broader cultural shifts of the Hellenistic era, which saw the decline of traditional Greek city-states and the rise of larger, more cosmopolitan empires that embraced a greater variety of artistic styles and influences.
