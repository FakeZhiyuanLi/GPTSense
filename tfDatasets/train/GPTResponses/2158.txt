Regular broadcasts started in Europe in the 1920s. The first country to have regular public radio broadcasting was the United Kingdom, with the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) beginning regular broadcasts in 1922. Other European countries soon followed, with France, Germany, and Italy launching their own public radio stations in the mid-1920s.
