among the most important things in life,i think the friends we go with remain of prime importance as its always rewarding to have accompanying compliant partner with whom to share the journey of life. i believe great things starts little and i know that god created me female,to be the loving support and helpmate of a man and i pray the lord prepares the heart of any man who may enter my life with interests of no more than a friendship commitment,no string attachedif a man is to be mine, i need to know that he chose me for himself because we hold admiration for,laugh with and share the same goals/values/beliefs.
