"the things that people in love do to each other they remember, and if they stay together it's not because they forget, it's because they forgive." "when you're in love with someone it inspires you and gives you hope. you have faith that even if you can't be with them on earth, that if god wills, you will be with them one day in heaven." don't leave that person who loves u,for someone you like,because that someone you like,will leave you for someone,he loves. i've been sitting here waiting for your call.i often wonder why i bother at all.your probably talking to amber or chris.maybe your eating or taking a piss.i'm bored to death but here i am.i often wonder if you give a damn.even though it's getting late, you promised so i'll wait.just as i'm feeling all alone, the silence is broken by the phone.i look out the window and see the sun.you finally called, so this poem is done!
