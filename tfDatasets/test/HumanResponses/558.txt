in the meeting on child soldiers yesterday, where i presented an update on the government's program to address the issue, someone brought up the case wherein a child soldier wanted to surrender, but because of the so-called "no firearms, no surrender" policy, the person couldn't surrender since he didn't have a firearm. during the discussion, everybody had a good laugh because of a joke that went like this: conversation between a military personnel and a young rebel. rebel : sir, i would like to surrender. military official : okay, where's your firearm? hand it over, please. rebel : sir, i don't have a firearm. military official : no firearm, no surrender! rebel : but, sir, i'm just a cook. how can i have a firearm? military official : buy one from me. again, this is just a joke!
