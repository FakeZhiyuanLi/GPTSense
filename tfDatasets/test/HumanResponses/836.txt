i know you always knew i know you always knew what is in my head my past is something you know i always dread you so want to believe i am nothing but a lie you don’t want to believe the truth you’d rather die lost in your own head with your false reality there is no room for my true essence or fragility you act so tough it seems for you anger is easier than love but i know the real truth deep inside, what i am really made of i have not lied to you or tried to hide behind insecurities you just chose to make up and research your own absurdities you know me better than anyone but then not at all you know only what you really don’t, hiding behind a phone call your misconceptions to both of us have been destructive i know if you would allow me to love you we’d both be more constructive gia
