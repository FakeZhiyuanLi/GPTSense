six weeks with family and children visiting for the summer is drawing to a close. although i will dearly miss everyone after they leave, i will look forward to catching up on all the phone and email messages, as well as messages here :)so many things to review and consider, and, hopefully, some wonderful interviews to schedule soon.house of shaman's 2-day lifestyle gathering is coming up in late august. sooner than i'm ready i fear! now, how many submissives service trainees, slaves, and pets will it take to clean, prep, cook, and serve for 30, as well as get the gardens trimmed back and presentable? hmmmm. i'm thinking 5-6, which will work for 2 days prior to the event weekend and then provide ample coverage for our guests during the gathering. plus. 5-6 in service, will be even more eye candy and playtoys (boy/girl/trans) for me!
