so the new maps for sc:pt are only available if you buy them for $5 usd (6.82 cad). i don't know if there are other games that have done this, or not, but it's certainly the first game that i own that has done this. frankly, i think it sets a disturbing precident. so in addition to buying the game ($64.99), subscribing to xbox live (starter kit: $99.99 cad), they now want another 6.82 for 2 new maps. whats next? pay-per-use downloadable content? "only 10c/min to play on this map!" yeesh.
