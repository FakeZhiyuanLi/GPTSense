i hope i can make it through the week. i finally got my network candidate finished late on monday. now i just have to convince the rest of the group to use it :-) not that it's the best, but i put a ton of time and effort into it and i don't want that wasted. sql test tonight and then i should be set for the rest of the week. maybe then we can focus on buying our first house. hopefully one that has a yard for the dog!
