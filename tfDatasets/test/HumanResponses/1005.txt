i officially love blogspot. its very.controllable, yet user friendly. i love my layout! anyway. =). again, i mention i have not been told my flat mate and room assignment, and i will be arriving there in less than two weeks. oh well. jennifer says be prepared for the worst. i am -trying-. a word of politics: china needs to be sent the right message by america and is not being sent oneand so it proceeds to walk all over american foreign policy. the president should have balls enough to support the independence of a capitalist democracy, taiwan, autonomous for a very long time, from the despotic rule of undemocratic communist china. the united states sells taiwan weapons to defend itself against its what the us claims is its rightful owner. the 'one-china' policy is wretched and should be destroyed. what is china going to do? stop manufacturing? thats going to happen. *rolls eyes*.
