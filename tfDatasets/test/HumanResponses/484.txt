gah, working sucks. the 'rents go out on vacation staring wednesday. wednesday to next wednesday. who wants to do something? i got a surprise raise at work. i make 7.25 now. meh. doesn't make it any less sucky. the acoustic version of pardon me owns all of you. i wish i could have some drama to bitch about, but, i'm pretty sure i don't have any. stupid summer, you take all the fun out of it. i keep thinking about andrea. i just really want to talk to her again. it hurts. there's nothing i can do, but.it doesn't make it any less painful. my mom is going on some ocd cleaning phase. i try to hide. out of sight, out of mind, so i don't have to help. anyway, i should get back to.whatever it is i do. later.
