i learned from okram my friend that 311 was actually from australia. world tribe is from california and the band have decided to go on their separate ways according to ricky guinto na pinsan ni tikbalang. pero magkatunog yung ibang songs nila sometimes pareho sila na boses s ibang kanta dami ko pala naripped na kanta ni ben harper from five albums courtesy of okram and im planning to collect all of their albums! natuloy din piknik ng sublime! as usual inuman pa rin pero this time with bulalo naman! sarap siguro mag compose ng songs ulit! though wala akong inspiration ngayun wala lang gusto ko lang. try ko tonight mismu! my mistake 311 pala is from omaha. i checked the 311 website. si okram talaga heheh
