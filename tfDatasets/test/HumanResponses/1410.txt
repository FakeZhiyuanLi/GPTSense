i got half day today at office, so i hev done nothing much at my office, just attend a few meetings, onced i got back from office i packed myself with my fishing kit and set to pasir ris park, meeting my friend day for fishing, fishing at the beach give me calmness in my mind, at the same time enjoy the thrill if you got a bite, thrillin part of fishing is how you fight with the fish and drag it to the shore, it will be more exciting and fun if the caught is a big one! : ) while waiting for the bite, john my classmate for interactive media at coleman creative school call to discuss about the game project given, coz he have trouble to find sound fx and loops for his game. somehow you stress will be at ease by the beach, viewing the panaromic view of the seascape, people jogged, pretty mermaid "babes" and birds flying bla bla bla. by the time i got back around 11pm, quit tired though i spent a few minutes posting this blog!
