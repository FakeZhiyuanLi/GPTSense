boring boring boring day. it's 20:06 as i type, and i haven't spoke to gemma today, and if i don't by midnight it would've been the first day in months that we haven't communicated with each other in some way :( still, i've been writing her a letter explaining how i feel and i'm gonna give it to her tomorrow, unless i chicken out, which i probably will. other than that i've just had a normal sunday, went to see the bourne supremecy at the cinema's, which was no way near as good as the bourne identity. gemma's friend emma told her yesterday that she's moving away in a week or so to bournemouth in a few months, so she's pretty upset, which is why she's not out with me today, cos she's spending the day with emma. emma's a lesbian by the way, not that it matters. gemma's a bisexual, and experimental. they used to spend a lot of time together. you do the math ;) anyway, gotta go wallow in self-pity, man utd lost earlier :(
