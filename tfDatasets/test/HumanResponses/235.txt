these last few days of school are terribly painful. sure, they're just exams, but today was the worst one. the dreaded science! i've learned over the years that i'm just not a science or math type of person at all. i don't mind math as mush though, besause in math, i have a hard time and i want to pay attention so i can try and undersstand. science is a whole nother story. while looking back over my notes, i learned that during sceince is when i spend the most time drawing and writing silly things like this. it's a lot of fun to read all that i was thinking. science is the only class i've ever fallen asleep in too. not that it really matters, cuz there's nothing i can do about it, i still feel bad. not!
