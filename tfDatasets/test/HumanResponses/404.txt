after a marathon session lasting from 1pm to 3am i have finished draft one of "alive." i am mourning my method of ending the book but it is for a greater purpose. now begins the process of abandoning it for the next day or two while i reflect. i will begin editing monday. to those two beauties, eve and binks, i thank you for your reading of this rough draft and for allowing me to share this with you. your encouragement has been a sustaining force for me while i bleed this one through. i hope that you will be happy with the ending but also angry that i have chosen to allow such suffering in my characters. i will be with you all again shortly on more thoughts but for now my brain needs to sleep.
