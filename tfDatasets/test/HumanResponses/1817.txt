another boring day doing absolutely nothing. my cousin sarah is here today and she is spending the night. she is kind of wild and hipper. some times it gets pretty annoying. she is still fun to be with. other then that it was another boring day. i hate it is the 2 week of vacation we have not done anything. the only good thing that i think we are going to do this summer is go to six flags. i cant wait. it is going to be so fun. my sister and i are going to go on all the roller coasters. well i don't know if i will i think the thing i am most scared of are roller coasters but my sister said that if i don't she is going to drag me on them. i cant wait for next year so i can see (him) next year. i think he is mad at me though for not going out with him last year but whatever. couldn't anyways. that's all i have to say. p.s. lets take the retard out ( its a inside joke and obviously your not inside of it)!
