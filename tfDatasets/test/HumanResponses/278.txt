getting sick on the eve of one's vacation is bullshit. i succumbed to all the hype and bought some emergen-c. i'm already in the midst of the cold, but maybe it might help. i'm probably kidding myself, though. i just hope i don't spend all 4 days feeling like shit with snot running out of me every second. i've always hated my nose, but now that it has started it's own snot factory (whose slogan is apparently "all snot, all the time"), i like it a whole lot less. thankfully, the baseball bat down my throat has been removed, and i'm not too ache-y. i guess i can live with having tissue burn in my nostrils. it's like getting rug burn, but without all the fun bits. sniff sniff.
