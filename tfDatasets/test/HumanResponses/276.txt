ok, first day back to school since friday. well i didn't even go a full day, i had an eye doctor appt. @ 9 so i went to that and got back about 11. so i had a total of 4 periods today. so the day went really fast. i didn't get to go to the career center. cassie, i still can't believe that they rescheduled the ac tournament for next saturday how stupid can they get? i mean how many schools do they expect to show up at this thing? aren't all the schools doing solo and ensemble? i really wanted to do the tournament i am so mad sorry, that was my little rant. i am all better now.
