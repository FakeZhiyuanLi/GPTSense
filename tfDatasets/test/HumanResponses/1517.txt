phd factor for today: 2.0 (on a scale from 0 to 10) so, it's been a less mentally productive week so far. the thing about mentally unproductive weeks is that i still thinki'm just not thinking about what i'm supposed to be thinking about (ad-hoc networks and so on.) it would be nice to have a job where i was just paid to think about whatever i felt like thinking about. i suppose that'd be something like a cross between an artist, a consultant, and a psych ward patient. really, it's starting to get to the point where i'd just like to have an income.
