is there anything uglier than seeing a girl wearing a baseball cap? they even make a goddess like britney spears look like a the trailer trash she would be if she didn’t have a mom who was ready from the earliest age to exploit her. baseball caps are for baseball players, black men, cancer patients and people at sporting events. that’s it, that’s the complete list of times they are cool. caps are like hot girl camouflage. once the cap is on a beautiful girl blends in with the ugliness of humanity. stars wear them so they won’t get recognized in public. i’ve asked girls why they wear hats and the answer is almost always; “i looked like crap so i threw this on.” well i hate to break it to you but now you look worse. put some work into your look, as a female that is all you have.
