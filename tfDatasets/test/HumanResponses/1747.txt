i guess i’m falling for you tonight… i don’t know why… just the mention of your name makes me smile everytime your e-mails in my inbox arrive… i’m feeling the urge to open it… when you send me that special message in my phone… i’m feeling so special, so honour by you… my special someone that i know just by a chance my special someone… that appears every day in my inbox
