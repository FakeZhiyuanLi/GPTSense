i ditched fedora for suse just to see if i like it any better. after using gnome for so long, kde is definitely a lot different. i'm not sure if i like it or not yet. part of the reason i installed suse is for the experimental project utopia red carpet channel. i think installing ximian desktop 2 when it's released for suse 9.1 could be my perfect linux desktop. one thing i've noticed is suse's font rendering is very nice. blogger.com looks amazing.
