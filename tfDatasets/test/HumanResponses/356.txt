watched fahrenheit 9/11 today and was really surprised to see the huge turn out. most interesting was the large percentage of young people turning up. i would have imagined with the movie being mostly political and opinionated, it would be something the senior folks would be more interested in. the movie has been very controversial, and no doubt this has attracted a lot of interest by all sections of the american movie-going population. the movie turned out to be very well made with an excellent flow of events and statement of facts, but it does show too much sentiment against the incumbent president. all in all a good entertainer for two whole hours.
