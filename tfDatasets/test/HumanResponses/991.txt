ok, gangi need a little help. i just moved into the officeit's been painted and recarpeted and moved around a little, which is wonderful! however, it's still quite.boring. here's where you come in! i want to use you for my personal benefit, so listen up! i would love to plaster my walls with you guys, and since i would get in trouble if i glued you all personally to the wall, i've got another idea: i'll decorate with stuff you've created! do you draw or paint or sketch or take pictures or do other things that are along those lines? if so, i think it would be awesome if you drew or painted or sketched or took pictures or other things along those lines, something for the office! and what's better, for those of you who think you are incapable of being so artistic, draw me something anyway! cat poop, or stick people, anything! so go for it! also.if you have any other artistic and random office ideas, let me have them! mark
