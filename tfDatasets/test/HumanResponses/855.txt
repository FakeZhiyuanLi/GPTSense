furby! ::sigh:: furby ::dreams:: i don't know if i should be feeling this way. this is how i felt when i first started dating jesse. jesse ended up being a not so good thing tho. ok, my insecurity about furby is that he won't like me after he meets me in person. i also had a couple dreams, like he met amanda, saw how beautiful she was, and then totally ditched me for her. i cried sooooo much. i've been crying recently and it really sucks. this one song that i have really reminds me of him. new found glory "story so far" i can't listen to that song anymore without thinking of him and getting all choked up. ::cry:: i know i know, i'm pathetic. really really pathetic. i'm gonna end it here now.
