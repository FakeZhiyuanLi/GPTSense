yesterday morning i ever so convieniently struck my glasses (which were on the nightstand) with my elbow, disfiguring them. they lasted through the day with the only hassle being adjustments every so often. then, in a stupid ocd moment around dinnertime, i tried to adjust the side frame andcrack! that part snapped off. i tried superglue, but it would take the night to dry. woke up this morning half-blind and tried on the newly repaired pair of glasses. they sorta fit, but my mom and i figured we should just get a new pair. i took the day off from school, basically under neccessity, to get new frames. so now i have a new pair of glasses and my first absence of the school year, on a day with two tests, nonetheless. oh well, not like i could've gone to a packed, pushy school with crap vision. =/ oh yeah, played a demo of pikmin 2 at walmart, and it kicks ass. just what i need, more games i'll buy this fall. i need a job u_u
