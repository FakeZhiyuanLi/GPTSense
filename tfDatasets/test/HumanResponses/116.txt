this recipe is from an old cookbook of my mothers that is now, sadly, lost. one time, while living far from home, i had a desire for this fudge and i had lost the recipe. i called mom and asked her to read the recipe to me over the phone. i had made it many times so i really just needed the ingredients. i made the fudge, there in my own kitchen far from home and it tasted just as good as it did at home. 1 c. sugar 1 c. brown sugar 3/4 c. milk 2 tbs. light corn syrup 3 tbs. butter 1/2 c. or more peanut butter 1 tsp vanilla mix sugars, milk, and corn syrup in a pan and cook until the soft ball stage. add butter and peanut butter. allow to cool. add vanilla and beat until it looses it sheen. pour into a butter pan and cool completely before cutting.
