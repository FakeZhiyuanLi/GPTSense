halloween may be no where near but it is on my mind. the summer is a great time for me to start making new props and thinking of new ways to scare people. this blog is dedicated to halloween frights! i will hopefully be posting pictures of the halloween props i make and some of the ones i have that i have put into action around halloween time.
