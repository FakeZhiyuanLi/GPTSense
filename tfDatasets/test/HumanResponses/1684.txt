it's 7:45 in the morning, another sleepless nite, another empty day. everyday now feels the same, each one running into the next. i may be blue, and i may miss you, but i'm far too tired to. my head is empty, my back aches, my chest feels like the world rests on it. i could sleep, i could rest, but then i'd dream, and you'd be there and that pain makes the weight of the world seem like a balloon.
