these were the notes last time when i used to be very negative and pretty much sad. i still am, a little but not as much. so here are the phrases that i used to scrible all over the place and keep rereading to prevent myself from doing anything drastic or stupid. love yourself for who you are. respect others and they will in return. shut up and listen to yourself. you can never please everyone. not everyone can like you. you have a voice, a heart and a brain. use it. nothing is impossible. you are an individual, be proud of it. choose the right path, handle things your way. believe in what you do, believe in what is right. don't run away in fear, stand up even if it means showing your tears. fight for yourself, don't lose your voice over the crowds. okay, there's much more but i can't find where i scribbled it all to.
