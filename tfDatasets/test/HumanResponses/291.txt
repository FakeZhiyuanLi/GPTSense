as of late i have been building up for jeff hardy's return in the wwe possibly to save his brother matt from the evil and sinister kane. that all got flushed down the toilet when unexpectedly jeff shown up at a nwa:tna ppv in nashville last week. apparently jeff is under contract with nwa:tna seeing as how he was in a title match against aj styles for the x-division championship. in a recent interview with jeff's mother about his debut, she claims to have not known anything about it and that all she had known was that jeff got on a plane to nashville. as of now jeff fans are waiting for more news about his nwa:tna contract. jeff however, was not at last weeks impact event and was rumored that he is already in trouble for being terribly late to the ppv. more will be posted on jeff hardy as news becomes available.
