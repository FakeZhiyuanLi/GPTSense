with a bruised leg, stuck to the indoors, this memorial day weekend has been movie time for me. saw one more movie yesterday - the day after tomorrow - decent movie with good special effects and visuals. if u are looking for a good story, there is none - u could might as well sit at home and watch the kobe trial proceedings. but all in all - decent entertainment value for a couple of hours
