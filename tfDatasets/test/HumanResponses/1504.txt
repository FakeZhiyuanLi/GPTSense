i hope i spelled her name correctly.you'd think if you love someone you'd know how to spell their name, huh there is a song (#6 on the new fallen cd) that i cannot stop listening to. i would assume it was written about a person, but i can't listen to it w/out thinking about god. this is the chorus: you stay the course you hold the line you keep it all together you're the one true thing i know i can believe in. you're all the things that i desire you save me you complete me you're the one true thing i know i can believe. i want to write songs like that - straight from the heart.
