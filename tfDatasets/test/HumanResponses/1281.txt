my words left unspoken untold and alone left as a secret written in stone. whispering softly through ears that don't hear will he ever know why to love brings me fear? to think is to speak like breath is to air forgotten in time left in despair. when life is determined by the beat of a heart the truth will be spoken and with a kiss we'll depart.
