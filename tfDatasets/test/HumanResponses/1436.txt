ever been bogging? put on a pair of old sneakers, clothing you don't mind getting wet and lets go for a walk. as you step out onto the bog it is like stepping out onto a waterbed made of moss. your feet sink into the ground as water fills in the whole. it is a creepy but wild experience. if you dare you can walk right out till you are waste high or go over your head. now you may ask what does this have to do with a blog? absoultely nothing but being as much of an environmental science nut as i am, it was the first thing that jumped into my mind. so feel free to bog around! enjoy
