i was traumatized today. it was horrible. mom let me outside to play. i was having a grand old time. i teased the hamsters in their cage. the little balls of fluff just hate it when i paw the bars. they puff up and jab at me. little buggers have a heck of a bite when the catch ya though. when that got boring i spent a little time hunting bugs, though i have be careful to stay away from the rock garden and the flowers that attract the best bugs. after my belly was full i started my rounds and was on the far side of the house when i was suddenly soaked. rain came out of nowhere and i just got drenched. i had to sit and cry at the back door screen for five whole minutes before mom let me in so i could dry off in my bed. i am still a little damp. i am not sure i will recover anytime soon. i heard mom say that it is supposed to rain all week. i think i will stay inside, no matter how much i crave a good crunchy bug.
