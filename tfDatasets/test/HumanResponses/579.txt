ive been talking to michelle a lot its crazy weve met like twice but its all good cuz it sounds like she actually cares. wow i know its crazy but it might be true. so i came home after havin an intersting convo with my morality teacher, i love that class. i get very inspired. ive been thinking a lot about a lotta things and im starting to be happy more often and i still have my theory that anything that has ever happened in history has happened cuz of money and ppl being selfish. nothing has ever happened for any other reason with wars in history. its sorta depressing thinking about the world like that but actually ive learned to accept it :). so anyway after skool i came home and was dealing with comp problem bullshit but its ok ill figure it out and i gotta lotta shit to do with fixing up my room and writing thank yous for my bday along with act retake shit that i just finished. so ya that was my day i shall speak to you all later
