first they put away the dealers, keep our kids safe and off the street. then they put away the prostitutes, keep married men cloistered at home. then they shooed away the bums, then they beat and bashed the queers, turned away asylum-seekers, fed us suspicions and fears. we didnt raise our voice, we didnt make a fuss. its funny there was no one left to notice when they came for us. nofx i thought that this was a good way to start off my new blog. real posts will come later.
