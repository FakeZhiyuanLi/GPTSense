well today was pretty dull. i woke up around 12:30pm turned on the tv and flipped thru some channels after that i went downstairs and had breakfast, had some cereal and orange juice. then i got on the computer and checked my email and a couple sites that i frequent then i played a game.got off and watched tv the rest of the day. i also saw the last episode of the real world, kind of sad that they all left.too bad those girls were hot! ah well. well tomorrow a few guests that are visiting my sister from denver(my hometown) are coming over for dinner, they're pretty nice people ive met them before. well thats all folks, cya!
