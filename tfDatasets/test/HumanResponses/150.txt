there's really so much i could say about smiles i love them more than anything when someone smiles they look their best. a smile can be for many different reasons. whatever those reasons are i encourage you to keep smiling a smile can brighten anyone's day when they walk by you on a rainy day and see your smile they cant help but smile themselves. you see how one smile can make a whole world of difference. so smile a little huh. id also like to take the time to give props to sarah k because she smiled when she sung at a choir concert and it made all the difference it was so nice to see someone smile she was the only won who did the whole time until it ended :) anyway just thought id put that in there because it's something worth mentioning.
