.i have come to the ultimate conclusion that life would be much less complicated if all involved would adopt the fatalistic attitude,and accept what was predetermined. although that particular existence would be quite fruitless,we might then feel secure. maybe then, people like me would have a right to complain about the injustice of it all, as opposed to now, when we do,regardless of whether we have license to, or not. yet,when you really contemplate it, would we really feel any more secure? knowing you are being hurried down a blind past, knowing nothing of how it may end. unsure of whether anything you accomplished,attempted, or felt passionate about would mean anything in your inevitable end. can living ever be simple? have we lived in this somewhat mildly predictable,yet,sometimes extremely random method so long,that the inherent unpredictability in the behavior of a natural system would overwhelm us?.
