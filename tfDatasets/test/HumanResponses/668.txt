i had these ideas for a while now and so i decided to post them. : "the lone knight stands on the tower watching the gloomy storm clouds in the distance" "they watched the lone knight travel along the road, never to see him again" "so after she left him, he traveled alone in the world, never to be with another for the remainder of his life." ""behold your king before you", he motioned to the body of their king laying there in eternal peace" Â© roberto marquez
