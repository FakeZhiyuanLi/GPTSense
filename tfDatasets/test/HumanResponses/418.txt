i'm feeling a little odd. i may have been over-indulgent in the whisky department. i saw a tv programme earlier. it involved david icke. all very strange. i watched sex and the city too. even when those girls are having a bad day their lives are great. god. i can't remember the last time i had sex. well, i can , actually, it was with david ( not icke), but that's not the point. the point is it has been a while. it has been a long time.
