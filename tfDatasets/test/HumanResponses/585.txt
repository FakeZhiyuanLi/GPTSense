welcome! this is my first blog and therefore my first blog posting. my girlfriend thinks i need an outlet to vent, i think i need an outlet to vet . in the coming days, weeks, and months i'm going to be vetting and venting on what i think are today's most important events. for those of you who don't know me i'm a 27 male born and raised on the outskirts of boston, home to my least favorite person du jour, senator john kerry. i look forward to trying this whole blog thing out and i can't wait to see what kind of feedback i get. bless the us and thanks for reading.
