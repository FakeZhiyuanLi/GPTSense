here it is june already and i am just now finding christmas ideas. i am usually more organized than this. but then this has been a very chaotic year. overwhelming debt, moving, theft and puppies and god only knows what else is yet to come. does this mean giving up the internet? i don't know but i can no longer afford to pay for it. so i borrow access from others.
