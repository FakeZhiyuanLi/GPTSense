i am ecstatic. have i died and gone to heaven? i wonder when i see the sign of my favourite lingerie store has got a 50% sale on. the adrenalin rushes as i see the shop door; my heart is in my mouth as i search the shop for the ultimate pieces of beautiful, exquisite and lavish lingerie. it's irrelevant if the piece matches anything else, fits properly or it's not my normal style; this is paradise, an aladdin's cave of the best goodies which is better than gold. a pure moment of euphoria.
