lately i have been so confused of what i have been feeling. i know that what i am doing is right, that i have god's blessing, that i am in his will. yet, at times i feel like i am having pride and lack of love and compassion. i wonder, will i have the words to express all these things? will i make sense? why did i take this burden on myself? why didn't i allow god to help me? why didn't i go to him and let him open my eyes sooner? why was everyone so scared to tell me? why didn't i listen when they actually did? man, i can be a dumb man. yet, thank you lord that you are bigger than me and all of this. thank you jesus, that you are helping me through this. guide me lord and show me when and how to communicate and love her through this.
