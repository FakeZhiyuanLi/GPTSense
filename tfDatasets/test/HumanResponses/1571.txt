so after looking around the apartment, car and office for about a week (sadly resigned to my not finding my cds of photos of europe), i went to sleep and woke up knowing exactly where to look for them. got out of bed. and found them in that spot. amazing. why does that always happen? i've learned to believe it will happen every time.
