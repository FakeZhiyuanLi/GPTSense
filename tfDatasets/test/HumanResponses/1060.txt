mostly martha the triplets of bellville el bola empire records he died with a falafel in his hand (sorry i'm too lazy right now to give you reviews but they are all really good!) jay-z - the black album kanye west - college dropout joss stone - soul sessions hole - live through this (high school flashback) putumayo presents - afrorock/puerto rico/salsa and more i liked kanye west and joss stone enough to buy my own cds after listening to library ones. late twentysomething patrons appreciate the new sounds but we still need a core collection for the moments when we want to return to our "grunge" roots.
