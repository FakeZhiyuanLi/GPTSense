good evening and how are you? like most people, i want my 15 nanoseconds of fame, unfortunately you have stumbled across this site and my wish has become a pathetic reality. just had an idea, since i'm calling this site "hex on lex", i shall use it to collate hexes, curses and the like from around the internet. by "the like" i mean the usual drivel most gen xer's obsess about. nice. a hobby is just what i don't need. feel free to deride me and this blog, i could do with the material for my collection. alx
