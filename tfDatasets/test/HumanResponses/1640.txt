so this is kind of fun.a little addicting. so how is everyone's summer's going? mine has been very busy, i feel like i work all the time, but have no money to show for it. i'm looking forward to high school bible memory camp, for which alecia and i are going early and staying with a dear friend, holly, for the weekend before. i'm working on a trumpet solo, well, kind of, more like a trio, but still like a solo, for jazz band. ross is very kind for giving it to me. anyone who would like to hear it should come to the school next tuesday at 9:30 am. and i'm going to bed because i want to get up and tan tomorrow before work. so goodbye
