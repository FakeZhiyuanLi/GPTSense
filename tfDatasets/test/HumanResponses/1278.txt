well, probably not the best day ever to start a blog. i feel down. like really down. although my problems are not even significant in comparrison to those of the rest of the world, and although i have a lot going for me, everything seems wrong. i dont like the constant invasion of privacy. i dont want secrets, i want confidentiality. i want to be able to say something without it all backfiring. i want to go to leeds fest, i want to move house and i want joss to go. basically for the last 3 points, i want my mother to stop taking the easy option. but then again, its not all bad, it can't be. i'm going to paris on tuesday with the people who dont understand not to shout how im feeling to the world. then i'm going to an interview at oxford on the thursday, and i dont know what to do. all good. all shiney. all smiles. all the time. jd
