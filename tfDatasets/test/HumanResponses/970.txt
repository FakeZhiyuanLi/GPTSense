yesterday i just laid around all day pretty much and watched lifetime movie network then my mom came home and we went to red lobster to get that lobster and shrimp thing for like 14.99. it was really good. and while we were there i saw ashley matias there, which was wierd b/c it was soo far away. then we went grocery shopping and spent 100 dollars worth on junk. it was pretty uneventful really. today i woke up at like 11:15 or so. then it started pouring down rain and the power flicked off. i had also let ollie bear outside and then it started pouring so i kept trying to call him in and he never came. he finally came in but he was soaking wet so i dried him off with a towel and held him. now i'm watching another lifetime movie called touch of a stranger. it is really good so far. after this is over i think i'm gonna go take a nap and be even more lazy than usual.
