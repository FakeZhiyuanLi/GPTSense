well i just gotta start off and say that being single sucks.but it does have its perks. like u don't have to remember important dates such as their b day and the anniversaries or their friends names and their phone numbers and so on and so forth. for the most part i like being single but then again i do get lonely sometimes and i would wish i was with someone. but i kno if i do have someone than i will get tired of them really fast and get annoyed by their face and constant bad habitsor maybe i'm just ot picky.idk.lol. well i'll just leave it as it is for now. i'll "eventaully" have someone(i thinkand hope)lol. well ttyl.
