i said, in our recent planning workshop, that our office does not have a library. we have shelves, and books in the shelves, but not a library. overnight, i asked myself: so what really is a library? why did i say we don't have one? okay, we don't have a librarian. that's one thing. but maybe it's more because i don't see people, including staff, visiting our "library" to read materials from the shelves, and getting inspired to know more and more and more, and geting answers on the issues of the day. a library is not a stockroom or warehouse of information, but a wellspring of knowledge. it should not wait for clients to come, bur, rather, reach out to them and sustains them. there should be a system that gives people answers even before they asked the questions.
