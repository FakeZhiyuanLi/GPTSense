my sleeping habit is way off. i'm falling asleep at 7 am and waking up at 4 pm. last night i fell asleep at 10 pm, i woke up today at 3:30 am, and now, at 1 pm am thoroughly tired. i want to take a nap, which will keep me up all night again. *sigh* how am i going to get into a good sleeping habit in time for school?
