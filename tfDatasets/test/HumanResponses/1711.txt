i had to deal with people who treat me like shit lately. and i had a sucky day,because my coworker treated me like shit, arguing all the gloves were the same when there were only left-handed ones. she commented real snottily this: "fine,believe whatever you want to believe!". and of course, there was a yahoo user named marial, saying complete bullshit on how ign's official harvest moon board thread is not full(oh,so, thirteen thousands posts on one thread board isn't full? wrong!). geez, i'm getting real sick of people from ign saying that same bullshit. it pisses me off. yes,it pisses me off at least i got my chicken fajita. it was the best. at least i got something good out of a sucky day like this.
