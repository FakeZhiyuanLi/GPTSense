this was a big moving weekend. now we are living in a cavern of boxes. the question is always "where is my." or "where is the." i was still packing while the movers were carrying stuff down. it was so much work! at one point i sneezed and saw stars. i never saw them so clearly. usually there is just a vague swimming something that disappears quickly, but this time i saw little perfectly round pinpoints of colored light that swam in little arcs, leaving fading trails behind them. my little girl (my real daughter, not my inner little girl) is desperate. what with all the moving and hauling and searching for things and cleaning and stuff, there is no one to play with her, to pay her attention, to take her to the park. remember "it takes a village"? where is the damn village? we had a babysitting come by for a couple hours, and it was beautiful.
