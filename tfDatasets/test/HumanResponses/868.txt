my co-worker said that there will come a point at which my cravings will go away or at least die down. i think i'm starting to experience it. normally i snake during the day while working. i usually crave cookies or other carb loaded goodies. today my only snake was a package of sunflower kernels, (1 carb), for my morning break and nothing but coffee for my afternoon break. i didn't miss the carbs. i have to pat myself on the back for the dinner i made. broiled chicken, seasoned, marinated and sauteed with onions, served with cabbage. i read somewhere that foods like cabbage and grapefruit help you lose weight. another thing i'm working on is getting to be earlier. i find that the longer i stay awake at night, i tend to snack.
