people today go to the cinema if they want to see a movie. it was not like that many years ago, the theatre was the place people would go to be entertained. dramas was perform in theatre by actor so the people who wrote drama intended that their work be acted out and not as a reading material. drama is what is call a performing art because they are acted out in front of an audience, intense because what is said is concentrated into a few hours. and is enjoy and judge by a group of people who have come to view them. however it will be impossible for us to see every play that we want, it is far more easier for us to read a play then to see one. although the experience wonâ€™t be the same as seeing it but at least a great art is enjoyed and appreciated by more people. personally i think seeing a play would be much more fun then reading it
