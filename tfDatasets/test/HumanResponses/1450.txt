i have many plans for the summer. this july i going to be on a two week roadtrip through wisconsin, minnesota, south dakota, wyoming, idaho, montana, nebraska, and missouri. on top of that i think i have a good chance at scoring some good tickets for some upcoming concerts. when i'm not traveling or going to a concert i hope to hang out with old friends, that i haven't seen in quite some time. also i am now able to get a job with a work permit so i will have some extra cash. i think this will be a summer to remember.
