searching, looking, seeking, all my life wanting love, but love never was found. hopeless, broken, defeated, i gave up, gave in. then i found you, a beacon of hope, shining bright and strong. i looked for love, but love could not be found, cause love is you. i had you, i had love, i had fullness and i had life. but you took your love, gave it all away, left me broken, hopeless, defeated. now in an empty bed, with empty thoughts and empty dreams, i live, if thats living at all. i hear your voice, "i love you still," i hear you say, "stronger and deeper then ever." but your heart is in the hands of another, though your heart beats for me, you can't break his to be with me. "i can't live without his touch, his kiss," you say, i cry. tears fill my emptiness, i guess love doesn't find a way, love is cruel and love hurts, i hurt.
