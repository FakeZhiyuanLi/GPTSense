your heart. felt good. and so it went on, this slow progress on my thesis. bits and pieces floating out. with trepidation, hesitation. out of the abyss of not-formed ideas and made into something solid, signifying some commitment of faith from me. so i guess i believe this, i wrote it, it's mine. or an incarnation of somebody elses, jumbled with some breath of my own. i can't guess at how much the music i listen to as i write affects my thoughts. because, dammit if i can't even decide on punctuation listening to the string quartet tribute to coldplay (can you blame me?) but put on the moon and antarctica and modest mouse has me nailing out critical development theory. with conviction. with conviction.
