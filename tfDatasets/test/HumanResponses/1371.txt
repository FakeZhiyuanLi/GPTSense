i'm so excited i'll be going to ann's church tomorrow for nusery duty. i hope that i won't make any of them cry. haha meiyi's going as well but she won't be joining us for nursery duty. ann says she hates children but hey, that's what we all started as isn't it? hmm and i am going to get my "new" bag tomorrow as wellhaha at 30 dollars. regina thinks that i should have gotten myself a new bag since it's 30 dollars. thought about it thought she was right but who cares? what matters is that i like the bag and that it really is still quite new isn't it? yeah the kids will inspire me to be more loving. kindness can be developed. that's what i believe.
