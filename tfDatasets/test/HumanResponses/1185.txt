for some odd reason, that phrase really irks me. when i read 24/7, i assume that it is implied they are open 365 days a year. they could also say 24/365 which would imply that they are open 7 days a week. it just seems that they are being redundant and that bothers me. other inappropriate versions (to make you realize that this is stupid): 24/168/365, 168/52/365, 168/365. some maybe appropriate ones would be: 24/7/52, 24/365, 168/52. sorry for the rant, but that's what blogs are for, right?
