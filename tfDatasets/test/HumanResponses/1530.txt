emerson mills was an old mill that got transformed into apartments, my husband picked the crappiest town up near the state capitol, which is concord. he had gotten a job working on the prisons computer system, so we moved into this place because it was the cheapest place around, only 525.00 a month, not bad huh? we moved in new years eve, with the help of some of my husband's friends. it only took 4 hours, by midnight we were done, and sleeping. when we moved in i liked the place because of it's high ceilings, and enormous windows, and the feel of it was great. little did i know the feeling would soon dissipate over time. i have to go so i will finish this blog later.
