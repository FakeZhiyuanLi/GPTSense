rather than waiting until year-end, i thought i'd come up with a list of goals to work on thru the rest of the year. here we go: 1. quit trying to give-up diet coke. i'm just going to accept that i need my diet cokes. 2. quit being nice to people who truly do not deserve my kindness. 3. meet the weight loss goal that monica set for me by year end. 4. enjoy time spent with friends and family, without worrying about other things/chores that need done. just relax a little. 5. more to come soon.
