well tonight has being so fucking shitty i can';t even say how bad i feel. i'm so dissappointed in myself i can't even explain it. i lost my moms debit card. that may not seems like something that big to you, but for me it's huge. my mom actully trusted me not to lose it and i did! i fuckign lost it. i fucked up once more. i am such a fuckup. i dont' care how other ppl see me, thats how i see myself. and stupid pointless fuckup. i hate how i'm so stupid sometimes, i hate how i drink, i hate how i tell ppl i love them when i don't, i hate how i'm so mean to ppl when i shouldn't be, i hate me. no, just sometimes. what i really hate is when i get suicidl thoughts. i wish those would leave. i dont' think i would veen actulyl do it, but even the thought of it sounds really good sometimes. i wanna do it. so bad.
