walking past the streets my mind flashed back remembering the past the good and the bad suddenly,tears started rolling down my cheek without even realizing i found me crying so hard i didn't know which past my mind went what i knew was it came into the past that i longing to forget for i can't never change my past or my mind came into my past that was so good that i wish i can stay forever in that past
