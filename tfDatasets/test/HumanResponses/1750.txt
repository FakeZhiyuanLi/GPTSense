i feel like the world is no more smiling back to me…. i hear no birds is singing in the mornings the sun is hiding from me… and the stars don’t want to shine again at nights. i am so heart broken…. like a glass smashed…shattered into pieces…. i am so heart broken… feel like dying and waiting for death to come i am so heart broken… my heart beats so fast like roller coaster… there’s no inside, inside my broken heart… there’s only despair, confusion, and tears… .
