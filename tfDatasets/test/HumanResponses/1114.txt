hey people ! so we meet again :) after my previous post if you were feeling a bit afraid whether i'll return or not, don't be anymore. i have returned, and am here to stay ! anyways, since i have nothing really to post, i shall leave you with a small riddle. i liked it a lot when i first solved it. it goes - punctuate the following paragraph to make meaningful sentences - "is is not not not is not is is is is not is not is it not". why i posted this ? i don't know. just remembered it, i don't know why, and thought it is good enough to be shared with you people. anyways the answer is - "is is not not. not is not is. is is is. not is not. is it not ?"! easy, wasn't it ? :p anyways shall be moving now. see you again later ! ankur.
