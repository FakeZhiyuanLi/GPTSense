there are many arguments that can be put forth about the commercial advertising of tobacco products in kenya. i for one feel that the kenyan public should not be exposed to such kind of advertising. we have seen kids as young as 15 years old smoking in public because the commercials can explain much better on how smoking is fancy than a parent can advise his or her kid on the effects of smoking. it is with such maneuver that we have witnessed and experienced family breakups. of course i am not against people smoking, but i am very sure that this very group will agree with me that smoking in kenya among the youths under the age of 18 is on the increase than any other age group, and it is doing so at a very alarming rate. it is essential that if the tobacco companies stop advertising their products on television and radio, there will be a less percentage of the problem that i am bringing up here. give your take.
