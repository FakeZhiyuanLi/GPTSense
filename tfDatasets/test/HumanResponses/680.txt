"what kind of tear are you?[emotional][going to add pictures]" - youre a black tear, and you have alot of depression going on in your life, you might result to selt mutilation. sream in your pillow and cry in the corner of your room, you feel like everyone is after you. or that you have no-where to go. [i can relate] but the best thing to do is to let it all go.just break free. go for a walk, write poetry. or talk to someone you trust.just remember there is always someone who loves you, no-matter how horrible it may seem to be unloved, or how bad you feel it. how heavy it might be, there is always someone there.
