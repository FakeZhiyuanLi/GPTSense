we are drifting apart don't know since when i know we have many differences it used to be allright we are different,but we care for each other no more calls, no more messages i really miss those even.i feel like we are just strangers who just knew one another for a day isn't that sad? where do our friendship go? or is it true people change? do you have change of heart?
