oh, i had forgotten to mention that they misspelled my name on my new jersey. tan-gatue was spelled "tan-gataue". usually when my last name is mispelled, the "e" is replaced by something else, usually an s or an a. this is the first time that tan-gatue was misspelled like this, though. i'm going to have to find a way to remedy this. the funny thing is, it shouldn't have to be. tan-gatue is my great-grandfather's full name in the fujian chinese dialect. the root surname is actually tan. i daresay tan is a lot easier to spell. to save myself the trouble of having to spell it out everytime, i just call myself "philip tan" in minor situations like phoning for delivery. well, if this is the biggest problem of my life, then i'm one lucky sob.
