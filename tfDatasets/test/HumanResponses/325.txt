i live my life freely, but not without structure. even though i'm just a boy, i am a man. confusing you say? not really. you just have to read my mind. oh, so you don't have that ability? everyone in the world has the potential to read a book and a mind. you just have to concentrate on reading and not let your mind wonder. it's easy, if you sit back and listen. but anyway, i'm a well rounded guy. i have many skills that i have worked hard to aquire. one of those is playing the piano. i'm also excited about getting into the bounty hunting business. i try to stay modest. a great man once told me, that the ability of a man is made possible by the perspective of the others around him. soo that is why i'm not cocky. this is my "code." it may be wierd to understand, but this is my look on life.
