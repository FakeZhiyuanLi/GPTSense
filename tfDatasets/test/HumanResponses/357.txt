to become a member of the blogging online community. i am naturally very curious about a lot of things in life (just inquisitive, not a jack-of-all-trades), so hopefully i will be able to blog away and have fun doing it. some of the topics that i plan to regularly blog on (not necessarily in that order of preference) are the internet and online community, computers and tech stuff, philosophy, current events, movies, and psychology.
