alas, i believe that there must've been some reason for the end of the perfect michelle blog. i do miss the sixty something entries that i had saved up, and i do miss the wittiness that was mine which will forever be forgotten in webspace. i am still a little veclempt at the thought of never retrieving my innermost thoughts from the past year, but i figure i'll get by with my new thoughts. the reason i have come to terms with the loss of my beloved weblog is that i figure only positive things can come of this. i will have erased all the negativity that has haunted me over the past year, and this symbolizes the cleansing of my soul. i have come out of therapy clean and now, my weblog is also clean free from the horrible shit that has passed through my life. well, here is the beginning, i suppose. wish me luck.
