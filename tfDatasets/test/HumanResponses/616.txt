i stirred and looked at the clock. half past 6 on the clock. another busy day. i put feet down, bent down to touch my feet. a morning routine of warming up before i started my daily chores. i went out of the room and closed the door quietly behind my back. the air outside was cool and humid, like every day. i checked the lock on the door. locked, as i had last night. i slowly passed the kitchen, to the bathroom for a wash up. i switched on the water boiler, sat on the living room couch . am coughed in the next room. his cough was getting worse. should i send him to school or not? better not i'll take him to the doctor, i decided.
