i just got done watching a million dollar man biography thingy on some channel. pretty interesting stuff about him. his stepfather was none other than iron man mike which influenced him in the wrestling career. his mother was also in the wrestling business. while going coast to coast wrestling for some small curcuits ted recieved a call from vince mcmahon for him to wrestle in the wwf. of course he took the offer and became the million dollar man. but it wasnt enough to look like the million the dollar man, he had to act like it. he stayed in the best hotels, rode in limos, and done everything else a rich person would do. the crowd hated the million dollar man but ted loved it. just some interesting facts i thought i would share about a wrestling legend.
