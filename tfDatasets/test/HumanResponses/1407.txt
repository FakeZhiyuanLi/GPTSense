i got up early today, when to play soccer with my ex army camp mates, quit a good game. after lunch at home i jump onto my bed and take a nap, woke up around evening for dinner. so we went to compasspoint for family dinner, reached home around 10, feeling bid shag i on my laptop and continue to do some touch up on my game intro and storyline. lastly not to forget to write this blog. seriously for today i don't have the mood to do all the creative stuff, the "creative juice" in my head sopped for a while! : |
