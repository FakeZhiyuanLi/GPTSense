fencing is the best sport in the world: the heat, the passion, the adrenaline, the pain, the sado-masochism of it. nothing better in the world. from a freudian point of view this sport satisfies the id, ego and super-ego, and is therefor satisfying in every way and it is therefore the best sport in the world.
