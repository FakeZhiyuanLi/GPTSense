today was kinda ruff, i woke up, well rather kim did and told me to get up so we could work out. well i had a migraine due to the 900 calories a day and a gallon of water thing, you know. so i just had a good morning. afternoon i walked down the street and made some 13-14 year old boys drool. fun! later on i got a phone call from shana talked to her, i guess her and jamar are back together, but as she so eloquently put it, "it still feels a lil funky." my sweety called and i called him back and he was saying how he missed me and he loved me and all that mushy stuff. i also told him the same, but i told him how late at night i get the urges, and he's not there to satisfy them. he's pissed now cuz he's got football training so when i come home, he still won't see me for a week or so. poooooorr baaaaaabyyyyy
