paid surveys online.wtf? i see a lot of sites that say you can get paid for taking online surveys and participating in focus groups and other nonsense like that. what a bunch of crap! a good portion of these sites lure you in with prospects of anywhere from $5 to $150 a survey you take. well, read the fine print baby! those scammers (they may not really be scammers, but it's sounds fitting) insist that you pay something like $30 to start. again, you've gotta pay them money before you can start making it. the ones that are free to join stink just as much. i signed up for one free site. in the past two weeks i only got to do one survey and haven't seen anything for my effort. i was using a different one a while back and got to do a few surveys, but only got points for my time. and it wasn't big points either. i don't remember what the points were worth, but even ten points won't get you anywhere.
