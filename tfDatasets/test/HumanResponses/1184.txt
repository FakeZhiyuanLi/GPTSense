some kind soul has, for some reason, seen fit to give me a taste of totalfark. the only problem with totalfark is that it will now distract me from everything else in my life. i think wendy is already sick of it. but other than that it's really cool. i've already done two fark photoshops as a totalfarker and had one do ok and the other is doing pretty well. i'm gonna start picking and choosing which ones i enter now though, because i don't have the bandwidth that some of the regular farkers do.
