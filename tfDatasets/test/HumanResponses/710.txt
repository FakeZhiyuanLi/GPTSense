i made it through the hurricane. didn't actually have too much excitement out where i was. we lost power for about 12 hours, and have had intermittent blackouts since then. but at least its all over now and we can get on with helping other rebui. wait. whats that on the weather chart sunuva yes ladies and gents, the great joker in the sky has decided on a two for one sale, not on pepsi or any of the million things on my brothers wedding registry, but on natural freaking disasters. this one is currently heading towards the yucatan but i really doubt we will be that lucky. not that i would wish a hurricane on anyone, but another one right now could get real bad, all the shelters and temporary housing up, all the homeless people trying to get out, yeah not good. but the only thing we can do is get as much done while we can and hope that it dies out or hits some uninhabited spot. my thoughts and prayers are with everyone who has lost in this disaster.
