today was a good day! well pretty good it was so boring- we did nothing but talk in all of our classes, they should really start our finals on monday. oh well so i studied a lot for physical science, and mike suprised me and came over for like 45 minutes and we got ice cream. and he dropped me off and went to work. since then, i've been sitting @ home bored out of my mind because it's so nice out and i don't have a fucking car to go anywhere because i don't have my fucking license, which really makes me mad! the cubs lost yesterday's game, it was a good game, but we just couldn't pull through! i really want to go shopping, but i don't think that i'm going. :-/ oh well, maybe some other time. 3 more days that i have to wake up for school which means 3 more days until summerrr! woo finally! lol and my birthday is like a month n 1/2 awayyy :) well i'm gunna go try to find something to do to keep myself occupied with byeeeeeee
