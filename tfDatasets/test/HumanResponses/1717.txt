i took my car into the shop today to have some work done on the electrical system. i had to leave it overnight, so i decided to pop in on my girlfriend at work. she just started a new job and she's been exhausted after each shift. i wanted to maybe brighten up her day a little. so i take two buses and a train, then walk about four blocks to get to the restaurant she works at, only to discover she was given the day off. dammit. two more buses, the train, and another walk to my apartment. total time wasted: three hours. the first thing i'm buying in vegas is a new car. well, i mean the first big thing. i figure i'll probably go to dinner or buy some groceries before i buy a car, but you get the idea.
