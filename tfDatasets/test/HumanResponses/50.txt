hey. it's me here. i heard about these "blogs" a while ago, and after finding one on accident today (of a guy i've heard of), and i figured this would be a good way to express my thoughts and feelings to. just something. maybe if i brush up on communication here, i'll get better with speaking in real life (yeah, right.). but i look forward to jotting my feelings down, so later in life, i can look back on what i had done. that is all. and by all means, don't lose focus.
