i can never be completely honest in this blog. so far it is anonymous, but eventually my ego will cave and i will want someone i know to read it. that means all the tall tales that have neatly put in the vault shall not be revealed as of yet. it also means that deep down i will want to write something cool as opposed to something real. i am such an idiot. i knew it all along.
