oh man- so i went to the warped tour with jess on sunday at raceway park and it was such a barrel of monkeys. in addition to getting a bunch of free stuff: stickers, buttons, slim jims, posters, etc we also got a bunch of great music and tee shirts. we saw a bunch of bands, most of which were really great including: the fear nuttin band, matchbook romance, the casualties, yellowcard, taking back sunday, the washington social club, melee, the kinision, bad religion, motion city soundtrack, and (drum role.) the bouncing souls! the bouncing souls kicked so much booty, i can't even tell you but the real find of the day was neeting melee and the washington social club. they both were super nice and provided great tunes. we even missed melees's set and they did an acoustic one to satisfy our needs to hear them live. we also met the q and the kinision. all in all an uber successful day of spankin tunes, great friends, awesome merch and good times!
