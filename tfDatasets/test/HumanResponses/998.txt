we had a nice afternoon/evening in the boat. we fished for about an hour. i got 5 "makrell" (don't know what that is in english), and hege, my wife got 2 "pale/sei". (don't know what that is in english either.) nice and warm weather. a bit rain when we started, but at the end, the sun was shining. about 20 degrees celcius. we are looking forward to next time already!
