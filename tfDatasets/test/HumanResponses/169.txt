my fellow classmates- at our meeting on monday i had asked matt if i could possibly borrow his formal logic text book. since then i have been thinking that perhaps i am not the only one who would like to refresh/relearn/learn the basics of symbolic logic, (most specifically for me language q). i have a few handouts from course work last summer, "methods of logic" by quine and a collection of essays entitled "a philosophical companion to first-order logic" that i have yet to peruse, but nothing that qualifies as a true text. given the nature of formal logic, i feel that briefly going through a text or even comparing notes on internet research would be x-ceedingly beneficial. is anyone else interested in meeting as a class to go over logical rules and formats? -rinn
