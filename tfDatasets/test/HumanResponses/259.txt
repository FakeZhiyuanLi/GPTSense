each day i live i feel the ache something is missing i'm hollow inside each day i give give way to the ache cover it so no one sees the real me each day i act i forget that i'm fake i go through the motions that make me look sane each day i know i make the mistake i conform my thoughts to be just like you each day i sigh how much more can i take? crowded isolation no one understands each day i cry it makes my heart break no one can express just how they feel each day i bet kepp raising the stake trusting even more of my soul to be seen each day i sing for my own sake expressing my soul, emotions, me each day i pray for those who don't make each moment count life is too short
