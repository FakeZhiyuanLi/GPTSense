the last few days have been really boring. in fact, this whole sem promises to be a boring one. the classes start around 9 in the morning and go on till 5 in the evening. most of them are one and half hour long classes - now, however good a prof may be, one and a half hours of continuous listening is a bit too much to expect. have recently started reading a book called 'any human heart' by william boyd. it's in the form of a private diary. from whatever i've read so far, it seems quite a good book - the celebration of a simple life.
