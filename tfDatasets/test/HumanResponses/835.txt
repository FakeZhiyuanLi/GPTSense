empty and dark an empty space inside so dark and sad gone is my life, my love all i have ever had now you’re a shadow in front a memory behind knowing i will love you until the end of time working your way into my cold hardened heart realizing i was in love with you right from the start you touched my soul with your breathtaking light holding me close keeping me safe through the night you will never understand what, you were, and still are to me to my heart and my soul you will always have the only key a million unanswered questions race through my mind knowing that ever will i dare for hope or happiness to find the next time you are laying awake at night missing me think of all the parts of our souls we allowed each other to see and just remember the next time that you hear our song that i really and truly have loved you this time all along… gia 2004
