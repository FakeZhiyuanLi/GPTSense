i'm reading this book called "stiff". it's about cadavers, the different things that they are used for, the stages of decomposition, autopsies, etc. i found out something that was really disturbing, considering the fact that i am planning to donate my body to science when i kick it. cadavers are used by medical students who are going to school to specialize in plastic surgery. i already knew that before you die, you're not going to know what your corpse will be used for, and neither will your friends or family. the most degrading situation that could happen to me would be lying on a table, dead, with a med. student practicing a face lift on me. or a fucking tummy tuck, liposuction, goddamned implants pretty much, regardless of how much i've denounced superficiality while i was living, there is a slight possibility that i could do the exact opposite when dead. i now consider cremation.
