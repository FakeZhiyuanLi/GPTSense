yay! i got my license today! oh, and i picked up an application from pizza hut, which i'm going to have to drop off sometime tomorrow. i'm so happy about getting my license for some reason. but i'm sad too, because dear 'ol **censored name** got nervous and didn't get her license today. i came into the dmv today just as she was getting out, and i felt so bad for her. i really hope she gets online so i can play healer again. so ironic that i'm the one that gets thrust into that role, is it not? yet, it seems that people with problems are drawn to me. anyway, enough of my life calling garbage. signing off, m.
