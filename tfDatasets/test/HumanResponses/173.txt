my girlfriend is on the way to egypt as i write this. for the next two weeks, i'll be in state of total lost and confusion. every two months or so she would go somewhere for a vacation while i'm trying to bust my ass off to earn cash. can't blame her though, the parents rich. and i'm just a very-late scholar phasing through mid life crisis. =p each time when she goes somewhere i would be like, what am i supposed to do now who am i supposed to go out with then the whole idea struck, if she's going somewhere for a vacation, why don't i just go someplace else too?! i was lucky enough that my boss gave me rm300 (until today i still don't know why he gave me the money, i was in a hang over back then. thanks, dude!) i made myself a passport and decided to go to thailand the end of the month. hehe. thailand, anyone?
