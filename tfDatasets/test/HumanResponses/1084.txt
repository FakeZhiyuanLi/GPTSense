so i haven't updated my blog in a while. why is that, you wonder? well, i've just been too busy. being too busy to take a few minutes of your time to write a few lines of text is not fun at all. okay, i confess, it's partly my own fault. the main reason i've been this busy is that i accepted this new producing job i was offered. the thing is, though, as a start-up production company, you need to pretty much take any jobs that are offered. and don't get me wrong, producing is what i really want to do. it really gets me going. talking to 20-30 possible sponsors just to get 3 hooked is exilarating. you kinda forget all the negative responses. it doesn't matter that it's only for a very low-bugdet 15 minute short, it's still an awesome experience. hopefully, i'll have a little bit more time after this weekend, when shooting has wrapped. i will also try to write a few lines later this week, but that may not happen.
