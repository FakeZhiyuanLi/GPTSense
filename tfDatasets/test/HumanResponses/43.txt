i'm about 1/3 way through my first feature length script and it's been fun. i dropped out of this local production in vegas to concentrate wholly on getting this script done. the production itself was very uninspiring and i feel totally liberated when i was given the opportunity to tap out. it also is a motivator since now i have to come through on my reasons why i wanted to leave in the first place. anybody else working on shiznit? is chris still basking in the uruguay sun or wherever there honeymoon is? also, if you haven't seen anchorman then you must right now! the ending with the dog and bear is worth the price of admission alone. over and out.
