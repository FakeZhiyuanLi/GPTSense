i could never go on a low carb diet. i am such a lazy cook that i rely  no, depend  on the ease of making pasta and rice dishes. on a low carb diet, i would probably starve to death from my own laziness. so maybe it is because i cannot actually see myself living a low carb lifestyle that the whole craze boggles my mind. the speed with which restaurants and food producers have cowered to the diet astonishes me. having low carb options at a bagel shop or a sandwich place just seems like a lost cause to me. but that doesn't come close to ridiculousness of low carb vitamins (vitamins have carbs? who knew?) and the latest invention of coca-cola  c2, a low carb, low cal coke product. low carb soda? this has to be a sign of the apocalypse. that this product exists is such a sign of desperation, an act of leming company. is anyone going to stand up to this atkins diet? i will. is anyone with me?
