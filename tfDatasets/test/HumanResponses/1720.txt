ok, i went to my ecdl class this morning, and just got told there is a new module *breathes in and out* why ? why 8 modules. there's me thinking i kicked 5 modules ass's and i now have three more modules, not two, oh well, just have to do them. the paper sheets for this module 8 has the answers to them which is no help to me, i want to learn without the answers in my face, just have to get my mum to ask me the questions without me looking. just got a phone call from o2, saying i can get more out of my phone, i listened, i hardly understand what the woman was saying and it seemed it went on for every. why don't they listen when you say i am busy { i wasn't really }. babydragon x
