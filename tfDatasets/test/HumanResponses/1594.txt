1) i am not perfect. 2) i am not well physically. 3) money issues are forcing me off of my prozac. 4) the leasing company is fucking with me. 5) showering in the morning is becoming an "issue." 6) i am regressing again. 7) where is danni anyway? 8) last night susan called it her computer. of all the horrible images that raised in my mind. my childhood came rushing back at me and i saw my parents taking away my best-loved toys because someone else wanted them. i was so devastated. if you haven't experienced the horror of being an unwanted child just try and get a clue. they always took away the things i liked and used. they would say "you're the child we never wanted." to this day it still hurts.
