this shall be the first of several forays into pseudo-philosophy, poetry and prose, architiger-style. i imagine the primary viewers of my written thoughts shall be close friends and associates, willing to indulge my need for creative expression with more than a little leniency and good humour. do not take what i write too seriously! remember i am quirky by nature, given to random acts, spontaneity and at times quite unusual perspectives on the world and its inhabitants. that said, find a comfortable seat, relax and enjoy.
