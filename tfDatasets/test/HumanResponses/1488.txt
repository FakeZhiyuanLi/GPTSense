.in my arms, the way i fit in yours. i held you this morning as you slept and i had to fight to let you go when you woke up. i want to see you stretched out underneath me. i want you open and wanting me as badly as i want you. i want to take you with my hands, my mouth, my tongue  any way you want, any way you've ever imagined. i want you helpless to do anything but respond to me  to the press of my breasts against yours, the sound of my voice in your ears. and i want to do it all knowing that as soon as you come, you're going to turn around and demand the same thing of me.
