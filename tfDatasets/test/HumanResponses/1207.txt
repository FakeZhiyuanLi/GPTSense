ok everybody. i'm going to admit i'm not the most unfortunate soul out there. and i feel bad. so i want all of us to start praying for kellie's friend who just lost everything in a fire. psalm 23 a psalm of david. 1 the lord is my shepherd, i shall not be in want. 2 he makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters, 3 he restores my soul. he guides me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake. 4 even though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death, i will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. 5 you prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. you anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. 6 surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever. wow i love that passage. later
