i want to run away and live as a cattle rancher with a rough tough and deep man who will make love to me at the base of a canyon in the middle of nowhere while i scream his name fearlessly in the isolation. we discover artchaelogical finds and he doesn't talk very much and we fight but its really sexy fighting cuz we always end up mauling each other hastily declothing one another and passing out in sheer exhaustion afterwards. when we wake up we're silent and complacent and pretty much forgot about the whole fight and he makes poached eggs and we chew our food silently and surrendered. it would be a nice weekend trip anyway.
