thursday, june 24, 2004 11:32 pm- my first entry it all starts somewhere. "this" is in my parent's basement, sipping on a bottle of ibc root beer, lightly giggling at colin quinn's tough crowd. this is life for me; mellow and sweet. hard to believe that i want to leave this and will be in about eleven months. everything seems to be shorter when placed into months "hey bob! when're you getting married?" "twenty-seven months." "wow, that close?" my point is proven. my plan is simple: move up to royal oak, michigan. once there, enroll in class es at the local community campus (i.e. oakland communikty college) and launch my entertainment carreer. sounds easy, but is probably nigh impossible. i can't think of anything more to write. what an annoyance. i make this damn blogger so i can share my feelings but none of my feelings ever come up! what a fucking pain.
