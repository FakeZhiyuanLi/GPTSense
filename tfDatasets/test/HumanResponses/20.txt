the night darkens, it darkens the world. like the poison in my very own, soul. i'm all alone yet, there are so many people around me. i just can't stand this pain, anymore i've got to get away. silent screams realistic dreams dry tears forgetful fears. and you. seated in silence, staring at the knife. it's blade so silver and shiny it carves scars so deep in my flesh releasing my deep crimson blood i let it drip. when will i awake from this nightmare? this nightmare they call my life. silent screams realistic dreams dry tears forgetful fears. and you. you've treated me in such a way that, (you've lead me to my grave) you've haunted me, screamed at me (you've lead me to my grave) you've hurt me, you're killing me. (you've lead me to my grave) silent screams realistic dreams dry tears forgetful fears. so many fears. and you.
