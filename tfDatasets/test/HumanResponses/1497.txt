i'm back home and still alive, although i had a terrible hang-over today. but now i'm already starting to feel like a human being again. i drank a bit too much and got bitten by lots of mosquitos. i also fell down some stairs and now i've got two huge bruises in my leg. good thing i was drunk so i didn't feel anything. :p but overall i had a very fun juhannus. :) i just don't feel like drinking again for a while. i can't wait to see the photos that i took. i remember taking only 7 photos, but when i checked my camera this morning i noticed that i (or some of my friends) have taken 24 pictures. hopefully there aren't any bad surprises among the pics.
