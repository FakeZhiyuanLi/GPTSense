r ead some new documents about longhorn today, i remembered that someone asked mr.gates when will the longhorn release in the conference in beijing some days ago. it seamed that we still have to wait for a long time for longhorn. i saw a colleague of mine use "looooooooonghorn" as the display name of her msn messenger account. i thinked she must expect this new os very much too. btw, i will try to install a testing version of longhorn and experience it when i have time.
