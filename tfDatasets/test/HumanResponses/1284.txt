nice morning, blue sky, green leafs are shivering by breezy wind. with a cup green tea my grand pa is heading towards balcony. as usual he set on his cozy chair. cleaning his glasses he took his favourite newspaper on his right-hand palm. after reading some of the headlines in naked eyes he put his glasses on. now he is in the deep sea of his favourite columns. i am getting ready for work. my dress-up almost done, suddenly dada called me with screaming voice. i left everything aside and ran to dada. “what happened? why are you screaming at me? is anything wrong?” i replied him with a slowly downing my voice.although he is 85 years old he is commander-in-chief in our joint family. everybody carries his order, advice and request without saying a word.
