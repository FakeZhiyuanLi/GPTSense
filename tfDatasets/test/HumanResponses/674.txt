i can’t put into words how amazing fahrenheit 9/11 is. there are so many opinions i have about it but they’re not worth listing off if you haven’t seen the movie, which, at least for me, opened up a million new thought paths. so what you have to do is go see it and then call me! i want to discuss with as many people as possible. we signed up for the unlimited rentals thing at blockbuster. so exciting! today will be lost in translation, if i get the time. must get ready for new york tomorrow, cheerios audition with maybe a little shopping on the side 
