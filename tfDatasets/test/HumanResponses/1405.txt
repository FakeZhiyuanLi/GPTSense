i haven't done nothing much for my interactive project in the office, but i got to time to sneak to "kinokuniya" to browse some of the flash, director and other design books. somehow i feel that i got a lot of motivation and eager to let my creative juice flow once you browse the books, a lots of idea, tips, and knowledge you absorb. jaye my classmate from my degree course called to discuss about her project, she got problem for the storyline and direction of the game. so i advise her on a few direction she can try for her game. basically her game is about three mischevious kids palying around with dirt in their backyard, their mother was shocked what they have done to their backyard, the kids were so scared that they hid themselves. find out more later from jaye! in the end of our discussion, i think she have a better picture in which direction she going to execute.
