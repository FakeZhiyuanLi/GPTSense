i am absolutely thrilled right now. this is not triathlon related but it is fitness related. i have been wanting to get my pre-post natal fitness certification, seeing as i already teach a post-natal fitness class, but the instructor who teaches it is pregnant again, and is not able to teach it. i recieved a phone call this morning, and was told that i was referred to the organization as a possible trainer to teach the certification course how cool is that? that opens a few more career doors to me.
