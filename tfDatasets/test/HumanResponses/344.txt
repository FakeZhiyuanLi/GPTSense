there is no happier life; the comforts are so sweet when two do meet. 'tis plenty a calm like dropping balm; love's weather is so fair, like perfumed air, each word such pleasure brings, like soft-touch strings; love's passion moves the heart on either part; such harmony together, so pleased in either. sealed with one will. with love god made man one, yet not alone. like stamps of kings and queens, it may be seen: two figures on one coin, so they do join, only they not embrace.
