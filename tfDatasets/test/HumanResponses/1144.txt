memorial day 2004: this is an important day for everyone. remembering the ultimate sacrifice that many young men made for you and me. my father served in wwii. my mother served in wwii. i however never served. i won’t spend time explaining why i didn’t serve. the times were strange back in 1980. i’m an only child and my parents didn’t want me endangering myself, and after watergate and vietnam i thought it was a good idea. i do appreciate the sacrifice through. they did something no young man should have to do. end their time when their just really getting started. so as my kids play and i enjoy having the time to write this, a special thanks to all those brave men in every war and "police action" who paid for my freedom with their sacrifice. thank you! god bless you!
