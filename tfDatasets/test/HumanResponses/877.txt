so i ordered two backpacks from rei today. one 2800 cubic ft and the other 5000 cubic ft. i can't decide which to take since it would be nice to be able to take everything but once i'm there curse myself for dragging all my material possesions all over europe. but then again it would be a drag to not have all my stuff but a relief to have such a light load while hopping on planes, trains, ferries and taxis.i'm thinkin go with the bigger one and pack in betweensolved.
