yeah, i was in toronto this week staying at a friends house, it was alright. lots of aoe2 and beyond good and evil, videogames and the olympics were what passed the time, man how i hate the olympics. it always takes the time spots of my favorite sitcoms! anyways, i want to encourage people *who am i kidding?* to check beyond good and evil! over shadowed by other large games being released this game went way under the radar. utilize a camera to uncover goverment secrets (we won't find any abused pow's don't worry, well actually you will) roam across hillys ( a futuristic planet) in your hovercraft and yes, interstellar ship *unleashes killer metal riff* great soundtrack/voiceover work gameplay is insanely great and the graphics are nicely polished. unfourtunatly it does suffer from some poor camera angles that take away from the gameplay, not to worry slight problem the goods out do the bad 1000 to 1
