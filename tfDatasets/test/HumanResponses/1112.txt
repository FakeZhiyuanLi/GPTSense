all was quiet, so i ventured outside to clean up our garage a bit. kay snuck up on me and scared me nearly to death! she came into my garage and told me she needed help. she said she was a secret agent hired to protect me from the police. fabulous! i always wanted my own secret agent. she told me she had been drugged and "they" took her away. "they" put drugs in her beer and took her id and money. she had to sell her truck for $1000 to get home. "they" took her phone and now she needed my help, do i have a phone she could use? like perfect timing, my cell phone rang. it was francesco, telling me he was on his way home. the phone call freaked kay out, she thought it was "them" and they were looking for her. she wanted me to follow her to her apartment so she could show me something. i refused and asked her to please leave. as soon as francesco pulled up, she said "they're here!" and scurried off to hide in her apartment.
