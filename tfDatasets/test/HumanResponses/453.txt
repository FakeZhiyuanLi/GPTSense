i just listenend to the new wilco album that is due out june 22. it is simply an amazing listen. now, this is a band that plays music simply because they have no choice, they love doing it for themselves and their fans. they release their albums online months before commercial release and still hundreds are lined up on the day of the album's release to buy it. that's what you call trust.
