when i first heard this song, i thought that is my theme song. can you love me when i am not who i normally am? those days when you are pmsing or just down, will you still love me or do i always have to be the happy one? do you love me or the way i am when all is right with the world? last year at the john mayer concert, he talked about this song. he said most people saw it as lovers and he meant it as friends. it is about friendship, how you like your friend no matter what the surrounding circumstances. it is still my theme song. suppose i said i am on my best behavior and there are time i lose my worried mind? would you want me when i'm not myself? wait it out while i am someone else? suppose i said colors change for no good reason and words will go from poetry to prose woudl you want me when i'm not myself? wait it out while i am someone else? and i, in time, will come around i always do for you suppose i said you're my saving grace
