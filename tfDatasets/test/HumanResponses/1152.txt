hi everyone! i have been a litle distracted (and unable to blog) from my life developing some .net applications. one of our main clients is openning a new store on mexico city, so they are rushing us to the neurons so they can start operations with advanced new software. the first application runs on windows ce in a symbol mc-9000g portable terminal . at the moment, symbol's device has been a headache. it's wince personalized os is really a mess. there`s no notepad nor .net compact framwork available neither activesync. the second aplication is a members management application which collects members general information and generates id cards (like the ones in sams club) storing all information in a sql server 2000 database . well folks, im gonna return to my .net debugger for a few more hours (and a few more lines) of happy coding!
