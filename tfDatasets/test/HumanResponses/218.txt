ok this is my first time posting one of these things. monday i plan to edit my poems and send them into australian poetry compititions for the first time im excited bout this, should be the first start i make to a writing career, whilst applying for scientific positions. i really hope i get myself one of teh forensic positions i have applied for i have been working towards it for so long. hi ted if you read this post. i just want to say to you that i feel exactly the same way you do, life is definietly cruel sometimes you find someone you would have the best relationship with and friendship just the best everything and the one drawback is you live in anothe country. maybe you will get to visit in april with your internship i would love it. anywho ciao
