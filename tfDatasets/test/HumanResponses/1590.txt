well, here it is another friday and i feel like this was another useless week. it doesn't matter how hard we work in this office it is like there is never any progress. kids still get hurt and parents still lie. other states ask for help, we ask for help, everyone asks for help. and the help never comes. so you pick up another doughnut or soda or candy bar or . . . and such shining examples of denial. we have a father that come in to visit with his two year old daughter and screams for dear life during the entire time and he tells the judge that the visits are going fine. kind of hard to keep that "professional attitude" going when even the psychologist is laughing at the guy.
