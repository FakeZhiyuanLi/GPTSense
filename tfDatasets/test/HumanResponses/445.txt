ok i'm kinda tired right now from lack of sleep, so this is gonna be short. i talked to my brother yesterday and he doesn't sound too good. we only talked for about 10 minutes and he was out of breath. he was released from the hospital and is going back to work tomorrow (crazy workaholic isn't he? must run in the family because i'm the same way). he, his wife, and their daughter are all coming down in october. i can't wait to see them. finally someone to drink with! lol. anyways, we had the birthday party for lizzie yesterday. everyone loved the cake that amanda (my bestest buddy in the whole world) made. i ended up getting home late from that so i didn't sleep much. damn telemarketers don't get enough of calling my house phone. they are callin my cell phone now too. ain't that a bugger. i better get to sleep now so i can get up and be at least functional tomorrow at work.
