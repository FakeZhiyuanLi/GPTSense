today was a good day.i went to church, learned some good stuff.and i saw you there. you were setting there, as beautiful as ever, and i was happy. later everyone went to the lake, i enjoyed that, espacially the service, were i sat in your shadow. if you only cared for me the way i do for you.ohh, what a love that would be. i've been waiting for a while, but that doesn't matter, my feelings for you haven't dissapated, i doubt they will. your the first person i think of when i wake up, and the first person i pray for, before i sleepwhat a love this could be. countless hours spent dreaming of you, but whats sad, is that your in love with another, and there is nothing i can do to stop it. but all in all, today was a good day.
