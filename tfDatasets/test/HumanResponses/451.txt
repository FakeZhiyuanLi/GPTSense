today i went to work, and my boss responded to me. then she was nice to me all day, but not to any of the other housekeepers that we could see. hmm! i'm very thankful for her treatment to me, but it bothers me that others weren't treated all that well. well, i'll just keep praying for the whole thing. somethin's gotta give, i say! earlier this week one of my uncles had a massive stroke. the amazing thing is that now he's up and walking with assistance! plus he's trying to talk and is looking a lot better than my mom thought that he would! i can't go and visit him because of the distance and i can't get time off work because of our staff shortage. however, i'll just keep praying for him and for my aunt. i'm just totally amazed by his recovery! of course he could still have a stroke and stuff and things could happen, but, still, god is good and has touched him wonderfully! just had to share. good stuff! :)
