i walk around inside my head inside my house dreaming thoughts i sip pink lemonade its sour makes me thirsty for everything i wash my face i love that to clarify yes to clarify i hold myself smooth legs rough arms thinking dreams i write in darkness invisible ink morning reveals mourning reveals i pull in the car not going anywhere tonight that is life on hold i listen for sounds of intelligent life phone calls mostly life in waiting
