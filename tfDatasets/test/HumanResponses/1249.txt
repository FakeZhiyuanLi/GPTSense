yes, everyone laughed when hillary blamed "a vast right-wing conspiracy" when monicagate broke. but just because she was wrong about monica doesn't mean that the conspiracy didn't (and doesn't) exist. right-wing nutjobs (like the current occupant of the oval office and his puppetmaster) are determined to deceive the good people of this country and rule through misinformation and fear. well i, for one, won't let them get away with it! thus, this lonely blog. visit here often to see the right wing's lies exposed (or at least ridiculed). wake up america - they're taking your country from you!
