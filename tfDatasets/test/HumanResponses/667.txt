it's been one of those days where everything is setting me off. i got a new job in the company, and instead of congratulating me, a co-worker says, 'so what made you decide to abandon the sinking ship?' wtf who is she to decide that my job is that bad (it isn't i just want to learn something new)? then, another co-worker lost some papework i gave her, so she decided that it was easier to just say that i never gave it to her. yeah, too bad i have proof that i did. dumbass. i keep thinking about the one thing that i shouldn't. jim. i keep wondering if i'm still infatuated/in love with him, or do i just feel bad for the horrible way i treated him? which is it? love or guilt? and i know that i'll never know, the chances of us ever getting back together are nil, but that doesn't stop me from thinking about it all the time. some fools never learn i guess. i ended up oversleeping this morning, it is lovely to sleep in! at least one good thing happened today.
