wow, what a busy day. i have barely been at my desk. i bought some new fonts today, hooray! of course i had to pick up stuff for other people too, like a tungsten c and some canned air. i finally got my quark 6.1 to install. i hate quark. they make people jump through so many hoops just to use their product. brian comes home tonight, yay!
