man, yesterday was a drag. i went to get my haircut at this place in norwalk. so were in the car and my mom is all like, "well go this way. i know a shortcut". well, it turns out, my mom didnt know any shortcut and we just kept going straight on this weird road somewhere for like 15 minutes. after some crazy winding turns and confusion, we finally got back to the main road, and made it to the haircutting place in time for the 12 o'clock appointment. there were so many homos in there, with their squeeky voices, listening to gay pop music. i was just glad to not get one of them to cut my hair. the lady that i got gave me such a bad haircut. i look like such a homo now. its crazy. but, itll grow back, eventually. and on the way back, i saw two mad crazy black ghetto dudes right in the middle of darien. definetely a rare sighting. alright, im out, later.
