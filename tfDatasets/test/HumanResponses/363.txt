we've been working with a bunch of swedish film students on a short that's been garnering some interest, to the point where they've been doing reshoots. the first roll of those came in today, complete with clients, and someone from channel 4 filming interviews who also wanted some shots of the telecine process. this is the point where i made my excuses, and left the job in the hands of simon, the second day colourist. i've had this before, and if there's one thing you don't want to be doing, it's trying to concentrate on an enormously complex job with a high cock-up ratio, while someone's sticking a camera in your face. all it takes is for one of those tense little moments ("are you sure that's in focus? what's that mark? no, it's more of a warm blue.") and you can see your professional demenour dissolving in public. not nice. simon loved it, apparantly. he made sure they got his best side.
