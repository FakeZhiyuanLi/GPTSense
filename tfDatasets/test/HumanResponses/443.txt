these are just a few of the many, many songs that run thru my head on a daily basis: "i am extraordinary if you ever get to know me. i am extraordinary. i am just your ordinary average everyday sane psycho"  liz phair, extraordinary "when i grow up i'll be stable. when i grow up i'll turn the tables."  garbage, when i grow up "if you still care at all, please don't tell me now. if you love me at all, don't call." jimmy eat world, your house to be continued.
