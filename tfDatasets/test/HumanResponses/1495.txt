goodnight my love. yeah, that was keith's away message last night. we talked a lot online last night, but nothing of real importance. he was thinking about things yesterday but when i asked him he said he didn't have any major revelations and he needed more time. it was so good to read that away message though. it made me all happy and fuzzy. that kid in *general* makes me all happy and fuzzy. i hope this lasts. i'm already getting nervous that he'll lose interest again. he's playing my sg for a song at the tss show on july 9, and he'll have to play it before that to make sure it'll work and stuff, so i know i'll see him but still. i have thet doubtful feeling and i really hate it.
