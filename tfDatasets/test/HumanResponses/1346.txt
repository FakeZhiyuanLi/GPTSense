the day i dread and pray won't came all weekend has arrived and i cannot be more bummed. mondays are always the worst days, its just a fact of nature. anyways i was fighting with my homework all weekend and found that it didn't want to come up on my computer at home so now i don't know what i'm going to do. i guess i'll cross that bridge when i get to it. ~cartoon~ the cartoon is saying that lack of parental supervision is damaging to a child, even more than too much television.
