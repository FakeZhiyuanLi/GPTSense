if you were here i'd never have a fear. so go on live your life. but i miss you more than i did yesterday. you're beautiful well i'm a total wreck and almost every day. like the firing squad or the mess you made. well don't i look pretty walking down the street. in the best damn dress i own? if you were here i'd never have a fear. so go on live your life. but i miss you more than i did yesterday. you're so far away. so c'mon show me how. 'cause i mean this more than words can ever say. some might say we are made from the sharpest things you say we are young and we don't care. your dreams and your hopeless hair. we never wanted it to be this way. for all our lives. do you care at all? if you were here i'd never have a fear. so go on live your life. but i miss you more than i did yesterday. you're so far away. so c'mon show me how. 'cause i mean this more than words can ever say.
