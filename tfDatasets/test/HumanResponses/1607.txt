i just read an interesting little tidbit. you can use melted crayon to color your soaps. that's neat, i'm going to have to try that one next time. also i think adding actual cucumber and avacado to the soap wasn't such a good idea. i imagine it'll make the soap go bad much quicker. i'll have to see, but in the mean time i don't think i'll be passing this batch out to anyone. i'm going to try to use a higher percentage of olive oil in my next batch of soap, and hopefully, find some coconut oil.
