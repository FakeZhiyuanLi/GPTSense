in two more days i will have been blogging for a year, it may not look like it because i've done a little house cleaning. out with the old and in with the new is the system i feel most comfortable with right now. i decided instead of taking some kind of hiatus (which is what i was considering) that i should just wipe the slate clean and begin again. there are quite a few things i had written here that i liked some i even loved, i saved those posts and will add them here and there as time permits. everything else was really just crap. it's possible that anything new i decide to post will be crap too, but that's ok. it just feels right to start fresh, without all the self-depricating, useless drivel. damn i feel good! i hope you feel good right along with me! **update: i've re-posted everything i intended to save - not in any particular order just things i've happened upon that i wanted here. so pretty much anything previous to this post was written some time in the past year.**
