to enlighten those who read my dreary posts earlier, here are some funny things. i swear you haven't lived until you've seen a horse with blue lips and tonge. now, the horse wasn't sick, it was eating a blue lick-it treat. it had the same effect of a human eating a green lollypop. i thought that was something good. and i saw a stand selling fireworks next to a gas station. all it would take was one match and boom! gosh, it's something i can see someone i know doing. haha! just to make you (and me) laugh.
