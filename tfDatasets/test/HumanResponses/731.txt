wow i don't know where to begin this weekend was awesome, camp fires, weenie roasting, marshmellows, live music, in a 3 day period, its great. got to sleep in a tent too! it leaked on my side so i woked up drenched after it rained but that was no problem. chilled with tara most of the weekend, it was really fun! got an ace? ;)
