well, my day has been extremely exciting. this morning i got my driver's liscence! it went really good. after that, me and my mom went to wal-mart and i spent got this super cool steering wheel cover and a cute sponge bob air freshener. of course, seeing a poster stand, i had to buy an orlando bloom poster and a spider-man 2 poster. i also got the three days grace cd, which i totally am loving. if you're into alternative rock, definetely buy this cd. a few days ago i bought the bourne identity dvd, since i'm going to be seeing the bourne supremacy tomorrow. i love it. there's this one part that made me jump really high out of my seat. and wow, matt damon is pretty hot too :)!
