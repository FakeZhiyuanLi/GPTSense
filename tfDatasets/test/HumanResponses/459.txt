ok, so here is the deal, we have a dishnetwork satellite system and we have a dishnetwork pvr (a digital recorder) so we can record channels. so my wife and i have this issue because we generally both want to record shows on during prime time like between 7pm and 9 pm. so we have to fight each other over who gets to record what. do i need to get a separate pvr for each one of us?
