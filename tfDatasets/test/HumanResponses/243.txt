i thought of putting a pic of myself today , but dont really feel like it(they all didnt turn out good ) :s heh heh must get myself a real pose first. hmm nth much been happening today,woke up , did some push ups etc. then met my friend for tea time.played bball at night, ended up having a drink with some of the fellas. not a bad day i suppose. i planned to just rest my mind from thinking of a person i dont want to. but still i fail miserably. i just dont know y after so much that she made me go through , i still miss her. in fact , i think abt her so often that it just gets so hard for me. i just dont know the answer to this question ive been asking myself : y do i like her so much?
