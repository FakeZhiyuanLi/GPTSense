well, i'm just doing this for myself, basically, i'm bored with what i'm doing on c2 code right now, which consists of turning stuff that looks like this: send_to_char("only numeric values are allowed\r\n", ch); into this: co2900_send_to_char(ch, "only numeric values are allowed\r\n"); or this: bzero (buf, sizeof(buf)); sprintf(buf,"%s has a %d gold\r\n", get_real_name(vict), get_gold(vict)); send_to_char(ch, buf); into this: co2900_send_to_char(ch, "%s has a %d gold\r\n", get_real_name(vict), get_gold(vict)); about 4 or 5 thousand times. fun stuff. not. anyway, my new project is a from scratch mud server in cocoa. so far, it's good fun! all i have is a couple classes that constitute a very simple multiplexing and non-blocking telnet server that does nothing. well, it parses through the input and puts it into an array to use later, but that's about it. just laying the ground work!
