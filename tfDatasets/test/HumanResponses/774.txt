taken from the car when i was going thru the i64 west bound. the arch stands tall along the mississipi river. we can ride the tram to go all the way to the top where we can see the view of st. louis downtown, you can see the black dots at the topthat's where the windows areand the arch is designed to swayso you can feel it sways when you're at the top630 feet above the ground. i went all the way to the top once, squeezing in the small tram with 5 other peoplethe tram (elevator) is so small you can't even standyou have to sit your azz down. not recommended for people who are claustropobic.
