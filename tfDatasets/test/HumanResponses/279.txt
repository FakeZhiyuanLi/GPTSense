it's been a while since i wrote in my blog. hope she still checks this out from time to time. why does she always lift me up? she's really like my angel in disguise. she was sent down from heaven to bedazzle me and change my life. am i being exaggerated? maybe a little. but it's still all true. the way she encourages me to go on. to enlighten my mind is a way to say it. she so kind, gentle and obviously as pretty as a fairy. thank you very much. i don't know what to say. i don't even know what to do. tomorrow is cat again. i hate it so much. the way we get pushed aaround by people that we used to know. .that is one of the things i lose interest in school and of course the silly practices i also hate it err- 4get about it. the thing i wanted to say is even though the tides turn, she's always there for me. i'm really confused big time. big time
