stocks are the most boring, complicated thing on the earth. i have no idea what i'm doing. i have little to no money to invest. am i certifiable insane? possibly. i've narrowed it down to index funds and (when i get a job) a roth ira. now i just have the small problem of buying index funds. they couldn't make it easy.oh no! finally figured out to go to vanguard but i can't understand the crap that they're spewing (are you sensing bitterness? i am.) so if anyone on here knows how to get started please help me. i'm not asking for advice in which stock to buy but how to buy them. end rant.
