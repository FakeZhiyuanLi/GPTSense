no one reads this but that's okay. this is good for me. like therapy. it helps to vent. today i woke up at 7 to work with daddy. ashlie and i worked like. something that works really really hard! (i don't know i am to tired to think!) but yea, the cat house is so huge! we still aren't finished with it! we'll finish it tomorrow. last night i realized that i had been lied to. and if you know me you know i absolutely hate being lied too. i have been played. i thought i was smart enough not to be, but as it turns out some players are really good with concealing their motives. but i’m still not upset or mad… i’m just frustrated. i could have been persuing the guy i truly liked instead of wasting my time with a player. but i have a plan… its going to shock the hell out of this guy! i’m tired of chickening out when i think about doing it. i know i need to do it the next time i see him before it’s too late. hmm… i think that is it for today. cat
