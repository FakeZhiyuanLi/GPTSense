before i forget. i had a wonderful meeting with a few oldsters and their faith-sharing group. i just became catholic on easter and was asked by one of the sisters to join them and share my journey. it was wonderful. what a supportive group. the group consisted of people in there 60's, 70's and 80's. it is great talking to people older than me. they usually have very interesting stories and have a great deal to share. there was also a person there with brain cancer. she had just been treated for it last summer and now she has a tumor growing on the side of her head. what courageâ€™s woman. wow, my problems pale in comparison to hers. everyday is a gift. remember that! i'm gone.
