well, i am officially exhausted. the adrenaline has run out - for now. i could have slept all day, but we had another full day of orientation/training. also, i forgot to mention that yesterday when nate and i were out and about in hong kong, i made a trip to a public restroom that looked all fine and dandy. to my surprise, this bathroom had no toilet paper and people had to bring their own. fortunately i had some napkins to use.i guess this isn't so rare in china, but i was not expecting it to happen in hong kong. that's traveling though, right? prepare for anything!
