i've noticed in the past years, that i'm extremely affected by my surroundings. if i live in a nice place with a nice neighborhood, i feel determined, motivated, and content. when i move or just spend a lot of time in a dumpy part of town, my mood turns sour. this isn't just a minor mood change, mind you. this is a full blown change of perception, actions, and life overall. why does something as simple as surroundings, effect me so much? i've asked around and i seem to be in the minority with this phenomenon. unfortunately i don't have the monetary requirements to move into somewhere nicer at the moment, so i suppose i'm stuck. your perception is your reality, and mine is on the decline.
