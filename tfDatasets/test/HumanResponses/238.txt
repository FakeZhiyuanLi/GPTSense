i stopped by dq today on the way back from lunch, and i decided to give the new brownie batter blizzard a whirl. my friends i advise you to stay away from this mound of brown pleasure at all costs. i think someone must have slipped some kind of drug inside of this thing. every bite made me feel like that blonde no-name chick in the matrix 2 (reloade, revolutions whatever it was called). it was as if the dq women was the weird sounding guy from the matrix giving me a virtual wet spot in my pants with each bite. problem is after i was done i felt i needed more, so there must be something to my drug theory, or else i'm just an ice cream whore. so do yourself a favor, go for something plain like the oreo blizzard and stay away from this mocha blast of excitement!
