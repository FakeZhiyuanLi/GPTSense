hey it has been a while since i have posted anything. everything seems to be going ok. we have about 28 school days left well at least i do. i will be going back to flordia for summer and i will be down there for about 6 weeks. i know what everybody is saying doesn't it get kind of boring going down there 3 times a year but no it doesn't. well i am excited about cassy's party. i will make sure that my swim suit is "g" rated. i will try my hardest not to wear my thong bikini. nothing much happened to me today except i saw like this 6th grader smoking pot witch is really gross. i would never do anything like that. well i am going to go. toodles
