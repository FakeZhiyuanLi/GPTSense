well, i'm back from moab. unfortunatly, i'm back from moab. so, now i'm grumpy and i freaking hate all this "not-being-able-to-go-swimming/rock climbing/self-in-sand-burying-whenever-the-freak-i-want-to". i'll probably snap out of it after a bit more playing around with the computer; i love my computer. so, expect more crazy websites and biting political dialogue, not to mention my blog as well.
