i thought you were everything to me you represented everything i gave you my all thinking you had all the answers but now. i have moved on. finally i have found happiness and for once it doesnt include you. i met him. i thought he was nothing because you were my everything. he showed me the way. he gave me his hand to hold. and i climbed the long journey with him. putting my trust in him. and for once i am not afraid to move forward with someone else. i no longer blame myself. i no longer hold on to past regrets. i have realized my mistake in placing the blame on me. when you were the one creating all the problems. its ok now. its over now. all we have left are memories and. i have began a new journey. so now i whisper final words in my last chapter to you. goodbye.
