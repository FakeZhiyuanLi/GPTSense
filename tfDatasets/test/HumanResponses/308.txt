last night was the shiet! lol. well i gotta say what happened first. i went for my 2nd interview at chillis but the manager that was supposed to interview me was in a fuckin meeting! and trina told me that those "meetings" are just them drinking beer and what not! i was like fuck it was so gay cuz its such a hassle to go down there!but anyways my mom piched me up from there and she gave me $50 for ryans birthday! it was so nice. my dads being such a jerk he still won't give me money for her present! but anyways then i hooked up with ryan and lynsey, sarah and fran(finally!). then we went over to ryans friend chrises house and there was this guy andrew there as well. so we all got drunk and i invited sophany, sophana and trina over lol there was so many of us! it was awesome though! oh yea and it's ryans birthday today!
