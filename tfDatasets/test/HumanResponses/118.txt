my mother loved this dip with crackers. she always made it for christmas eve when we would put out a tableful of snack food for the occasion. she made this dip mainly for the adults, herself and dad. the kids like onion dip better. now, as an adult myself, i can appreciate the subtle flavors of this dip. try it and see for yourself. 1 8 ox. cream chees, softened 1 small onion, grated 1 jar pimentoes, blended 4 tbs sugar (or less) 4 tbs vineger 1 lg egg blend sugar, egg and vineger in a double boilers and cook until thick. remove from heat and add other ingredients. beat and chill. (i usually put everything in a blender)
