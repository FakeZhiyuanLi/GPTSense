ok the match itsself was pretty good ill admit. i know benoit is the champion and would probably win but i didnt expect him to win the way he did. the last 10 minutes of the match benoit was pounding on kane like he was a little baby, then out of nowhere comes a crossface and he beats him. that really makes kane look like crap. they do this all the time with kane, they make him look indestructable and then at the ppv he loses his match. maybe he has superpowers and looses them when he enters the ppv. they done it at the undertaker vs kane match as well. the least they could have done was make kane look like he was a decent wrestler and maybe have a chance at beating taker. bottom line. they build kane up for the big event and make him loose. maybe they should put the belt on kane to make people fued with someone else that is not triple h.
