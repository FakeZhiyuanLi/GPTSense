i sift through so many ya books each week. it is an experience when i find one that such pleasure to read. this is not to say that there is a shortage of good ya lit, just that i'm still playing young librarian catch-up so i try to read it all. sometimes i feel a little overwhelmed. the story of death of olive barstow just lifts off the pages. henkes communicates the sense of uncertainty and immortality with such ease.
