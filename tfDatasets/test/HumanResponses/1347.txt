tgif everyone! its finally the end of the first school week and i'm extremly excited. friday is always a good day except for the fact that it tends to go by slower than any other day but thats ok because when its over i have a whole two days without school. its amazing how everyone mood changes on a friday, hardly do you ever find anyone in a bad mood even if they were in a bad mood for the rest of the week. well 6 hours and 50 mins left till i go home. yea ~cartoon~ the cartoon is about a man who bascially has to withdraw his whole life savings from the bank to buy and pay for school supplies.
