i am currently playing the mega man anniversary collection game for the ps2. this is a great game for any mega man fan or old school gamer fan. for just a mere 30 dollars you get mega man 1-8 plus 2 arcade mega man games that were never released in the u.s. beat that. the game is also full of original art from the creators, new remixed music inspired by the series, and lots more. the game also features two ways to play the game. you can either play it totally original, meaning the games being played exactly the way they were meant to be played on their original console system, or you can turn the "navi mode" on and play the game with all new remixed music and a new "hint" mode that gives you free hints when things seem to get a bit hairy in the game. that is all for devin's reviews for the games he plays.
