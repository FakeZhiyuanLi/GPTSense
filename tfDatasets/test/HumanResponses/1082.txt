i added a countdown to my desktop this morning. it counts down to when the plane heading for usa, and my vacation, takes off. seems like a very long time at the moment, but i'm hoping it'll be more inspiring when i see the days ticking away. either that, or i'll go crazy and remove it. we will see. there's usually something to count down to, to look forward to. if it's not christmas, or your birthday, it's vacation, someone else's birthday, or maybe just a big event. people usually counting down to things, and i'm not really one of them, have a lot of stuff to count down to this year, especially the sports fans. i don't know if that is stressing them out, or if it makes life little easier. for me, sometimes, the only thing that keeps me going is knowing i have just 1 month, 24 days, 4 hours, and 5 minutes left until take-off.
