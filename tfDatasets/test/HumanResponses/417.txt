i hate paperwork. i think i might be in a minority there, ha ha. i've decided to finish the library books before i get started on the other one. bit of a pain, but. richard's looking at me again. it's hard to know whether he's in love with me or i just have something on my face. i wouldn't know flirting if it stuck its tongue in my ear, but you can't ignore all those glances and little compliments and things. still, i doubt it because i thought he was with that coffee woman, whatever her name is, something swedish. if only it were alan - i can't count the number of times i've looked at him like that, but no, not a glimmer, he couldn't care less, it had to be richard , didn't it? no. probably not even richard. not even bloody richard.
