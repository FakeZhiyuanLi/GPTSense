i have just about had it with this wireless internet bullshit that i got. i spent around $200 to get the router and pc card for my laptop, only to find out that the signal is really only good in the next room away from the router (because of the materials used to build the house i am told). not to mention when i am lucky enough to get a signal that stays with me for more than 20 minutes, my neighbors have a wireless system in their house, which interferes with mine. theirs must be better than mine because it keeps booting me off mine somehow. so now that i have spent all that money to get the wireless, i gotta drop around another $100 to get the wired internet and i am stuck with the wireless equipment. any buyers?
