cnn.com - julia child dead at 91 - aug 13, 2004 : "(cnn)  julia child, who revolutionized cooking in the united states with her cooking school, cookbooks and television shows, has died, according to a statement from her publisher, alfred a. knopf. she was 91." ok, i know the lady was old (and has come across as ancient for quite awhile now), but it still saddens me that she has passed. obviously, i am too young to have experienced "the french chef." but when "baking with julia" was on pbs during the mid-90's, i was right there every saturday afternoon, watching even when it was a repeat. i also bought the book, and i have never purchased a $40 pbs-related book, before or since! i still miss that show, and was secretly hoping for a follow-up.
