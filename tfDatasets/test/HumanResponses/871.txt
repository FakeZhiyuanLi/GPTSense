before i go on this european trip, i must make a trip to good-ole austin.it's been a year since i left and frankly it feels like yesterday. so many things have changed but so many things haven't, it's weird, the displacement hasn't really affected my sense of time.feels like yesterday.againthe things that i miss about austin: picnics at barton springs sushi at musashino's bubble tea at momoko's live music at stubb's bbq, emo's pretty, lazy sunday mornings breakfast taco's at the taco shack gelato at dolce vita apparently it seems as if i may miss the food more than anything.haha
