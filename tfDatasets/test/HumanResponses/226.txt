1 (one) 0.5 lb salmon - tasty. 5 (five) lamb tacos - okay, but no cilantro. neither myself nor my roommate have anything even remotely related to a green thumb. we watched our garden slowly die with a numb sort of fascination, though we did get a month's worth of parsley and basil out of the deal. 1 (one) vitamin water - lemon-lime, stress-b, the new tap water.
