i cant belive i forgot 2 say about this yes2day, we got this new rug :/ it dosnt even fit the style of the room, its long and rectangular and its just put accross one side of the room and dosnt fit properly, it looks as though we cant afford anything that would fit in with the room so we had to use that even though it probly cost more then one that fit the room would :/ oh well ill update about 2day l8ers.
