computers rule. plain and simply. right now most of us can't imagine a life without computers. we work on them, we play with them, we play with ourselves with them, we can do whatever we want now. what better source of amusement? no wonder people screw around with it! you can find out anything about anyone, do anything to anyone, take away their lifeline, thus kill them. maybe people who screw around are annoying, but they have the right sort of idea: if you screw around without wanting to destroy completely, it keeps you on your toes and stops people from really wrecking your life. stop complaining and repair their damage and look out better than before!
