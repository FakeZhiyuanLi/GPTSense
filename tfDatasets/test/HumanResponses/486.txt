well yesterday i got a call from an ex. somebody that i totally blew off for no reason. i really really cared about him, and that's not easy for me. i have cared so much for him for 4 years. this summer he tried to get back with me, but i was too afraid to be with him because i had no clue what to do about my feelings. i just pretended like nothing was there. that was easier to do than to let him back in. well, we've been talking about issues and tonight is when we really talked. he knows me. and i like to think that i know him. he gets me and puts up with all my stupid crap. i've realized that i don't want to just be with anyone that come around. i want to be with one person. and that's him. i'm being so sappy, and for those who know me, u know that i'm soooo not like this!
