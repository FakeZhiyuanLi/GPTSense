hi, i think to close this blog. i have another one where i'm writing on in french. some people have been reading it since i opened it. i don't think writing to nobody in english will help me to improve it. maybe. i don't know if i must to close it or not! i like writing about everything. i don't like studying english in english book, because i can't memorise all what i read. but, i learn a couple of new words and i'm very happy because i understand what i read. i am a little tired today, because i went to bed at one thirty yesterday. i got up at ten thirty. i begin to have some good friends, i'm very happy. i need it. thanks.
