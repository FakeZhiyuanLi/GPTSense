some very close friends of mine, as well as myself, find this verse very cool. i figured i would share it with you all. philippians 1:6 for i am confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of christ jesus. as we learn to grow in the grace and knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ we will realize that the perfecting does not come from us. the more we learn to allow christ to live his life through us we will begin to really live. yay god! more on this subject later!
