every time every time i hear your name i smile inside. every time i see your face i start to glow inside. every time you say my name, my heart beats faster. and every time i am not near you my inside utopia starts to fade. weather you know or not you are in my heart. you have made a lasting impression, its like a perminant finger print where no one else could ever reach in my heart. one day you will know how much you mean to me, and i hope i will mean as much to you.
