another day that will probably go down as being wasted, went and looked up shiny rocks for zak, not sure what will come of that, gettin ready for the wedding this weekend and trying to figure out what the heck i am gonna do about an apartment next month. this town is too freakin expensive. but at least i get my daily call from the annoying client who just can't take a hint.
