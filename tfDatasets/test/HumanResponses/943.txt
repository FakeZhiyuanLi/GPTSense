god i love bubba ho-tep. i fell asleep watching it last night. today i'm feeling loads better. literally it was measured and it came out to a load. so nothing good happened at the mall. my item i was questing after was unavailable. i met by friends sister who works there. other than that no revelations occured. however i hate the transit system for west vancouver.because it sucks my ass. i waited for 40 minutes, which is actually short from past experiences, for a bus way behind schedule. oooh and i had sushi for dinner. bc rolls rock. if they played guitar they would bust out some page inspired solos. mmmm bc rolls. so there's my insane diary. -hip-happening gavin i could have lied i'm such a fool.
