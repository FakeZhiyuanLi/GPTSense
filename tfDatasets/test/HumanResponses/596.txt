today: sunday: sickening. i should have listened to kawaiikunaii and lacan. now, look what i have got myself into? not only have i lost my voice, now i have a fever to match. sigh. maybe i should sleep? maybe i should just watch tv. nah. talked with lacan yesterday. well, i should have included this in yesterday's blog. but, i didn't. i don't know. maybe i dont wanna know. what ever the contents were, it was childish. i tried to forget it. but, it's just too hard. maybe's the way he speaks to me. he should stop talking with girls like that. it gives people the wrong ideas. well, it gave me the wrong idea. and, maybe he's treating me like this because he pitied me. come to think of it, i pitied myself too. that's why i have this blog. pity pity pity. okay, enough about that. here's something i drew/cged yesterday. wanna dedicate this to kawaiikunaii. hope this cheers him up when he's down. mp3 recommendation: tune the rainbow  sakamoto maaya
