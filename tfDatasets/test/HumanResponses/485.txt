school is back in yay! well my week was pretty uninventful. i went bowling on friday and i also went to a chruch lockin. it was pretty fun, we played mafia and a game called underground chruch. it's relly hard for me to explain in typing, but trust me when i say it's like hide and go seak on crack.it's a sweet game. well thats about all i got now, i'll try to do something more interresting later on in this week.
