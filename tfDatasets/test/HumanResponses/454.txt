it really isn't a question of whether or not to do so, but rather a question of where and on what. i have blogged every day for the past 23 years in my thoughts, essays, and arguments. it is now time to put it into a modern medium, a more colorful and legible form. so here it is, a page dedicated to me, myself, and i, on what i love, even if it will never love me back.
