my sister-in-law got a virus on her computer today. well it's been there a week or so but i took the time to id it today. i got to thinking. what if my newly connected computerized life support system (i use wearable medical devices that i have connected together and to my pocket pc to make controlling them easier and well the ppc is wireless to the net all the time) what if they got a computer virus, or a virus that infected my ppc made them go haywire. not a pretty sight believe me. i have an antivirus software installed on all my connection points but not on the ppc; not enough mem to put one. one more thing for a borg to think about. llap
