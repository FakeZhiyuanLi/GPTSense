it seems that i am missing 3 hours from a humanities class. this, plus the 12 hours i'm already having to take to graduate will be a real bummer. my only hope is to find a class that will sub in its place. i know when i registered last semester, i had this humanities class mess fixed. i guess i'll be going back over transcripts to find out what subs there again. :-(
