yeah, so since i got my new modem i have been disconnecting from the internet every four or so hours, which really sucks because i am in #idlerpg. i became a net admin on irc.lazychat.net which rocks, now i need to buy that irc junkie tshirt off of jinx.com. now we just got to get all the services (nickserv, chanserv, botserv etc) my modem problem does seem to be fixed, so i am going to play cs.
