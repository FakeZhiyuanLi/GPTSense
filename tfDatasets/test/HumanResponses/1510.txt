i hate this typing thing. i type something up and it's deleted.*twitch* well nevermind that. i have discovered the secret to why heero yuy never dies when he commits suicide. duo is afraid that if heero dies, then he will never get to have hot yaoi mansex again because quatre and trowa are never leaving each other and wufei is just ugly. so whenever heero tries to kill himself, duo just goes on break, which really pisses off his employer, because he gets paid breaks. metal dungeon sucks. never rent a game you've never heard about, because it will most likely suck. they call it a horror game? ha i get creeped out more by elmo's world than i do this game. mood of the day: random and crazy bishie of the day: sephiroth hojo
