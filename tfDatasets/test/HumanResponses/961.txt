csi is one of my favorite shows but tonight's episode struck me as a bit weird. did anyone else think the character of the murderer could have been a x-files? grissom called him an "anomaly"(sp?). the murderer (named todd coombs)had a twin embryo that never formed and somehow his "brother's" dna merged with his so that he had two sets of dna. his blood's dna differed from his hair dna and that is how he got away with rape and murder. fox and scully could've solved this one! i wonder if this is the season finale or if there's another new episode next week. tonight is without a trace's season finale. if i only had a brain, dot
