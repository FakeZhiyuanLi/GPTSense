rant: when someone describes something, and you don't understand, so they proceed to describe the same thing, the same way they just described it, thinking repetition will help the situation. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- it doesn't help. when someone doesn't understand something, it usually helps to try and describe whatever it is you are talking about in a different way. many times, at work, i hear representatives speaking to a customer, repeat exactly what they just told a customer two or more times, not because the customer didn't hear them but because the customer didn't undersand. not hearing vs. not understanding require two different remedies. oye vey
