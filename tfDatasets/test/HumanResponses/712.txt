anyone want a boxer? she's cute, housetrained, doesn't eat much, and runs like a freaking deer. she got loose this morning and ran over 2 miles away, i had to drag her back by her collar (getting later to work every minute) which took a total of almost 3 hours of running, stalking or dragging. all of this in the golden ghetto, a great neighboorhood to be running around in the back yards. so yeah if you want one shes yours. i'm thinking of going to iaido tomorrow. just watching, seeing if i want to go to the all-day deal on saturday. any opinions? and to the people who have commented on me, you rock! although the one of love was kinda irrational. but thats ok! (i work for a divorce attorney, we treat love like the iceberg treated the titanic) back to (allegedly) working!
