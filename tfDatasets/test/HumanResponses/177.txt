the vote on this one was tied 3 to 3, so i guess i'll have to decide for myself. my own personal opinion would probably have been darwin, just because it seems so amazing that he came up with the theory of natural selection before so much of modern science, such as genetics or the concept of dna, was well known. plus, i actually find his theories convincing, whereas i've got to agree with alex that aquinas's reasoning doesn't really do it for me. but in the end, i have to go with aquinas based on the strength of elgen's argument. if a million chumps came up with a million theories, and one of them turned out to be right way ahead of its time, we would all celebrate that person today as a genius. but with aquinas, he believed the same things that everybody in his day already believed, yet he still made a name for himself by making his theories so confusing that nobody could prove him wrong. that's got to count for something.
