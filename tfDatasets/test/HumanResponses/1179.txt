ok, this week, i'm going to moan. i've been suffering from really bad hayfever this week. worse than i've ever had before. is it just me, or is everyone the same? i've spent the entire week dosed up on antihistamines and sucking strepsils. i'm not a happy bunny! headed home last weekend to durham (where my folks live), and spent a bit of time with them and my dog. my parents look after him, as i've got a one bedroom flat on the fourth floor, and i work long hours, so it wouldn't be fair for him to live with me. so i only get to see him every few weeks. it's his twelfth birthday today, so happy birthday ozzie! anyway, more soon, but "time for bed, said zebedee".
