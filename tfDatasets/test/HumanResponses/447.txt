the purpose of this blog is to track my progress as my life takes a new direction. after a few years of drifting i've set a new path; new life goals. i will also use this blog to reflect on current events and my reaction to them. i've been reading blogs for a couple of years now so it i've decided to take the plunge. hopefully i will not bore anyone to tears.
