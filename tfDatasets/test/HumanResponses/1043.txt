i like blair. i listen to his speeches in the house of commons a lot more that i listen to bush at his ranch in crawford. i do believe that he is a born leader out to make positive progress. as i was reading the bbc news online about him accepting that there may be no wmds in iraq, i see the leadership feature in him. but as i continue reading on how he was taking question in the house of commons and it comes out that he supported the war in effort to get involved in the middle east peace process, i see fault. it is like a business. barter trade if you like, exchange of good for good, or exchange of services for services. it sounds like a fair deal but one of the receving end is far much better than the other one.
