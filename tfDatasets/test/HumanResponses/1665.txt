its 1am im freakin bored. im waiting for my friend to come online, i missed her like an hour ago which sucks, irc is boring. i downloaded a shit load of pirated software today, i got trillian pro and not only do you need the program you also need a login for the program. so i guess i gotta find a hacked acount. heh i found my old dj tiesto cd, nyana i think that is the first electronica cd i ever bought. im listening to it now. i installed tkl and i already have 26,000 keystrokes not bad for an hour eh? damn im a loser. next week im either going to be buying an external hard drive or an ipod i dont know which one i want yet. my frind king_of_hate is currently in hospital for an attempted suicide. thats his second attempt in like 2 months, that really sucks, anyway i best be off.
