tears, tears paint my face, pour from my eyes, wash over me, and fall, gone from my face, my life, like you now. yesterday, you were here, for ten years, you were here, for me, always, my best friend, to you alone i cried. tears, tears, i cry, to you, for you, gone, but in my heart. i see your eyes, eyes full of understanding, of love, of sadness yet happy still, i see the cute way in which you slept, i smile through the curtain of my tears. i think of that day, you alone, i alone, you lying there shaking, seizures sweeping over you, helpless. now here i lie, helpless, helpless to stop these tears.
