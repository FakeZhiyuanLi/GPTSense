. and i have writer's block already. good start. i guess i should introduce myself. i'm mike, i'm 27, and i'm an english ex-pat living in scotland. when i'm not working (which seems to be pretty much solidly, these days!) i spend my time taking photos, in the hope, one day, to be able to give up working behind a desk, and get out into the real world! i'm very lucky to be where i am, though. i live in leith, the northernmost part (and becoming one of the trendier areas) of edinburgh, and i work only a couple of minutes walk from princes street. anyway, enough for the first blog - don't want to spoil the fun for later!
