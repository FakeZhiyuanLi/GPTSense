this idea is ingenious, and i'm working on the patent right now. a small calculator-like computer sits on the table. you quickly enter all bets played, the entire board, and at the end, your hole cards. the computer will calculate, depending on each bet towards you and your hole cards, whether or not this was a good move. after it decideds, it will then use this formula: if(badmove==false){ end; } if(badmove==true){ shock=potsize * (1/oddsofhitting) * yourloss; } and shock, of course, is the number of volts shot into your brain. and yes, i'm kidding.
