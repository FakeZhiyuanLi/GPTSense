nothing much to report on since last writing. i took caden to my parents (nana and granddaddy's) house on sunday and we got to swim. caden loves the pool. we also wanted to see them before they left town. wendy, caden and i get to go stay at their house this weekend and watch our dog, duke, who has been staying with them while we're stuck in an apartment. it will be nice. our 4th anniversary is also on friday, so it will be nice to spend a relaxing weekend together.
