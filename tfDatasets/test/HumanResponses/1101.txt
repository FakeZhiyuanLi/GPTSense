yesterday i drew this awesome pic of the character in my new manga. i mean seriously, he’s hot. then i (technically) went to sleep. well, today so far has been…annoying, i suppose. my evil stepdad woke me up at 6:30 am and told me to take a shower so i could help my mom with my sister and brother ‘cuz he was going to work. so i complained a bit and took that shower. by then he was gone, so i went to my mom and was about to tell her straight out how i felt when she told me that all she had said was “i would like some help” to l. but didn’t say to wake me up. and by the time she knew it was too late (sounds kinda like one of those trials on tv if you ask me. lol). so i didn’t get all pissy at her too much and ate the rest of the chex cereal and went back to sleep. then two hours later i woke up. i played zoo with my little sister for a little bit (gag) and then got on here. that’s all i’ve done so far. so i’m gonna go. see ya.
