hallo y'all it's the first time i've ever written a blog. hmm. i suppose i'm venturing into the realm of the unknown. :p i'm still in england. can't wait to get back home, i arrive on monday :d. anyway, touring nuts sounds good, i agree it would be good to develop it, as i think we didn't explore it fully. i saw 'guantanamo' last night in london, which was amazing. any of you who are coming to england see it! hope everyone is having fun. bjs, viki
