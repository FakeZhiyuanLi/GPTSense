well, i went and did it. bought 10 balls of hazy at the sale it just looks so lovely and i know there are other patterns in the tape thing book that i'll want to knit. am dithering over the black shadow since i know i'd wear black more often, but so far am resisting. so does anyone else have swatches to show? am curious how slipping knitwise vs. purlwise changes the look of the pattern, if at all. later!
