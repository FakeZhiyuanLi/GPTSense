if it isn't one thing it's another. first i start having trouble with my lower back and now my right shoulder is giving me pains. my diet isn't working, the cholesterol medication the doctor gave me has painful side-effects, it's allergy season and my landlady is being a bitch this weekend. i can't get a minutes peace even when i leave the house.
