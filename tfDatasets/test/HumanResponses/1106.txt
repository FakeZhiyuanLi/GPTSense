i wrote about being afraid to talk to n______, but i didn't understand why i was afraid.until i turned on the tv. i only had to watch one second of television to see why i couldn't speak to her. how am i supposed to have confidence when no one will help me on the most important form of communication that has ever existed? i've seen movies where the underdog succeeds, but it's only by a stroke of luck. how can a real underdog succeed when he's being dogged?
