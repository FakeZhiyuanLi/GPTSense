i am the little panda, therefore there is a big panda. you can't have one without the other. of course, the big panda is my boyfriend. we don't get to see each other as much as we want to, the big panda has a job that requires travel and for some reason also requires him to have an apartment in kansas city. for the next two weeks, i will be going to the lovely city of kansas city. he is the second major relationship in my life. the first one ended disastrously with a dear john letter and i'm very glad that it did cause i wouldn't have met the big panda and i wouldn't be so happy now. i don't believe in soulmates but the big panda is the closest thing to one that i will ever have.
