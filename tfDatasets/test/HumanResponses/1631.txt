had to work today. that was exciting. i'm getting so bored with my job.this always happens to me. took me longer with this one. will be 2 years in sept. and i'm just tired of going there every day and getting run over with the bus. my forehead does not say cota stop. ugh had alot of fun actually today>i got to see a bunch of people that i rarely get to see. i don't usually work weekends. went to lunch with a friend that used to work with me that i don't get to see much now. it was a good time. i miss her dry wit that is so much like mine. we are such different people, that i almost wonder why we get along so well, but we do. last we talked on the phone, she said she had something to tell me that she couldn't tell me on the phone, but she didn't mention it so i didn't either. she'll get around to it i guess. thats about it. nothing much else happened. ho hum
