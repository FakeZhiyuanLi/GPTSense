i'm falling head over heels for you i'm not ashamed, just afraid of you i'm running away from love and from you i don't have anywhere to go but to you what do you want me to do i'm falling head over heels for you i saw you sitting there with your friend i didn't know how to talk to you but then you looked over at me and you said hi there it goes, my heart just had to fly i acted cool, calm and collected i knew that i wouldnt be rejected you felt the same way about me and i knew that this could really be something amazing and wonderful looking around, i didnt see another girl i caught him, he is mine leave me alone, i am just fine i'm falling head over heels for you i'm not ashamed, just afraid of you i'm running away from love and from you i don't have anywhere to go but to you what do you want me to do i'm falling head over heels for you i'll finish this song later!
