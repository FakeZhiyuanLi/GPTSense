i wanted to go mini-golfing today, but the place i love to go to went out of business ='( my runner up activity involved going to see collateral, but according to a few sites, there are 20+ f-words spoken. i mean, i can stand a lot of profanity, and even an occasional f-word, but 20+ in two hours!? over-freakin'-kill. so now i'm bored. someone suggest a good webgame or activity. i wanna do something
