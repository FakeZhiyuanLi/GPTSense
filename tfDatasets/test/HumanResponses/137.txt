my friend matt said this the other day: "if you think life is bad now, how would you like to be an egg? you only get laid once. you get eaten once. it takes four minutes to get hard, only two minutes to get soft. you share your box with 11 other guys, but worst of all, the only chick that ever sat on your face was your mom! so cheer up, your life isnt that bad!" thanks matt
