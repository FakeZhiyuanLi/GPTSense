i used to believe when the time is right love will come to me i used to believe when i love someone and love him with all my heart sincerely he will love me back i used to believe when two persons really love each other nothing can ever separate them i start to question all my beliefs when love keeps passing me by when the one i love doesn’t love me back when a truly loving couple have to be separated now….i don’t believe anymore now…. i believe in something more powerful that believing it’s called faith…
