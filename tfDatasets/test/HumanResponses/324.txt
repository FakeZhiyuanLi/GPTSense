i’m not much of a sexual guy. sex is a complexity of its own really. some people search for this oasis like it’s the answer to life’s problems. i believe it’s a commitment and vow a person should make to someone they have an extreme closeness to. a gift of pleasure to the significant other. (sigh)… poor nicole. nicole is a girl that, i think, wants me. she recently told me that she would give up her virginity to me in a bathroom during my fourth period class. honestly… what do you say to something like that!? “thanks. i’m sure the sex would have been incredible if we were in a different lifetime.” i can’t, though. i couldn’t hurt this girl i’m seeing now. she’s so sweet and innocent. i just want to hold her tight and let the world take us wherever. that’s why i don’t care about sex or looking for it. i’m done. the only thing i need is to have her by my side and hold her tight. that’s my heaven on earth.
