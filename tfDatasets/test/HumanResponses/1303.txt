ah monday, not my favourite day of the week. work had a few revelations today, and i learnt some important lessons. there is no standard rs232 sharp edges on things are sharp and may cut you trying to do a job that needs 2 hands in a hole big enough for one hand just doesn't work. ever. i realised today that i said i'd get back to playing football next month, but that that would stop me watching all of euro 2004, d'oh! apart from all that, absolutely nothing has happened today. maybe if i keep having days like this, i'll have to make something up. maybe music : faith no more greatest hits thing still (due to idleness of not changing the cd) reading : monstrous regiment by terry pratchett (maybe i'll just list these things when they change.)
