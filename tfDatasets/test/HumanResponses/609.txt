"panapanahon lang yan" i was about to complain about the bad weather today when okram said "ibira mu pa!" he was reffering about the wind "amihan" why? because he is a surfer and when the season/wind is right man! it's like waimea out there heheh the bad thing is that im not a freakin surfer! and they (baler boys) are the only ones wishing for the big storm to come in our town! the good things is that for 5 years or so this little town havent had any storm not even a weather condition near to be a called a storm. thank god for that! amen! sarap matulog!
