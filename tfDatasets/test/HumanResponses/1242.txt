hello, i have been thinking about the issue of cumulation of knowledge produced through qualitative research. one of the goals of science is to produce knowledge that can be accumulated. in many approaches to qualitative research (e.g., grounded theory, especially in coding textual data), the concern for intersubjective verifiability is not encouraged. it seems to me that such an approach runs against the goal of producing knowledge that can be accumulated. any comments/reference on this issue would be welcome. regards, rajiv
