in every relationship there will always be screwups. your partner or yourself might screw up something really big. but if u think bout what would you want your partner 2 do if you had screwed up like this. probably you would want a second chance. so loosen up a little, your partner is the love of your life. so give em a second chance 2 redeem themselves. =).
