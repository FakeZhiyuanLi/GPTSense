oh, i'm so relieved. and happy. my birthday was last week but i only gained my cell phone yesterday. oh, and a friend of mine gave me a beautiful box with a couple on it. and finally, the tests are over. the one i thought would be the worst was the best! but that's fine for me. today is saturday and i have nothing to do by now. i wish we could go out later just to breath some new air. like that bird is flying on the sky just looking and waiting for something of his interest, this is the way i feel. uh. i wish i had a skate - and know how to use. i have a pair of rollers' but i don't use it much. anyway, it's my time to go now. have a nice weekend, everybody!
