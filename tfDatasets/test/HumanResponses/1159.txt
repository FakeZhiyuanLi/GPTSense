first of two parts. i am a nervous wreck. we meet at 2pm at the 100 center to get this all straightened out. our real estate agent does not sound happy. if this doesn't work, i hope he can find us something else, fast. i want this to work. i have dreamed of having something in this building for years. i have prayed and prayed this is what we're suppose to do. i know it is, but where? god isn't just going to hand us something. i know we have to work for it. but, oh boy, is this cutting it close. i'll finish this up when i get back from the meeting.
