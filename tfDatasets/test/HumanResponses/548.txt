ah the pains of motivation. i need to be working on job applications today. i have several hours of free time today (probably the only time that is going to happen this week) and so far i've not even touched them. that isn't to say i haven't done anything. i have finished several other things i had to do, but i just can't seem to motivate myself to write my cover letter. my lack of motivation is going to end up putting me into a bad sutation if i am not careful. hopefully this job will work out, but i don't even have any real confirmation that it is going to happen yet.
