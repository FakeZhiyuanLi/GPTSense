the other day at my friends house some of his friends that were there decided to smoke weed. that was cool and all. then my friends brother takes a big hit off of the roach and throws up everywhere. normally you smoke weed not to get sick but not in this case. ive never heard of anyone throwing up smoking weed. but i thought it was really funny.
