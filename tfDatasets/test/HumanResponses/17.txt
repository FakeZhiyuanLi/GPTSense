i'm thinking of getting a digital camera, one with a rechargeable battery and a gig capacity of storage or memory. i was thinking it would be good to date and stuff, but, really i just need a few friends. getting married having kids etc. is a lot of hastle that i'm not looking for. maybe a very casual female friendship in the future would be good. i'm still deliberating on taking the job at miracle software systems, i got another interview lined up at chrysler this wednesday that will seal the deal. if they like me and i like their project i will go with chrysler, otherwise i will go with miracle
