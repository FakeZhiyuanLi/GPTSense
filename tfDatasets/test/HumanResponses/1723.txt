thanx gladys for the granting of my 15 nanoseconds of fame. thinking of a curse to stamp into the pages of my collection of ratty old secondhand books, to stop people not returning them. here goes: "should you not return this book, may your fingers become more entangled than the innards of a pc built by my younger brother, rendering you never able to turn the pages of any borrowed book again." cheap custom rubber self-inking stamp company, here i come! ok, maybe that was an overstatement and my curse needs some work. not to mention the fact that i rarely lend out my books.
