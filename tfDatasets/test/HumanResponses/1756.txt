the clock will keep ticking no matter how you want it to stop even for a brief moment it will continue it hours, it minutes, it seconds… eventhough you want it to hold on a minute the clock is the metaphor of our life when the good times happen to us, we want it to stop gives us chance to enjoy our good times… but… when things don’t go as we wish them to be… we’re hoping so much that time will pass by quickly for us to forget the sorrow like the clock, we can set our life if we want the life to be joyful…. we have to cherish every moment of it…. every seconds count grab it, don’t wait …. to say something nice to our loved ones to do what we have to do…. because…. like the the clock,our life will continue….
