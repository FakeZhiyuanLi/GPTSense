welcome to the right wing of cyberspace. here i will post frequently about current political issues and try to incite some dissenting opinions among viewers. anyone is free to post comments, but please limit the profanity and ignorance. i am a republican and i will be biased just so you know. this is not a "balanced" blog, it is right wing, hence the name. but liberals are welcome and we will take you seriously and more often than not prove you wrong. so let the blogging begin!
