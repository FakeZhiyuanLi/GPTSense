where are you when i'm sad where are you when i need to talk to some one where are you when i call you always say with my parents or out with my brother but what can i believe anymore where will you be when you know you love me where will i be when i'm laughing at you one day you'll know what i went through one day you'll love me like i love you one day you'll need me like i need you someday you'll want me like i want you but when those days come around it might be to late i might not feel for you
