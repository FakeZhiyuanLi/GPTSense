i finished "the lake" last night. not sure if i would recommend it to anyone but a hardcore fan. the book is quite obviously one of laymon's earlier works, as the story doesn't have his usual flair for horror. it's too stitled and feels way too much like an erotic novel, not a horror novel. characters are doing things real suddenly and there really is no character development. however, negativity aside, there are some truly horrifying moments in the novel, which makes the book a must read.but only if you're a hardcore fan. keep an eye out for a ramshackle house.
