recently i went and seen the movie the village. i was told it was suppose to be the greatest movie ever by some reliable sources. i go and see the movie and turns out it was almost the worst movie ive ever seen. i didnt like it because of several reasons. these include it being too short, it was the type of movie that made you think through the whole thing to figure out the twist, and the twist was even stupid. and for the fact some of my family and friends were trying to compare it to the movie the others because it had a twist like the village did. i for one think the others was one of the better suspensful movies i have seen and should not even be used in the same sentence as the village. bottom line the village stunk and i could have died happy never haven seen the movie. quote that tv guide.
