oh. i'm going crazy with this every single day i'll have to study a lot! i mean not a lot 'cause i'm a lazy person. anyway. if i'm not studying, what i'm doing? well, let's say a lil fun is enough to tell. i think i'm strange. somehow i am. hehehe, i remembered now of a movie we're gonna make. the title can be translated as "an explosive and caliente passion". the story is about a girl called jennifer, who is ugly and not very careful. she loves steven. steven is sharon's boyfriend. jennifer's best friend loves sharon. in the end of it all jennifer discovers that she really loves her best friend - i forgot his name by now. anyway, i am just one of those people who are just passing by in the film. the main idea is to make ppl laugh and laugh and laugh. i think the story is lil important too. hoho. returning to earth, i think i'll study now. bye bye.
