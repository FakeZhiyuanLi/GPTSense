friday - got to move in 2 days early to avoid the rush of 20k-30k students moving in all at the same time. in the evening the rotc guys walked around, talked, answered a couple questions, and then we went to a pub and sat around, meeting people. saturday - climbing wall, spider web, one man rope bridge. free meals all day. did some "drill and ceremony" for a couple minutes, the parade rest is messed up. yeesh. i am the master of the climbing wall. could have watched stripes but went out and met people instead. had to fill out about a dozen pages of paperwork. did a lot of talking among each other and the other ms cadets. so all is good. todaysome sort of games and barbecue.
