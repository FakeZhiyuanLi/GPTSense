yo sup homie today, i was ill and couldn't go to school. i told my classmates i got hit by a car and they actually believed it lol so gullible. anyhow, i gave my work to kenneth so that he could hand them up to my teachers. ms. koh made me rewrite my essay outline just because i forgot to hand it in a week ago and left it in the history folder which i gave her. what an ass! also, went to the doctors around 4 and he gave me medicine. paid $20 just for a visit. what a rip-off i can write myself an excuse letter without having to pay $20! oh yeah. or fencing coach is thinking about sending us to malaysia for an international fencing competition. wonder if it'll push through. anyhow, i gtg do my work now. peace out .
