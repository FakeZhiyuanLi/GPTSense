most of the things i've been working on are part of bigger pieces, so my inch count is way down. no fear, i'll make it up when i finish them. this photo is from drawing class, using one of the photos of myself that i showed here previously. i had a little trouble at first and was worried i wouldn't be able to pull it off, but after getting one eye done i figured out that i just had to take it a little slower and really take my time to get the shape right before i did anything else. i'll finish this piece at least by monday, because that's when it's due in class, but i'm hoping for a little bit sooner. we're supposed to create a tattoo on the skin, and i'm still doing some sketches trying to figure out what i want those to look like. this is 24x18, so when finished it will come out to 424 completed inches.
