feeling like shit today, very achey i have spent all morning reading books. i need to get some new underwear and tshirts, if i ever leave my room perhapts i will go to the store. while going through some boxes from my last move i discovered some good books that i thought i lost. oh also i found several of my ramones albums on vinal. later tunafish sandwich, tortilla chips and orange soda and one ciggeratte later i was back to my current read. maby i will muster up enough energy to call cal and go see him this evening.
