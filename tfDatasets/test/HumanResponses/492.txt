well, we had a first this morning. maitlyn totally enjoyed swim lessons! she didn't complain one bit, did everything she was asked and even had fun! one of the things she always complained about was the kickboard. today, as she was kicking across the pool with the kickboard, she said to me "i like the kickboard." she even dog-paddled for a few feet several times!
