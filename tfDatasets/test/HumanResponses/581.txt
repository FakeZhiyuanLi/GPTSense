what more can i say? i'm lying in bed, looking at my tv, listening to heat radio from emap and typing rather badly on a wireless keyboard. no, i haven't got a pc with a wavefinder hooked up to my telly - i own a netgem iplayer, a digital terrestrial television stb with internet capabilities. its capabilites certainly don't match up with those of a pc, but at a price of around Â£100 i think it offers great value for money compared to other less capable stbs. shortly, i shall probably blog on the iplayer's features - and some of its problems. nighty, night!
