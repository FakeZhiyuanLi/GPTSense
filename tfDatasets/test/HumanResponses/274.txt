well, i've been a little busy at work lately, so i haven't had much time to blog, plus nothing much has been going on. gonna go down with the folks to move in ricka back into her dorm room at sms this coming weekend. in a few weeks i'll be starting classes myself. at least the weather hasn't been unbearably hot. rather nice, actually. well, for august.
