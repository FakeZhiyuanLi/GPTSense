hey have you been watching the news lately. if you have you probably heard about governor macgreevy's affair with a boy. he admitted that he was gay! some people say he is a great governor because he told the truth about himself, and others were shocked and didn't like it. macgreevy dropped out from the job of governor. i think he is a verry good governor because he told his people the truth and was brave enough to pick up the topic. in other hand i was also shocked when i heard this and was un happy that new jersey's governor is gay!
