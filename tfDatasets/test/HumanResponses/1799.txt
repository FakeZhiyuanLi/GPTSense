about 1,000 spectators watched as 130 kayakers competed in the 22nd annual kibler valley river run saturday. the competition is sponsored by the red bank ruritan club in patrick county and draws water enthusiasts from all around. the course began at noon and takes about a half an hour to complete. this year was a special challenge for event planners because of work being done to the pipeline that carries water from pinnacles dam to the generator powerhouse. the dam was built years ago to supply additional electricity to the city of danville. the event serves as the primary fund raiser for the red bank ruritan club. about $5,000 is raised each year. contestants paid $25 to compete in this year's event.
