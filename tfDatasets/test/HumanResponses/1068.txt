gosh. i thought i was gonna die because of these tests. but i won't. in june there will be more of them! it is just like paollo told me: do not be sad it will get worse!". pretty funny, uh? i can't imagine what will happen in 2005. almost every week - tests. in a period of three months - a new book. in the end of the year - i don't even wanna talk about it. uh. forget it! i thought it was coming back. the memories came into my mind and then. the good thing is that j. called me yesterday, so i could notice that it wasn't true. there was a misunderstood in my confusing head. yeah, i think this the end.
