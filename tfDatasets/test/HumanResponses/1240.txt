so. i guess i'm here. too bad my od has been tainted. not that i'm unhappy or unglad to be here, because that is not the case. what is the case? er. well. this is me. and i'm here because my fiance (one 'e') is here. i wont really get very personal here.only because i've learned my lesson (the hard way) and it only gets ugly. but then.what will i ever post? good question. stay tuned for the answer, i suppose.
