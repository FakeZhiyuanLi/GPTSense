a month goes by and suddenly everything is different. well, . . . maybe not so suddenly. i have been reading dr. ornish's book about reversing heart disease and had a comeuppance or two. or three. i am forced to admit that i am the unwanted child. from infancy i have had to force myself on others to be accepted. other people never like me they just tolerate me. the only reason i am tolerated is because i am useful in some way. it is necessary that i admit this is my problem and that i need to accept this reality and learn to live with it. i am forced to admit that there is an invisible wall surrounding my heart that will not open. it is protecting my heart from me. nothing has changed.
