yesterday, i did a cycle/run brick. 36 min(15 km) bike followed immediately by 1 mile on the treadmill. i also went to physio for my back again. i hadn't gone in about 2 months. when i started running more often, my back started acting up again(did i already mention that?). i also biked 15km home. today, i cycled to work and after work i swam for 33 minutes(about 850 m, i think) followed immediately by my ride home. i wore the wetsuit while swimming to get used to it. i think it is a little small. one of the members at the gym told me that i could borrow her wetsuit. she is doing the ironman canada in 3 weeks(wow) so, i am going to try out her suit in the lake next week, and hopefully it fits tomorrow, i have a wedding to go to, so no workouts.
