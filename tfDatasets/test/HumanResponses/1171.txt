i was a child, searching for the flower buried so far beneath. the petals soft, the color dep and complex flowing into clear simplicity. soiled, i searched with nieve hope and determination, my playful mind instinctively moving forward. there was nothing behind me to cause me to stumble. i kept digging with my bare hands, small delicate fingers strong and taught against the force. i am an adult, hands weak and fingers raw. the flower has turned to stone, the color gray and cold. there is a web of pain before me, i am unable to free myself of it's grasp.
