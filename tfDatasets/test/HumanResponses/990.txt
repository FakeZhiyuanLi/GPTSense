i started to look for jobs in the newpapers for all kinds of position in the fashion industry from sewing operator in factory to a sales assistant in a retail shop. i don't mind to work from the bottom as i know i will learn more from there as i move up i will be more confidence. just like how i work from scratch in mcdonald's. one day, i came across an ad in straits times recruiting for apparel assistant merchandiser by wda. that's how i got my 1st step in it. i went through all the briefing conducted by wda and also the 3 interviews. i was finally selected by ocean sky. i feel that i am very lucky to get this chance as they only select 3 candidates out of the 12 candidates that came for interview. i remember that janice was the one who interview me. till now i am looking for a chance to thanks her for selecting me and i am still curious to know the reasons for selecting me:)
