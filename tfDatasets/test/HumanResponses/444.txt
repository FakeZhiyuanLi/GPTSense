things are finally falling into place and looking up for me. i finally have friends that are not out to get something outta me (i.e. expensive presents, a reason to talk to someone else, etc.). i have a good paying job and a second job that i really enjoy. i'm finally able to pay my bills on time and in full. looks like i am going to have some sort of social life. this is the happiest i have been in a very very long time. all in all, looking back, i am glad i took the chances i took when i decided to move out here. i'm glad the things that have happened did happen. i look forward to the future now (instead of dreading it, which i used to do). what's the line from terminator 2? something like "the future is not set. it is what we make it." please correct me if i am wrong (which i prolly am). anyways, i'm headin outtie for now.
