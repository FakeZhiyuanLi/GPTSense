7 hours at work, 3 hours of commute and another 3 hours in the computing lab. i'm toast, but not sure i can sleep. but i got 2 answers i'd been waiting for today: one from my brand-new danish bank and one from the commission (see yesterday's blog). still waiting for news from the university of oslo, though. i had some knake (typical lundian sausage) and a dirt cheap danish beer for dinner. the sausage was the better part.
