i can't believe how awesome gt3 is. best racer of all time. makes you work for the kickass cars, and when you finally get one, it's driving heaven. today after working for about an hour winning championships with my uber pimped out mustang cobra, i saved enough (352,000 to be exact) to buy an italian masterpiece. the zonda c12s, is ridiculous. it certainly can't be legal to drive on city streets, because attaching a v2 rocket onto the back of a civic has about the same effect. (though the zonda looks much cooler then a civic with a rocket attached to it, yes i mean it.) i know i must be tired when i'm talking about cars. it's a good thing no one reads my site.i hope.
