today was really fucked up. again.i stayed up all night online, but then i got offline to sleep, and i got woken up 2 hours later. my friend had called telling me she doesn't want to talk to me ever again, cuz i said her bf is shit. i have also begun another suicidal tendancy, again. hell.life sucks. all i can do is hope it gets better. my bf is being a complete ass, and he thinks hitting me is fun. i hope that the whole world blows up soon. that would make me happy :)
