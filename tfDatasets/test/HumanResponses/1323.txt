i had the bonfire party that i've been planning for about a month.(i kept having to postpone it). three of my friends, who are on my message board, my sister, and her friend, came. we ate junk food and played sardines (which is the reverse of hide-and-go-seek; one person hides and everyone else looks and then hides with the 'it' person. the last person to find the hiding spot loses and is 'it' next time).
