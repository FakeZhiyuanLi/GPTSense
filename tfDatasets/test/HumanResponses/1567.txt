i lay beaten and broken a victim of your anger a victim of your rage i lay cursed and crushed a victim of your bitterness a victim of the words you say i lay weak and weary a victim of your abuse your emotional abuse i endure i lay angry but alive its a miracle i survive the amount of times i wanted to take my own life i am hurt by the things you say i am hurt by the anger you display you hit me and you curse me you play games with my mind but i wont accept it anymore there comes a time when i must stand i stand tall and strong a survivor of your anger a survivor of your rage a survivor of you bitterness a survivor of the words you say a survivor of your abuse your emotional abuse i endured i stand tall and strong and life it does go on written by lylia garrett february 1996
