this was another tie vote. i don't think there's too much debate that climbing mount everest is sweeter in and of itself than flying a plane across the atlantic, but a lot of people seemed to feel that hillary might not deserve all the credit for this, what with the sherpa factor. and i have to agree, it seems like tenzing norgay is getting a raw deal. in the end, i think if edmund hillary had actually said he wanted to climb mount everest "because it was there," he would have to be sweeter. good quotes count for a lot with me. but evidently, he didn't say it. therefore, i'm going to have to go with lindbergh, who, no matter what else he may have been, was undeniably a bad ass.
