another thought: i watched bill o'reilly's interview with michael moore last night on fox news. the interview was not live, but it was unedited (except for a commercial break), and i must admit i was already biased against moore. apparently, the 9/11 commission's report (which i have not read - yet) claims that bush was a victim of misinformation regarding the lack of wmds in iraq. moore says "bush lied about the wmds - there aren't any". well, there are "lies" - deliberate misstatements of fact intended to deceive, and there are "lies" - false statements. either moore truely does not understand the difference, in which case he is a first-class idiot (albeit a rich one) or he does know the difference and he is a pompous, condescending a**hole. they report, we decide
