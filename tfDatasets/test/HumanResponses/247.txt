remember by christina rossetti remember me when i am gone away, gone far away into the silent land; when you can no more hold me by the hand, nor i half turn to go yet turning stay. remember me when no more day by day you tell me of our future that you plann'd: only remember me; you understand it will be late to counsel then or pray. yet if you should forget me for a while and afterwards remember, do not grieve: for if the darkness and corruption leave a vestige of the thoughts that once i had, better by far you should forget and smile than that you should remember and be sad.
