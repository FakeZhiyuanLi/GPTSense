nba finals 2004 - detroit beats la 4-1 so the lakers got spanked and yanked like nobody's business. i am no laker fan (far from it - i am a kings tragic) but i didn't expect them to lose, not to detroit who couldn't score points for dear life. i guess this once again proves - it's the team that wins and not superstars - sounds too idealistic, but boy, was there a bigger endorsement of this thesis than these nba finals. if there's one thing i feel bad about - i lost 10 bucks on the lakers to a work colleague!
