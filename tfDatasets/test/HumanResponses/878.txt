so my initial title for the blogspot was tammy's trips, but once you remove the space between the two words to condense as a url it looks like this: tammy'strips. hmmmmmperhaps not. so we leave it as tammytrips.which upon further review is still weird. oh welljust going to have to live with it and not think about it too hard!
