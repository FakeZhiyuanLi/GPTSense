i don't know what's up today but i am in a very ornrey mood. probably has to do with the fact that i got fooled by an email scam that should have been a very obvious scam had i stopped and thought about it! well, i stopped and thought about it but with the wrong head! aside from that, i feel like causing a lot of trouble today and am thinking that i am going to take my frustrations out on the exercise equipment down at gold's gym! at least then i will be doing something productive! oh well, live and learn right. blog at ya'll later
