my neighbor just called and said that three freshman who went to north springs died in a car accident last night about 1 am. one girl, emily wiatt (sp?) was from her church. apparently none of the five people in the car wore seatbelts (u_u;;) and they were going 80-90mph on a neighborhood street, crashed into a mailbox, and the driver was killed on contact. the emily girl was also killed near instantly and the third victim is brain dead at grady hospital. the other two kids in the backseats escaped and pulled the bodies out before the car exploded. oh yeah, and none of them had driver's liscences ! >_> truly sad story. just serves as a lesson that you should a.) drive safely, b.) make sure you're certified to be behind the wheel and c.) wear your seatbelts! got that, kids?
