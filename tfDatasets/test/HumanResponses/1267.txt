i promised my parents i'd get up nice and early tomorrow (6:30 am to be exact) and head over to this farmers market, to do community service till 1 o' clock. i'm never going to fall asleep early enough for that. to make tomorrow even more irritating, my brother is leaving for japan, and i won't even get to see him off. it's not -really- that big of a deal, but i won't be seeing him again till christmas. and on top of all this, hell week starts monday, so half of my last day of sanity and not feeling like a truck hit me, i get to go help old people carry bags of discount vegetables to their cars. if anyone has any tips on falling asleep, please do share them with me.
