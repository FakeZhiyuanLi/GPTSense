yeah, so i went to buy my ipod today, and the services rep guy said that i really should get the extended warranty because of the ipod manufacturers bug. i asked what it was and he said that 20% of ipod's non replaceable batteries die. and since i dont have firewire i need the usb 2.0 dock. ipod = $350 dock = $40 warranty = $60 i didnt have enough money. so now i must wait another ten days before i get paid again. i guess its ok, it will give me time to get some more songs.
