tonite. it is hot. really hot n i can say that, without getting embarassed, that i'm wearing only my boxer while writing this blog. i went to the convofair earlier, bought some chips for tonite's muvi time. n also grabbed my favorite dish in hari raya, lemang + serunding + rendang. really tasty and this perak people, they are experts in rendang. we also had retro night at the convo square, some veteran singers for veteran audience. n i feel so lonely without her. ahh~ so for tonite, i am going to watch the replacement. nice quality dvd-ripped movie from #chow-kit. my rummet said it was a nice movie n he watched it for 10 times already. keanu reeves fanatic i suppose. hehe. so this blog might be short because i'm eager to watch the movie rite now. i'll continue when i feel like it. to rozie, i miss u a lot.
