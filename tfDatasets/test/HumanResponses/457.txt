ok, so now are they coming out with low carb potatoes or something? everywhere you go, everyone you meet is on some sort of low carb eating regimen aw my gawd what is going on? i am personally always fighting food demons and weight demons so i know about trying to lose weight etc, and for fun one time i did atkins for 2 weeks and lost some awesome weight. and then i ate some pizza and gained it all back! :) so now i am sticking with tried and true - salads, exercise, and some painful late night choices like herbal tea instead of that gallon of haagen daz. but can you imagine the money being made from all this? i remember the high carb diets a few years ago and the high carb bars everyone had in their pockets. man, that is the kiss of death now! ok, it's saturday again, weekend again, wow, time flies. -mustafa
