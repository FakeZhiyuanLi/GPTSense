i'm in a trance when i see you when i'm near you i can't seem to think straight i'm in deep though when you come 'round i can't seem to clear my thoughts of you i'm in a dream when you call my name how can you make me like this with such a simple word i'm in a different place when we're together my world seems a lot brighter when your around like no troubles can bring you down all i know is that i'm different round you i have a smile on my face life in my eyes a hope that the day will get better
