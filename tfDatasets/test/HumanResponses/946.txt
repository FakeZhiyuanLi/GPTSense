ok i'm the advice guru in this love.well it's not a triangle it's a friggin octoquad. there's so many angles here theres no word for it. it's as if no one can just be nice and just honest and open about their feelings. they have to go and say i'm not talkign to her cause she's sort of into someone i never made known i was into but she should have guessed anway. i mean how do you respond to that? wow your an idiot just talk to them? if only it was that easy. they have to just make me be the messenger. so if anyone out there feels my pain or has been in this situation drop a comment. it'll be kooky fun. -annoyed gavin
