i had my third driving lesson today and it went pretty well. :) the teacher had to push the pedals couple of times 'coz i didn't do so, but other than that it was fine. now i have a two-week break and after that i'll drive again, so hopefully i don't forget everything during those two weeks. i also got those juhannus pictures today and they were ok, although there was one horrible pic of me. oh well, i don't have to show it to anybody if i don't want to. :p and btw, i had a really funny dream last night. it was pretty chaotic, but i remember me going to an empty candy shop and sitting in a chair watching spongebob squarepants. suddenly i was at school and everybody had to get out of there fast because there was an angry spongebob tearing the place up. go spongebob, go! :d
