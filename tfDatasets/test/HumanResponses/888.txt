there isn't any snow left. isn't that great? heck no thanks to all this great weather, everyone has to participate in "track" tommorow. wooooo i mean: noooooooo what good is there in "track and field" anyways? physical activity? fun? the joy of participating? competition? i don't think soo. keep the ribbon making people in business? yes. but that's no good. no good at all. the forecast for tommorow is just perfect and it couldn't get any better. thanks for nothin' you dumb weather oh yes, the simpsons is on tonight.
