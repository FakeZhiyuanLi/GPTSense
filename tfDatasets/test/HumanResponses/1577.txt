i had a blast today, not much to say about the morning, but i got the 12 o'clock train to chloe's house, we watched van wilder (it was alright), then we went to chloes room, i read ok magazine while chloe woke herself up, then we listened to musac !  we watched everwood (was coolness) while eating a nicely prepared cheese on toast by roger (chloe's dad), then we played with bubbles !  thats right, bubbles   then we watched fight club, i have seen it 3 times before, but this time it seemed different, i dunno why ! and chloe bought me, skittles to share, a bottle of oasis, milky bar to share and some poppets. then we walked up to the train station and watched this big fire, was lovely !  and then the train came. i really enjoyed today, it was good fun !
