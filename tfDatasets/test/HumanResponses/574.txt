well i just woke up abour 10 minutes ago and it's 1:30 in the afternoon. i didn't get to sleep until around 7 this morning because i had so much on my mind. the first thing i did was call charlotte, but no answer. she almost always answers her phone, but this time i got her voicemail. let me sign online to see if she's onshe is.now i'm really wondering why she didn't answer her phone. as i talk to her, i can't help but feel i've done something horribly wrong, which she says isn't the case. everything is weird between us and i don't know why. i think i'll cut this entry short though, as i don't want to say anything or jump to any conclusions.
