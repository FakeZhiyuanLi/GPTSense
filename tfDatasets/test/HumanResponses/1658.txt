yeah, so using my ipod i maybey stating a pirate radio station. i found something (called iradio i belive) and it transmitts to any fm station you like in a 35 foot radius. none of my friends live within 30 feet of me, soooo im trying to find a 10 mile minimum broadcaster for sale in ontario canada. i know where i can buy one but you need a radio license. which i lack. technically aslong as i dont mess around with any licesnsed radio stations its legal by the fcc. also today i came soooo close to buying a laptop. its a p4 800mhz, 40gb, 64mb shared video laptop with xp pro already installed. but the thing that stopped me was the ram. 128mb? i mean c'mon. laptop ram is uber expensive sooo ill just wait for a laptop that fits my needs i guess. if anybody knows where i can get a broadcaster email me: tekno.samurai[at]gmail[dot]com
