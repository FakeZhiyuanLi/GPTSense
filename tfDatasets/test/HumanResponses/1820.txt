today was my first day to work out in a week. i woke up around 9:00, then got already to go outside and run. i ran three miles thru out the entire day and then had to go mow the grass. so i put on my bathin suit (straight country lol) and hopped on the lawn mower. considering i have 70 acres. and i would be mowin until the sun went down, i put my bathin suit on along with some tannin oil so that i would get some color outside. today was a pretty normal day, no rat infested motels or no salt and sandjust a regular day. maybe tomorrow will be better.but doubtfully possible!
