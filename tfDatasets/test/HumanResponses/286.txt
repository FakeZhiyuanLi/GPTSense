a well rested la lakers took the court last night, and in one of the best team efforts all season the lakers veteran squad took the fight to a younger, tired minnesota timberwolves. shaq went an impressive 9 for 11 from the free-throw line, combined with yet another double-double for the big man. kobe, in true form, showed everyone that he doesn't need to fly between denver and la on game day to perform like the superstar that he is. kobe chipped 23 points of his own, and added 4 assist to the taly. the secret to la winning out this series lies in the hands of the seasoned playoff performers that grace the lakers line-up. malone, payton, shaq, and kobe all need to keep their game at a high tempo, and keep taking it to the less proven t-wolves squad. team unity, something that has been well publized with respect to the lakers, once again proved last night that professionalism, and unity on the court will always prevail. i stick to my guns, lakers in 5!
