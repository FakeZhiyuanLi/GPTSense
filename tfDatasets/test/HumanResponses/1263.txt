getting up has never been such a chore. even falling off my chair in the general direction of my bed is going to be an accomplishment. i couldn't make it upstairs to use the jacuzzi which really probably would have helped me. still, despite all the crap i'm going through, it feels good to be back. i missed football. oh well, i should just get to bed, if i sleep now, that'll be nine solid hours. tomorrow is gonna be a tad harder then today, since well. i'm gonna wake up and not be able to move. that should be fun.
