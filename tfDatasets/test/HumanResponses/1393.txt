7 30p 05312k3 trigger struck with a stupid judgment can’t believe i have fallen for playful words not meant to hurt but somehow in my mind was incurred it never really mattered before coz it wasn’t exactly what i cared for but now that i have grown up, something in me says, “it’s enough.” humanity’s sense of perfection is what everyone tries to live up to the standards are set with no options, it’s wrong but that’s what i oughtta do. yes, words have that mush power to swing you to a mind setting but bear in mind it depends on you whether or not you wanna fit in. there’s a good side too in my case coz i can somehow have a say envy has got no more space, and that’s non-conformity in a way.
