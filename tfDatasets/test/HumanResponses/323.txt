what can i say… i took a beating from a girl. the students in my 4th period class have to tell and show something special to their lives in front of their class. it’s freakin show and tell… honestly! the last time i did this i was in like 2nd grade. we are in high school. who does she think we are? anyway, nicole is a wrestler and she thought that would be cool to show us what its like to wrestle. it was cool at first, because she was wrestling her fellow wrestler and best friend. but… then she said she could do a few of her moves better if it were a guy. so guess who was picked to roll around with this girl… me. she’s a hell of a fighter. i feel sorry for the guy who wants to rape this girl late at night. he’ll definitely be in for a surprise. …(sigh) that hurt.
