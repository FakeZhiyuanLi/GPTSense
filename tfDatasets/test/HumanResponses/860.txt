man, i never knew i'd end up back with blogger. i went from blogger to movable type to greymatter to livejournal to xanga to tblog and now back to blogger. back to blogger and blogspot. but hey, they've improved a lot. now they've got comments! only one more on the wish list - categories and sorting by them perhaps?
