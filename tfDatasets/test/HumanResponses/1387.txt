02212k4 happy months ago i dreamt of you i don’t know how and why my dream just flew you were my savior… looking out for me in reality i never thought of you not until today, i never knew i never expected i’d like you but i’m happy i just do… you are my light… shining to lead me i’m happy just the way this is though i know you see me differently from a distance i can see you still i’m happy, but i won’t hope coz you’ll never be with me thinkin’ bout these makes me whine will my dream ever come true? no one can tell but i thank you i’m happy you crossed my mind but i know my limits—you’ll never be mine.
