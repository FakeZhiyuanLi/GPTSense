i know, reliving childhood nightmares is supposed to be an opportunity. i know, i should be addressing the "inner demons" in order to make a full recovery. i know, susan can't read my mind and cannot possibly know what kind of nightmare i was living through. but gee, does this kind of event have to be so brutally effective? oh wait, you mean if i wasn't in such deep denial then this wouldn't have been quite so bad? you mean if i were taking care of my problems this might not have even happened? damnit! why does everything always have to be my fault?
