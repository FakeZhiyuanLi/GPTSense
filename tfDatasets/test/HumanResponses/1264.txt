well i'm still walking.funny. the first day was pretty tough, but after so many years of doing this, it hardly seems as bad as it used to. it seems like its easier every year, but i guess i really have just gotten stronger. i guess i'll go figure out dinner, cleaning off, and maybe using the jacuzzi. i'll probably post again before i go to bed.
