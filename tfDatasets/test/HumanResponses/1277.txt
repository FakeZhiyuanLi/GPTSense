wow. two posts in one day. this will never happen again. isn't it amazing how things can change totally the other way round and when a day starts of bad it can end up good. i made friends with them (elephant juice), i'm allowed to go to leeds fest. no news on the house, and joss is going as of tomorrow (fingers crossed). and im happy. i finished my work. i played a game today hah yea im sad, where you have to name all the things you love. i love my friends who tell me what is right instead of what i want to hear. i love potential adventures and i love people who demand me to be my best because they know i can do better things than what i am doing. mainly, i love my friends. in a friendship way :p:p:p
