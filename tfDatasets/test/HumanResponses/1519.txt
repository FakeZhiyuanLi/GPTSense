today was a "low-food" day. it's a habit i really need to kick. i have a very bizarre appetite, which will only allow me to eat certain things at very particular times. on one hand, it keeps me skinny, on the other hand, it means i usually don't have enough energy. i think it's a root-cause of a lot of my other problems (general exhaustion, lack of motivation, etc.) i'm not sure what i should do about it, so if anyone has any suggestions, let me know!
