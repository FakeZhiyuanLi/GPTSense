i see you there, alone. i sit here, alone. i see your face, it takes my breath away. i meet your eyes with my own, my heart melts. i hear your soft, sweet, angelic voice, it warms my soul. i love you, more then you'll ever know. i love you, more then i'll ever show. i know it'll never be, for when i look to you, you look away. i love you still.
