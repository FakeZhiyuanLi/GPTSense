well today was ok i guess. nothing special happened. well there was one thing. my teahcer didn't want this toy snake that she had. so i said that i wanted it so then she threw it to me and it was soooooooooooo cool. it felt all mushy and tight. bad thing was that there is a hole in it so i'm guessing that's y she doesn't want it. well for school nothign special thereit's the same old same old. i'm glad that there is only about 5 more weeks of school left. i jsut want to leave and enjoy my youth. right now i cna't enjoy because of my classes. well i do love my core(magnet) classes there so fun! we get to talk and stuff. well later for now.
