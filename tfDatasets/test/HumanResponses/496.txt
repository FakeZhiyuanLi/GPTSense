this is why i hate phones. if i were amish, this wouldn't happen. i would just walk across the village to see her. or a horse-drawn carriage. but i met one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen in person friday night. of course, she was a waitress. and i was like the fly and she was like fly paper. i know i said words to her. i hoped they were strewn together into complete sentences, complete thoughts, etc. i gave her my phone number in a state of complete spontaniety just because i didn't want to hear her answer if i was to ask hers. she called the next night. at 11:57 p.m. wanting to hang out. where was i? at a bar. with my phone not on vibrate. i wanted to punch myself in the face.
