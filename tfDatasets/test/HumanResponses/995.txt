people are crazy or they are stupid, or something, it's very strange. when i stay home, and i watch the tv or i take a shower, i always dream "wow, how good will be now if i would be on a mountain, with flours around me, not any car sound, not smoke, not any strange noise from the neighborhood, just the birds and the plants". and when i'm up there in the top of the world on the mountain, i think "why? why i camed here? bugs everywhere, i don't have where to take a shower, i don't have anything to do, i just get bored, not a tv, not nothing, i should stay home next time when i wana go on a mointain". and ofcourse, when i'm home the same thing it's happening, and when i'm on a mountain the same thing. why we are like that? we will never get the answer.
