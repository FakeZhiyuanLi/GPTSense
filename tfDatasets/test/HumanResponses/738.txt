today was a bit dull really, i took theo to the shops and for a walk around the market. i made gammon with roast potatoes and garlicky peas for my mum and step dad. the weather has been changeable, scorching sun to hailstones all in the space of a couple of hours. i got an email from dennis saying i was a great friend, which was nice of him. also had a few emails from my friend rose in newcastle, she's moving into her new house next week and is buying loads of new things. well, that really is a waste of space and i truly apologies to anyone bothering to read it, what can i say? everyone goes through boring phases in their life and i'm smack in the middle of one!
