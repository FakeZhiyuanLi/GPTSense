my unconditional love for you is never die thought you so far away out of my reach thought we never meant to be. i give my unconditional love without asking in return. call me naive,call me a dreamer how can i deny if i am so in love with you how can i reject this feeling,if it feels so good inside everytime i thought of you. my heart warms,my soul at ease. when i think of you every night,every day of my life
