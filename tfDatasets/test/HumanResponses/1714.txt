yesterday at work, some co-workers rescued an abandoned kitty. they brought him into work, and he was immediately adopted by a fellow co-worker. now named "yugi", he went to the vet last night, and is adjusting well to his new home. he has lots of food and water and a happy home. sometimes, things just work out well, and make you smile!
