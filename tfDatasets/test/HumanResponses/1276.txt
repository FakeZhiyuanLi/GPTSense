im not romantic. romance is like as different from me as anything opposite could be. maybe they do romance courses at college. *ponders* i should be romantic and thoughtful and all roses and love and hearts and shiney things, but i must have missed obtaining that gene, take after mother then. "loaded, i've loaded up this gun, there's a killer in me, hoping you're the one, but you always run away when i come around, i dont mind the day, i'll track you down, and terrify" liking that song at the moment, a lot. suave voice, for a guy that is. seeta has a suave voice, she has a gig on saturday however im not going. my plans for this weekend so far: friday - nothing saturday - nothing sunday - kd come here (no choice) and stay over monday - "period pains" no school. apart from that i have work, but not too much, so im worried about the amount i will get next year when we have to rush through the course, not that i am complaining! holiday in 2 weeks and 3 days! whooo. jd
