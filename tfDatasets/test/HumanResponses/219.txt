i intend this to be an ecumenical blog offering interesting comments and open discussion on interesting religious questions. comments are always welcome and encouraged, and will only be edited if they are offensive or profane. 1-your first blog? a-no but this is my first blogger weblog (having done radio and typepad in the recent past), so i will spend the first few days learning how to make sidebar links and generally fix up the place using the blogger template. 2-what exactly is the goal of christian inquiry? a-initially, to assemble a list of links of personal or group blogs, five or ten per denomination, that have a similar approach to blogging on religioninterested in asking questions and inquiring, rather than witnessing or doing apologetics. 3-who are you? a-just a regular guy. see "about me" on the sidebar. enjoy!
