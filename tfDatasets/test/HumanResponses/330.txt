i just found out that i made a mistake with a friend of mine not a mistake but mistakes. mistake is a very common word sometimes it does not value that much but i did i was very miserable finding out i made those especially to a friend that i started out to count as one of a good friend perhaps not only good a friend who is not only nice but also comforting me i do cannot stand this condition once again i ask time to be at my side may forgiveness surrounding someone's heart and let the friendship grow stronger p.s: "i'm just too excited having a new friend"
