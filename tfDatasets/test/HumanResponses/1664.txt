yeah, im really really bored as always, i think im going to make a game or something. i spend way too much time on the computer, i have had 120,000 keystrokes in less then 24 hours. i gotta go to work soon, which sucks, i downloaded a pirated and cracked copy of trillian pro, but i dont have access to all the plugins because i need like a special login for the site so im just going to find like a third party plugin site. im trying hard to get my site off the ground, its starting to die, if somehow i can get enough members and posts i will buy a shoutcast server aswell as an irc server for it. im looking to download a movie called matchstick men, its a movie about social engineering, i have a feeling it is on suprnova.org i just cant find it. i am still trying to decide whether i want an ipod or an external hard drive, apparently an external hard drive on usb 2.0 will run slow. i have about 4 gigs of music on my computer so i bet i could fill up an ipod. well im out.
