i spent the better part of last night finishing the front and back of carla. instead of dec. 3 stitches for the beginning of the raglan decreases, i decreased two on each side by k3tog. using this method i ended up with two extra stitches, but i couldn't come up with a way to dec. three stitches without breaking the pattern. i don't want the sweater to be baggy so i may end up frogging back and dec. 4 sts on either side. i am worried that this will make the sweater too tight (i normally wear a medium but i am knitting a small). i co for the sleeves this morning and immediately the edge started to roll. has anyone else had this problem? what method should i use to co? or . will the edge lay down by itself? i have also heard that once you unravel the stitches, your co edge becomes very loose. has anyone discovered a way to prevent this from happening?
