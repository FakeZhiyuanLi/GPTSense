hey, xplain this! who came up with the kooky scoring system for tennis, and how did they succeed in convincing everyone else that 1-2-3-4 was a bad idea for keeping score in a game? i mean, 15-love, 15-all, 40-30 etc. it makes no sense. what gives? do a post and give me your best theory. your readers want to know!
