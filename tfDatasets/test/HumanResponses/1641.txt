dear citizens of nashville, i would like to apologize in advance on behalf of my parents who will be visiting nashville for the weekend of august 2. please disregard the things they say which at times will likely be off color or rude. please forgive them as they are ignorant, conservative, republicans from california. they know not what they say not because they have been drinking but because they are ignorant. if you overhear them please just do your best to ignore them and please don't fault me. i have tried to teach them the ways of the open minded. i have tried to teach them the ways of the liberal, but they just don't hear it. thank you and again, i apologize. alison
