hello again! today is sunday, and that means.nothing special. well, i went to union street and then the nihonmachi street festival, where i saw none other than mr. kim and ms. gutierrez from across the street. well well well. i guess that's all there is to say about today. watched more olympics. rather dull, but that michael phelps guy is pretty interesting.
