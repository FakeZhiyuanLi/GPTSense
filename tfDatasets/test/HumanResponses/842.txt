this blog isn't journalistic in nature, but i wanted to be able to tell my faithful readers that i have finally been freed from my cast! i'm in a structured boot now, and have scheduled surgery on my left foot for july 23. please pray for me as this next surgery will be more complicated than the last. i'll be so glad when this whole nightmare is behind me. when it is, i'll have two brand new feet. almost. my right one looks like a new foot, and my left will be a more dramatic change.
