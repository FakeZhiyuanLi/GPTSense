-=love is only a feeling=- the first flush of youth was upon you when our eyes first met and i knew that to you and into your life i had to get i felt light-headed at the touch of this strangers hand an assault my defences systematically failed to withstand cos you came at a time when the pursuit of one true love in which to fall was the be all and end all love is only a feeling (drifting away) when im in your arms i start believing (its here to stay) but love is only a feeling anyway the state of elation that this union of hearts achieved i had seen, i had touched, i had tasted and i truly believed that the light of my life would tear a hole through each cloud that scudded by just to beam on you and i love is only a feeling (drifting away) when im your arms i start believing (its here to stay) but love is only a feeling anyway, anyway love is only a feeling (drifting away) and we've got to stop ourselves believing (its here to stay) cos love is only a feeling anyway
