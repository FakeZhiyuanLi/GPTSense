i should make this clear. i do not own a ps2 or x-box i am a pc gamer a comment i got from a friend made me realize that most gamers are on consoles. i on the other hand am not. i am a pc gamer first and foremost. i do however have the recommended equipment (mouse, keyboard, headset) for ps2. the usb equip for the ps2 is great. ok have a nice day, back to fragging.
