i think by definition i would be called a worry wort, but this has gone beyond that lately. now i think it would be called an anxiety disorder. this is my usual day's worry: do i pay enough attention to my daughter do i pay too much attention to my daughter is my daughter getting too fat? is she getting enough to eat? is she getting too much to eat? is she getting enough sleep? is she getting too much sleep? is she still breathing? better check. (this happens every time she takes a nap, about 20 times per hour long nap) okay enough on her, here's the other ones: when am i going to die? how's it going to feel? what if husband dies before me? what if my daughter dies before me? what if i die before them? what plans do i have in place if my husband dies? where will i go? will i be able to get work? will i want to work? who will help me take care of my daughter? uhg. there's more and it goes in this big eternal circle over and over. i want to stop worrying
