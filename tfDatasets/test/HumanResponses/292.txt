recently on the smackdown! brand on the wwe they have made the wwe champion none other than bradshaw. what is the wwe thinking? making the wwe champion the same guy who used to fall job to ryno only a few weeks ago? i always thought of bradshaw as being a mid-carder if i even gave him that good of a name. i dont know whats going thru the mind of vince mcmahon but it looks like he just killed the smackdown! brand.
