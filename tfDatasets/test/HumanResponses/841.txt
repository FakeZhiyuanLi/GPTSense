has it ever occured to u that what if, just what if ur whole life was nothing but a big fat, ugly lie. everything would just go wrong.( i don't mean to be a pessimist but still) u get from nowhere to nowhere. won't thatjust be devastating? oh very thought is so depressing ok topic change ummm somebody once said, there is no way to happiness, happiness is the way em> so ppl count ur blessing n stay cool
