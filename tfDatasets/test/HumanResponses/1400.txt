ok so i'm basicly in charge of my dad's books for his company. it's good that i'm getting experiance with starting a business before i do it myself. this shit seems like it's gonna be a pain in my ass. but once i learn it once i think i'll be in much better shape. i'd still like to do the house thing but i dont think that can be my only job. i have to look into lost freight auctions in the area. those and auctions from public storage units. i dont know if i'll get anything good but pretty much everything is ebay-able.
