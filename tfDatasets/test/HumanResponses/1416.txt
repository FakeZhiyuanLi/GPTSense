today was interesting. one of the guys i've been talking to online, wich i happen to like, decided to lie to me.a lot. well, as usual, mostly everybody lies to me. i feel so stupid to believe him. i feel so stupid to believe everyone. i got pissed off, mostly hurt, and got offline. i went into the bathroom and tried to end the pain. it was too hard. so i started to cry really hard. my mom found me and sedated me. i still feel like shit. still feel like crying. but the sedatives are numbing the pain. cant live, it hurts to live. i look and feel like shit. pain is love, i suppose. and if it is.my bf really loves me. more than anyone else. death seems so great right now.but im being observed everywhere i go so i cant do anything. it sux. kill me please. please just take away the pain.
