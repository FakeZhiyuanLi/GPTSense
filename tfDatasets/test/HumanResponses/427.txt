welcome to my blog. my name is scott and i am a 27 year old resident of oakland, ca. i enjoy drinking recreationally (beer, hard alcohol, tea, coffee and espresso), smoking (cigars, alas cigarettes are no longer in the picture), oakland pro-sports (athletics and raiders), music (pre-1980 country and western, pre-1990 rock and roll, early 90's east bay punk rock), reading/writing fiction, philosophy (hume is my basis)procrastinating, complaining and pontificating. as such, i decided to throw up a blog where i can ruminate about those first six interests and indulge in the final three. oh yeah, i forgot to mention, i tend to suffer from mild manic-depression and major social anxiety giving my outlook a rather pessimistic, misanthropic tint. anyhow, if for some bizarre reason you are receiving this transmission, enjoy and jump in. scott
