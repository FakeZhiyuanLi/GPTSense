mom has really irritated me all day. she won't stay away from here computer long enough to pet me but 5 or 6 times. she forgot to put ice in my water bowl and then yelled at me when i tried to lick the ice in her cup. she forgot to leave the tv on when she left earlier so i had nothing to watch while she was gone. and what really got my tail in a knot? well mom and grandma sat here and watched some make fun of cats show right in front of me. as if i wasn't even in the room. i mean geez what do they think, i don't have feelings? i think i will knead her arm extra hard tonight. meow!
