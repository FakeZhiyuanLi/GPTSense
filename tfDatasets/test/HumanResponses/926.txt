howdy folks.charley is coming.lol school is cancelled tomorrow due to that hurricane, pretty cool (sort of). well school has been going .ok i guess, unbelievably boring! i guess thats b/cuz i dont know anyone in any of my classes but maybe that'll change soon.i do see my old frineds at lunch and we hang out.but its just not the same. damn i need to get a girl.sarah is sort of the only girl i find myself attracted to but why bother it'll all just end in a train wreck like the past two relationships we had, plus she can be difficult and in a way so can i.if there was a way we could settle our differences i might consider going back out with her. but then again there are plenty of girls out there i just doubt any of them are interested in me. :( cya blah
