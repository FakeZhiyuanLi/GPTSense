spring is okay so far we got engaged without romantic proposals just golden rings and a three-decade-old red wine. 300 euros poorer we now have sweet smelling walls and not a washroom with green tiles. dark patches of clouds here and there above our yard but funny how grandma was the only one drenched. my self-esteem got washed away too, but perhaps it will turn up in portugal or parnu in the summer i canâ€™t hardly wait. copyright 2001 by serenity
