call it reminiscing, but i find myself going back to listening to all or most of the music i listened to in high school or during my freshman/sophomore years of college. i haven't listened to public image ltd. since probably my senior year of hs, but here i sit, really appreciating every last part of it like i never have before. i encourage every last one of you to break out your old music collection and listen to every single cd until it gives you meaning. it'll be well worth your time.
