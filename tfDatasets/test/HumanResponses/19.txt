so i've had a pretty bad stomach virus for the past two days. i have like 0 strength and can hardly get out of bed. it really, really sucks. i've caught up on tv watching though. i can't eat anything substantial because it doesn't stay down. it's horrible. other than that, nothing's really been going on but i figured i'd update. maybe some more later.
