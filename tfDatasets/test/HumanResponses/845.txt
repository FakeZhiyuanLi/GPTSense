welcome, all of you faithful readers and bloggers. i have created this blog in light of a decision i've made to make my blogging more interesting. i figured that since my old blog was not getting the kind of traffic i wanted, i needed a tabula rasa (clean slate) to work with. these blogs will be more related to current events than my previous blog, and hopefully will instigate compelling discussion. this is a new beginning, a time of rebirth and growth. join me in my journalistic journey!
