i bought more stuff for my trip today, an eagle creek toiletries bag and an off the shoulder pouch to carry my mp3 player, guidebook, camera and stuff.part of the airport at charles de gaulle in paris collapsed which is creepy since i will be flying out of there to go to athens and then back to the us. also, they found a bomb in athens, never have i felt more close to world events than now
