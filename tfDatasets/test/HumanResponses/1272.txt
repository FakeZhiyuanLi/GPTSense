i'm walking through union square park this morning. headphones on. donovan's "where is she?" comes on. it becomes this amazing soundtrack for walking lethargically through the park. everthing's in slow motion. and i'm looking at the people on the benches. it's all surreal. these faces. these blank, tragic faces. stone faces. faces of madness, especially this cigarette smoke-wrinkled woman, heavy eyeliner, defeated and staring at dogs and smoking. the guy with palms pressed together chanting. and me still walking slow, because it's the way i feel. and donovan walks with me.
