one of my best friends from iit kanpur, deepak garg, arrived in iiml yesterday. he’s joining the pgp20 batch. those who know dg will tell you that he is one of the best thinkers of our batch from iitk and he deserves to be in a much better place than iiml. his coming to l this year was a surprise. i was expecting that he’ll crack either b or c (he didn’t get a call from a). but then life is full of surprises, some pleasant, some unpleasant and dg perhaps is going through one of those lean patches of life that all of us have been through at some point of time or the other. i’m sure he’ll come through and crack everything that comes his way from here onwards. best of luck, dg, for your stint at iiml.
