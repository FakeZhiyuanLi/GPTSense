i saw her again to day, but nothing more than a passing glance. what i wouldn't give, to hold that girl.i've written her several songs, she knows how i feel about her. but sadly, for me, she is already in a relationship. so i find myself once again lost in this dark spiralling chasm, gasping for breath, hoping yet again to catch a fading glimpse of her beauty.she's so beautiful. my story is nothing but a speck in all of history, but it is still my story, and i won't let it end unhappily, i won't stop loving her, if indeed i do love herthere are many definitions of love, mine is wanting to just be near her, nothing more than to see her, but ohh this lonelyness is dark, so very dark.hopefully she will find her way to me, maybe, if i'm lucky.she's so beautiful.
