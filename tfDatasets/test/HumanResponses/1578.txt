today was really fun,i spent the morning relaxing listening to a compilation c.d i made with bands like : stories & comets, motion city soundtrack and snow patrol on it. i didn't do much else in the morning apart from doing my regular post up on gaming world, i got the 5:20pm train to chloe's house  we layed in bed listening to music, it was so much fun just watching her. knowing that we are ok again, we had fun tickling each other under the covers. after that we watched school of rock, (i am mr. cool i swear)  which was fun  had a pasta bake (yum-yum). then we went to bells and got : skittles, hippos and a milky bar. was a fun day, i loved the moment we had in the bed :)  i real heart warmer !
