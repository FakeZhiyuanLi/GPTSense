i have just heard that my interview that was going to be held tomorrow morning has been postponed until next week. the reason for this postponement is due to an update to their cms which they need to evaluate before making an appointment. normally this would possibly aggrevate me but as i am yet to finish swotting up on asp and vbscript and finish my 15 minute presentation. the update gives me a stay of execution , certainly enough time to knock up a kick ass presentation.
