on the banks of the rivers of babylon i sat down and wept for strange towns where we lived a year or two for the walk on the long wooden path to the river and woods for crumbling longhouses for the smell of dark swampy water for the lost of paternal love. on the banks of the rivers of babylon i sat down and wept for the call of the ocean for the coldness of trade winds for sands and stones beneath my feet for the lane where we held hands below the arch of branches for sunsets and fields. on the banks of the rivers of babylon i sat down and wept for our early morning shadows in rose-tinted rooms for our lost dreams of yesteryears for our playgrounds and games for our smiles and tears for us ceasing to be children overnight for our age of innocence. copyright 2004 by serenity
