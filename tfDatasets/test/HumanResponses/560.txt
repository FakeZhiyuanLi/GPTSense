jun, my office mate, emailed to me this story: some time ago, a mother punished her 5 year old daughter for wasting a roll of expensive gold wrapping paper. money was tight and she became even more upset when the child used the gold paper to decorate a box to put under the christmas tree. nevertheless, the little girl brought the gift box to her mother the next morning and said, "this is for you, momma." the mother was embarrassed by her earlier over-reaction, but her anger flared again when she opened the box and found it was empty. she spoke to her daughter in a harsh manner. "don't you know, young lady, when you give someone a present, there's supposed to be something inside the package?" the teary-eyed child said, "oh, momma, it's not empty! i blew kisses into it until it was full."
