ok i only put that as the title coz sum1 on msn just said it. but anyway, 2day was a pritty boring day we went 2 homebase and got sum paint 4 my room coz it needs it. and we had a bbq with a few of my step dads relatives, oh but good news is my m8 bickham is back from holiday. and hannah wont stop calling me druggie since she found out that i have smoked weed in the past. but only twice im not realy big druggie and it was ages ago and i started getting moody so i stoped. but hopefully the novelty of calling me druggie will ware off soon as well as the novelty of makeing me gay on the sims :@ anyoing indeed. but she is well alrite off msn.
