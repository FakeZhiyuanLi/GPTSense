cheerio mates, 2day wasn't too bad but it wasn't good either so lets just say it wasnormal. its started out bad cuz i overslept til like 2:30 when i had plans with tim at 11:30 to go to the local eb games and the bike trail. but, we did get a chance to hang out like 5 mins after i got up, lol. but we didnt go to eb but we did go to 7-11 which was kinda worthless cuz we got this wanna-be surge drink that had a messed up after-taste. but it was cool. i did this awesome tailslide while riding off the trail to test my new diamondback, woo7. and, the rest of the day was just boring, i had to babysit my mom's co-worker's son, but honestly i didnt watch him, i just went back in my room and watched t.v. and yea the next couple hrs arent important so.yea, but now i'm on the phone with kevin and maria which i have been for a couple hrs now. kinda funny how you can stay on the phone for so long and talk about nothing. hah, being a teenager is confusing experience. piece.
