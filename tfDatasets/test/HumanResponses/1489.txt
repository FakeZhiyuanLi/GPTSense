in your eyes i can see into the depths of your soul. i know you as i know myself. you have always been a part of me, even before i knew your name. you will always be a part of me, long after our names have lost meaning. you live in my heart and i love you. love that reaches beyond my need to have you, beyond my desire to hold you, beyond my fear of losing you. in your eyes i see your capacity to love. there is an infinite amount of love that you give freely. in your embrace i am home. in your arms my soul is still, my heart at peace, and i am safe. in your arms is where i long to be.
