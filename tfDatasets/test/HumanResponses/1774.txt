well my first week or half a week of school is over. yay! it has been fun, today there was a gc in the senior lounge and i played ssb like all day long. the homework load is light, but it will get bigger. and my classes are nice, so for now i have nothing to complain about. picked up the kill bill 2 dvd and there is this deleted scene, from which like 1 second of it was shown in the trailer and it is sooo awesome. bill kills these five guys with relative ease. the due date for all films wanting to be in indie memphis is in like 4 weeks from now. time to get working well, i dont really have all that much to post about. oh! i am taking my driver's test again this tuesday, and guess what i'm studying for it. until next time.
