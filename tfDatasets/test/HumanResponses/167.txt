first, i have to make my disclaimer. this a joke, not to be taken seriously. now to the possible obituary for my annoying sister. **censored name** died far from the comforts of her own house today. she was at her grandmother's, picking up sticks out while riding a golf cart. since she pissed off m. too many times, m. slammed the brakes and turned suddenly, throwing her from the cart and crushing her skull. her nosy, bitchy behavior will be missed, to be sure.
