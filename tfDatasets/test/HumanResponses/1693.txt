curse my heart, for it has broken me. flooded my cheeks with tears, inflicted my chest with pain, forced a hate so deep into me, hatred for myself. not for me, but for who am i not. i hate me. not all the time, just now and then, more now then, then. but, if only i had, had a love, a kiss or a hug, a warmth in my soul, a weekness in my knees, if only, if only, if only you.
