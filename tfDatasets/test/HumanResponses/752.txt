the ups man brought by a nice surprise today. he brought my new sony ericsson t226 cell phone. i got the free upgrade reminder from sony ericsson in the mail a few weeks ago and i really didn't think i'd get it. nothing is ever free anymore. we'll see about this one. my old phone(is 7 months old?) is being donated to my brother. he wants bluetooth for his tg50 and i suppose his laptop. it should be fun for him to use. bluetooth really didn't live up to my expectations, maybe it will with him.
