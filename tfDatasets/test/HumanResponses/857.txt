work: margot's back. please. comments: margot's back! we did our usual thing yesterdaylunch @ makeda, going to the bank, running other errands, and basically catching up on things. i graded like a madwoman last night, and a lot of the papers were very good. i prepared for class, went out for a very late dinner with margot, and then we hung around a bit more until she grew tired. not much was done, and i didn't write a thing (not to mention the fact that i didn't exercise). i also spent a bit more money than i would have liked, but i don't think it will be the end of the world. i did not hear from the insurance company today. i watched part of a horrible red sox game, and mapped out my academic schedule until thanksgivingwhat a nightmare that will be! if i can do it though.wow.
