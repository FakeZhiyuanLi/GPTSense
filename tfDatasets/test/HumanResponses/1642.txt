you walk away and as the time passes your squashed heart begins to heal. you don't see her for weeks. then when you do you stumble for a moment, but realize that it's not so bad. you gain interest in other things, other people and other places in your life. you see that you do deserve better, you see that your friends were right. you no longer think of her the moment you awake nor the moment you go to sleep at night. you quit secretly telling her you love her. your heart is finally in a good place. then she writes, then she wants to get together, she assures you only as friends, only platonic, without any strings. however your healing, weak heart begins to consider falling again. all over again. for what? just to break again, just to go through again what you didn't think you could live through the first time. you say never again, not this time, i won't fall, i won't be duped in her seedy game, i am going to make it. but just when you finally begin to make it, she writes.
