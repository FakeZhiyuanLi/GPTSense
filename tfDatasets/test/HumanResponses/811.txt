kalapana here comes the night once again i'll be feeling lonely oh, if only things could work out like you plan where can love be tell me why it's so hard to find somebody who will stand by me and take the time to understand and show me love again i want the real thing or nothing at all i need someone that i can be sure will catch me if i should fall someone who'll be there when i call then i'll know that it's the real thing i want the real thing to warm me each night someone to love me over and over making the future bright someone who'll be there when i call just give me the real thing where is the moon? won't it smile on just one more dreamer let your beams come down and fill my empty room here comes the night but if there's still a chance that love can find me i'll be here crossing my fingers i want to know for sure that i can feel secure knowing i've found an everlasting love and once i get that under control then i won't let go
