today i realized what chickenheads girls can be. all they do is walk around bawk bawkin. they have to be useful in some way. but they're not! but anyways, i wrote a rhyme about it. this is my first post, you guys are going to notice that i express my emotions through making rhymes. so check this one out. man, these girls always walk up and be like bawk bawk bawk it's surprisin' to me because i'm the lady hawk girls have imaginary beaks they peck at you and step on your feet chickenheads always think they run the game they think they change the man but the man stays the same us men? we gotta stick together instead of seein' a chickenhead and chasin after their feathers a guy like messin wit' a chicken dat's silly i don't front with chickens, and dat's da dilly i'll keep posting whenever i have a new rhyme. if you liked it playa stay up! if you didn't  that's too bad, because i'm going to be the first rapping president.
