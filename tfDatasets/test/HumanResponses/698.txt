man.i really am the dumbest person in the whole world. i went to see 'the day after tomorrow' at the movies (very good, has to be seen on large screen!), but i decided to take the following with me for no reason: - customise grip w/ rubber thing + g-winder - gaia dragoon ms so guess what? (a) i lost it. (b) i lost it because i had piss! (c) i lost it becuase i'm a god damn idiot! correct answer .(c)! so, i am having thoughts about taking a break from blading, my desision isn't final, so i'll keep you posted.btw, if i do.it wont be for long, just until i decide what to do next. untill my next post.toodles
