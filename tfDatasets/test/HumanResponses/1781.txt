c heers! i sign up and pay for an msn premium account today since i saw that there is a discount price for the internal employees:) the price sounds good, $30.00/year, compare with the market price $99.95/year, it is very nice. i got $2.6 tax plus. msn premium is very excellent, although there are many services can not be supported in china at present, i still enjoy it very much.
