weather-wise, yesterday was a bad day. typhoon signal no.1 was hoisted over the metropolis and you felt you’d rather stay home all day. at 8.00am, though, i found myself among the audience at the quirino grandstand in rizal park, witnessing the inauguration of the president. facing a huge crowd that took cover under umbrellas, the president, in aquamarine gown, spoke about her ten-point agenda (but this you already knew from the news the day before), and called for unity towards the common good. the line which i liked most was: tupdin ninyo ang inyong tungkulin. gagampanin ko ang akin. (do your duties, while i do mine.) the ceremony was brief and simple, stately but not grandiose. by 8.40am, we had left the grandstand and were headed to our office. raging waves battered the bayside along roxas boulevard. browsing over the souvenir program, i noted the president’s busy sked. by 9am, her plane should be taking off for cebu city for her oath taking.
