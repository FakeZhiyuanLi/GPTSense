i type 101 words per minute but it's in my own language. i used to have really long hair, and people thought i was high all the time. people always compare long hair with drug use. i wish long hair was connected to something other than drug use. like, "an extreme longing for cake." a stranger would be all "that fucker eats cake. he is on rum cake." a mother would be all "don't bring the cake eater over here anymore. he smells like flour. did you see how excited he got when he found out your birthday was fast approaching?" i've gotten the aids test about four times now, the aids test is scary. waiting for the results is frightening. so i don't get the regular test anymore. i get the round-and-about aids test. i call my friend, and i go "yo brian, you know anyone who has aids? no? cool. because you know me." mitch hedberg. haha.
