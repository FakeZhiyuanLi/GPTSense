well. today is another of the boring days to add to te list, have done basically nothing since about 10 this morning (its now 3). its not like i don't want to work there is just nothing to do and it frustrates the shit out of me that things change that i should know about but either i am told hours before i am supposed to do something about it, or not told and i find out from someone on a different site. my office is beside the pm but i hear nothing and am told nothing. should just duck my head like the good little mushroom i am.
