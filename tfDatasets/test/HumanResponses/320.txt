“how do you depend on a person, when people are so unreliable? in the end, you will have nothing. the people around you will vanish, and you will be left with an empty feeling.” this is my greatest fear. the pain of this feeling is unbearable, that’s why i have kept my distance from many people. i’m glad i have the courage to deal with this. i will not be defeated. "fear defeats more people than any other one thing in the world." -ralph waldo emerson
