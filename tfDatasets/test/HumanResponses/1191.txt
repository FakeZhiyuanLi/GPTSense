today i was on ems. i love those guys so much. i would protect them with my life. anyhow, yupui was talking about spammers and he posted this: what i was thinking of. a crack team of people who worked around the clock to to put the exact chainletters into the auto block. i'd be tedious, but then again, i'd also be tedious to change the wording after a while. and instead of blocking them, they should just replace it with "i'm a stupid spammer" just like they do with the "this is not a scam" thing. i laughed so hard! good times with ems. -sighs- -happy tears- :')
