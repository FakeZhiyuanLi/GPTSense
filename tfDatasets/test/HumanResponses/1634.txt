the general assumption is that we americans are pretty silly, even simple minded folk that just want to consume as fast and as much as we can. well i hate to say that the current reaction over the gas prices, as well as the well publicized "gas boycott", has simply proven this better than anything we could have ever done on purpose. until people realize that driving an escalade actually does have an effect at the macro level we will not see wide spread change among american drivers. so i guess it is ok to drive that tahoe, just don't forget it when you go preaching to your friends about how this war is really just for oil. and by the way, if you drive a civic twice as much as your neighbor drives his big suvwell hopefully you see the point.
