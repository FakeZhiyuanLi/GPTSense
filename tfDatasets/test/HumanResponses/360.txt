dreamweaver lying alone in your bed images from the past filling your head you try to run, you try to hide but there is no escape, your eyes are open wide long time ago you felt alive now only emptiness is blackening your life the time has come to break away or you go astray dreamweaver - there is so much more to see dreamweaver - there is a deeper way to feel dreamweaver - misery takes a hold of you paralyzes your soul dreamweaver - find a way to understand dreamweaver - you hold your fate in your own hand dreamweaver - break your chains and make your move or you might just see a dreamweaver's fall things that you started are still undone while you are wasting you precious life the sleepless nights won't leave you be you're going astray
