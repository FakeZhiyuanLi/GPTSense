so, i am starting a blog. there. your welcome sara. so tonight i had to deal with a crazy person. maybe we are all crazy people. i thought i would write a lot about this but i have now changed my mind because i am crazy also. foxy is asleep at my feet and she is having one of those dreams where her feet are moving like she's running. it's really adorable. i can only imagine what she's dreaming. i am listening to "i look good in leather" by cody chesnutt. that song makes me laugh. it's so arrogant. in a great way. anyone who reads this should go see the jeremy lister band @ sputnik in the 11th. 11:30pm. oh, crazies.
