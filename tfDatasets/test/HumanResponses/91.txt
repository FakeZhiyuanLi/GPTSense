hello everybody! i'm very stoned right now, yep i'm stoned and im listening to a couple songs. the sogn i like to listen to the most at the time is "white rabbit" by jefferson airplane, i love jefferson airplane they have good songs and grace slick was hott back when they were making the music. "white rabbit" is about alice in wonderland, only this song deliberately screams out that the story is about a drug trip. taking mushrooms, smoking hookahs, taking pills your not supposed to take will make you happy but the ones your mom has you take suck ass, and thats among many others just as cool. im stoned and writing this, my brother was talking on the phone in his room and i heard is voice talking to someone, when im stoned i tend to get very paranoid so by not hearing what my brother is saying on the phone but knowing hes talking to someone, it could be my mom and hes telling her what im doing thatd suck ass.
