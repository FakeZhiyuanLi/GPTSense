sadly sifting through the shadows of my past my mind wanders restless searching i stumble over the remains of what was once beautiful, whole. captured in bold flashes of colour, indelibly etched a vision of happiness found joy that was once celebrated. i extend myself reach out the memory fades the blackness remains.
