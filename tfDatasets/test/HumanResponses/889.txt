i'm at the gaming cafe with no games to play. so.updating my blog sounded like a reasonable way to kill the rest of my computer time. who cares? my brother payed for it. i found some kick ass pictures of jesus on google, for some reason. this guy beside me keeps on calling me godboy. i guess i'm the athiest godboy. that's it. screenname change. if bstevegod then showmessage ('i am changing my screenname to athiest bible humper'); end you know what? i miss programming class. what the fuck? whatever. i got ot see hillary today, which was alright. we played truth or dare wit hjoel and jacquie for a bit. i was dared to french her, so it was a good game. well, that's about it for today, sowell -adios -steve
