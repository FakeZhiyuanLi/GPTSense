avram works in very mysterious ways. when we first met avram it was through the cryptic messages he left on our dorm dry-erase message boards. they said something like "avram says 'hi' 3:40am". or something. this weird approach to communicating with the opposite sex is still a big part of being avram. recently he's been canvasing for people who want to add a little "av diggity to the rotation". and by that i believe he's referring to the rotation that pot makes when you smoke it and pass it. but av - what about the rotation that i make every work day when i check out people's blogs on the internet? that is where i've been missing the av diggity. however maybe this is something more celestial. i've noticed i've also not been blogging regularly. and this morning i woke up with a sore throat for some reason. am i getting sick? ya - sick of avram not blogging anymore
