our office is quiet. out of 4 salesmen and myself: one is hung over, one is stressed, one is new and one is about 4 hours away. the only person left is me and a dead fish that we froze as a practical joke. next door kelly is pulling her hair out, dropping f-bombs because of a co-worker and relative that just might send her off to church camp before the day is through. i'm sitting with my ramen noodles attempting to get a lunch while the phone and fax ring off of the hook. blog to remember, i hardly think so- but some mondays just suck worse than others.
