all alone again, another day, another night, alone. gazing towards the heavens, i think; of you, of me, of us, of your eyes, of your smile, of your kiss, of your touch, of your laugh, of you sayin "i love you." of you sayin "i want to spend forever with you" of you with him, of your lips on him, of you saying "i can't live without you," of you saying "but, i cant live without his kiss." my heart turns, my eyes burn, i try to think, of the words to say, words that will break your wall down, melt your heart and arouse your soul. of the words i can say, to get you back. no words come, but., i love you.
