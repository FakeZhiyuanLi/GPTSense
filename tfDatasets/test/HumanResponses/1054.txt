welcome, flesh of my flesh and blood of my blood. this blog has been established for all of us to use, hopefully opening up some extra lines of communication between all of us. we know how hard it is to share everything that's going on when we live so far apart and talk only occasionally. gone are those days. let us partake in the free exchange of thoughts, feelings, and experience.and maybe some pictures, too. i want to know what's going on in the minds and lives of those i hold dear. please join me on this excursion.or else we'll have a vote and disown you.
