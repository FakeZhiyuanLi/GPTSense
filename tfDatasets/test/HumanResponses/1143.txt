mood: reflective listening to: craig armstrong - this love anyone who knows me well will know how much i like nicki. kelly asked me today if i'd asked her out yet. i told her no. she asked me why not? i ended up explaining it to jacs. if i asked her out she would most likely say no, in which case everything would stay the way it is now, me having a thing for her, nd her not caring. but if she did say yes, wot then? i wouldn't know what to do - having never been in a real relationship before - and i would just be a bag of nerves. i know i wont make a good boyfriend, and thats why not. i'm much better at being peoples friends.
