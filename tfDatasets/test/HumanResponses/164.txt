wow, i'm e-mailing stuff directly onto my blog. i'm so easily amused, aren't i? anyway, talkin' to **censored name** now. she got a cell phone today, so she's pretty happy, even if she's mad at me, which i think she is. she said i could stop by her house on wednesday, though, so it's all cool. **censored name** was asking what i did to her earlier tonight too. but then **censored name** denied bein' mad at me, so i'm kinda confused. oh well. i'm having too much fun blogging via e-mail! signing off, m.
