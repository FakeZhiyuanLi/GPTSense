i am a christian. i am proud to be a christian, and i try to be a good christian. the other day i was reading a blog that spoke of a person's mother who rejected christianity because "christians are "bigots" because we believe that ours is the only way and so we exclude other good and "holy" people and, in fact, condemn them all to hell." i was highly impressed with the daughter's response, which i won't go into here, but it did get me to thinking. chistians can't "condemn" somone to hell, only god can do that. chistians don't determine what gets you to heaven and what does not. jesus did that when he said "i am the way, the truth, and the life, nobody comes to the father except through me." bigotry is defined as "an attitude of intolerance." is it intolerant to believe what god has told us through the bible? those who reject someone for their beliefs should look into a mirror. maybe the bigot will be staring back at them.
