so yesterday my sister got a call from the recording studio were she is suppose to go to make her cd. well the guy that is making her cd wants to meet with her but hear her first. and the girl that was handing out the prizes at the place my sister played at friday night (the battle of the bands) works at the town hall and she was talking to the people there way back when my sister first played at the student lounge and she said how good she was and a lot of other stuff too. and they all planed for stephanie to win at the battle of the bands and that is why they got the 4 hour recording session. so it was all planed for her to win but anyways the town said that if the recording goes any longer then 4 hours that they will pay for it. i think that is soooooooooo great i am really happy.
