got my gameboy advance sp (the nes one) yesterday. at the moment i'm still only playing the old gameboy and gameboy color games that were at my folks house (mainly stuff they had got after i moved away). there are seven games, 4 of which are zelda games! including oracle of ages and oracle of seasons, neither of which i've beaten (only even played one, which one i don't remember), so that should be exciting. i've played it with the four swords adventures games for my gamecube, which is pretty neat, and i've tried it out with windwaker. uhmm.if you don't know, those are both zelda games. yeah, i like zelda. hell, i'm even thinking of buying the gba zelda, a link to the past/four swords adventures. or, if you have any suggestions, i'm open!
