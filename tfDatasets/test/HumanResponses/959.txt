i have a serious amount of flem. my throat hurts. i would like to thank the combined effort of squeet and lulu of infecting me. thanks. yesterday i stayed up an exceedingly long time and got up rather too early. my eyes hurt. i plain hurt. all over one might say. i have practice today. i can barely stand up-right let alone jump around singing not so classic punk songs. again thanks squeet. you are the worst in my bad books and have sunk. greatly. i have a calculator on my speaker. it is doing little good. maths exam is a while off. it'll be ok. maybe. maybe not. science is rather too soon to bare. god bless it. i shall soon attempt to eat breakfast. after that i shall attempt retaining it in my stomach. with little success i feel. my grammar is now on top form. which is rather bad as you can tell. going to go peel the crust from the inside of my nostril. not really. i am blowing my nose. exit.
