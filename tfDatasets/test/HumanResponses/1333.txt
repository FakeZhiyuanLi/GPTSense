i feel like crap today. but you know what? i don't care! i have shit to do. so, anyway, this morning i dropped the jeep off to get rhino lined. which means that even if it rains the inside should never stink like rotting dead things again. good deal. i hate that nasty smell. so, anyway, i feel like shit. more later.
