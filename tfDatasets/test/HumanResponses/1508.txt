these days i feel lucky because i can get home earlier than before. at least by the time 8:pm i leave my office and go home. when i think of my body and mental health, it's definitely a good thing. overtime working threatens man's health, especially mentally. i know about it, but i can't say that i'm totally happy. to be exact, i feel a little hesitated to leave office early. because most of my colleagues and my boss are still working there. my boss once told me that " you should help your colleagues when you're not busy." usually i try to do so. they never force me, they say "you should get home early if you think you can". and finally i decide to get home, saying to myself that "that's all for today. my task is going on schedule. overtime working produces another costs for the company, so i don't have to be here." i'm disappointed what a coward guy i am. it's good to go home early, but. can anyone cause blackout in my office at 6pm every weekdays?
