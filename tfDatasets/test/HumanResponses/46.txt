i had a very eventful weekend. my wife and i are buying a house. it is a process that god will walk, neigh, crawl us through to the end. so much to do and wait for and learn and blah, blah. but we are very very excited. this is the woman that i want to spend my whole life with and we will move into our first house together soon. it's cool, you should see it. things are interesting. i am letting the devil have a lot of control over my thoughts, and then i read in romans that there is no condemnation awaiting those in jesus. the law was made weak by the sinful nature of man, but made holy by jesus coming and dying after living a perfect life. i am free. i have to exercise that liberty in a responsible way. i pray that this week will bring me into a place of clear and holy thinking, so that god will be glorified with my life. brother willy is awesome, god is huge. good night.
