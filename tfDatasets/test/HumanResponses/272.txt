we went to go see dodgeball: a true underdog story tonight. not bad. i laughed (although that's not hard to accomplish). lots of hilarious cameos, including chuck norris and david hasselhoff. any movie that has david hasselhoff chewing out germans (in german, no less) is good by me! (germans love david hasselhoff)
