well yesterday was the big little party and it was cool except that i only saw my little for like 3 seconds, justine and i got way to sweaty, it didn't rain, there was no water, and i was hungry. but other than that it was fun. some weird guy called me last night and was like "what are you doing" and i said "nothing, what are you doing?" and he goes "laying in bed thinking about you." and i was like ok. i have no idea who it was and so i said gtg bye and hung up. so if anyone knows who it was please please please tell me. well i got to go strip the bed and wash the sheets for tomoko, b/c she comes today. ciao
