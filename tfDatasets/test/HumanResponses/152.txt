last nite's party was no different from the hundreds of other desi-parties that are hosted around clemsonit had all the usual ingredients- a keg , liquor (kept hidden by the host) , mix-n-match of hindi and english dance numbers and the same faces.but i have become such a sucker for all these parties that i shall still go to the next one i am invited to without even thinking once.
