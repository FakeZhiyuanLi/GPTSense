they are wearing the suites. the robe. shiny shoes. neckties. ahh. i feel glad for them, and sorry for me. because i supposedly graduated today, but some technical problem prevent me from being happy n nervous like my friends. i had to continue for another semester and my graduation day shud be a year from now. august 2005. but life has to go on anyway. that's all. just wanna congrats them on their graduation. and happy job hunting. i want to continue my reading. elizabeth was getting scarier becoz her only trusted employee had been assasinated (sidney sheldon - bloodline) today, just like any day before. it is hot. i can say it is almost 40deg c. but i think it is okay becoz it is better a shiny day rather than rainy. if it is to rain, i do hope it will be this midnight. so that i can sleep with my comforter wrapped around me like a cocoon. okey, time to get back to my book. (aaa i miss her again)
