this is a family recipe. it is the best potato salad in the world in my opinon. i have tried many different types and none compare. my mom and all her sisters make this. it is present at every picnic and everyone is glad for that. dressing: beat 2 eggs 2 tbs. flour 2 tbs. sugar 1/4 c. vinegar 1 tsp. salt 1/4 tsp. pepper 2 tsp. prepared mustard (yellow) blend, add 2 c. water boil until thick add 1 c. mayonaise (i like hellmans) 5 lbs potatoes, boiled and cut in squares 3 stalks celery (or morei like lots) 1 sm onion finely chopped 3 hard boiled eggs, chopped updated to answer questions in comments: my mother used all purpose white potatoes but waxy potatoes like red skinned potatoes or yellow finn potatoes work really well. boil 5 lbs of potates with their skins on until tender but not over cooked. pour off water immediately and allow them to cool. peel and cut into cubes (~1 cm or 1/2 inch square). add dressing and stir gently to coat.
