ah communication one of the most important things in any relationship. learn 2 talk 2 ur partner, risk fights if u have 2 just 2 get the two of you 2 talk things out. remember fights are not always bad if a couple can fight and love each other after that then that's the kind of relationship that will last. but failure 2 talk 2 your partner about problems will eventually build up and cause more problems and more problems and that will come back 2 haunt you when both people explode. then those fights will cost you a relationship and much pain afterwards.
