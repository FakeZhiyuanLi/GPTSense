i've spent the last few years trading muscle mass for computer time. ooops! so, i joined a health club last week as part of a big lifestyle change. i'm pretty attracted to the idea of having energy all day long. on my first day, i had an assessment during which i was flooded with memories of the grade school presidential fitness exam. i still rock at the sit-and-reach, but i was surprised to find that i also rock at sit-ups and i set a new club record for lung capacity. all that to say, i'm weak and weight training is my new best friend. they also have a great locker room which brings me to the universal question: why is there always the one guy in the men's locker room who likes to walk around naked? and why does he always have flabby butt cheeks? do you know, internet? which one of you is that guy ? did you forget that you were naked? did you want to show off your lack of self consciousness, or is it about intimidation, like standing in someone's personal space? why?
