i gave my 6th toastmaster speech today. i contrasted my wonderfully memorable trip as a 11 year old back in 1989 to the sorry state of kashmir today. it came from my heart and was able to describe the change of affairs in sentences such as these: - the natural utopia has been relegated to man-made hell. - it doesn't matter who is wrong, what matters is who is wronged. - it's the new normal. i accept it. i am a part of it. it was a good experience coz it was well received and i look forward to giving more speeches in the future.
