ok one time i was playing socom and the guy, right, well he came up to my and i turned around and like i shot my 50 cal. and like he got hit right in his chest(me thinking he is dead chucked a nad at another guy not knowing the guy i shot didn't die) so bye then i was dead. hoping my nad dropped before i was killed i waited but nothing happened, then about a minute after i died this guy walked over my dead body i i heard an explosion(i was in my room getting a pen and paper) i ran in and at the top of my tv it said ,gsg-9 magnum(me) fragged ******(don't remember) with an m67 and i was like what the fuck. and i won the round for my team. that's f.u.b.a.r.(fucked up beyond all recognition)
