being a systems analyst at westcon is a lot like working for the fire department. you need to stay prepared, stay aware and just wait wait wait for something to go wrong. inevitably, something always does. so, in the spirit of making dealing with tickets a bit more palatable, a few of us here have taken to writing and including haiku in or about our ticket responses. without further adieu, here are a few: tickets are like fish for they have no sense of time they will still wait there notes will not open. tickets are there waiting now. they will wait longer. patiently i wait. tick tock tick tock its friday my home beckons me "i click the button the page it is not there now i will shop elsewhere" i cannot log in the problem is not my own ticket needs new home
