i decided to start my first blog. it's been a while i'm thinking about it, saying i will do it soon. and was never starting it. it's weird how things are sometimes, i stopped looking around to find a place to write my free blog. and today i decided to install googletoolbar, to stop receiving popups. ken told me the google toolbar would block everything, it did! i wondered in the options and found something about a blog. here i am now!
