i had a dream last night. "she" was in it. i've had a crush on her since school, and i was hoping to lose it during the summer, but it turns out my dreams don't want me too. this is just getting rediculous. why am i, adam garrick lee giovanni otti ston, in love with anyone?!?!?! i've been asked out by many and turned down each one, but the only one that matters i don't even have the courage to even think of? i have to talk to her: not about it, but i just have to see her. i wish i could just hate everyone and get it over with, but for some reason i need them all.
