good evening again. it has been raining. the sun has been doing a short peep show. now and again that is. i really am not on top form. feeling particularly sad about leaving currently. no matter. i shall be back to normal. soon. descent. beginning to wonder whether i have the right spelling of the right word. is descent as in it's good or falling? no matter. zoom out camera man. listening to "am i missing" by dashboard, it is mighty good. buy their album also. i do believe that this is not a good choice. moving. bullshit. i don't want to leave you all. ever. just written a pretty awesome set of lyrics. i don't think i'll ever get to use them. i'm always second rate. or it feels that way. back to masking the way i really feel by short sporadic sentences. i would share my lyrics. but you'd jip them you thiefing munchkins you. umpa-lumpas even. with your orange skin and your green hair. you make me sick.
