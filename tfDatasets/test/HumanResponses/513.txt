i finally got around to swatching! it took a bit more time than it should have because i kept forgetting to yarn over before the slip 1, k1, psso. so annoying. hopefully after i cast on i'll have it in my brain. otherwise, i'll have to count my stitches after every row to make sure that i haven't forgotten to do it! i'm having second thoughts about the color i chose, string. (photos later) boy, is it dull. i thought i wanted something neutral. i had considered glint, but that shade isn't quite warm enough against my skin. argh. anyway, string it is! who knows? maybe i'll grow to love it! carla-alongers feel free to post to the blog through blogger. if for some reason you haven't received your blogger invite or need another one, please email me!
