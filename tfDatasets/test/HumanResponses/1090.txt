this b*tch(my mother) decided that since i can't remember to turn the water off in the basement(pipes broke in kitchen so to use the w.c. or brush teeth or whatever, we have to shut off the main valve.) that she feels she needs to take my car away. number one you didn't pay for that car my dad did, number two how am i supposed to get to work, cocksucker? number three i need to take my damn drivers test on thursday, so thanks to her i can't practice and i'm going to fail.
