11 40p 05272k3 my heart’s words it’s hard to admit this but it’s true i have grown farther away from you stress and pressure just went out of hand aggravated by your reprimand i miss the days when i’m still young when hugs and kisses were precious gems those moments are already gone and time is hard to fight against i should have understood both situations but i acted tough and hard instead leading to miserably wrong actions i’m sorry’s not gonna undo what was said miles apart our hearts might be but still love bridges you and me coz our souls and blood are of the same unconditional love and care remain i’m making upfor the times wasted it seems we both are, i have noticed a vivid image of us together is in my mind and heart forever…
