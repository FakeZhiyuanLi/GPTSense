take more breaks during play. take more time to calculate outs. lay down hands earlier. be more outwardly aggressive with top pair. mix up method of slowplay more often. change gears more - i tend to stay in one kind of play for one stack size, a lethal mistake in this game. take the same amount of time for everything - while i do take time to think about each move, sometimes i take longer than most. this means i either hold a monster or am drawing. i need to disguise this by either shortening or lengthening my decision time. use implied pot odds more! i tend to only calculate pot odds for the current round of betting and don't think ahead to the river. stop bluffing unraised pots- they're not worth it! i caught myself doing this last night at least twice. i need to get a shock collar or something. actually, that's a good idea.
