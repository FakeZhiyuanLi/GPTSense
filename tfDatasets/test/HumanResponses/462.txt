well, it's saturday, weekend! kids have exams today (don't ask!) - so now i am wondering what to do this weekend - i got these new swim pant/shorts so i want to try them out - i have to go swimming this weekend! ok, maybe plan a trip to the lake on sunday. today seems like a cleaning day. boy, could it get any more exciting?
