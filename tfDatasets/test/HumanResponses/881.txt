i can't believe that in one week i will be in europe. the feeling is unreal because i have kept so busy that to think of a break in the routine seems an anomaly. to not be working for three weeks. what? enjoy life, not think of money-making, such an odd non dallas thing to do. i'm gonna wake up, hit some sites, eat everything in site, go to the beach, learn about ancient greek history, have some drinks and just not give a care in the world to anything really.sounds just bout rite. :)
