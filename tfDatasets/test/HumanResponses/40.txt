i thought this was some kind of new freakish spam that i got in my e mail. luckily i read it and it said something about movies in space, and then i thought for a second and marveled at the technology that spam has gone through, how spam could know personal things about you i.e. affiliations with movies from space. after writing several nasty e mails i came to the conclusion that this may be a special situation where it might not be spam, still on my guard though i tread lightly and found myself here writing yet another e mail. all this e mail writing has made me tired, i'm gonna go to sleep now, thanks for having me on board. joe
