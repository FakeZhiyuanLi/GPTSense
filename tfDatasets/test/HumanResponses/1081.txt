i'm sitting here, doing something really boring, but inevitable. after two years of neglect, i have a whole bunch of cds that needs indexing. the problem is not the lack of great indexing tools, there are a bunch of those, the problem is that it's time consuming. just sitting here, switching cds every 15 seconds for some 400 plus times adds up to a lot of time (about 100 minutes). that's what you get for putting things of. the really sad thing is, it doesn't matter that i swear to index every new cd the moment it's done, i know i won't. maybe i will keep it up for a few weeks, but then i'll be back to my old routine. the cds will stock up, and then i'll be sitting here again in two years with another pile of cds to index.
