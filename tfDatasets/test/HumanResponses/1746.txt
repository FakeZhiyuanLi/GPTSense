tonight i dream of you being here, embrace me in your arms looking at my eyes and telling me how you love me so holding hands, we both looking at the moon tonight and making a vow to be true with each other to be together no matter what your kiss is so gentle and so warm and you touch my heart when you say you want to be with me for the rest of our lives you make me shed my tears when you say will you marry me and be the mother of our childrenâ€¦
