i checked my e-mails for like the first time ever. well the first time in ages, and i had 781 e-mails. im deleting them as we speak. shows how much crap you get in e-mails tho bcos all of them are either for porn sites selling viagra giving away holidays on competitions or the odd chain letter the world would be better without advertiseing e-mails
