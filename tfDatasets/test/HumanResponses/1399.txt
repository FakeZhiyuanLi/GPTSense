so i got the gmail account i've been looking for (props to matt for that) and now that i have invitiations they are going for crap on ebay. oh well. at least i got the ill gmail name. not that i'll post it here but if you need to know it you will. in other news i power washed the deck and the porch. it took me a while but they both look alot better. i forgot to take pictures of the back deck (which was really nasty) but i got some of the front deck. they may show up on the website if i'm really bored.
