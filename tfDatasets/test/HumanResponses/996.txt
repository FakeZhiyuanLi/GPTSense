when i'm at work i am thinking at alot of things doing after i get out from work, in my free time. so, when i have free time i should do those things. i'm not. why? dunno why, i just want to get lazy and not to do anything. curios, huh? sometimes i ask my self why god made us like we are. eating, going to toilet, drinking if we are tursty, sleeping, and so one. it's a strange world and some strange people too.
