what am i passionate about? that is the question that has been plaguing my thoughts for the last several hours. however, this simple fact is that i am unsure where my true passion lies. i keep asking myself the same questions over and over in desperate hope that an answer will come to me from within the folds of my mind. yet when i dig deeper all i find are more questions. am i passionate about my career choice, yes i am. i love computer programming more and more every day. i love to sit down with a problem aid out in front of me and finding a way to solve said problem in a logical and systematic manner. i still feel as though i'm missing something. until i figure out what it is that i am missing however, i will still be me. i'll keep on doing what i do till i find something better. i suppose that's all i can ever really ask for, the chance to continue on, move forward, and become a better person.
