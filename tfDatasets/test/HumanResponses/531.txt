had a bust up with a neighbour on friday morning.the unfortunate woman came to get in her car 2 mins after i realised i could'nt get mine outnot good at 8am when i've got a hangover.we were like a pair of fishwives shouting in the street  oh dear oh dear still she has'nt parked there again over the weekend! so last night i drunkenly decide i will make an effort and text l to see how he is and with an inspired request for his emailwhy i've not thought of this before i don't know.(prob cos they were always spying into each others email at his last workplace!don't think any of my customers recognised my arse out of it's jeans casing tho!)i then promptly turned off my mobile and rightly so cos he must have got straight back with a reply on my voicemailhis hotmail addy doubly recited to make sure i have it correctly!so my favourite form of communication may manage to rekindle somethingonly time will tell
