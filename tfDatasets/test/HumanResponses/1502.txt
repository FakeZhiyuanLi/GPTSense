well life started off interesting. eddy's forgot to put my cadence cable on. they can't find it. hmmmmmm. had the bright idea to use the railroad access road to get into town. it seemed like a good idea. no traffice, level. bad idea, let me repeat real bad idea. they pave those roads with the rocks that they use in the railbeds, (big). whent about two miles before i got to a public road and finished that way. so i'm back to the jungle. there just are not any good ways in and out of akron that do not use major roads. well i got 5.5 miles down and still had to walk part of the way. the new seat and tires are working very well. considering the folowing changes in a bit, change my fork to a solid fork, i don't mtb, and clips. i have to add lighting as well talk to you later,
