i'm getting so desperate. i'm horny, i'm lonely, and i can't find a man. i actually find myself thinking that one of the kids at work is cute. what is wrong with me i am having serious problems. i don't need a man to make my life complete, but it's getting hard to tell myself that and feel good about it. i'm 24 and need to get laid. i'm open to suggestions but since no one reads this, i guess i'm just bitching to myself. damn. someone help me.
