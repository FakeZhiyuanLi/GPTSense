i'm so cold, sitting here, i shiver, alone, my naked soul stinged and numbed by the harsh cold, the wind, cutting through my heart, like a thousand razor blades, i look up through my tear blurred eyes, nothing, nothing, everywhere a nothing, a blanket of gray as far as my bloodshot eyes can see, looking down, as i often do, i see the face of punishment, the face of a man i hardly know, yet a man who's caused me more pain then anyman ever could. i grow hot with anger, my fist clenched tightly, knuckles white, tears flowing from my eyes, why, i do not know, with all my anger i strike at my hatred, stomping and kicking, shattering the face, breaking the mirror, sending me spiraling downward, into a black pool of depression, for i have been imprisioned by my enemy, trapped by myself, broken by my own body, hated by my own mind, damned by my insecurities.
