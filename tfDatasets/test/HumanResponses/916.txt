today was an ok day.even with the horseshow and the snack tent i didnt snack! august 11, 2004 -toasted everything bagel w/ butter -turkey and swiss wrap w/ honey mustard -soup in the cup w/ a everything bagel w/ butter goal! my goal for tomorrow is try to narrow down the amount of food againand keep the amount of excercise up! today i rode my bike a mile and a half to the hunt club and then rode it around the hunt club all day which is a good source of excerise.but for tomorrow i am really going to try to keep it to 2 meals no snacking unless it is skittles.because those are just toooooooo good to pass up and i need to get some source of exercise.so maybe i will ride my bike to the hunt club or something
