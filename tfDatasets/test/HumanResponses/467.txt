once again, we are under a severe thunderstorm watch, and i think it's cool, as usual. may was a real tough month where storms and tornadoes were concerned, but i do love storms. by the way, i am going to post the time at the end of each post here cuz the one already posted at the end is wrong. 5:29 p.m.
