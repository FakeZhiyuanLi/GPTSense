i've been driving my old truck for a while. for free basically. its paid off and i am not paying for collision on my insurance. it runs fine, but, the battery is going low each morning. so, i am in the process of driving it every four hours to keep the battery going. i will take it down to 'belle tire' tomorrow. these things are troublesome, especially when i will need reliable transportation to my new job. cross my fingers i'm able to hold it together for the next two years. i suppose i need to relax, express how i'm doing, get out more, and get a girldfriend.
