it's time to discuss something architectural. due to the recent boom and an explosion in the demand for housing, developers are building homes at a staggering rate, comparable only to the years right after wwii where displaced soldiers need immediate housing accommodation. with the way houses are built and designed, the very core of regional architecture is being obliterated by cookie-cutter style track housing. you can find the same type of housing in southern california as you can find in connecticut. think about this, what if the architecture in rome looks the same as in france, or in japan and thailand? the very essence that separates us apart from the animals, "individuality" and "creativity" are destroyed at the expense of quick return on your dollar. we, as home buyers, perpetuate the thinkings of the big developers that "if you build them, they will come," mentality. good for business, not good for our culture.
