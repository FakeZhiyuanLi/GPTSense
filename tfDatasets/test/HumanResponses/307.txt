last night was pretty chillin. i went to ryans for a bit then he went to the pub with his brother and shiet and i went to sarahs and we got so fuckin high! lol i actually bought weed for the first time this summer! haha. yea i was so high we mixed 3 different types of weed in this big joint and yea the rest is history. then ryan came over and we couldn't even think of smoking more weed we were so high. so i'll get him baked today. i wish i could've gotten him a present but oh well i will when i get money. but i have to meet his parents next week! ah! i'm so scared lol i hate having to meet peoples parents. but his sound chillin like they get drunk and stuff. i also have to meet his other brother but that will be alright cuz he's apparently a big stoner. but anyways gotta go get high!
