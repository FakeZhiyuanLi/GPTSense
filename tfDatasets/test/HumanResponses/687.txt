.it comes up with the craziest news stories, here's another of my favourites, especially as i have been to germany and can understand where the lorry driver is coming from. berlin (reuters) - a german truck driver has beaten up a motorist he believed was driving too slowly in a case of "road rage" in a country famous for having no limits on stretches of its motorways. the trucker got in a fight with a car driver who had been slowing him down by observing a 30 km-an-hour (18 mph) speed limit in a built-up area. police in the western town of bochum said the truck driver told them he felt provoked by the motorist "because he was actually driving 30 kph in a 30 kph area". the trucker faces an investigation and may lose his driving licence.
