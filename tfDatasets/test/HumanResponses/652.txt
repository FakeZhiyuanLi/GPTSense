well i just finished my econ homework, gee i forgot what it was like to finish homework and how good it feels! well today went pretty well i think, i saw senora silva which was way awesome because i love her! and i made acapella so now i can sing my little heart out everyday and now i have my foot in the door for the europe trip! i need to figure out when spanish club starts because i am totally going to do it this year! today i got to see tommy and update him on everything going on, hes so goofy him and steve both. honestly i love the people i work with except for the dumb ones! but i feel bad because even though jim (one of the checkers) smells bad he is really nice. but larry is just down right annoying! i love checking though so much better then courtesy, and i can't belive that guy totally flirted with tiffany. okay to much work talk now, i am starting to sound like an even bigger loser then i am.
