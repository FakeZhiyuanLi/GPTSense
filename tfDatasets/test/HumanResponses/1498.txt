tomorrow is juhannus, a finnish midsummer festival, and i'm going to celebrate it at my friends summer cottage with ten other people. i just wish i don't drink too much alcohol and wake up lying on a ground and bitten by mosquitos.:p oh well. and how on earth am i supposed to get myself out of bed at nine o'clock tomorrow? we are leaving at ten, and since it's my summer vacation i'm used to sleeping till 2 pm. i have to set at least three alarms. *sigh* well, this wasn't very rational, but i guess writing here in english encourages me to use this language more. and at least writing helps me to clear my thoughts a bit. so it doesn't really matter if anyone reads these or not. :p
