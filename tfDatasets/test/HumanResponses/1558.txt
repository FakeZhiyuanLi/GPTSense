that is one awesome song. everyone, go buy vendetta's reds cd. yes, it came out last year. but its great. and for once, i'm not pushing something for myself. i don't get points if you go to their site, or money or a special autograph if you buy their cd. they are simply a really amazing music group. this is my last pre-vacation entry, so it better be good, eh? i don't want you to think of me as a loser for the next month. first off, it's important to wish everyone a happy birthday who i will be missing while gone: kryzilla, sam, josie, lexi, courtney, and everyone else. i love you, i miss you, and i'll make y'all banners when i get back! secondly, i got invited to the beach by a hot guy! haha, i was at work, eating a strawberry starburst. he asked me if i wanted to go to the beach, what time was i getting off work? too bad i wasn't getting off until four. lame post, but whatever. i'll see you all when i get back. email me, darlings!
