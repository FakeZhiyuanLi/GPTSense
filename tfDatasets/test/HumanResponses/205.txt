hehe. well today was the first day of band camp and well i was squad leader of my squad of bass clarinets. but our director wanted some more people to play cymbals because k was the only one. with much coaxing from my friends, i volunteered. i knew it would make his gf pissed. it did hehe. (but what is so sad is that we now have me, k and 2 other juniors playing cymbal. its usually a freshy job, being cymbal bitches. o well) its actually a lot of fun, once your arms get used to the pain well thats all for now hehe
