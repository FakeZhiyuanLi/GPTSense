today i experimented with the liveim thingy on my phone. it seems pretty cool. i think i wanna get a text messaging plan, which i've already been told i have to pay for. not like this is a problem, since i'm applying at pizza hut once i get my license. speaking of that, it's two days from now (less than, actually)! oh, and i wished good ol' **censored name** a happy 16th today. i hope she gets online later tonight. i haven't like really talked to her since the six flags trip, which has been a while. no one's online right now, though. so sad. signing off, m.
