i proudly declared my love last night. that's right, i love one of my teachers and have for almost a year. i do fear that i waited too long, for now he appears "taken". but i feel so much better now, i decided that it is really not the anwswer from him that was important. it was the telling by me. things have a way of working out, for the best. so if it was truly meant to be.well then it will happen, if not. best wishes to him and his happiness.
