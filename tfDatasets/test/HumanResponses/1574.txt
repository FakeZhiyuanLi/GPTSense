yes, it is undoubtedly. i am starting a god-forsaken blog! reason: i need a magic "place". i.e.: " i need a place to bring all my alc newbie friends together" " i need a place to put up info about the sale at helen's this weekend" " i need a place to get a group of friends together about hairspray" this is going to be that kind of place. amazing!
