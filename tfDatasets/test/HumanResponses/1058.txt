i've been looking everywhere for a t-shirt that says, "register to vote at your library". so far i've come up with nothing. as the big election draws nearer i think that i may have to just design it myself. i want to create a little sign for my car window too. we don't exactly publish this information on our website or in our calendar of events- at least i haven't seen it yet. people approach the information desk daily with the timid question. secretly i wish i could wrap the library with a giant flashy banner so everyone would know. because not so long ago i was one of them. no one ever told me that i could register at the library.
