still haven't gotten very far in the planning and execution of the "get my life in order" desire. i just can't seem to take that next step that will get me where i want to be. i still weigh the same. my finances are just as bad. and getting worse. i feel drawn to write and to voice over work, but can't bring myself to act on that conviction. i know what i need to do to make my life work, but am stuck at the same old place. i want to be the person god created me to be more than anything else. what do i have to lose right? i don't like where i am, but it's familar, but i'll never realize my potential if i don't. help
