"i will always see you marching in the ghost parade" - - remember the ocean - _tomorrow after dark_ it's apt, really, kristin. i don't know if it's at all what you meant, but i can feel the trailing fingertips of all the people walking by so long after i said goodbye. not ghosts, per se. although the dead share this path too, and mix between the long-lost without regard or distinction; makes me fear, somehow, for loved ones who've not yet left the land, only my life. behind closed eyes they creep, slow paced and steady with the inexhaustible strength of my regret. in the quiet moments when i'm trying not to be blinded by the sun, they pass before me with reproach in their eyes. they stand apart from each other, most of them, to leave room for me, right there beside. every one of them reminds me, silently and angrily, that i left them there. nights hold no rest.
