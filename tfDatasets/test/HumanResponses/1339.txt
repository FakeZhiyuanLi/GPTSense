i went for a drive with robyn, the pilot whos working for the dropzone for $50/week to get his hours, to dorrigo national park air walk. the air walk itself is about 30 metres long, but theres a walk that took us a few hours through the rainforrest. its very much a family/touristy track - the walkway is bitumen the whole way. it was nice though, and the coffee at the coffee house there was good. i took some pictures (of course) theres a link to the right. i also managed in my cleaverness to delete my documents directory. doh.
