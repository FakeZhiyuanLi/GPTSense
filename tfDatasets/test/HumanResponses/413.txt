the boys are back in town. well i am back from a very "educational" (hehe to people who know what that means) and fun trip from boston. boston is an extremely beautiful place and i recommend that all people should go there before they die. but unfortunately i am not in the mood for blogging and if you interested in talking about it give me a jingle. you know the digits and if not just ask!
