i will be returning to school this upcoming monday, i'm going to be a sophomore in highschool, i can't say i'm going to enjoy it although i am going to be taking some fun courses, since i got health, and speech out of the way my previous year. unfortunatelly school won't leave me a lot of time to update, but i promise i won't abandon this site, on worries.
