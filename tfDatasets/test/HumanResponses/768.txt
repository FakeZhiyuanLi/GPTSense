so i have actually accepted my fate at being the biggest loser ever. i can now close my eyes and put my final fantasy soundtracks ( read: all the released soundtracks. about 20 including piano collections. ) on shuffle and hear the first 10 seconds and go, "town theme! final fantasy 6! nobuo uematsu!" don't hate me because the japanese make the good video game music. announcer: and now, homicide: life on sesame street. bert: (answering phone) hello? son of a bitch. i'm on my way. (gets out of bed and gets dressed) bert: some poor bastard got his head blown off down at a place called hooper's. ernie: bert, i wish you wouldn't drink so much, bert. bert: well, ernie, i wish you wouldn't eat cookies in the damn bed . ernie: bert, you're shouting again, bert. music currently playing: my heart bleeds the darkest blood by shai hulud wow. good song from a good band. talk about emo. too bad they're breaking/broken up.
