so here i go again, signing up for yet another "let's meet people on the internet" website, when in all reality, i really don't want to meet people on the internet. the reason why i sign up for this shit is because i constantly need something to create the illusion of business at work, and unfortunately, the internet's all i've got. i figure, by the time i'm 30, i'll have more internet acquaintances that i will have friends and acquaintances in real life. i am the biggest walking contradiction that exists. i hate society, but am insanely social. oh well, fuck it.
