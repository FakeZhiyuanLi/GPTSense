well, that last post was about a month ago and a bit premature on the excitement, i suppose. i have since seen billy wayne, gone to murfreesboro to see him twice and the second time, he completely ignored me. it was a horrible trip during which i spent one night with him and then went to get ready at my friend's house. after that, i couldn't get a hold of him all day. i was supposed to spend the night with him again that night, but i guess that's too much to ask of someone when you drive an hour and a half to see them. maybe. whatever, i'll just go back to my normal lonely, keep-to-myself person and maybe get into another band or something to occupy my time. don't feel sorry for me, i know better than to date these guys. this is my fault, these are my mistakes, this is my life.
