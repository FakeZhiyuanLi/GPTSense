i'm really over everythingeverything being everything.it's that mid-time of the month where all the hormones in my body get together and decide to have a round-table about all i am doing wrong and how they want out. they've had it! .work was a little frustrating, i keep thinking i need to be somewhere else, doing something a little more pro-active, being more kinetic. how many more days until i am hopping ferries to little greek islands? well, first i have to get through london and paris
