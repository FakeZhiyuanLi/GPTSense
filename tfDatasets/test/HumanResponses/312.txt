blogging from work: bit naughty. but everyone else has gone home and i have to stay until half five to make up my month's hours, so here i am. had a long, dull, irrelevant meeting this afternoon made interesting only by the chairs' use of dodgy quasi-poststructuralist arguments against points they couldn't answer. "ah, but what you're forgetting is, this is a process , see, not a structure . it's non-linear. " right. anyhoo, that's it for now. back to bemli.
