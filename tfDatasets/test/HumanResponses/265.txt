for g i was a caged lovebird in mahogany gothic gazebo with pointed arches and elaborately detailed carving. i used to have a mate we were immured rainbows green blue bodies yellow gray markings on head and tails, red beaks. he didn’t chirp much just sat staunchly close to me head touching mine sometimes he’d stared beyond me far, far away. silently he took flight one night lit out to travel the world i was asleep came morning he was gone. i’d still tilted my head to one side hoping to touch his hoping he’d come back to unlatch the door for me to tell me why. i never saw him again. for three years another lovebird would perch occasionally outside my cage. he too went away. one afternoon on the fifth year i escaped. strong wind blew the door open. it turned out it hadn’t been latched. i never knew it back then. copyright 1997 by serenity
