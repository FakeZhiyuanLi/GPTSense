i watched the clocks in a foreign room. there were two: one on the vcr and the other sitting on the dresser. in pitch black, i felt the numbers were taunting me. one was a minute off of the other. the other would turn and what seemed like hours later, the other caught up, only to turn again seconds later. i waited for so long, for just one minute to pass. it's incredibly odd that minutes can feel like hours. certain moments in time, one wishes could last forever. upon this realization, certain moments in time only still exist by being replayed within my mind. why is it that time can also erase these moments? i don't have to forget, if i keep rewinding. but life forces us to fast forward.
