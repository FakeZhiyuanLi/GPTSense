there are times when you are down and those who lend you a helping hand, are worthy of. and those who did not, the real colours of your so-called friends will be revealed nowadays there is no such thing as brotherhood or sisterhood. they are totally bullshit and to blind the youngsters with the mentality "we are brothers si bo? mai zhou bo shui leh." it is ridiculous because words will fade and action is for action for now. friends are those who will help you even though its to their disadvantages. they will help you even regardless you have helped them umpteen times or not even once with no intention of getting the favour back. yet friends are those who have taken the favour, keep it by heart dearly. recognise when the person is down, he or she will piggyback him. be attentive when the person is pouring his heart over and over again (even though you are sick of his issue) do such friendship exist? maybe it still does. i hope.
