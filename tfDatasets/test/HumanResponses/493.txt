so maitlyn and i are going to swim ranch tomorrow for swim lessons (day 3). she took lessons last year as well, but she is still rather tentative about any water that is over her head. so that means that during swimming lessons, i put on my biggest smile and try to be as persuasive as an attorney. usually the first 5-10 minutes are spent with me trying to pry her arms from around my neck - she is supposed to face away from me for most of the exercises in the water. nonetheless, i think she is making progress and is growing in her comfort with water. that is the goal. she might not officially swim this summer, but i have to think of it as one more step towards that day when she does.
