a 6 or 7 year old girl from gilmore was kidnapped on sunday. yesterday they arrested and charged her babysitter with kidnapping. they sitll have not found the little girl, but they did find her bike and her shoes. gilmore is about 6 miles from tyronza, where i used to live. i feel so bad for the family. i hope and pray that they find her alive. i can't imagine anything worse than losing a child.
