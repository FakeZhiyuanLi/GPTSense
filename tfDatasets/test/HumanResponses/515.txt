mmmm i'm writative today. must be boredom. in a little over a month i'm starting an exchange semester at the university of idaho. besides all the stress, the hunting down papers and signatures, i'm getting pretty excited. for me it's a chance to finally go somewhere without parental guidance. i know, 22, err umm almost 23 and still living at home. makes me wish my university weren't so damned near my home. some days it's just stiffling to live under a roof with parents and siblings. except for my little room, i have no space to breath. i can't be alone for a moment. there's always someone barging in. mother sometimes says i would be lonely living alone in an appartment. but what she forgot are the friends i have living in the same city. and that i'm a loner. i like my peace and quiet. well i'll have to wait another few years for that. gonna be sharing a room with someone in the residence hall. *shrugs* i'll survive it
