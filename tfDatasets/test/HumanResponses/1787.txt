i've made many mistakes in my life. most you learn from and forget but purposely setting yourself up for blackmail just because you find smearing lipstick all over your face, except for your lips, hilarious. i love acting crazy and putting on things and going all out and being someone else. yet in the mess of all that fun, you must be careful. a simple pose, such as my courtney love (messed up lipstick, cheap dress with a guitar in the air, and a leg up showing the bruises you painted on) can turn from fun to the hidden camera's film posted all over the office. ah, so tell me, what happened to the sanctity of goofing around with out the fear of those "linda tripp's" out there. hehe. like the alliteration? that's the shared thought of the night.
