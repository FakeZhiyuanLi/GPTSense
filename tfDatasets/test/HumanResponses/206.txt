i was ready a time magazine the other day and came across some polictical polls. the numbers where extremely close, 48% kerry, 49% bush, and 3% unsure if the election was held that day. with nader it was something like 6% nader, 43% kerry, 48% bush, and still 3% undecided. so more people would vote for bush. that's not a bad thing but another poll underneith asked people whether they thought bush wasn't doing a good job as president. more people said yes, they thought he wasn't doing a good job. suprising since more people said they would vote for bush. so they think bush isn't doing a good job as president, yet they would still vote for him. wierd.
