i came home for lunch today. my roommate came home shortly thereafter. he had just come from the humane society. he had cats picked out. we drove to the humane society. we picked out two cats and decided to play with them to see how they liked us. shortly thereafter, we found out the cat my roommate wanted had already been adopted. i win! his name is gilmour. he is black with a white underbody, paws, and bottom half of his face. he was a bit skittish when i first brought him in the house, but after about an hour, he calmed right down. he just took a break from playing in my lap to go take a nap on the chair. hopefully he stays just as calm as he is now.
