well, yet another rainy day down here.nothing to do but be bored all friken day.but that's alright. gave away about 6 gmail invites the other day. sorry, i'm all out. i'd like to ask you something. if you're reading this, could you comment on it telling me why you're here? why are you reading my useless posts? it's a waste of time, is it not? ah, i don't know, maybe you're like me and you're bored outta yo' mind. i'm not entirely sure. well i'm off to best buy, seems they've got a hdd there with my name on it. see ya.
