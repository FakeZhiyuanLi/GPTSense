everything seems to be getting worse. not only did i get a call last night from the lady who handles one of my credit card accounts, i got a call this morning from my mortgage company. i don't have the money for this month's payment and the payment i arranged last month to cover the july payment didn't clear. i have a number for a lawyer to help with getting everything put in my name. i need to talk to my boss. they've let me know that they might - maybe- willing to help me out with everything. why do i let this happen? i know what's coming, so why do i let it happen? i hate this. i'm intelligent, mature, responsible. why do i do this?
