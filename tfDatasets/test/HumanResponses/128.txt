sometimes, don't you think, it's reali tired to be the one taking initiative all the time. i think i'm getting tired. but i stil love them. i stil love my friends. so what if i'm tired? i know i'll stop making the first move to call n gather them only when i dun care anymore. sigh. back to square one. i care. xmas is coming. i wan to meet a lot more friends, but, i hope i had more substance in my bank account man. there's a lot more places i want to go nex yr, i think i better do something abt it . rating for the day: 4 stars of 10. as moody as the weather.
