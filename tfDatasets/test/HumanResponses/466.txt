well, here i am, once again, up at a very early hour cuz lindsay woke up and decided she was gonna be up for a while. she was up at 4-something, so i changed her (she proceeded to pee all over the place, so i had to change her clothes and changing table cover), gave her a 4-oz. bottle and put her back to sleep. she almost always goes back to sleep, but not this morning! luckily, i am pretty sure she has finally fallen asleep, cuz i don't hear her anymore, so i am gonna try and catch myself some zzzzz's. 5:25 a.m. thursday here i am again, at 9:07 a.m., same day. i am trying hard to baby proof this apt. cuz lindsay is everywhere now that she is finally crawling. she is also 10 months old today! where did the time go? anyways, she is in her crib right now complaining cuz she does not wanna nap, but she is tired, and i sure as heck don't wanna risk her getting overtired once again by keeping her up just cuz she doesn't wanna go to sleep. wish me luck.
