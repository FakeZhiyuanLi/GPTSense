well i had my unaccompanied baggage shipped off to korea last friday, so now i must make do with what i have left. (for those of you who don't know what that is, an unaccompanied baggage shipment is a personal property shipment sent to your gaining base before you leave, in the hopes(hopes?) that it will be there waiting for you when you arrive.) i was in the middle of two different ps2 games, front mission 4 and driv3r, both of which were very entertaining. i had intended on keeping my ps2 with me and carrying it to korea in my suitcase, along with fm4 and driv3r. it was a sound plan, but i forgot to keep the games seperate from the shipment, so they are now on the way to my next base. so i had to buy some other games to keep me from boredom. i bought drakengard, and i bought everything or nothing. both of them are pretty fun. i just wish that the bond game was in first person, like goldeneye on n64 was. oh well
