to start off with, last night was awful! a bunch of us started off meeting at morgan’s house and from there we were going to go to the airport to see amy when her flight came in. but amy and her brother missed their flight sending all our prior plans into a mass chaotic mess. to make a long story short a few people left and we knew where they were going and just didn’t want to go and then some other people played a little game called "let’s ditch rebecca and morgan and see how upset they get." well we were upset, very upset. so we watched "tuck everlasting."
