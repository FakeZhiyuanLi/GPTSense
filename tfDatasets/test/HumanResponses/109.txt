and here we go. now that i have established my personal history, i can begin to post my feelings and opinions on stuff. i should start with a little disclaimer: i think reviews of other peoples creations, be it art, movies, music, video games, are usually bullshit. people go and see a movie, and they say it sucks. but what do people know? personally i like most movies. if i don't like it, it doesn't mean it sucks or is a bad movie, it just didn't entertain me. i like ebert and roper, because the simply reccommend movies, not neccessarily on the basis of a movies atistic value, but on it's entertainment capabilty. alright, i guess that's enough for now.
