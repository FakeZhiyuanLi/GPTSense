dear blog, this is my 1st blog entry, and i must say, i am excited. let me tell you a little about myself. my name is amy, i am 23 and i am happily married to tim, who is 34. together we have a 10-month-old daughter named lindsay, and she is the absolute joy of our lives. she arrived 5 weeks early via c-section due to the fact that i had extremely high blood pressure. she weighed 5 lbs. 1 oz. and was 19" long, but perfectly healthy; didn't even have to go to the nicu like planned, which made us very happy. i am a sahm and tim is a paramedic. he is currently working in kankakee. we reside in naperville, il. right now lindsay is being rather crabby, so i am going to end this entry now. bye! june 23, 2004 8:39 a.m.
