well i can tell that it's summer now. i've already slept into 12:00 pm one day, i've stayed up till 2:00 am and i'm waiting to pull an allnighter. it's starting to get really hot outside, man am i happy that we have a pool. not that i use it that much. but if i ever need to i know that it is there. o yeah, i saw shrek 2 it was awsome. there are still some movies that i wanna see. well i'll post some more stuff later.
