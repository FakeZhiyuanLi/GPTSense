oh my god! she looked so amazing today in her skirt and white tank top. she was drop dead gorgeous. oh man she looked great. when i first saw her i was stunned. my heart skipped a few beats. just standing their smiling, glistening in the light. i felt like my mouth was wide open from all the amzement. hehe, here's a poem from the soul. .i lie on the ground, and stare into space, the stars start to move, into the shape of your face. i see you there now, looking down at me, with that cute little smile, that i like to see. you say "close your eyes" "tell me what you see" i see only two people, just you and me. we're walking the shoreline, with our feet getting wet, the horizon turns pink, as the sun starts to set. we make love through the night, on that white sandy shore, then i hold you while thinking, i could want nothing more. oh i wish i could be in that one special place, as i lie on the ground, and i stare into space.
