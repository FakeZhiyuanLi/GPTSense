holy crap i'm bored. i've done nothing but sit around all damn day, and now i'm f*cking bored. i guess it could be worse i could of had to work today. at least it gave me time to re-listen to all my paul van dyk albums though btw, i'm still bored. anyway, today i decided to mess with the game called cube, and mess with the hud to make my weopons look different and such, and it came out pretty cool. but yeah, peace out.
