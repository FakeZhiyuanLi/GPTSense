here it is the beginning of the third week of my shortened summer semester at city college of san francisco. i am taking physiology as the first of 2 prerequisites i need to apply for a masters of nursing program. if anyone reading this blog does not find this interesting i don't blame you. but for me, out of school for over 10 years its a huge shock to my system. i'll reflect more on this tomorrow and start working in some politics!
