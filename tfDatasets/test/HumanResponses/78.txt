i started typing this blog to get some things off my chest! it is unusually tough moving from one place to another and trying to do all these things at once. i have been just shuting down most of the time;taking the easy way out. i was expecting to have some comments! but how? the thousands of blogs are bombarding with people from around the world! that's not a bad thing, but there needs to be an easier way to read what you want to read and comment on them! can't we get a voting system of what is being read or what is of interest? i doubt any one will read this so i guess this is just going to have to be a therapeutic forum!
