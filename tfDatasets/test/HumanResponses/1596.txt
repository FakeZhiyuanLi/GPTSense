i see myself in a house and i am surrounded by friends. the house has a brown tile floor with plush area rugs. i am walking toward the sliding glass door to go outside. there is a small pool and a large grass area. perfect for playing. there are trees and a small garden in the yard. it is never too hot or too cold and the rain never lasts too long nor gets us too wet. my friends are the pets that i have known over the years. omar, twinkle, bear, buddy, princess, samantha, jasper, muffy, sampson, tinkerbell, bruiser, romeo, honey bear, chase, critter, mattie, augie, barney, wit and charm. we are walking out to the backyard so that we can play. bear gives me a kiss and i thank him. this is a happy visual that i can use to combat depression.
