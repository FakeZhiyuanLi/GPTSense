7 30p 11022k3 second flight for so long, i’ve fooled myself i’ve become so blind, numb and deaf. can’t see reality the way it is coz i’m longing to feel what i think i miss i’m over you at least i think flipped my wings to another twig but hanging on to this sight leads once more to my plight. why should it be this way? how come i can’t figure this one out? just tired of dreaming you would stay fooling myself i won this bout. but at least i felt it, though painful it’s sweet… my second flight remains to be yet another unsolved mystery… or would it really be?
