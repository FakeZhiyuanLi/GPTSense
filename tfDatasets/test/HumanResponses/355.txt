i have become hooked on to the o'reilly factor on fox news channel for some time now the man is incredibly charismatic, despite being hopelessly republican and sometimes showing shades of exteme right-wing bias. almost 99% of his past shows have him out-smart his guests and speakers with witty and sensational dialog, and i am yet to see one of his guests verbally bludgeon him into submission. i do not agree with many of his views though, but watch the show for the sheer entertainment aspect of it. the show airs on fnc weekdays @ 8 pm and 11 pm est.
