so, avram has resurfaced. i do not know if this is due to the inspiration that this fansite has brought him or because he was just ready to blog again. but i do know one thing and that is that we love his blogs. now, don't worry i am not going to just retire this blog the same day that i started it. that is not going to happen. we are going to continue to bring the life of avram to all the little people. now that we have established all that i would like to put out a big reminder that june 14 (flag day) is avram's birthday. that is on monday, so we better start partying this weekend. do we get off for flag day?
