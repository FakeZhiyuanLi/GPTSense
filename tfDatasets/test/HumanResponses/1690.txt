it seems like yesterday was full of gray. i used to wonder why i'm ever here, whats the purpose to life, when your life has no meaning. all i ever felt was loniness and fear. til' the day you came along, my heart was empty, like a day without the sun. now i'm filled with you. everything good in me, is you. you are my heart, full of life. you are my soul, peaceful and warm. i no longer wonder why i'm here, the answers there., in your smile.
