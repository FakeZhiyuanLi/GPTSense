i just heard about the decision of the craziest governor in the world - ahmed sani of zamfara state, nigeria to demolish all churches. indeed this man is an anti-christ. he must be dealt with as one. i am amazed at the fact that this man has been allowed to continue in office and continue to perpetuate these undemocratic, demonic and unconstitutional acts. the press are not pounding on this man and the president and all the law makers have allowed him to continue. this is a shame to democracy and the nigerian press. it is a big shame to all those who claim to promote democracy in nigeria. how can this be allowed to continue. god help us.
