this is like my thing. i do this every summer. start a webpage (or something) and then drop it like it's hot drop drop it like it's hot. okay, i've only done it two other times. actually, i also had an e-journal for about five minutes last year. it blew. here's to hoping that this doesn'tand that maybe it will live to see its three month anniversary.
