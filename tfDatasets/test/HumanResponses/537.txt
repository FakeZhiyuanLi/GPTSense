okthis is gonna be brief. there are all kinds of folks that want to get online. aah ok lets just share what is going on right now. we are circling the flying j truckstop parking lot for the millionth time because christy is huddled soaped up in the shower cause the gray water tank is full so the water wont run. first we thought we ran out of water so drove and filled it up, but that was only part of the problem. so she has been huddled and soapy for damn long time. meanwhile robin has the fridge open with the unprotected eggs ready to fly out and join the beer, maple syrup and dish soap that have all spilled all over the floor. alright.i should be online tomorrow to check in. perhaps i will try the audio post too. have fun all of you normal living people.
