well i ended up not going to see the village, cause it was sold out (stupid theatre). so we went to see i robot. in the ads i robot appeared to barely rise above the 'so bad it's funny' mark. the movie however was a little better then that. it was full of holes, lose ends, and some rather random senses that didn't quite fit, but it was still fairly enjoyable. i'd give it a b-. now on to bigger and better things. wait. i've got nothing else to say. bye -driel
