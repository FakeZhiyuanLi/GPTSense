desire vast and restless constant chaos of wants and needs a sinuous flame licking at the imagination here, there i've always imagined being with you yet the imagination is limited by inhibition,by time and i write to say that i love the feel of your skin i love your smell i would snuggled up to the curve of your neck and smell you i smell you in my sleep and smile. you dont make me smile anymore
