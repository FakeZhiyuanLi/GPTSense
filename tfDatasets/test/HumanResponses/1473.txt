well i would have to agree with mandy on the topic of michael moore's new movie. i think that he is not only saying what everyone else does not want to say but he is also generously funny at the same time. he makes a point in his movie that when president bush got news about the first airplane to hit the first tower, that he stayed in the school for about 30-45 minutes before he left. the president said that he stayed there for so long because he did not want to make the kids feel worried.well guess what they should be! there was a high risk of a terrorist attack at the university of maryland the other day when i went to school and i didnt even know it until the next day when it was announced. makes me feel really safe to go to my own school. well a little bit of an upside, my dad left the hospital yesterday and to my knowledge i dont think that he has had a drink yet. well getting to long so i will talk later. see ya.
