we had a summer league game last night. it was a lot of fun actually playing in a real league again. it had been four years since i had played in a game with officials and i'm sure i don't have to write it, but you could tell from the way i played. we lost 64-56 or something close to that, it was hard to tell at the end of the game. although the loss is bad news, the good news is that we have another game on thursday. a chance to make up for our suckiness. hopefully that will go much better.
