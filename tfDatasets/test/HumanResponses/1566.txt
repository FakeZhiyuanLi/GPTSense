eyes the shade of a deep lagoon stare longingly into the sun a heart that once echoed with sweet love songs a soul with thousands of dreams both lay in a heap broken and torn and my eye weeps a crystal tear life like a dark ominous force strikes crippling blows at the heart once standing tall and proud now hunched over like an old brooding woman the weight of the world on her back such a bleak outlook on life, on my future and my eye weeps a crystal tear gaining momentum as they stream down my face collecting as a pool in my hands as i gaze into this watery puddle i can see deep into my eyes the very window to my soul i can see the strength like a grand oak in a storm these crystal tears like a savior rescuing me from the depths of despair as i see the strong hope that my heart carries i know i can make it the healing process has begun with a single crystal tear written by lylia garrett september 1999
