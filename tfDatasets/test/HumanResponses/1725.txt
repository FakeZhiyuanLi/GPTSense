i had a sleepover yesterday! lacey came and it was simple, yet entertaining. i taught her some stuff on psp and she made a shitload of lecavalier icons, lol. lacey lacey lacey. lacey and her lecavalier. i just think it sucks that vincent lecavalier plays for tampa bay. godddd. he's canadian, play for a canadian team damnit! frvgforjfwe it's not fair. the only reason is because the usa offers a lot more money. >:[ i got a betta fish and i named him andy. supposedly my friends did call on my birthday, by the way. my brother just never told me. t______________t he's such an idiot! if he had just told me it could've saved some trouble jesus christ he's annoying. meh.
