why do we fall for the wrong person? wrong person as in: one who treats you like shit, attached, married (gasp!), your sister/brother (hahahaha! just kidding ok?). is it because of the thrill of forbidden love? wanting for something that you can't have? or simply, that person is charming? like i've said to a good friend of mine, and i quote myself "maybe it's the wrong time. maybe it's the wrong life. or, maybe it's just not meant to be." what would you do if you have fallen ? would you've stayed by his/her side? wait for them? there are worst things than falling for the wrong person. like, someone whom you meant the world to asks you to go eat shit and die .
