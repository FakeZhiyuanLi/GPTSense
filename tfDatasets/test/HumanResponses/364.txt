blimey, hot over the weekend, wunnit? close. moist. too hot to sleep. ended up glued to the mattress by my own nocturnal emissions (i was sweating, alright?) what we needed was a nice drop of rain. and now we've got it. bleedin orrible. now my jeans are damp after the walk into work, and it's cold, dark and miserable and i miss the sun. no, i am not easily pleased.
