never say goodbye when you don't mean it never say i miss you when you never call the person never say you're the bestest thing ever happenend to me,when you never show it to the person never say what's wrong,when you can't listen to the person's troubles. instead say,what can i do to help you to fix the wrongs never say goodbye when you don't mean it never say i love you when you're not ready to see your loved one loves someone else. **better see the one you love be happy with someone he loves,than being unhappy with you**
