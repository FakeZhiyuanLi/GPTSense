ok, now that i am here, the question becomes why am i here? i keep hearing that blogging is this big thing, but frankly, i never really got it, but that won't necessarily stop me from giving it a whirl. a lot of the blogs that i have seen are wastes of perfectly good hard drive space, as this one will probably wind up being. but unlike before, i now have an urge to ramble on about something, and now i get to subject you to my publishing whims. i'll be posting about diabetes and my fundraising efforts. i'll occaisionally post about my adventures in technology and the importance of the death penalty for spammers and virus writers. heck, since it's my blog, i guess i can post just about anything i see fit, can't i? well, i guess this is as good as an introduction as any. i'm off to enjoy my three day holiday weekend (it's memorial day weekend in the states), so ttfn.
