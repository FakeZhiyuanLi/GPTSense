i just watched truely win the monaco f1 and then left where i was watching it, jumped into a vehicle with 300 hp and this is not a good combination. smoking tires and sliding corners i decided that running around town at 60+ might attract attention and i pulled it in a bit. of course being borg i knew the speed i was going and where i was due to my always there gps unit. borg never get lost, we use electronic bread crumbs. llap
