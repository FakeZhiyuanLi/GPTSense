i kept personal diaries for a short while about 8 years ago. but someone barged their way into it and soon my personal thoughts were public knowledge - and that was the end that exercise but of course, here i know from the very outset - this is public, this is the internet. only this time i wanna tell people what i am up to. also, from a personal standpoint i'd be cool to maintain a log of my daily denominators. lets see how far this one goes.
