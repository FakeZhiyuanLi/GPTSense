welcome to our class blog's. as you can see i've decided to use the internet as a way of having my students document and keep track of things we cover in class. having this record online allows easy access to all students and to you - so that you can see what we're doing in class. this particular blog can be used as an additional way for you to communicate with me. please feel free to post questions or comments to this blog that way the student blogs can be restricted to class content. i look forward to working with you and your child this year. -mrs. greer
