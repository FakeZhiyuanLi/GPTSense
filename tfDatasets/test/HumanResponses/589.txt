mr white, you made my day with your little 'stuff-up'! hetzner must be reckoning that we really like to play our cards open. ;-) maybe they're thinking that we hope they'll offer us a better rate if they know we're gonna get it free somewhere else. i also think that exploring the free hosting is a good option to explore. if it doesn't fulfill our requirements we can easily change our hosting. our urls will remain the same if it ever comes to that. i just want to make it clear that i don't want to be mr pink. i want to be mr burntumber or mr olivegreen. okay, lets just make it mr green. mr green.
