the road to making a demo cd is gruelsome. does anything ever happen when you want it to? no. does anything ever come easily? no. when it is convenient for you to make this cd of which you speak do you have your voice? no. of course it is a lesson in the world where murphy's law is always triumphant. if it can happen, it will. this is yet another lesson that i did not want to learn.
