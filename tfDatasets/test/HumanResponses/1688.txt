have you ever seen the face of god? it's there in your eyes, your soft, beautiful eyes. eyes that melt my heart, look into my soul and warm me. into their soft glow i am pulled. til' your soul touches mine, wrapping and twisting around my own. our souls slowly merge into one another, i can no longer tell you from me. you become me, i become you. in that i find love. you blink and into reality i am pulled, but, love remains.
