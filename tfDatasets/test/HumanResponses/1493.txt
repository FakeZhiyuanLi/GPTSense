while i'm sitting hoping and praying that this one person will notice me, he's probably doing the same thing about someone else, who is also doing the same thing over yet another person.it's a tragic circle of bitter irony. and to make things worse everyone knows everyone else. is this a circle of friends or just a circle of pain?
