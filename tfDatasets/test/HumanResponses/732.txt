if you've ever wondered what i do, sitting up at 3am, well, im educating myself. most of the time, its on history subjects, such as disease outbreaks and the such. this mornings topics i've been researching are: - german measles - apollo 13 - challenger explosion - chernobyl - polio now, for you people out there thinking "this guy is a sick freak", i'm not. im just interested in past events, and they don't teach us any of this stuff in school.
