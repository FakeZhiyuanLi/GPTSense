today i went to the grocery store with l, my stepdad. or rather, i got up at 10 am and was dragged to the grocery store with a wall. ‘cuz i kept asking him stuff and he ignored me. am i really that annoying? well anyway, after that we went home and i carried up practically all of the groceries. then i made like a recluse and stayed in my room the whole day watching anime i had taped on adult swim. that’s it. leave me alone.
