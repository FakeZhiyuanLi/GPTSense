this is how you have left me. i have no reason anymore, no reason to remove myself from this darkened pit. you had chances, and many, but i just don't have the patience to sit, sit and wait for nothing, nothing at all. contrary to belief, i am not happy, nor am i lament with greif. beneath such facades i feel. like an emotionless void.
