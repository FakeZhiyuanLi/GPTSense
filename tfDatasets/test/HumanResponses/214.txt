havnt really posted anything in awhile. so i thought i would. went bridie o'rileys saturday night and i had a ball danced for e hours straighht pretty sure that i lost weight from it and my feet were burning by the end so im sure i had fun. unable too pick up guys due too the amount of losers around us i swear must have been looser guy night ok too be fare not all of them were. why is it that guys will eye you but make no further moves are they expecting us to make the moves i dont give off a snob image i hope all i do is shake my booty and go nuts on the dance floor. right now im trying to find ways to improve my job interviews some questions are really difficult but i guess may be because i am a recent graduate. well hi ted if your reading this im killing time till you back online so you can call kisses
