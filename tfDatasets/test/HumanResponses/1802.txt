i'm bored. i keep thinkin about this girl that lives in town. i don't really know her, and yet, it feels like i know her. that's confusing. well there's a lot going on in my life no one knows about. then again no one knows anything about me. people think they know me, but there's really another part of me that no one ever sees. a side that's really nice, funny, not the side everyone sees, serious and business like. i like being myself, but i've raised an image that everyone thinks i am. and i'm not. there's only one person that my real self comes out around. when i'm with her i feel i can be me, and not the me i've made myself to be. sometimes i believe i'm the person i'm not, and just need someone to hang around with so i can forget about it. right now what i need in my life is just something more. not a relationship, but a true friend. something that's hard to find anymore.
