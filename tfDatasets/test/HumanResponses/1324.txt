today was boring. i have a lot of good teachers and i am in a few classes with some good friends kevin is still short. i haven't done that much stuff today. i didn't see dipshit on the bus or inside school. i downloaded a emulator and now all i have to do is get a few games on it. hopefully i will get megaman x, x2, x3 if i do i will never leave the house. except for my top ten favorite things to do list. that that about it. my mom and dad are doing good. and i have burned dans 2 games so that is about it for me but i still cant wait for my dipshit dude across the street to go to school and i can't go to school tomorrow though which sucks for me i like school this year i really enjoy it i know i am turning onto dan. everyone i didn't see in summer change some way. drew got his ear pierced with looks gay on him and ben got acme and my acme cleared up a little.
