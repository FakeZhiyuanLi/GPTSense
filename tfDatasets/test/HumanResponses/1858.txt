i'm an idiot. i have heard about the bandwith issue on so many websites before and it never even crossed my mind to think about it. i've signed up for keenspace or keenspot whatever you want to call it out of hopes that maybe it will still work for my site. i'm really not sure if i'm still gonna be able to work with geocities and if i can't i'm gonna have to learn a whole lot more if i plan on ever getting this working. i'm alright trying to figure out that angle at this moment though so we'll just see what happens. damn this was so much simpiler a few days ago. i'm gonna look through all of my options though. i may have to settle for only having my comic strip seen on one of them drunk duck things. good luck getting much notice off of that. hobbies really should not be this stressful
