saw troy last night. all in all a pretty good movie, providing you're not too hooked up on homer's iliad, otherwise you'll hate it. pitt conveys achilles arrogance/indifference excellently, and bana was just brilliant as hector. diane kruger as helen, the face that launched a thousand ships? personally i don't think so, but regardless of who they cast, someone was going ot be disappointed. she's not an actor though, something almost cold about her. that and the fact the whole war seemed to last for 20 days instead of ten years. minor details though, the movie goes for nigh on three hours, and i hardly noticed the time fly, so it must have been good. ratre it 8/10.
