are you a borg? do you want to be a borg? what would becoming a borg do for you? we are all to some extent becoming borg. some of us more so and faster then others but in they end we will assimilate you. some of us depend on our technology to survive, some to keep from getting lost others to keep from getting bored. (bored, not borged!) one of my friends at work who would not consider himself borg has 2 cell phones a beeper and a pda. is he borg? maybe not. i have my ppc, cell (bluetooth connection both always on) my tens and my gps (not yet a bluetooth model but soon, i will give the old one to a friend when i get the new one.) not only that but i am developing my own hud and will probably convert that to an camera/hud as soon as i can. some people have technology but use it little, others of us depend on them. i go camping and take solar chargers for my computer in my drybag. so what do you have that may or may not make you borg? are you?
