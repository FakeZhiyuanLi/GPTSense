can't get into the work mode yet today. man, that whole genesis 3 fall of man thing is such a drag! way to go adam and eve; becuase of you i've gotta be cursed to work the ground! hahaha actually, sometimes work is good but it sure isn't what i'd really like to be doing. reality strikes however and you've gotta be able to pay the bills. training for a 12 hour race in august. just lost a teammate this morning due to prior obligations with his wife. although i understand, i'm still bummed. gotta do better on the next race. i got a heat stroke on the last one and almost didn't finish. almost. finishing is definitely the fun part. playing through the pain. proving to yourself that you can stick it out when you're gasping for air and your legs are burning. you ain't gonna quit for nothing! that's what its all about in my opinion. well, gonna try this work thing today. later.
