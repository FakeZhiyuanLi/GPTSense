so, the other day, someone at dinner asks me if i had seen this particular commercial. like, i have no idea what he is talking about. why? well, i have basically stopped watching live television. i pvr it and watch later.meaning that i skip the commercials.push the forward button a few times and poof commercials all gone! it has gotten so that even if i am right there at the time the show starts, i prefer to just wait about 5 minutes so i can have 5 minutes of buffer to forward. what is really freaky (man i mean freaky) is sometimes i will be listening to the radio or even watching a movie and i want to reach for the forward button! i am wondering what the heck is this i am listening/watching to?!? awright i am out. -mustafa
