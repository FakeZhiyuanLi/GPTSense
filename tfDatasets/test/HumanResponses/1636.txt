so it looks like sprint may finally have a bluetooth cellphone. both nokia and motorola have announced bluetooth phones for the cdma network, two plus years late! i have avoided upgrading for two years because all you could get was a crappy picture phone. sorry, but if i want to take a picture i would like to be able to tell what the picture is. but being able to have my contacts all up to date, now that is something useful. i'm just hoping these phones hit the market before my old phone completely dies.
