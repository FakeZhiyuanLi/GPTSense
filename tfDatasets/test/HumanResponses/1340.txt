perfect weather today blue skies and almost no wind. only problem is that no one wanted to do a tandem, which means i couldn't go up (they need the numbers, otherwise they loose money - the price of petrol these days is criminal :p). so instead of spending money on jumping, i spent it on shoes and stuff. they look kinda dagy really, and aren't particularly comfortable. they were just the best i could find.
