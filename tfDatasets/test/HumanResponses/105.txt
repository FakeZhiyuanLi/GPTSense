today i had my first experience of driving in the pouring down rain. pouring so bad i literally could not see where i was going. i was sooo scared! but yes! it was bad! my birthday is in a few days and i cant wait! tomorrow is school! ugh. last night courtney and i were talking and we figured out we are like soul mates (not in that way). we have so much in common like serisouly i really cant go into detail about what we talked about but it was serisouly scary. it was crazy! church today was awesome! we had this really good sermon! it was wonderful! i just had a really great day except i was soo scared to drive in the rain but other than that i had a pretty awesome day! well thats all for the moment! save the ant eaters!
