ok, its the final hour before the end of the work week and a 3-day weekend. you'd think i would be excited. well you're wrong. this day is going by so slow that i can actually feel myself getting older as each minute passes. the day started off fine. the first 2 hours flew by. but then the hour before lunch basically dragged, knowing full well that i was going to cherish lunchtime. and from there, this day has just dragged on, kicking and screaming. and for what? i don't have any plans. i'm not going anywhere. its not like there is anything for me to be excited about that would make me want to leave. no, its just the fact that this is the final day before a 3-day weekend. that's all it really is. and its pissing me off. come on.all you need to do is say 4:00 and i am gone. is that so difficult? for the love of all things small and furryget on with it
