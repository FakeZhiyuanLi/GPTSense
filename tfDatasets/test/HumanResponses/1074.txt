well, this is the last year of high school, only 1 week left. but before i get to leave, the school gets to screw me and my classmates over by giving a shit load of homework due in the last 2 weeks. students should not be forced to stay up till 3 in the morning completing the 2 projects due the next day and then having to study for 1 of the 3 tests. on top of that, i can no longer enjoy my weekend because of an english project and chemistry lab report. the last weeks of school are meant to be slack, not crammed so full of homework that if you cram anymore, the whole universe would collapse on itself. a logical solution would have been to give us these assignments during the curse of the fourth term, but no, were stuck doing them at the end scrambling our asses of. o well, i guess we just have to take the shit that is thrown at us.
