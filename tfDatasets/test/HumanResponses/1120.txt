pen and twinkling h2os on watercolor paper this image is cut out around that weird shaped border (hard to measure inches). the paints i used look like they have tiny bits of glitter in them, and don't look so hot in the scan. they look much better and not so splotchy on the actual paper. i want to really get into art journalling for this challenge, and have realized that it won't happen if i have to work out of a book i'm made. i get terrible "white page stage fright" and can't do anything without worrying about having to pull it out of the book. so i'm going to do loose pages and then bind them all into a book at the end of the challenge. i like the shape of this page, so i might do more like this. i think they might look interesting interspersed with regular square pages.
