it's about 10 in the morning now. woke up and hopped right on my computer. checked my email and for any offline messages on yahoo. of course, nothing exciting. chatting with a friend of mine on yahoo who lives about 3 hours away from me. should drive up to see her soon. i drank a whole fuckin' 6 pack last night. i so don't want to go to work today. don't really have a hangover. guess i'm just lucky this time. my bed is calling to me something fierce. i can already feel that this 9 hour work day is gonna feel like 18 hours. i'm definitely not looking forward to it. eh. i'll write more later. i'm bored now.
