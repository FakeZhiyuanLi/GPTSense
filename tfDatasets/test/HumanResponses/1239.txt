so, i've finally figured out how to get to the "dashboard" thing.which then allows you to write an entry. yeah. i'm a wee bit slow out the gate (as my mother would say.and doesoften) but.i seem to manage, somehow. things are weird right now. i feel odd. not happy.but not exactly sad. sorta like an ugly brown swirled up mixture of the two. swirled so much that it becomes an entirely new emotion altogether. all. to. get her. i always say that in my head when i'm spelling that word. taco bell has beef and potato burritosthis i discovered tonight. i'll miss them when i leave in 10 days. i leave in 10 days. i hate saying goodbye. especially when i just did this. i'll miss them when i leave. in 10 days. but i cant wait to be held by him, forever. i cant wait to be his wife. i cant wait for them all to finally meet. i cant wait. only 10 more days. **** buenas noches, que suenas con los angeles. (the celestial beings, as opposed to the city. hehee!)
