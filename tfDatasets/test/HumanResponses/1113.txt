it has been quiet the last three days. no crazy kay until today. she's back from wherever she went. for the last hour, i've been watching kay bring food to the dumpster. she's not throwing anything away, just bringing everything from her kitchen and putting it on top of and around the dumpster. the crows are watching her, too, and she keeps hollering that she's going to call the cops on them. i left for half an hour and returned around 9:40 and everything was gone! she spent the rest of the morning going through the trash and taking things back to her apartment.
