think back. back in time. back to a time when mtv wasn't ruled by jessica simpon's sister and the real world was the only reality show on tv. back to a time when there was quality television. and the underdog inspired many. that underdog was daria morgendorfer. do you remember daria? that show of the trials and tribulations of teenage outcast with dark humor and dead-on high school stereotypes has always been one of my favorites and i wept when it was cancelled years ago. but! on channel 100, the noggin channel, (recently added for my viewing pleasure since patriot media has so graciosuly given my family digital cable) daria is on at 11:30 pm and 2 am- and on some nights- from 11-12 and 2-3 yes, there is a higher power and yes i do appreciate whoever has given me my favorite show again. so watch, embrace and feel the love that daria can give each and every one of you. "sometimes your shallowness is so thorough, it's almost like depth"- from daria meehee
