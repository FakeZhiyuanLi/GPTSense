hey it has been a while since i have posted. i have been very depressed today and it is mainly because of my dad and stepmom. i came home saturday from flordia and it was very sad b/c i didn't want to come home. after i came home on saturday i went to the smokies baseball game i had box seats. i saw andrew temple there and mr. hodges who was very drunk. it was so funny to see him like that. i went to the game again on sunday as well. i have to give a report in latin tomorrow on the titans(not the football team). it's greek mythology. i am so tired i didn't get much sleep on the count of i was watching i want a famous face on mtv. there was this guy who had been taking these pills to turn himself into a woman and he had grown boobs but he was still a man in some places. but he/she wanted to look like jennifer lopez and it didn't work. i was so gross. well i am going to go. toodles. p.s. cassy i will miss you. i heart you.
