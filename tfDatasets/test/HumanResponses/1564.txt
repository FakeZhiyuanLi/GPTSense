i hear the oceans thunder as it beats against the rocks, and i wonder if forever is just another day. would it take a lifetime to swim the ocean blue, would it be eternity before i see you. it breaks my heart in half to know your far away. if i had wings like eagles and could spread my wings and fly, i'd have been here yesterday and today you would be mine. but oceans are between us, they're the wedge between our hearts. i wish i could be there to hold you in my arms, to see your bright smiling face and your handsome boyish charms. but fate it is against us, and the world is not our friend. .because we are oceans apart. written by lylia garrett may 1999
