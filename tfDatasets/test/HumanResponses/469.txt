i just heard barack obama, a state senator from illinois, talk in the dem national convention. he is everything kerry isn't and his retoric makes clinton look like, well, me. i would love to see an incredible surge in the poles for him, and i would just hug someone if he replaced kerry on the ticket tomorrow. ok, it wouldn't happen, but a boy can dream, cant he?
