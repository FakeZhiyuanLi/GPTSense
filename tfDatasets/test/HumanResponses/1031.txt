the trials of many decided by so few manipulated by those whose hearts know nothing of loss who want for nothing yet are possessed of a hunger that can never be sated. greedily grasping for the next conquest the next big crisis hoping to reap the dividends not heeding the rape of justice perpetrated by their very presence. woe to the masses whose voices go unrecorded who scream until they are hoarse and finally can speak no more. the scales are permanently tipped not in favour of the needy the sick the dying no. the golden statement determines right and wrong and from there what is left.
