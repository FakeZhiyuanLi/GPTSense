this post will be short because the miracle of modern medicine pumped my veins with more codene than blood, and thus i have the attention span of a small monkey. i got my wisdom teeth out. my face swelled up like a small monkey's i spent several days playing computer games 14 hrs straight, until my eyes were yellow and jittery. like a monkey's. i think you can see what im getting at here an that is that im a fucking monkey! sorry. -m
