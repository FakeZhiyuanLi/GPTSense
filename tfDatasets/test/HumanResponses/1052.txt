i'm just making trouble for myself in a place where it doesn't have to be. and i will stop thinking about it because i know that i do not want to lose such a great thing. a friend told me yesterday, "do not think about it. do not think about it. in my opinion he is the best thing that has ever happened to you." and the thing is.i've never been more happy. i don't think im being clingy. it's not like i've spent tons of time with him during the school year. in fact, i hardly ever saw him during the school day. it is just the simple fact that i miss him, and i don't think that's being clingy at all. i am finally happy .in the past.it was off and on due to some particular events.but now it has been consistent.and that is a first for awhile now.
