well, i have to take it easy for a few weeks. it appears that i have tendonitis in my achilles tendon. oh boy! since i will not be working out for a while i must now cut back on food. i could certainly use the cut back in food anyway. so much for being young. i guess there is now hiding from getting older oh well, i'll be back to cruising around the river on my lunch hour in a few weeks. oh, btw, my wife is awesome. she puts up with my geekyness to the extreme. my eight computers, my fascination with aircraft of any kind, countless hours in front of my computer flying in my flight simulators, my fantasy and sci-fi booksthe list goes on and on. she loves me regardless and that is just the best. i can not imagine life with out her. i love her very much. anyway, i am outta' here. church tomorrow at 7:30am. must sleep. take care all! ng
