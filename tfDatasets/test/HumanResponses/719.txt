what is lupus? lupus (say: lew-pus) is an autoimmune (say: aw-toh-im-yoon) disease. normally, a person's immune system makes antibodies (say: an-tie-ba-dees), which are special chemicals that fight off infections caused by germs that enter the body. but the immune system of a person with lupus gets confused. it can't tell the difference between germs and some of the body's normal cells. so it responds by making autoantibodies (say: aw-toh-an-tie-ba-dees). these are antibodies that attack the body's normal cells. it's a little like a soccer game gone haywire: instead of the defenders of a team protecting the goal, they actually turn against their team. they begin attacking their own teammates and scoring on their own goal.
