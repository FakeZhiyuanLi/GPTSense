an angel walked the earth today reigning joy on everyone a dazzling smile like a bright summers day blinding you with all her glory such a love for life bubbling like freshly poured champagne an angel walked the earth today such beauty she possessed a heart of gold and hair of silk our hearts she surely touched as brief as her visit may have been i wish she could have stayed longer that she didnt have to leave but like a delicate shinning star she faded into the dark night sky our angel has returned home she sleeps with the blessed no more pain no more tears rest well our little angel we will meet again written by lylia garrett july 2000
