woo-hoo! i'm finally 16. i can't believe it. i got back this morning from oklahoma and i am so glad to be home. i am totally beat. my aunt's wedding was beautiful and the reception was a blast. i had a party there and i got mostly jewelry. my aunt and new uncle got me a 14 karat ring with ruby and diamonds in it. my other uncle and aunt gave me a really pretty bracelet. and my grandparents got me a gold necklace. i'm mostly excited about my brand new computer! it has a flat screen which i really like! i'm really excited about it.
