hoss is my bulldog (for anyone that sees this but doesn't know me), and he is a spoiled one at that. this how we have found him when we came home on several occasions. you can't see it in the picture, but there was a corona on the railing and his daddy was grilling hamburgers for us.including him. i wonder what he does that we don't see.maybe i don't want to know, eh? anyway, he does weigh at least 62 lbs here. he still thinks he's small enough to be a lap dog, and will climb up in my lap every time he gets tired just to prove it. of course, at that point i am pinned and have to move a mountain to get up out of the chair. but he has more kisses than i can stand sometimes, and plenty left over for anyone that comes to visit. i'm definitely a bulldogger!
