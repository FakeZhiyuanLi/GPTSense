i am so sick of my mom sometimes. i wanted to tell my story about something that had happened today to my dad, and she kept interrupting me, and then she was just like fuck u i was like what? i don't have any idea what i do wrong to her. i am rude to her alot, i know that, but it's because she has changed so much. my mom used to be my best friend, and for the past couple of years, it's like we've totally lost that. ever since i got my license, we've gone even farther back and i just don't get it. she doesn't want to let me go. give me freedom. i believe i've been rebelling against her and her ideas of how i should be lately, and i feel totally guilty about that. i wish i could talk to her, but she either gets her feelings hurt or she gets mad. i don't know what to do.
