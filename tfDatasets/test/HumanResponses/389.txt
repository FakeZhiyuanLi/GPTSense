yes the sun has come back again for now. i got to the oldham match last night was really a waste of my time the football was a shambles we lost 3-2 we are now bottom of the table and starting another season of low crowd attendance and bad football. however some of our new signings were quite good rodney jack in particular gave 110% last night and i need to give him credit for that. todat has been a good day i have met the pais worker hu will be based at our church from septmeber he is called lee, 18 from n.ireland. he is a cool guy and will fit in with our group at chruch fine. infact he more or less is one of us already. other tahn meeting lee i haven't done much today apart from sat in front of the tv and go on my pc. god bless katie
