a sense of humor is very important in this job. they want me to do more work. but they aren't paying me more. and i am supposed to be happy that i have a job. my benefits are decreasing. but my needs are increasing as i get older. next the insurance premium will increase. but i won't get a cost of living increase. that's always good for a laugh.
