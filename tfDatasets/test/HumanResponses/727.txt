all people are jackasses to some extent. only a few jackasses know that they are. jackasses hiding in earth covered holes who never see the light of day who live in a chosen oblivion know that they are jackasses. i have a soft spot for these types. they seem to have the most poetry. jackasses involved in endless attempts at approval who bask in the public sun who take the exterior world for reality who live in a blindly ambitious way don't know they are jackasses. i have no recourse for that jackass. probably because they lack that element of poetry. so it would seem that to knowing the innards of things is poetry even if it does make you run and hide, it is closer to reality realism is poetry. as for ambition, it is the security blanket in a fool's paradise.
