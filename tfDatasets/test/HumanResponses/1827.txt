i got pulled over just now, driving my friends car who was, at one point atleast, rather intoxicated. the cop had me radar'd "as fast as 40mph" (i managed, though with difficulty, to keep a straight face, having been driving near double that seconds before) no ticket! hurray for my charm and good manors, eh?
