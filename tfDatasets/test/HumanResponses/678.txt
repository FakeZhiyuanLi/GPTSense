lonely liar i stand in the middle of the road a man with no place to go looking to rid my heavy load on anyone, i'll make it so i am the lord of all i survey because i'm blind as a bat they all want to laugh, don't they? the creature that drinks their blood shall be getting fat not a promise or a threat just a simple observation the bus stop is where they all met and i'll be waiting at the station then i remember one simple truth i am a lonely liar standing in the street eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth is why i'm blinded and beat
