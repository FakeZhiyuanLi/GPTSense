i no longer have the dissection class. and to those who have been reading my journal i know i have 3 days more to write about. i have them written in my paper journal just need soem tiem to myself to type it in here. i promise i will this week. i started my 4th class of the summer. powerpoint. taught by a guy and i mean no offense but you would expect to see this guy behind any 7elven cash register in the usa not a prof at a university. i have spent all day in this class 8am-4:30pm and i feel like one of my cadaers from last week. if i had a scapple i would skin myself. i could barely understand anything that came out of the man's mouth except for one line "is this clear what i am saying". holy fucking cow! i have 4 more days of this. my two worse nightmares bill gates meets ghandi makes me want to slaughter cows!
