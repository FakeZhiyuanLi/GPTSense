went to watch a movie with my bro today, like we always do. watched the village this time . didnt really expect the movie to be that way though. hmm, gonna upload a photo just too lazy to plug in the camera and stuff. prolly do it tomorrow then . im still a little worried abt my friend. she had unprotected sex. what was she thinking ? i mean, i had my experience of getting carried away and almost did, but she did it spontaneously , without even worrying abt him putting a rubber tube. come on. she's gonna get in big trouble if something happens. i didnt know till a accompanied her to the store (she promised me a can of coke , man. how can i resist :p), and being the psychic person i am (heh heh) i sorta read her lips when she ask the store person for a pregnancy test kit . they didnt have it though. all i can do is pray for her (though im not good at it ) . she gives in too easily. hope things go well for her. *crosses fingers*
