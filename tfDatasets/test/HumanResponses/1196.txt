i was so high i did not recognize the fire burning in her eyes the chaos that controlled my mind whispered goodbye and she got on a plane never to return again but always in my heart this love has taken its toll on me she said goodbye too many times before and her heart is breaking in front of me i have no choice cause i won't say goodbye anymore i tried my best to feed her appetite keep her coming every night so hard to keep her satisfied kept playing love like it was just a game pretending to feel the same then turn around and leave again this love has taken its toll on me she said goodbye too many times before and her heart is breaking in front of me i have no choice cause i won't say goodbye anymore i'll fix these broken things repair your broken wings and make sure everything's alright my pressure on her hips sinking my fingertips into every inch of you cause i know that's what you want me to do
