yahoo has really stepped up in the internet world. they have increased their email capacity from a measly 4mb to 100mb. they are trying to compete with gmail from google which gives users 1000mb=1gb of space. hotmail however has fallen back, still offering just 2mb forfree accounts. i for one thank yahoo and gmail for the additional space because i always hated the hotmail account saying warning you are reaching your inbox limit when i barely had like 20 email. with yahoo and gmail, internet will be much better off. =)
