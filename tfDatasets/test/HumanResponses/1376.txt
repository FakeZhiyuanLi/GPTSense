in the ever expanding research of military technology, the folks at the university of buffalo received a $1.5 million grant to fund research into inorganic blood substitutes. the technology makes it possible for a soldier to survive in the field for three hours with a 60% blood loss level. the compound called dodecaflouropentane emulsion, or ddfpe can expand into microbubbles small enough to deliver oxygen into the system through the capillaries. when i think of the amount of money that is spent on military research that could be used to treat cancer or aids, it makes my blood boil. ha ;)
