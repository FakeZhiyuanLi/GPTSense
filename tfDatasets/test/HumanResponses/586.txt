so the first couple days of summer have been soo much fun. i dont have alotta time.so this'll probably be short. exams were okay.had to go to a graduation party on thursday night. friday was the amazing water fight/cookout at caitlin's. we watched the history of the world pt. 1. very funny. josh showed us a pic of this crazyyy stretch truck limo.that i dont think is real, but we will hunt down and take to holkum to dress up in fat suits and go trick or treating. then friday went back over to caitlin's for her forensics party. that was mucho fun too. now we're trying to get everyone together to go to crockett to hang out for a while cause my parents are dragging me to go see the nashville symphony concert.what fun.
