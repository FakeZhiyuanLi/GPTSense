the woven night paints a tapestry of memories deepening darkness embraces my thoughts i feel you your memory casts a shadow in the garden of my despair illuminating the corners of my well of sorrow yet you elude me i hear you the sweet melody of your being is in exquisite harmony your truth cries out over all else i see you the faded portrait of your countenance diminishes with each rising day yet the deepest softest sleep brings you into vivid clarity i need you the separation of our souls is as endless as the night you exist purely simply without me i am alone
