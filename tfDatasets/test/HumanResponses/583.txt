went out the other night, decided it was time i saw the light of day. i know, *gasp* but the sun didn't burn. we went off to taco bell (wouldn't want to clean the bathrooms there) evidently no one does, they are as filthy as, as, a resteraunt selling spicy food's should be. that wasn't even the highest point of the evening though! the village , it was good, my father hated it but my mom and i stand by our decision. it was one heck of a film, eerie and odd but good. now see it, i comand you. *ends tansmission*
