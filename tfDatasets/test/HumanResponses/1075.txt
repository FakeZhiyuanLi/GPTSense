ever since i got a b- on a short story i wrote for english class back in 1971 i have had an unrelenting desire to get published. over the past 35 years i have had an essay, a short story (the coin) and a poem published. you may be thinking "he's not vey prolific", and you'd be right, but hey, i've been busy! as of july 1, 2004 i have begun work on a novel. a daunting task yet i feel confident that i can write it; it's just selling it that makes me nervous. now that i know what a 'blog' is i will keep a diary telling you the reader all the mistakes.eri mean all the great decisions i made culminating in the sale of the book.
