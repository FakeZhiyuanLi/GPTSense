i have an interview for a new job on thursday at the yorkshire tourist board as their new webmaster. not only do i have to sit a skills assessment on asp, vbscript and sql i also have to produce a presentation on future development for the site in line with their 2005 marketing campaign, which i know nothing about. normally i wouldn't worry but i only got the details last thing yesterday giving me 2 days to knock up the presentation and brush up on my asp and vb knowledge. fun. thankfully all the other applicants will also have the same time scale. i now have to surreptitiously do the presentation whilst at work today which is not easy considering that my monitor faces my bosses desk! anyhoo, will let you all know how it goes.
