the sun is up and the bird shrieks on a bough your eyes are open and you long to hurl fiery words into my ears. which you did. but all i could hear is the bird. a train is coming in the distant metal grinds against metal outside our windows. you donâ€™t hear all these things. burned, i dive under cover. copyright 2003 by serenity
