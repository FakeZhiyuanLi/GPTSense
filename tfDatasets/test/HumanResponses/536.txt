you know, i tried posting one of these twice in the last week and both times it didn't come up, so this will be the third time. if you are able to read this, then you know that it worked. if not. well blogger can fuck off and i'll go back to livejournal (or better yet start my own blog). anyway, tomorrow is the opening of insidepulse.com. it'll be nice to be able to read columns by my net god, hyatte again. a week without him is like a week of not being able to jerk off. passionless, boring, and all together unsatisfying. now i can have a mental orgasm all over myself. should be fun. welcome back cool hy, you fucker. well, that is all i can think of. now. if you'll excuse me, i plan to go stuff my face with hostess cupcakes. i can put a box away and i don't gain a pound, you bitches! reno
