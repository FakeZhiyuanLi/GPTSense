wow, yesterday was so boring i didn't even blog anything. today i just sat at home watching the olympics until like 4:15 when i drove myself into church. when i got home dad and i went to eat at monical's because the girls are out of town. the problem was that i then got forced to drive dad to the goddamn concession stand at the football game where i was stuck for way too long. not like i had anything to do at home anyway, but still, i would rather have been home. anyway. signing off, m.
