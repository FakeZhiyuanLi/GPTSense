today, i am going to a wedding! the last time i went to a wedding was when i was a ring bearer for my aunt kendra's wedding. i was, 4, i think. she still has it on video! the only things i really remember from that wedding are doing the "funky chicken" dance, and the fact that kara got a really cool lollipop because she made a request from the dj (i was uspet!). the wedding present i chose was a fondue set from linens and things. at first, it seemed like a somewhat trite choice. but in the end, it seemed like a somewhat cute idea. i wanted something that they could do together. i just hope they don't end up with 14 fondu kits. :) just for effect, we're using a shower-loofah with a lion head as the ribbon. teehee.
