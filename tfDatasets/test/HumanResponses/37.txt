my older brother is moving out of the house at the age of 23. actually, he's getting kicked out by my mom for basic mom reasons, ie, she's tired of him being around. why, i don't know. this sucks, for more reasons then one. he's a very cool brother, and he taught me a lot of lessons. some by accident. but he has helped me stay on the "right path" and we spend a lot of time just hanging out, chilling and talking about whatever comes to mind. problem: he's taking his pc with him. the good one with the nvidia geforce 4 mx and matching chipset. the modded-out gaming/filesharing computer. how will i get my fix without it? :sob:
