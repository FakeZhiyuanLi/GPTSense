i hate people who use chopsticks to eat chinese food. they are the lowest form of human on earth. and don’t give that “when in rome” bullshit. you don’t dress up like a long shore man when i go to red lobster. using chopsticks to eat chinese food is like drinking unpasturised milk, archaic and stupid. “but shurs, some people get a sense of accomplishment from mastering chopsticks.” then buy a fucking puzzle, the one with the big pieces, because completing that is as much of an accomplishment as “mastering” chopsticks.
