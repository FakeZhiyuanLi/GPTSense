welcome to the begining of something not so speacial or entertaining. shrinks are too much money and my handwriting is too bad to have a diary. so here lies my dirty laundry and skeletons in the closet. or, just me rambling on as i pretend hundreds of people stop by and read this thinking i am soooooo clever and funny. thank you, thank you, i love you all. um, damn, i am pathetic. check out our new baby birds, and amber's hand! aren't they cute?
