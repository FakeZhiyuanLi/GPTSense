there is one person who reads my blogs and who can figure out who i am. i've given many clues as to who i am, you just have to read the comments and look closely. this may be my last blog, when you find out who i am, i have one last thing to say to you, but you have to find out who i am. its been fun and all, but hiding behind a name like dark angelique gets boring.
