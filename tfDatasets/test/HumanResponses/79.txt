had a dr's appointment on thursday. xray'd and said it looked to be holding up well, nothing had widened any. i can sort of sit cross legged on the floor, and tried standing up in the shower the other day. which went alright, as long as i stay in one spot. turns out i'm not going to be going to physical therapy because the doc said that since i don't have insurance he's not going to send me. i can just do some exercise at home. soak my foot in hot water for 20 minutes a day and then move the ankle around (up down side sidedamn that sounds like an old nes code, where's my b or a buttons? heh) for a few minutes. i was able to go around some yesterday with just one crutch. did ok. still moving really slowly though. tried it some today and it hurt more. tried it again after soaking my foot and exercising the ankle and did a little better.
