yesterday well actually early this morning me and my cousin went camping we got hungry and it was about 1:00. we figured taco bell was still open because the sign said they were open till 2 a.m. so we get out there and the whole trip me and my cousin are anticipating getting the grande meal with 10 tacos. oh how great it would taste. we got to the door at 1:30. plenty of time to get some last minute tacos in our tummy. so we pulled on the door and it was locked. noooooooo! we shouted and there was people inside just dilly dallying around. it was so gay and we were forced to eat at the only 24 hour resturant in middlesboro. krystals =-( taco bell will be forever gay.
