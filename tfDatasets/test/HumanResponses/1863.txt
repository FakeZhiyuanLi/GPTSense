words i read in a book i just started to read. written within the first three pages of the book. enough to make me love writing for a snippet, and then it was back to envy, and trite cynicism about my own ability to form sentences. even sentences that simple. that simply resonate. that echo in my mouth, in my nasal cavity, making me wish i could use them in a conversation. big work party tonight. will try not to get too lit as monday morning horror stories are not fun. they are fun when you are talking about someone else, just not about you. lost 1.5lbs, even while guzzling a bottle of pinot grigio and a chocolate chip cookie.
