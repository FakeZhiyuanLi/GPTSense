i'm actually happy today. i had a decent enough day in school (i learned two new peoples names! u_u;;) and right now i'm kicking back and finishing my homework. which i really need to start doing.hehehheh.grades aren't up to snuff imo. i'm hoping the weekend will be awesome though. gonna have a party and maybe see collateral. the latest game informer has some neat articles in it this month, but of particluar interest to me is a six-page feature on mech assault 2. i didn't really like the first one that much, but that was mostly due to repetitous goals and stuff. with the addition of shinier graphics and fully destructable stuff, and being able to traverse outside your mech with a jetpack and jack any vehicle (be it tanks, mechs, or gunships) the game is looking to be the first great game of '05. (comes out 1/15/05 btw. ;d) ah.can't wait for the end of the month.phantom brave, star ocean 3.yummy. ^_^ later.
