do you have an obsessive-compulsive personality? i like to think i don't. when i was younger i sometimes got hooked on video games, wasting huge amounts of time and money. it's like candy for the mind. i've seen obsessions in others however. for example, cleanliness obsessions. cleanliness is of course a very good thing, but not when it becomes an obsession. some people can no longer travel for fear of germs (viruses, bacteria.). some can't stop washing their hands because of the same fear. sleep is a great remedy if you're spending too much time thinking about something.
