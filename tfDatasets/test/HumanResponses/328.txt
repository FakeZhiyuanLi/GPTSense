honestly, these traits sound familiar don’t they? most of the things described in the last entry is mainly true… too weird, but if you know who i am, then you know that i do the things mentioned. not that i believe in this sort of thing, but… haha i actually thought i was becoming a poet because of what cassie has shown me, but that too seems to be a trait of the aquarian. well, i guess this kinda explains why i do the things i do. this is very odd. check out the likes and dislikes section, this hits me right on. and also check out paragraph 5 after the traditional aquarian traits section. (cassie, i'm like that with you.)
