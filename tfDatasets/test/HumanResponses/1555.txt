a south-east wind is blowing this afternoon : the weather is good to take my board. this evening, i will help erwann to buy a laptop and wifi accessories to make a lan for his job. then i will running with christophe and j.m. to prepare for a adventure raid in september. yesterday evening, i didn't see my neighboor totoro , i chose to see rush hour 2 . i think it is not a good jacky chan movie, dialogues are worth and fights are not so beautiful but the spanish federal agent is very cute.
