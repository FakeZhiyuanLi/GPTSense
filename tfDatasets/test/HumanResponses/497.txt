i was talking to a female friend's "boyfriend" at a concert last night. he started talking about how tough he was in high school, college and now. he was flexing mc flexing, talking about carbs, diets and carb diets and i kinda nodded off. then he dropped the phrase "going to have to kick ass and take names." i said, "it's much more hard-core to kick the ass and make someone else take the names." from the look on his face, i think his brain must have shorted.
