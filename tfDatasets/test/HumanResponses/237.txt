well, today is going okay. i have applied for a few jobs, done the bills and balanced the check book. i am currently a house spouse. i think i could get used to this. it's too bad i can't take this on as a full time occupation! cocoa, the cat, is in heat and won't shut up! she is normally a recluse but is now very affectionate. the poor thing doesn't feel good at all. the other two cats are nowhere to be found. i gues they are avoiding her. soon they will be in heat, too. the back yard needs mowed. i plan to get on that after i get a haircut this afternoon. my hair is so long i can comb it straight back like a gangster. it will feel so much better soon. sis called me to let me know the counselors at school think she will be one of the top ten juniors for grades this year. go sis! the girl works like a demon to maintain grades while swimming and while working. she works harder than most adults. it should be fun to watch her grow up.
