femta still shows that i'm at my "highest" phase of fertility. i thought that it would be cool to try maybe every other day, but liam has been nothing short of amazing, every night! oh my. i'm feeling pummeled, poor me. but i think he finally understands how important this is to me, to us. starting a family is the next step in the natural progression of our marriage. in the hopes that this month will be the one, i've thought over several names but the only one that liam and i can agree on is meilani michelle. i'm assuming that most men want the first son to be named after them, so i'm only concentrating on the girls' names. i know that thinking about names could prove disasterous, but i must remain positive throughout this ordeal, no matter what happens i'll see my neice for the first time ever this weekend. i'm sure that it will be a joyous time. until i become a mother, it is my hope to be the best godmother and aunt around.
