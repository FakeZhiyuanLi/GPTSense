so, av likes to paint this picture that he is no good with ladies. but i beg to differ. even back in the highschool days he was a souper-pimp and didn't even realize it. here an im conversation i recently had with a mutual friend of ours from highschool which illustrates my point (some im names have been changed to protect the innocent and this is not rachel cohen): trev555555: me and avram are still good friends trev555555: i see him once or twice a week rachel: really? trev555555: yep rachel: what is he up to? trev555555: hes temping at this one place and being a substitute teacher rachel: remember when i was in love him? rachel: those were the days trev555555: no man. thats crazy trev555555: you were in love with av? rachel: shayna liked him too trev555555: shayna did!? see. right under our noses, women the world around have a passion for avram. and for that, i must tip my hat.
