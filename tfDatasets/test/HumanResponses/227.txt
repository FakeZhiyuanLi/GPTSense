can't believe i'm at it again. well, i'm starting up the immaculate consumption project once more. i will list everything i consume everyday in the hopes that it will help me (and maybe dissuade you from such folly). help me understand where it is that my money goes and help me be conscious of what i do to my body. the previous versions of the ic project (started in 1997) were conducted at a time when i had considerably more disposable income and also considerably more debt. i think that this time will be an interesting take on the subject. ha. -aegis (i'm back)
