on august 1, 2004, was born emily ann reyes conway, the first daughter of two of my most closest firends at work. i didn't have oportunity to see her until this weekend, and gosh! she is the most beautiful baby i've ever seen. both, charly and alicia, the parents, are happy, the just don't beleive they already have a baby at home, a baby of their own.
