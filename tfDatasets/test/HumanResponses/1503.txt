i took my family out for a night at the circus last night. my oldest daughter sarah loved every minute of it. personally, i found the animal rights protesters more entertaining than the show. some of them were a little rough in my opinion as they called people "bad parents" and "poor role models" as they walked by. for some reason they didn't say anything to me. maybe it was the i eat beef and i'll knock you on your ass if you complain about it look i had on my face. either way, we all had a fun night.
