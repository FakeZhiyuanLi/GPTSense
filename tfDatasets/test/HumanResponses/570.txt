so, i told her. thank god. she took it well, she's been acting the same with me since, and i'm really happy about that, it's just like normal. i'm so lucky to have her as a friend. i went leicester shopping yesterday for clothes for 6th form.came back with one pair of trousers :( paul, gemma, charlotte, ruth and gemma's sister jessicca went. i went home but then i went for a walk, and cried my eyes out, i've had a lot on my mind recently. so anyway, i rang gemma and she came out and comforted me, which was good of her. jack
