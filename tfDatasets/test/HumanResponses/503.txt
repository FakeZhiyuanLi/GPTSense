can't believe what we did on saturday. mildly innane, really stupid. we refers to nexa and serene(3/4 03), me and veliana (duh 4/6). we (nexa, clau, serene minus veliana) did the happy dance 2004 in front of a captive audience numbered one. that one was mr low the one with the legend* and the revealed secret**. we wasted his time, to watch the entire second half, or rather, second 3/7th. and he wasn't really irritated i guess, at least he didn't seem so. by that, i believe he proved his mettle. i think he just earned himself the rank of funky*** mr low! you are officially funky! * legend: like -> devotion -> don't like if in doubt, ask clau ** secret: erhmmmm mmmarrriieee eeeerrrhmmmd *** hierachy of (good)ranks from lowest to highest: rock funky funkaay other funkies:mrs low, mr lee
