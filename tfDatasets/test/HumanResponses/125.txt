i dun like to wait. i dun like to sit n sulk. i dun like to put my own happiness in other ppl's hand. i dun wan others to control how they can make me feel. i dun like. i dun like becoz i'm scared of losing. i'm scared of losing to others, of losing out to myself, to declared i'm defeated. i gotta be strong. i have to.
