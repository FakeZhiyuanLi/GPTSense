last night, there was a major scare directed towards me. my mom changed her password so i couldn't get around the parent controls, meening no blogs. now, she doesn't know i have a blog, so i am always being sneeky bout it. and it also would meen no google, yahoo, or any other search engines. yet, somehow this morning i was able to access my blog. very strange, but good. now i can do blogs again! yay!
