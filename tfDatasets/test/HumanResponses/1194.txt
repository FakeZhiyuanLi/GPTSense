i woke up, got outta bed, dragged a comb across my head, got on the computer and ripped off the beatles. i feel gross, dirty, angry, hot,. not a nice mood to be in. ch-check this out, i got a disposable digital camera. who knows that they make those? ten friggin bucks, not bad. otherwise, pretty boring day with chad.
