later, knowing that all was now completed, and so that the scripture would be fulfilled, jesus said, "i am thirsty." [29] a jar of wine vinegar was there, so they soaked a sponge in it, put the sponge on a stalk of the hyssop plant, and lifted it to jesus' lips. [30] when he had received the drink, jesus said, "it is finished." with that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit. ~john 19:28-30 ~
