so the weekend is officially over. i feel a void right now, but i also feel somewhat satisfied. what is it from? usually holiday weekends with gatherings make me feel like i want someone in my life. but at the sametime i have an amazing amount of freedom because i do not. at the same time, i think things like the trip to costco alone remind me how single i really am. it kinda sucks. *fizzle* - i'm just emotionally tired right now. s
