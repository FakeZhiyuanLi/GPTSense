my job sucks. i want a new one, but i don't have enough experience to get a new one just yet. it's kinda funny, 8 months ago i was on the brink of a breakdown cause i couldn't get a job. i was unhappy cause i was unemployed. now i am employed. and guess what? i'm still unhappy does life really suck this bad or am i just one of those people who is never happy with anything in life? either way makes for a pretty shitty way to live your life coming tomorrow: i rant on relationships, love, and marriage. well i think it's coming tomorrow. as long as i don't find something better to do.
