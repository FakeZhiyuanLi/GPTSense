i was just watching michael moore's documentary, "bowling for columbine." he's seeking to understand why the u.s. is such a violent country. he examines various reasons that people often gives: video games, violent movies, music lyrics, guns, etc. the most intriguing part is when he interviews various canadians. any reason for america's violence that you give, it seems, doesn't make sense when compared with canada. for example, canadians play video games, watch violent movies, listen to the same kind of music, and own lots and lots of guns, but very few people get murdered by guns in a year. the clips imply that america's culture of fear is at least partly to blame. for example, canadians are so relaxed, don't lock their doors, yet have less violent crime (although the people he interviewed did admit that burglars have broken into their homes to steal things). i wonder what sociologists have to say about all this.
