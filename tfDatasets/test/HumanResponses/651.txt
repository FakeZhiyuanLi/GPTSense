well today was monday, oh gosh i sure am tired. i didn't get much sleep this weekend although i am sure i will this coming weekend considering the fact that i am grounded. my parents said i couldn't go out sat. night and there was no way i could stand for that in justice so i left and told them i was going to the store. then i went to tims house where he was haveing a party, i was hoping brian would be there because last time we hung out he was really cool and we talked for a long time. but he wasnt so after being there for a while i went over to alicias house where everyone was hanging out and eric was being a real shit head. oh yea on fri we went and saw the exorcist and eric was being dumb about that too. oh well who cares. yea so anyway everything was worth going out for. well i am tired i am going to get to bed.
