my quest for ddr is now over. its been a solid 3 weeks calling every game store around my area. finally a wal-mart has it. after asking the dude about the game he says they dont have it in stock. he checks anyway and finds just one more game left back in the deepest darkest corner of the game case. woooooo! thats good news for me.
