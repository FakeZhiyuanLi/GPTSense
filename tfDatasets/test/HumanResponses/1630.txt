i hate clouds on a sunny day. i hate fast cars that are slow. i hate cigarettes in the grass. i hate good food that tastes nasty. i hate dirt on clean surfaces. i hate smiles on sad people. i hate frowns on happy people. i hate tiredness without sleep. i hate friends without relationships. i hate love without expression. i hate the expected unexpected. i hate good music that sucks. i hate real people that are fake. i hate the security of insecurities.
