i've been living in the united states for about 3 years now and i seem to be losing my taste for healthy dutch beer. in the past i really enjoyed the heavier beers like grolsch, heineken and amstel. nowadays i'm much more comfortable with american light beers that keep you sober for a very long time before you finally get drunk. i still have a strong distaste for bud or bud light though. lately my number one favorite beer is michelob ultra. low carbs and very light :). is it just normal when you get older or am i totally ruined by the american beer culture?
