day after day, hour by hour, my heart grows for you. how do you do it? you're no longer here yet, i smile because of you. i feel a warmth, deep down to my soul, i feel whole, i think i'm falling for you. you let me fall, chose not to catch me, not to break my fall. you watched me fall, speaking only words that charmed my heart, breaking my defenses. fall i did, like a star from the sky, burning and breaking for you. fuck you too.
