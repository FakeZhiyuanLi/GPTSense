sorry all for not having updated this in a while. i know some of you have been eagerly anticipating the every word of my next post. especially you over there.yeah, i'm talking to you. the truth is i haven't been in the greatest of moods lately and for that reason have not felt like writing anything. couldn't exactly tell you the reason for my melancholy demeanor as of late.guess i've just been in those ruts that i seem to find myself in every now and again. anyway, i thought of the title for todays post while blasting memphis bleek this morning on the train. it describes my situation right now to the tee. got my mind right, moneys been right, and with the recent news about vegas being under terrorist watch only a week before my vacation there, i am now ready for war! if you think al qaida's gonna stop the kid from doing his thing down in sin city, you are sorely mistaken! bring it bitches! that's all for now.
