meh. almost $800 for a 60k tuneup (which is 13k overdue) and new front brakes on my sport trac. that's an entire paycheck! so now i am broke 3 days after payday. but then, what is $800 compared to the cost of getting into an accident (been there, done that. don't want the t-shirt.)? still need new rear tires, get a sensor replaced, get the axle thingie re-packed, and some other stuff which will run me another $600 or so. good thing i have a sugar mama!
