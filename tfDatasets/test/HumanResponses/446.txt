why are there not so many people running around named "enid" or "eunice" or "herbert" anymore? why is it that most females (and some males) are afraid of a teenie tiny little spider that isn't even poisonous? c'mon. you are at least 1 million times the size of them. squish it. and move on. does anyone else not have a microwave, but rather have a clock that occasionally cooks shit? does anyone else have amnesia and deja vu at the same time? has anyone else bought batteries, but they weren't included so they had to buy them again? and these are the thoughts that keep me up at night.
