i have this terrible terrible cold for three days now. on the first day it felt like i was goin to die. just like a wounded soldier behind enemy lines. there's not much that i can do. all of my body parts aint workin like they used to. and i am hatin this nose of mine right now. parang gripong sira tulo lang ng tulo! eewww! but i am feeling better now. tomorrow is a big day for me and that woman. yeah! im still thinkin what to give her though. ohh o-ohh o-oohh. hoo. yeah~
