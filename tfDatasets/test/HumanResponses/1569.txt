can i just say that i love launchcast radio? i just discovered it today (thanks to neemie). you get to design your own radio station. i've gotten everything from loreena mckennitt to rascal flats to a perfect circle all in the last half hour. i'm so damned pleased. i'll write about the invasion of the fake flowers after work.
