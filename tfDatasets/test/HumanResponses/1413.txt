sunday morning. together with my family we are packing up to go to pasir ris park for a picnic. not to forget my bestfriend "ibook" tag along with me. onced we reached there we enjoy the cool sea breeze and the sight was so fascinating. with a glance at the sea, your mind set to have peace from the weedays work pile. while my family having fun swimming and play along the beach, i sat at the bench with my bestfriend "ibook" to get done some inspiration for my game and magazine cover design. with the atmosphere by the beach, hearing the birds chirping, skies are blue, cool breeze really get your creative juice flow. after finished some of the idea worked, i spent the whole day fishing! guess what? i caught a 1.5kg "mangrove jack" too bad i forget to bring my camera!
