jibran riding his new johnny jump up. at first we wanted to get him a jumperoobut that one is huge and taking up so much spacethis one suits the need perfectly. he loves to jump up and down on the laps of whoever is holding himwhich is pretty tiring (although i can count it as an exercise for my arms:p) cause he seems to never get tired of that activity and plus he gets bigger and bigger everyday.
