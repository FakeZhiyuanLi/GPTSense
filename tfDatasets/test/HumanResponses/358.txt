everyone changes weither its good or bad, everyone goes through a dramitcic change. i change and i realized i don't like change. i lost all of my good friends over a stupid fight and now we want 2 kick each others ass. i also woke up a little, grew a little, i realized tht my life itsn't tht best barbie doll life around. i realized how family reall treat you, who are your true friends, and i must admit i still don't know how they are. the there are good thing tht come out of bad things: like i spent more time with katelyn than i do at my house and she got me 2 like the things she likes. like for instance; writting a journal. expressing my feelings, doing blogger, listening to dashboard confessionals (i love them now)and so many other things. i'm glad i'm in high school and so i can go meat new kids and make new friends i love you mike s. you helped me alot and i love you. good luck on baseball and i go to all of your games defintatley. peace noreen
