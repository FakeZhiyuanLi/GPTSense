my love for horror novels has spread over to mystery books. i never thought i'd be a fan of either, but ever since i was sexually assaulted in college, i've found that i am attracted to the darker side of humanity, the part that makes people tick. i think that's why i love horror novels and mystery books.i get to see a part of humanity that you can't find in, say, a romance novel. up next.book 10 in the janet evanovich stephanie plum series (whenever my copy comes in) and the book "alosha" by christopher pike. amazon emailed me to say that there's been a delay in the delivery of the pike book.i wonder why?
