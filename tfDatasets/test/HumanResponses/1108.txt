i look at people who walk down the street and question how they can remain so happy, so false, so faithful. i turn my gazes inward and see my friends and close ones and they are in "love". love shows me how much "god" hates us. there is no emotion so complicating, so crippiling, so completely maddening as love; people die for it, people beg for it, not realizing the bitter truth of it: love isn't tangible. i haven't experienced love as of yet, but i know better than anyone in the world that love isn't something that you can get from the tavern or your bestfriend, you have to have it within you at all times. it's there, you just need o find out where. but even if this is true, why am i so lost?
