crap. i ate ice cream tonight. i should not have. i have a bit 'o weight to loose and wish i had a bit more willpower. did good other wise today. i do not look terribly over weight, but i carry my weight everywhere and i am heavier than i look. i need to loose a good 50 pounds. 6'7" and 250lbs is a weight i can work with or at least move around with and not hurt my ankles just walking :-). 'bout got the back room in order and have a little den area established. quite happy with it actually. my wife even likes it. her desk gets "re-arranged" next :-). beautiful day here in portland. 81 degrees and blue sky. downtown was just beautiful to walk around in today. to bad i needed to take it easy on my achilles tendon and could not walk as much as i usually do. that's all folks.
