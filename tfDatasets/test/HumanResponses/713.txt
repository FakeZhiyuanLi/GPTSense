i am going to try to post a few random thoughts i have had over the last week every sunday. hopefully i'll do this at least twice in a row so i can call it a tradition. nothing says love like a restraining order on valentines day bush is a moron, there i said it, and i feel better for saying it vote zelman/rios in 2016, because america shouldn't have to settle for the lesser of two evils suburi flat out hurts the next day foamy is the true lord and master.
