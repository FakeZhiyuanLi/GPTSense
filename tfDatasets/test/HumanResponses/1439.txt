i just got a packet for the new private school i'm going to and the dress code is really strict. i mean, the girls can't wear pink! we can't have heavy make-up on or short skirts. i am actually reconsidering my choice. i guess i'll have to think some more. if you peeps have any comments about it or some advice, please let me know. love always, chloe
