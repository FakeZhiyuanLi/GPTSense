went for the bourne supremacy tonite with s and her friend. it was pretty good. besides, 007 and ethan hunt, james bourne is probably the next best spy. the movie is slickly made and has one of the best car chases i have seen in recent times. matt damon fits the role perfectly. overall, its worth the bucks i spent. want to watch collateral next. tomorrow my friend kapcy is coming down to clemson from columbus, ohio for this weekend. i am sure it will be a cool reunion. looking forward to it .
