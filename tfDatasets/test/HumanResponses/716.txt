how is lupus treated? the type of treatment a person has depends on how severe the lupus is and what parts of her body are affected. people with sle take some kind of medicine to control their lupus.people whose joints hurt often take acetaminophen (like tylenol), ibuprofen (like advil), or aspirin to help with the pain. antimalarial (say: an-tie-mah-lair-ee-ul) drugs to help treat skin rashes and joint pain. (antimalarial drugs are ususally used to treat the disease malaria, but some have also been found to work against lupus.) some people take steroids, which are medications that help fight fatigue and fever and some of the other symptoms of lupus. for other people with more severe lupus that affects their kidneys or other organs, there are immunosuppressive (say: ih-myoo-no-suh-pre-siv) drugs. these drugs help hold back the activity of the immune system. they are very strong, though, and are used only when it's really necessary.
