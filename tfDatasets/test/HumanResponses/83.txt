so i don't think anyone will be reading this.but i guess i've finally jumped on the blogging band wagon haha, i don't have much of.well let's be honestanything to say. so whether you know me or not, prepare to be bored out of your mind.and maybe even slightly annoyed? cuz i'm thinking this blog will be a good outlet for bitching. and a whole lot of it. so. to get the ball rolling, now is possibly the worst time for me to start a blog but procrastination will do a lot for a personoh and by the way, this week has been like purgatory. definitely the hardest, longest, worst week of my academic career. but luckily it will all be over soon! (no i'm not suicidal, don't worry.) summer is in 8 days.wooo
