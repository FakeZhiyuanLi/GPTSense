my sister is such a spaz. she comes home from softball after losin and she's all upset. she opens the screen door and then it shuts on her finger and she starts cryin like she lost her hand. then i give her some ice and my mom takes a look at it and goes "well it hurts because its cut." cue rediculously louder crying. rofl
