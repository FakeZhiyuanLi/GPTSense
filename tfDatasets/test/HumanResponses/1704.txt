well i got up this morning and i decided to have some breakfast like every other normal person. so i get up and i sit in the over sized chair in the den. i pet the animals make sure there all ok. then i get up go to the kitchen and cook some eggs. so after i cook the eggs i go to the dinning room table and eat my eggs. after that i go rinse off my plate and go to the den and try to watch tv. guess what the tv has been turned off. nice huh what i'm i going to do all day. there isn't anything ealse to do. i don't know what i should do. online isn't that much interesting any more. all there is to do is update my journals and then chat with some people and look to see that warped tour tickets are still there. it's all the same everyday i do this at least 3 times a day. i don't know why. i should just search for dumb shit. but i really don't want to. oh well i guess i need to go see what i could do today. well see ya later
