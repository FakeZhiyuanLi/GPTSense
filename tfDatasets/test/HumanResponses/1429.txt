i think i did just kick my own ass for even thinking about being depressed. but then i realized, i wasnt depressed. i was just thinking and worrying too damn much. and about what? my own stupid mistakes. stuff i never shoulda let happen. thankfully i didnt let things get worse than they did. im gonna stay focused on one. one. ill kick my ass if i ever let things happen how they did again. so i guess i just went through a transitional period. a moment of massive thinking. and yes, i realized all this when in a car ride while listening to guilty gear. good music neh? andy is stickin to his goal. and aint no one gonna interfere. fuck depression. i aint got no time for that shit.
