two days until my license! yes! oh, and it's **censored name**'s birthday today. i already sent her an e-mail wishing her a happy 16th. i think she's still a little mad at me, which is upsetting. **censored name**'s a great friend, i really hope she appreciates the e-mail within the first hour of her b-day. i wanna go visit her when i get my license, so we have to be on good terms again. anyway, that's all for now. signing off, m.
