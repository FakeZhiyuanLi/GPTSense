i got mine yesterday. a friend of mine sent me an invite and i accepted it. my first impressions have been mixed - infinite storage (1gb actually), super fast, many options - search, labels, shortcuts, etc but on the same count it is a beta product and so not always stable, deleting mail is a laborious process, they use frames and ask any web programmer - frames are evil! but overall i am excited and i now have some bragging rights over my friends.
