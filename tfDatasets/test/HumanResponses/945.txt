well for the most part it was. i started the day feeling a tad sick, but for the most part i got over that. i just hope tomorrow i don't feel like this. so yeah one of my best friends is getting jaw surgery(bad) but gets to skip exams to do so(good). so today we had a little shindig to wish her well. i got my tickle on if i do say so myself. we watched some samurai jack cause we're uber-cool. after that i started reading fight club because its a kick ass wicked movie and i wanted to see the book it was noveled after. 1 week until i have blue hair. it's gonna rock my socks off. ooh and anthony kiedis is releasing his autobiography soon. that'll be a gem to read. so today had a rocking swing to it. bye my non-existent as of yet readers. -happy gavin
