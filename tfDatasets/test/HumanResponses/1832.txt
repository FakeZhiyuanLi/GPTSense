last night i was looking up at going steady shirts and i was pleased with what i found. no clue how to buy them though, so i just kinda emailed it to my host sister to figure out (i feel kinda guilty about that one). oh yeah, please forgive this obsession phase. i work tonight, it seems. we're moving! not farjust a few miles thata' way, but nevertheless it's a new house, and a new neighborhood. i will really miss my neighbors :( things are in boxes all over the place. we have to be out by friday- actually i have to go carry some things from the neighbors garages here right now. maybe i'll see you at work
