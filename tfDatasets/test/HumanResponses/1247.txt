saw "the bourne supremacy" tonight. i'd give it a solid 3 stars. matt damon continues to impress in his most "meaty" role to date as jason bourne; half lost soul, half trained killer. damon does an excellent job of balancing the duality of his character and the stresses it places on bourne's psyche. joan allen gives a good supporting performance as a cia director who is hunting bourne. without giving away any major plot points, the bourne supremacy features a soild cast, good plotting, great action scenes (especially a tunnel chase sequence near the end of the film), great locations (berlin, moscow, india) and just enough character advancement to keep me entertained and engaged throughout. well worth the full ride fare to see it in theaters. and that's the bottom line
