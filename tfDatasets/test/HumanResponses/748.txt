my wife and i went out to my buddy's ranch today. the dog thought he was in heaven. it was definitely the biggest back-yard he's ever seen. anyway, the tanks(people outside of texas call them 'ponds') are full and i caught a nice size bass. i'm either doing something wrong or the fish just weren't biting today. all that matters is that we had a good time.
