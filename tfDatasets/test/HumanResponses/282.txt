the time now is 4:46am according to the digital clock that i can see at the lower right of my screen. you might be asking me why the heck am i awake at this moment in time? well to tell you honestly, i could not sleep. what could be the reason for this? i just had my upcat test and now i should feel relaxed. because it’s over. but no, there’s still another reason why i can’t sleep. my sub-conscious mind tells me to go online and check out my dear friend’s blogspot. i always think about this friend. maybe she's the reason i could not sleep. and indeed it was so timely that i saw what i needed to see.
