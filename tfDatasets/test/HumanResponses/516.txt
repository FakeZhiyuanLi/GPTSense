my left arm feels absolutely numb cuz my doctor drew ridiculously a lot of blood out of my vein. (6 tubes!) watch me, i'm starting a brand new life, enjoying the present time, not retreating into the past. because in the end, you only realize you've wasted your best years suffering and hoping for something that is not even worthwhile.
