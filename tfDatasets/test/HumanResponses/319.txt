.the shine of my potential, such a strange illumination, a world now opens up to me, through my imagination. i’m ready to face the world. i have heard some news of a big case my uncle wants to take that’s across seas. i want this. it will be difficult to track this guy down, but it shouldn’t be too difficult for a professional like me, right? there is danger in capturing this guy, but the reward is very… tempting. i’ve got word that this man is an escapee from some prison in india, but that’s all i know for now. i should get more details later. this is my fantasy world… i’ll make the best of it. "imagination is more important than knowledge." -albert einstein
