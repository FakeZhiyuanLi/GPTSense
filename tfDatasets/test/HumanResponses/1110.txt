.the novelty wore off after a couple of weeks. i've seen her wandering around the neighborhood in her nightgown and yelling at people who drive by. once i got stopped by her when i came home from work. she grabbed ahold of my hand and wouldn't let go. i had to pry her off finger by finger. the other day i brought a balloon home from work and threw it out with the trash when it got flat. the next morning, i saw it hanging from her railing. who digs through the dumpster and opens trash bags for a balloon? i know it was my balloon, too, because it was a specially made blue and yellow one. about a week ago, we went to the neighborhood bar for a drink. kay was there, carrying around a squeaky dog toy. i think she thought she was pretty hot shit, too, because she was hanging all over a couple of guys there and squeaking the toy in their faces. eventually, the bartender cut her off and she ended up hooking up with some young drunk kid. she never came home that night.
