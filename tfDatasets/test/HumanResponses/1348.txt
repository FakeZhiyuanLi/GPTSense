i absolutely, positively, certainly, cannot stand working. i hate it the most when i have to work on a school night and drag myself out of bed the next morning to go to school. i get off of school go to practice an than home to do whatever homework i can do before i have to go to work, everything i don't finish i have to do when i get home at 11:00 or later. the thing that gets me is a lot of peope do this and we all do for minimum or slightly higher wages. we all complain about it and we often come to school looking like zombies because of the lack of sleep. than there are the privilaged few who decide that they can only work on weekends making us who can't afford to only work on weekends have to work more hours. i guess thats the way the cookie crumbles. ~cartoon~ the cartoon means that if you are not careful while riding a.t.vs or other motor vehicles yoou could end up dead.
