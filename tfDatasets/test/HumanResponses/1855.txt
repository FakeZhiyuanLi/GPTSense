well, my girlfriend came over today. we watched mooseport something or other, i didn't really catch the title. i really didn't actually watch any of the movie well, i'm trying to fix her computer, but it's beginning to look _-*bad*-_ and i don't know if i can handle it. reformatting sounds goodbut drivers are nowhere to be found.kind of scares me. but anyhow.we went inside to watch the movie, and i ended up giving her a back and foot massage, which was fine. i thoroughly enjoy the time we spend together. it makes me happy that she cares about me. well it's late, i'd better be heading off to the dreamworld. closed eyelids are an open portal.
