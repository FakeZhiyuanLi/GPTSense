plans are all seet for the house of shaman hot august delights weekend gathering in late august. it will be wonderful to see all our extended lifestyle family again and play! i also look forward to meeting those that are looking to be considered for personal service to myself and/or the household.in the meantime, we secure the lease later today for the new facilities. i've been packing up all the goodies to build out a lavish asian-themed fantasy chamber in the main room and something more polynesian-themed in the front reception area. the articulating cross and suspension temple will definitely be moved there, as well as several bondage tables, spanking benches, and cages. i've found a carpenter to build out a large costume/fashion wardrobe/costume armoir for the area next to the lavatory and a full-on makeup station will be easy to add. so much potential and so much more can fit into this facility. what's a goddess to do but shop!
