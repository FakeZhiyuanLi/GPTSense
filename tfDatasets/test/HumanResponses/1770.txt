of people. friends, being so weird. net friends, they give you the impression that they're depressed. you ask them what's up and they answer with "ok." like hmm okay let's stop this convo here cos i have a feeling that you're going to rip my head right off and chuck it into the drain. or eat it. put me in their position and i've be overjoyed. she's meeting her idols at the end of the month, the second time in three months. she has some problems at home but she won't tell me about them. she'll disappear offline without saying goodbye. it confuses me and makes me think, cos i've been there for her so much but she's pushing me away. no, not pushing me out, pushing me away. yet she'll sign on later and be fine, and take interest this time in what i'm doing and how i am. or maybe she won't bother, she wouldn't be the first.
