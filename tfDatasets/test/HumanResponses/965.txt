i am going to see m. night shamylan's ' the village' tonight. i am nearing excitement. i think i'm about two steps from excitement. i think that at the moment i am 'greatly interested'. i am confident that i will soon pass greatly interested, zoom through 'incredibly interested', hop past 'looking forward to with happiness', and arrive safely at excited with in the hour. i am concerened about the scary factor though. i really am scared that i will scream or make a fool out of myself in some other fashion in front of my friends. however if i do i will pretend it wasn't me, ignore them for the rest of the night then purge my brain of the memory. -driel
