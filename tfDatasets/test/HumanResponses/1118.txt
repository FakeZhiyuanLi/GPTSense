i'm ending today with a grand total of 152 inches. add that to my whopping total of 0 inches from yesterday and that still leaves me at. 152 inches! at least i was able to scan and post everything. better than nothing, and i've got some new ideas. i can feel a definite shift in my attitude after one day spent working on more art, so this is definitely a good thing.
