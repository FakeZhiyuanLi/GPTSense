she finally got me the address of one of my fraternity brothers, who is a marine serving in iraq. every day i get a chill like ice running down my spine when i hear about marines getting killed. my thoughts and prayers go out to everyone who has lost a friend or loved one in this war. i know that, misguided as our leadership might be the men and women in uniform are doing a good thing. if there is the slightest possibility of bringing the freedom that we enjoy to another country, one which does suffer then we should do it. this is not to say we should invade anyone we dont like, but an unjust nation, like iraq, or iran, where the leader holds power by fear of force rather than the consent of the governed should be offered all the help we can muster. on a lighter note, what the hell else can happen to my dolphins (note: god this is a rhetorical question, please do not answer!)
