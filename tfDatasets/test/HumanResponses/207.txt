so, this weekend at the worst job in america truly sucked! i have endured about all of the abuse and putdowns and humiliation that i can possibly stand. i am supposed to be there right now,by the way. he-he! i took the day off to go on interviews instead. god, i hate that place! i don't think i can go back there, i truly don't. so anyway, my interview today went really well. i now have to go on a third interview. can you believe it? supposedly, this process will eventually end, and they will either hire me or not, but this is driving me insane! i found another job that looks promising, but i can't seem to get my email through. grrr! the level of frustration here is unbelievable! i have issues! that is all.
