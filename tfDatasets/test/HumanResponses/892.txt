today, i discovered that several people that sit around me in my class enjoy muttering to themselves the answer they thought was right as the professor asks a question. this nearly always turns out to be incorrect and they mutter "oh yeah." and nod their heads as if they really got it. see diagram a (a real picture). it turns out i am surrounded by idiots who can't seem to find any other way to keep themselves sane through the class than to mutter wrong answers. i assume they think it makes them seem smarter, when it really has the opposite effect. the guy behind me is indian and the only thing stopping me from going off on him is that i want him to do a "you kick my dog" impression. :p diagram a:
