well, i'm tired from work today. it can do it to you! since my job coach accidentaly forgot my order,so my meal wasn't ordered and made- so i was starving all through work. oh well,lesson learned. i went to mcdonald's with my mom after work, they screwed up my order, and got it right after a few times(stupid!). and i took a shower, played harvest moon: a wonderful life(which is, by the way, the best game ever.). the internet was down,until now.i'm glad the internet's backdon't know what i'd do without itsigning off,your friend rachel h.
