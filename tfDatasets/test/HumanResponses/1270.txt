i know i'm not alone. at least a third of my friends can still be found awake at this hour. but why is it none of us ever seem to be able to fall asleep? i lay down, and my mind just doesn't shut up. but come morning, waking up is as big a chore as going to sleep was. ok.so i know it's because i'm thinking too much. what am i thinking about? everything from how little summer is left, to what i'm going to do with the rest of my life. it all manages to cross my mind this late at night. i don't know. i guess this is just a teenagers way of making the last few weeks of summer last as long as humanly possible.
