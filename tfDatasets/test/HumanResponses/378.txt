well. i got the comment thing up so now you can all tell me how crazy i am :p . i'm busy working on another website at the moment. though this one is actually turning out to be a pretty good site. i finally got my game finished and once i have finished this site i'll be working on my next game. hopefully coldstone will be updated soon so i can get rid of the last few bugs in my game. on the music side of things, i have managed to get my ipod working again though it does still go weird sometimes. my music collection has grown to a healthy 375 songs and is still growing. the soon the itms comes to the uk the better :) hope you are bored now. good. now sod off and let me get back to work :d
