i voted on in the eu elections thursday to get that done. on friday i went to oslo, and partied two nights in a row. that was nice, but the airport train in oslo broke down and i was a full two hours late. what a nightmare. i even considered setting the train on fire: then, at least, the fire brigade would've gotten us out. the weekend was superb, though!
