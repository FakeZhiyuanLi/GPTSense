what do i name my main character, i know you might be like just pick a name but it has to have meaning, it has to serve a purpose, i mean come on if harry potters name was chris o'hare, i don't think it would have the same catch. i was thinking jason sword, but i can't use that, too much like jason bourne. can't use alex.sigh.name name name.krystal sword, krys sword.hmmm.i didn't say it had to be a guy, and if you find a girls name that mirrors a guys name she can use that to her advantage. sword for a last name might not be the best.cummings bj cummings.haha okay mind went straight to the gutter. i'll work on the name things. now plot.in a galaxy far far away.haha yeah that's not copyrighted. sigh, alternate universes. or a future that now one has predicted yet. okay i need to work on it all haha. okay i need my sleep more to come.yeah i know i'm not getting far.
