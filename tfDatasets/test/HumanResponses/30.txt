i'm pissed. first of all, my main blog has been forsaken by the old server and a friend of mine. she has taken a new server and left me in the dark with some sixty blog entries floating around in space with no backup. here i am using a backup blog to vent on something that i should be using the blog that all my friends read for. pisser. and not to mention that some questionnaire got published twice on my blog and i have deleted and deleted and to no avail. the questionnaire is still on my blog. twice. every freaking time. okay. venting over off to find new main blog.
