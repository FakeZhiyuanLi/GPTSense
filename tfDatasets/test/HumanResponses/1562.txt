i hate being sick. especially in the summer. being sick in the summer is like. going to school on a saturday. so basically the last 24 hours of my life have been spent with karly as we moped around and complained about how sick we are. we also cooked. which is probably not a good idea because all of our germs are probably lurking around in the food. we made these lemon cookies which turned out excellent and attempted to make kettle corn. bad bad bad idea. who knew that sugar burned when you put it on the hot stove?! we obviously didnt and you can pretty much guess what happened. well now im off to be depressed and contaminate another box of kleenexs. but dont feel sorry for me as im sure you have your own problems.
