i work so much that i almost forgot what life was meant to be, enjoyed. so i have decided that i am going to extend my trip so that i can visit countries such as croatia, germany, spain(again) and portugal. i've always felt so rushed to go through western europe, and i've never had longer than three and a half weeks, so depending on my budget, i will try to go for over a month. i know that work is expecting me back at a certain time, i only gave a tentative verbal estimated date, and work will still be there when i get back. i mean, there will always be work for me when i get back. also, i will be working on this trip, writing away around europe. it's work to live, not the other way around.
