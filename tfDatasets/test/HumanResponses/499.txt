there's someone special in my life for the past 3 years, who doesn't know i care. i longed to let her know, yet let it show, i wouldn't dare. whoever thought i'd feel this way? for i never thought i'd care. but there's something in that smile of her, that makes me stop and stare. i saw her pass by me today. yet, she hadn't acknowledged my existence. and all i did, was pray our eyes would meet again. every smile of her, shines like a mirror, and is reflected into my heart. tonight, as i gently close my eyes, and flip through the pages of my mind. i recall only her face, only that familiar smile that kills me, for if i had to take stock, of all my wordly treasures, just that few smiles from her, would be my most cherished possessions! pk
