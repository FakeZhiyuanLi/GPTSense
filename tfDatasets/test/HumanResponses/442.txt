ok so i started my new job today and it looks like it's gonna be tough work. i am definitely looking forward to it though, instead of a mindless office job where i sit behind a computer and watch my ass get fatter than it already is. i went out and saw a movie today cuz i just wanted to get out of the house (away from my visiting parents. i needed some alone time i guess you can say). i saw alien vs. predator again. its a cool movie, but if you saw freddy vs. jason, you will see the ending from a mile away. don't worry i won't ruin it for anyone. it is still a cool movie though. hopefully i will get to go see more movies soon with the new job paying much better than the other one. anyways i kinda tired so i am out for the night.
