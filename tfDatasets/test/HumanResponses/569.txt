hello children i'm bored as hell today. i've done nothing. i walked to my friend lisa's house last night and had a talk with her, haven't seen her in ages. this was just after i stormed out the house because my mum and her boyfriend jimmy were being cocks. so anyway, that's all i've been up to really. 6 days till i go to reading and get my gcse results too. uh oh. jack
