i just want to take a minute to kick this site off. it's now 1:26am on tuesday, but yesterday was the 2-week mark in our countdown to leave for yav orientation in chicago. i still have so much packing an preparing to do i didn't get any reading done today like i meant to, so i'll have to do twice the work tomorrow. i now have 2 of the 5 books read though, so 3 to go! i've got most everything i need too. except maybe another skirt. i just can't wait! every day i'm learning something new and thinking about how i can apply it. well, i'd like to thank you all for your support and prayers. please keep all of the yavs in your prayers this year! thanks so much! lindsey
