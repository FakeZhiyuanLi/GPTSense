iron maiden is great metal but not heavy metal, more like peaceful metal. the best music is symphonic dark/black metal in my opinion because it mixes up classical music and metal, making an ideal contrast which expresses itself via both agressive and gental persuasion. this makes symphonic dark metal the ideal music, which makes a true contrast with the repetetive rap which don't really have a melody, and techno which is a little too repetitive. rock is ok, just a bit too friendly for my liking.
