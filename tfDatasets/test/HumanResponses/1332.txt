today was just like any other day, received several calls from amber in the morning, i don’t want to answer her calls. last night she pissed me off, acting like me talking to another girl was like cheating on her. screw this crap, i really don’t know what i'm doing anymore. it’s starting to piss me off. she wont leave me alone and i don’t have the heart to tell her i don’t want to talk to her. i miss tammie like nuts, why won’t she just tell me to leave amber, and move in and be with me. god i can’t take this anymore, i need tammie so bad….i love her. i’m talking to amber as i write this, i cant stand her yet i can’t tell her, i just wish god would give me a sign, tell me wither or not i should wait for tammie, and give me the strength to tell amber. if only i could see the future. i’m going go to bed, and try to get amber to hang up, until tomorrow, l8ter
