so i tried to make some soap tonight for the first time. here's all the ingredients i used: 22 ozs. olive oil 11 ozs. corn oil 11 ozs. vegetable oil 22 ozs. shortening 1 1/2 cup cucumber and avacado 25 ozs. water 8.5 ozs. lye i stirred itfor about 30-40 minutes but it seemed a bit runny, but i'll have to wait and see what it looks like tomorrow. i hope this works out, i'm having difficulty finding recipes so i'm doing the best i can at math and making up my own.
