bugger. gemma just came to my door, accompanied by sir jerermy of tosspot, and his townie twat of a mate scott. so anyway, i was going to give her the letter, but i chickened out, i just looked at her and thought 'i can't risk losing her as a friend'. fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. i'm annoyed to hell now. i'll see her tomorrow though, so i'll give her it then hopefully. :( jack
