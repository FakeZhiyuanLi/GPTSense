today mum called me after school to tell me that her car tire got punctured.her car was stopped near a bus stop opposite from nus along clementithis was after she picked my brother up.anyway, i immediately rushed down to where she was in a cab from school.and when i got there, there was this newly hired assistant teacher from hong an's school changing the tire.so she didn't have to call the 'lexus-help-people' and wait an hour for them to come, and pay $50 just so that they can tow it awayexcluding tire replacement costs.thats why it is truly amazing who god sends to helps us when we in a time of need =d
