there are three types of lupus: systemic lupus erythematosus (say: sis-teh-mik lew-pus er-eh-thee-muh-toh-sis) is also called sle and is the type that most people mean when they talk about lupus. it's the most serious form of lupus. sle can affect the skin, joints, tendons, and other body organs like the brain, heart, lungs, and kidneys. discoid lupus (say: dis-koid lew-pus) is a skin disease that causes a rash on the face, neck, scalp, and ears. it's a much rarer form of lupus than sle. it doesn't affect organs the way sle can, but the rash can leave scars. drug-induced lupus is caused by a reaction to some kinds of medicines. drug-induced lupus affects the body in the same way that sle does. once a person stops taking the medication, the symptoms often go away.
