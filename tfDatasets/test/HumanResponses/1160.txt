music sunday. i sang my heart out! sounded pretty good, too. monday is the day. supposedly, we're meeting with the owners of the 100 center. i am a little nervous. we haven't heard from bill hunt yet about what time we are to meet. we started this show back in early april. i don't think i have ever heard of anyone having this much problem getting a lease signed. i swear, if they turn us down, i'm hitting them with discrimination. i hope bill is right and they put the building up for sale. on another subject completely, i have got to get this weight off. i weighed in at 272 this morning. i have never weighed that much! i'm trying some new tactics, just see if they work. off to get the kiddle ready for bed. oh, yeah, president reagan died yesterday. he did a lot of good. not great stuff for the glbt community or for aids, but good stuff world wide. better news tomorrow, i hope. good night.
