yesterday, two people have called me crazy. one because i was eating a raw carrot while walking around in town. the other one because i said i always take a shower with my plant. admittedly, these actions could appear somewhat awkward, but to me it's just plain everyday normality. it's not like i'm some poor crazy sod prophetizing we should return to the jungle.
