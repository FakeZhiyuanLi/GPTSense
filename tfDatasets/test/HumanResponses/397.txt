three things about taking the go train home. one: make sure to check the time of the train. (i was waiting at union for over an hour haha fabulous.) two: make sure you buy the right ticket and are prepared to talk your way out of a 110 ticket three: make sure you dont have to take the bus home.too many high school memories flooding back loved thurs in to. loved new boys to look at. loved new boys to dance with. i love boys. but loved hanging out with the girls even more. were fun. hahaha.need to work on the late night pizza hours. im spending this week in courtice (ange and meg i will call you) and im off to calgary june 1st until the 8th. but ill talk to all of you before then! xo linz
