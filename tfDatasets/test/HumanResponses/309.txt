so yea this weekend has been awesome. caleb came back to calgary and had a hotel party that me and ryan and sarah were going to go to but then me and ryan ended up having a fight so only sarah went. but thats okay because we made up. i didn't even see caleb the whole time he was here lol oh well. but yea and lynsey and jason did some coke with me and ryan but it was so annoying because lynsey would not stop talking! ah! i wanted to die! lol shiet. but yea anyways i don't really have much else to say except its ryans birthday on wednesday! i can't really buy him a present. but i'll buy him booze and i burnt him a bunch of cd's. shiet i can't believe he's gonna be 22! oh well
