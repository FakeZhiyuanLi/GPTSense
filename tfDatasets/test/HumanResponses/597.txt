ok, so the jayhawks fell. and duke won. sunday was an absolute drag in the realm of sports. but, on a brighter note, the baseball season is just around the corner. despite the efforts of bud selig, baseball is still alive. the tigers actually used their offseason to improve their team. i'm not saying they're going to win the division or anything, but they should lose less than 100 games this year  a marked improvement.
