this is the break in the bend, this is the closest of calls. this is the reason you're alone, this is the rise and fall. if it makes you less sad, i will die by your hand, i hope you find out what you want, i already know what i am. "now i believe that lovers should be draped in flowers and laid entwined together on a bed of clover and left there to sleep, left there to dream of their happiness." - conor oberst
