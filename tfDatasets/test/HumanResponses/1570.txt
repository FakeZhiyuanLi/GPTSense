so i know this is extremely . well, we can say ironic. or just hypocritical. let's just say i'm providing an example of what i am describing as i am describing it. i've been reading so many blogs lately and feeling so extremely overwhelmed with stumbling through other people's jumbled ramblings, it feels like there are way too many voices intruding in my head. shut up! i'm not crazy (debateable, of course). just the blogs don't edit. and so in that tradition, i will not edit this. hah. (no, i am not drunk. all i had to drink tonight is water. tyler, becky, yoshie, and jasmine can all testify to that.)
