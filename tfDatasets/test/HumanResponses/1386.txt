03132k4 nth cain late night dew drops form on petals waiting to bloom day break and still wide awake lying face up on my room torn apart but standing, hoping to be whole again scared to act and be known—wonderin’ if i really can. it rushed through so suddenly but i felt every inch of pain gush of blood, tear in my heart seem to be the nth cain. deeply hurt though the feeling is shallow coz my actions are limited, just bound to follow. early morning dew drops lay on petals waiting to bloom dusk of night just thinking of a way out of this doom. don’t rush to be complete coz time is a hard thing to meet. there is o reason to be so hasty coz everything is planned in my own destiny.
