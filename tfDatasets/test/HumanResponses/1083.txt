ok, so i hear you're supposed to have a blog. and now i do. how does this change my life? will i become addicted to keeping it up-to-date, or will i forget about it in a week? time will tell, i suppose. i also have to think about what to do with it. should i just write random ramblings, or is there some sort of concept that appeals to me? head hurting. i need a break.
