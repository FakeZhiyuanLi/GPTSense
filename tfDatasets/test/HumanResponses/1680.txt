so, i've basically spent the weekend catching up on all my lost sleep and doing absolutely nothing. unfortunately, the world goes on without me so today is chore day for me! goody. >_> hopefully i'll have time to either go mini-golfing or see collateral. speaking of which, that movie looks freakin' awesome. i love intelligent thrillers and badarses so it looks to be a great flick. some of my friends confirm this, so i have to see it! ^_^ gah.i still have some homework to catch up on, and then that stupid collage, but i just want to kick back! it's not fair i mean, i know it's just the first week and all, but i seriously dislike (not hate =p) north springs. i mean, you know there's a problem when your only new friend is a teacher! xd oh well, back to work so i can finish this stuff in time to do something! later
