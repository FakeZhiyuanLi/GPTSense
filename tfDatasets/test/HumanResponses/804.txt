irk: grading, grading, grading. delight: being finished with grading. irk: typing. irk: browswer suddenly quitting after i had just typed a long blog entry without having saved it. (i know, i know. there are many ways around this.) irk: trying to remember html tags when i haven't published a web page using anything but dreamweaver's wysiwyg interface in years. delight: four guilt-free days of post-semester decompression spent doing little or nothing productive. delight: sleeping more than four hours a night. (although i admit that my body has become so accustomed to the short shift that i actually feel better with less sleep than more.) delight: discovering that netscape for mac supports wysiwyg blogging, so i don't have to remember those html tags for formatting, linking and inserting pictures. this means i'll be more likely than not get on with my blogging pursuits. but i think i'll take a nap first.
