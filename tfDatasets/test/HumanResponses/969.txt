hi there, my name as you can see, is brock. i've been looking everywhere for a place for me to express myself, thank you blogger.com. i'm starting this school year as a junior, just turned sixteen, not looking for a girlfriend, because i've found one.she doesn't know it yet though.well, i guess i'll create a profile now.if you want to know more about me, head there. ps, this is what part of the alphabet would look like if q and r were eliminated.
