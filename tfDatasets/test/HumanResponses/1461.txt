tommorow the satelite company guys are coming to install the satelite tv. this will increase the channels of mindless crap to 126. still bored out of my mind, nothing much to do. oh ya, anne frank's diary is just the same old crap over and over. she's annoying, i get it. i still can't believe we got an assignment over summer, but i guess its better than sitting around doing nothing. life is crap!
