as some of you might have known i had an interview with dierburgs and it went really well. but today i got a letter from them saying thanks but no thanks. i guess its back to job hunting for me. this really sucks i was so ready and i really needed it too. totally of subject here but would those stupid telemarketers (no clue how to spell) please stop calling us, were on the no call list thingy. later
