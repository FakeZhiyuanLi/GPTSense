i was informed recently of a group in new zealand, rallying against the government in what they believe to be 'immoral decisions'. let's begin by saying that the new zealand government, is the most democratic government in the world- they have referendums! it is these referendums that this group is fighting against. now, i call myself a christian, but so do the members of this group. i will not be associated with such a fascist group of political neophytes with objective ethics that scream "truth" and shut down any whimper of tolerance. hypocrites.
