i am the last person that should be doing this type of thing. but this is me. my name is quentin arnold. i live in the middle of nowhere. but it could be worse. i have recently found a treasure that i will cherish for a long time. it is, without a doubt, the most beautiful thing i have come across in my lifetime. my only wish is, for the people that read this, to find something like it. i like to think i have soul and passion. you will find out later that having a soul and having soul are two different things. it's hard to list all of my attributes in one post so you'll have to figure me out along the way. although their is one type of person i can't stand, and that is a hypocrite. these type of people frustrate me soo much! hearing or seeing a person like this boils my blood. but i forgive and forget.
