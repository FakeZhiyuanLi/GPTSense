after typing fan fiction and grammar into google, i started thinking. i've been reading for so long, and i just read that readers make the best writers so why don't i write something. first thing that comes to mind is what do i write? do i start with an original story or do i try my hand at fan fiction? i guess inspiration will come to me.
