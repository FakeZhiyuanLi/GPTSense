who in their right mind would marry bs? she acts, looks, and just is.well.trampy. i'm sorry but it's true. even though she knows kids watch and try to mimitate her, she still wears pretty much no clothes. and her latest videos have been pretty sick. all i know is if i had a kid, i wouldn't let him or her even have a bs cd! that's my point of view. don't like it comment, please comment, i don't even have one measly comment but thanks for at least looking at my site! pro-life rocks. god bless. **stef**
