alone, i climb up molehills of life daring, caring making them mountains i climb alone alone, i roll down hills of life laying, playing enjoying the pain i roll alone alone, i wander through desserts of life questing, jesting with my mirrage i wander alone alone, i drown in waters of life teeming, streaming all with the flow i drown alone alone, i am throughout this life living, giving all of my self i am alone
