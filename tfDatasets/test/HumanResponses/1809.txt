i know its been a while, but i am back. the new comp is running great, but needs more cooling. i have found some products from zalman that i am gonna use. my scores have gotten significantly better, now i'm up in the 20's constantly. i am going to try to join a clan. i like dbd and a few others. all in all it has just been way too busy at work and home to play too much, and with the advent of getting star wars: galaxies i have had little time for my fps habit. well i gotta get back to the fragging fields, write more later.
