woot home from texas. fun time. i drove a scooter into a couch then nocked a table with a plant over. i didn't even get in trouble. however kirk got in lots of trouble all the time. for not doing much at all. the rodeo we went to was fun, they were very mean to the animals and yeah. six flags was cool. (the blog dates are wrong had to remake the blog. so i posted the actual dates for the topic.)
