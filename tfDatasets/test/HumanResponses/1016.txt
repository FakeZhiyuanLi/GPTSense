tattoos, hot with all kinds of ts, talking to amie, break-ups, napoleon dynamite, serious flashbacks, lots of boxes and books, the last day of work, getting ready for school, howard dean, almost crying, playing dominoes, disappointing some people, making inroads with others, imagining alternatives, seeking to make amends, thinking too much, doing too little, and finally looking for more. happy friday, welcome autumn.
