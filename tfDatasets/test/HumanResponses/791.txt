i dream at night i dream of you i can't stand it your all i think about sometimes i want to die the pain in my heart is all your fault theres nothing i can do about it i close my eyes and your there but how can i hate you i love you so i shall never not your my safety blanket but still i will not risk not being near my one and only love
