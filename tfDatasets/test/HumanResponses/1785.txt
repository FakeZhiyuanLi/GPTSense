just posted my first entry and surfed about to see what other people write about. now i am slightly embarassed for bitching on the internet in the manner of an angst-ridden teenager. (not that there's anything wrong with being a pissed off teenaged who likes to say "fuck" a lot. by all means, be my guest.) seems like everyone else in my situation is sleeping or screwing or tending to a howling infant at present. makes me feel like a bit of a loser. i could entertain myself by describing one of the sanctimonious do-gooder assholes that drives me crazy on a regular basis.or i could lay in bed and read the 9/11 report. eh, i'm going to bed. g'night digital world.
