so i rented bubble boy today. it is absolutely hilarious! it has this stupid comedy that made me laugh really hard. and, another good thing about this movie is jake! he was so cute. i went around town to try and find this movie, but luckily i finally went to blockbuster and rented it. i'm definetely going to buy this. i also bought the day after tomorrow soundtrack. i haven't listened to all of it, but the songs i have listened to are really good. kinda remind me of the movie.lol. tomorrow evening i leave to go to my aunts wedding. so i won't be updating as much as i would like.
