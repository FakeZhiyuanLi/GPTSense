do i dare disturb the universe? in a minute there is time for decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse. for i have known them all already, known them all  have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons, i have measured out my life with coffee spoons; i know the voices dying with a dying fall beneath the music from a farther room. so how should i presume? we have lingered in the chambers of the sea by sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown till human voices wake us, and we drown.
