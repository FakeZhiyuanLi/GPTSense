for amber's benefit, i do not think the kid at work is cute, anymore i was having a lonely day. but, there is a very attractive man coming into town this weekend to see me. so, i'm not feeling quite so desperate. i am very excited that natalie is bringing her new boyfriend, and i am also very excited that billy wayne is coming to see me. natalie said he was actually gushing about me after he met me this past weekend. he loves that i'm opinionated and aggressive (fucking a), he thinks i'm soooo hot (thank god for the blind), and he's already called me to tell me how excited he is about coming in and hanging out with me. wow i may actually make out with someone for the first time in lots of months. super. that is all for today. no more desperate michelle!
