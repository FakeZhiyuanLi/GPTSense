man will this rain ever stop. two days straight now, it has been raining. pittsburgh must be a swamp, by now. wwe raw was a good show last night. my first wrestling show live. the battle royal was really cool, the triple h/chris benoit 60 minute iron man match was spectacular. the highlight of the evening however. the flair flop yes. i have finally seen ric flair get the shit kicked out of him. pause in the corner. walk forward. stagger a little and fall forward flat on his face. in person! my life is complete. hot crowd, great action, although we did chant "here we go, steelers!" during the iron man match. us pittsburghers. class all the way!
