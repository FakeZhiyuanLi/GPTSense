arlington, virginia - president bush announced today that he had accepted cia director george tenet's resignation. bush commended tenet for his work, although the cia failed in 9-11 and iraq. tenet said that his decision was not related to politics, but many have suggested that the timing of the action suggests otherwise. bush went on to praise tenet for a "super-duper job" for the country. tenet's resignation comes after former vice-president al gore called for exactly that in a firey speech. "i am deeply honored," said gore, "i feel a sense of accomplishment that i haven't felt since the invented the internet." tenet's official resignation letter thanks gore for his "friendship and candid support." tenet's resignation will go in effect in mid-june.
