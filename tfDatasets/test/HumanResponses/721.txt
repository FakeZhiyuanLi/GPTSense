today was the start of the cat6 testing.it kind of sucked. although it was surprisingly easy. the first part was the english section and everybody finished and had 10 minutes left. then we took a break and then took the second half of the english part. it was soooooooooooooooooo easy man. we all finished with an hour left to partylol. it was great. well that was my day.
