i just wanted to let you know, i love you guys. when i heard page break down during the 8-15-04 wading, i began to cry. when trey broke down during his post-glide speech, i began again. but when trey says, "lets blow off some phucking steam!" and they tear into a massive split open and melt, bringing the smile back to my phace as mike harmonizes in his dulcet tones. and now, i can honestly say, that i am better and pheel the best i've ever phelt and i owe to a couple of special people, besides phish, you know who you are.
