i just sugar loaded on brownies. i don't feel so great 気持ち悪い・・ my house is boxes! i can't find anything i'm looking for! i needed peanut butter, so i opened the cupboard and it was stark empty. strangest feeling~ i wrote 知世　on my leg again with hearts. she was a friend of mine in japan, and i have adopted her to be my stalk-ling. yay! shes cute.
