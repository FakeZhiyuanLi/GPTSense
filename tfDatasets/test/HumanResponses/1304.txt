i will not be posting friday full card due to computer problems. here are a few quick horses to bet on friday. race 6 # 7 dixe preacher 2-1 chavez rides and should wire the field. race 7 # 7 vespers 9-2 switches to jr velazquez and is over due to win in her 4th start of year. race 8 #2 blue skies ahead 10-1 will be sitting in the garden spot with the mig riding and should come flying home after the speed burns each other out. good luck and i hope to have saturdays full card online. did somebody say tapit? any horse that has guiness for breakfast is ok with me. see you at the races.
