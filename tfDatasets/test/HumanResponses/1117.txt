sometime back in may 2003 i was very low on my spirits and happend to write this thing- one of the only three postings on my previous blog. just posting it here for my own satisfaction. the questions of our existence, which still remain unanswered to me - sometimes in life we get serious, and realize we should have been serious long way back. but i wonder, should anyone get serious at all ? afterall, it seems we tend to not enjoy the little things which one should in every day life. or am i overdoing things ? what is the secret to happiness ? aspire, aim and achieve, or be happy with what one's got ? what do we live for ? what is the final aim ? is there any ? is it the satisfaction in cherishing every moment of your life ? then why cry for something you couldn't achieve instead of being happy within ? is it so simple ? or is it out of our comprehension ? ankur.
