yet again another on-line attack by a group from russia. this time a triple whammy on the microsoft front. it starts with an unknown iis (the microsoft web server) security hole that allowed the group into a ton of internet sites to add code to the sites web pages. this added code downloads a trojan program onto your machine if you are using internet explorer (the microsoft web browser) and this trojan is so new none of the virus checkers catch it yet. so advice people, move away from iis if you are hosting web pages because this is a zero hour attack on you if you are just someone browsing the web move to a browser that is not based on the microsoft browser or better yet to a non microsoft operating system. this will not guarantee that in the future you will not be attacked again just that right now the bad guys are only paying attention to the microsoft world. ysrd
