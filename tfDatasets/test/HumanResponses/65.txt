fair enough. sweden's game was better :) i'm actually getting a football fever worked up here. that's all good in preparation of watching the sweden-denmark game at work in copenhagen tomorrow. and i downloaded a load of pic's from my digicam today. now all i need is a bigger disk to put'em on the web.
