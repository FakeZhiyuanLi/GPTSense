what is spotless mind? a mind without a spot.without a thought, without an aim, without an intensity. who doesn't have a spotless mind. think everyone does. an individual who doesn't have a spotless mind is unique. maybe this people are termed the perfectionist? everyone. according to my own definination has the unique feature of not being able to comprehend, understand and foresee certain thing in their own very unique way. so as to call the 'spotless mind'. just like my friend now- who is sitting beside me is suffering from a moment of spotless mind, whereby the mind went blankblank for an entire minute or second. that's known as the spotless moment.
