yeah, well cymbals lasted a long time. 3 days was enough for me. man they are really heavy! and to hold them in the high hat position for a whole song is torture. my snare is mad at me, and now i don't get a cool drumline uniform anymore, but it felt so weird being away from my instrument. general band camp news we have our first show in the bag, well it needs polishing, but we have it. fyi - we do 4 or 5 complete shows every season, and for our first game (next friday) we have four songs and we have drills for 3. and that doesn't count pregame.
