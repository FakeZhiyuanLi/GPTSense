do you have the time to listen to me whine about nothing and everything all at once i am one of those melodramatic fools neurotic to the bone no doubt about it sometimes i give myself the creeps sometimes my mind plays tricks on me it all keeps adding up i think i'm cracking up am i just paranoid? or am i just stoned i went to a shrink to analyze my dreams she says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down i went to a whore he said my life's a bore so quit my whining cause it's bringing her down sometimes i give myself the creeps sometimes my mind plays tricks on me it all keeps adding up i think i'm cracking up am i just paranoid? uh,yuh,yuh,ya grasping to control so i better hold on sometimes i give myself the creeps sometimes my mind plays tricks on me it all keeps adding up i think i'm cracking up am i just paranoid? or am i just stoned this song is awesome, but then again so is most of the stuff by green day
