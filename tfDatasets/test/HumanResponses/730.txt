saturday was an beautiful day, and to celebrate my father in law and my brother in law decided to take me golfing for my first time. it was actually a small best-ball tournament that our church was hosting. it was a lot of fun, although i found that i am terrible at golf. although i was completely useless for most the day, the two nice strokes i had are keeping me thirsty for more! we ended up coming in dead last for the tournament, but mostly because three of our four team members had never golfed or golf rarely. we did hit 12 over par which isn't to bad for a group of mostly first time golfers. we even had a few birdies on some holes. all and all it was a successful day!
