i'm listening to the new hanson album right now, so if anyone had a doubt to how much of a loser i could be, here's your proof, i actually bought it. but, i have to say- they're good! so, this weekend has seemed so long. it's only 12:30 on sunday and i'm trying to keep my eyes open. guess it must be one of those three-day-weekend side effects. but i mean, thursday was awesome- baltimore is such a cool city, and thursday night was fun too. then friday was awesome too- 13 going on 30 is a really good movie, i highly recomend it. saturday was interesting. alison and i got to hang out with a foreign exchange student from france,. it was. kinda awkward. today is our first sccr game of the season. c'mon intensity, i know we can win this one. and it's a home game, we got mclean to represent! haha, hell yes. i'm really looking forward to it- it feels like forever since i've had the opportunity to shove a girl and not get in trouble for it. i've missed the damn sport!
