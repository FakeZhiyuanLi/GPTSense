today is definitely not a good day for me. i checked up the traffic police about my vehicle summon as i think i was caught by the red light camera yesterday. to my surprise, i realised there was another summon instead. i was caught speeding along the road (meant for 50km/hr) which i was travelling at 80km/hr. when i saw the policeman with the huge 3-lens camera, it was too late already. actually that day i should not have travelled that route if not for my classmate aka bimbo queen, whom i went to fetch her. was abit blaming for her for my summon. :[ yah. all my friends were chiding me for my reckless driving and soon i will get into trouble. i think i did. hai~
