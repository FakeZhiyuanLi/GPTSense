isn't it a bright morn-afternoon. so bright it woke me up at 1. ^^" which, works out with me, no problems there. today i get to level on ffxi~! nothing better than neverending leveling. i swear, leveling on ro is so much easier. maybe i just die too much, :: shrug ::. i'm going to start drawing a filler for a friends webcomic this night if i don't have to travel to san antonio. ah, that reminds me. i have to draw character plot sheets for niou, one of the main characters of, " namida kanashimi ". ja, ato de~!
