well, lets try this one again. i am a masters student in biology at a small state university in missouri, usa. i will be defending next month and graduating in may. i haven't applied to many jobs but i have looked a lot. i'm pretty nervous about the whole job hunt thing. i may have a line on a job through a professor that i am good friends with, but i am afraid to get my hopes up too high just yet. he's been going to a lot of meetings and is suppose to be getting a lot of grant money, some of which he will use to higher some workers. he has hinted very strongly, although has not out right said, that i am in. this would be more than perfect. although slightly out of my field of interest, it is something i think i would enjoy. i have a son and another child on the way. i love kids, but plan on stopping with two. i hope to have the extra income required to adopt sometime in the future, but at this time its only a thought i'm playing with. well thats enough for now. i'll be around.
