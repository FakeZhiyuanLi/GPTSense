okay,okay so the first day of my senior year was pretty cool and all, but when i got home from school i still had a paper and two essays to write. man did i write my ass off. i guess its something about knowing you're gonna get killed if the essays dont get finished by tomorrow that helps you shit papers out faster. well, i gotta go to school now. but i was so happy that i finished writing last nite (this morning) that i could have sworn the super smash bros. guy came out of no where and said "congradulations!" until next time
