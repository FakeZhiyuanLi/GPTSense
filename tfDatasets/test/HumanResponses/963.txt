i plan on blogging about tv shows, movies, music, books or whatever is related to the various mediums. lately i've been noticing a lot of things in the media that are driving me crazy. i rant about it to my kids and they shake their heads either in agreement or disgust. this will be a forum for me to express my viewpoints (good and bad) about what i'm watching, reading, or listening too. you're welcome to shake your head in agreement or disgust as well. there's no place like home, dot
