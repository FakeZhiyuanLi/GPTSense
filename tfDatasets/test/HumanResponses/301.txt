i havent made a post in a while. it could be because i have such a boring life. nothing cool really happens around where i live or in my life for the matter. but theres probably a reason for it and life should start to get better. i dont think i could handle an exciting life so maybe i should just be happy with having an average everyday boring life with nothing to do but eat and sleep. yeah i'll go with that.
