saturday at last! yesterday i slept quit late, finishing some of the intro animation for my stickman, now the problem i need to plan the story and execute well. on thursday in coleman for my interactive media class i have learnt to do some game scripting in director, a bit of confusing but the more you practice i think i would understand. quit tired today, now after posting this blog, i'm goin to continue to do some animation for my flash game, though i'm tired i still got some creative juice flowing.
