i saw godspell last night. it was very good though completely not what i was expecting. it was all kind of musical bible stories which, unfortunately and honestly, i've never heard before. so they were interesting. i think i'm going to see fahrenheit 9/11 today which should be amazing. i'm gonna take michael moore's advice and sneak in. (it's rated r but he said if you're a teenager and you haven't figured out how to sneak into a rated r movie, you've got some problems!)
