yes, it was a hard day, because my boss was out of town (you could all say: yupeeeeeeee!). no, it's not like that, because when my boss it's out of town i have to do his work and i can't miss from work, and alot of thing. all the day i was very depressed, something in the morning made me to think at what is the meaning of life. and i didn't found out, a part from my depression is because i don't have a girlfriend., but i'm not in the mood to explain what i thought and what not. this subject i let it for another day. ah, by the way, today i had the first comment to my blog :), from somebody called ron, thanks ron :), it's nice to know cuz somebody is visiting your blog once in a while. ok, i will close the post for today, because it's showtime and because i'm just not in the mood, the oz it's begining :). a movie with a jail :) good night
