things don't really last forever i knew it, why the heck am i searching for it. i'm a big failure of society. why am i thinking like this, what's wrong with mei don't get it. all of a sudden, i lost everything. i lost interest in winning i lost interest in studying i lost interest in learning i dont want to study anymore i lost my self-confidence. i lost my passion for taekwondo but one thing i still keep it's what my heart keeps that's why it still beats as of this moment this one thing has the power to change the world. my world that i live in. a small message from her ignites my circuits, gives me the reason to live. in spite of all the things i have been through, i know this one is so true i miss her but i couldn't have her. maybe that's just how life is i got to accept it. i love you
