well, i worked at petsmart for two days in a row,now. i thought my senior school photo was going to suck, but it didn't. instead, it was one of my good ones, just like my junior one from last year- but they should have not used the yellow filter, that made my skin look weird in my school senior photo. i got jobs that i like this time,unlike yesterday. my job coach also gave me a lot of praise, and said i was working independently. i cleaned the outside of fish tanks and cleaned shelves.maybe work isn't so bad after all. *happily smiles*
