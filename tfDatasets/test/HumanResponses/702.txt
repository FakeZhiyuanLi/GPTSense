can bill clinton run for president again? i know the answer to that rhetorical question, but man, the speech he gave tonight at the democratic convention was amazing. in under 25 minutes, clinton layed out a clear political philosphy for the democratic party, differentiated kerry from bush, and finally made the democrates stand for something. in short, he did in 25 minutes what the kerry campaign hasn't been able to do their entire campaign. these are the things the democrats failed to do in 2000 and utimatly cost gore the election. sure clinton may have skeltons in his closet, but i still think if the democrats want to beat bush in 2004, they need to utilize clinton to the fullest. tonight was a shining example of how clinton was able to captivate an american public and win 2 terms in the white house against a hostile republican party ready to destroy the clinton administration at all costs. ronald reagan, eat your heart out. clinton is the real great communicator.
