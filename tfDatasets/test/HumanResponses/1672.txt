yeah. my isp is being a bitch, i was in the middle of a counterstrike scrim and my isp thought it might be funny to disconnect me, i havnt been able to get online all day, i dont know when i am going to be able to post this, thats up to my isp. however i am writing it at 2:00am saturday. i started writing some more tutorials for my website, and i found a nice template. you can take a look at it here: http://n3rdv4n4.com/possible.html i was hoping my internet would be fixed by the time i got home from work but it wasnt. i got to go back to work at 10 am so i think im just going to pull an overnighter and sleep when i get home tommorow. i have a new favourite song, castles in the sky by ian van dahl. i also stummbled upon a [pirate] radio station run by some of the interns at carleton u, i must say, they have awesome taste in music. hopefully i can make a couple calls and become a dj. well i gotta go, im gonna watch vampire hunter d. cya
