blogged for the very first time. yes indeed this is my very first blog. two short notes on my blog: 1. if i criticise ya deal with it. 2. enjoy my blog, learn from it or whatever. it just a place for me to vent my frustrations online. at the end of each blog i will do this: this will be my favourite album/song at time of writing>>> trax: this will be the last movie i watched>>> movie: this will be the last piece of food i ate>>> munch: this will be wher i place any links to websites or news articles i found interesting. peace out readers, l8rs! luke
