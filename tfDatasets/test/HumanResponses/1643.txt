go fish, a childhood card game. a 1994 black and white documentary by rose troche and now a game of wits and jealousy that she and "it" will play with me. they are asking around, trying to get the low down. trying to find a piece of juicy gossip where it doesn't exist. "what's alison doing? who is she seeing? who is she interested in?" well, wouldn't you like to know? let's just say it's definitely not you that i am interested in. i can't do that again.
