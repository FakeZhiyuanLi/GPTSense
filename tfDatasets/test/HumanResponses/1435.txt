today, i'm writing about relationship. i have a lot of difficulties to have a good relationship, but i have a lot of friends that i want to keep. i am not going to talk about someone in particular. i met some of my friends at school, we were in the same class. others, i met them on internet : visitors of my web site. some of them are living in europe. i like to chat with my friends. sometimes i meet them. just sometimes because they work and have a lot of friends too. so. me, i'm not very interesting. but it's ok. i have my activities too, alone : walking, painting, reading, making web site. but i like having coffee and talking to someone face to face. but. everybody is lazy and doesn't want to move.
