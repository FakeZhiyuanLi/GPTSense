everyone talks about this show and how the voting is off. the best have been voted off and now it's down to two, fantasia and diana. i felt bad for jasmine but she lasted much longer then she should have. they're good but in my mind they're not american idols. but then again, i didn't think ruben and clay were either and look at clay.he's got a great voice and is making a name for himself. this has been so disappointing i really don't care who wins, i'll never buy their cds anyway. the only idol cd we have in my house is kelly clarkson's. nuff said.
