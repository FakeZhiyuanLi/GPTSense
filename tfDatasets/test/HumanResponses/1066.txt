my lawn is a reflection of my soul. sometimes it gets way out of control. i took a whack at it about a week ago after a month and a half of pretending it was not there. my 6.0 horsepower mower couldn't handle it without stalling several dozen times. the cool thing about mowing after so much neglect was finding a plant with deep purple blooms growing right outside my kitchen window. i mowed around this happy accident. it was like finding a needle in a haystack that i wasn't looking for. analogy aside, i really could have made several of those large round hay bales with all those weed and grass clippings.
