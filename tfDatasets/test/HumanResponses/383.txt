i'm sick of life. i'm sick of math. i'm sick of spanish. i'm sick of everything. i have no reason to live another day. my dreams of becoming an anesthiologist are shattered. i'm failing math now. you guys promise me you'll help me. but do you? no no one ever does. if i go in early to mrs. austin she teaches me whole new crap and i don't understand. i'm giving it my all to understand but its just so hard. your probably wondering why i'm still here if i'm bitching.well some people actually make me feel like i should live. i thank god i have those people in my life everyday. without friends i'd be dead. i don't think there was anything good about today at all. i hope tomorrow is better.
