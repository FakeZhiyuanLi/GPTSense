aw man! for a while there i thought i was actually going to have a relationship for real . after all those pseudo-relationships, i was beginning to warm up to the idea of stabilizing my commitment potential. well, it ended as swiftly as it began. i don't blame him. i was being such a pest. but, hey, you can't blame me either. i was still in that experimental stage. i am entitled to make mistakes, goddammit. otherwise i'd be a prodigy at this and that's not normal . but that doesn't take away the fact that i'm deadly sad. qui ver?
