had a meeting w my new director for operations today. something he said struck me  and i wan to record this down and share it: he say when a worm's growing to a larva, then to cocooning itself before becoming a butterfly, it hv to squeeze itself out of it's shell? . if ever someone's to go prick the shell or cocoon open, the larva wil not grow muscles and fly. the process of struggle n squeezing is essential for it to grow, so that i'll eventually become a beautiful butterfly n fly high i think.i'll squeeze thru too.i'll.
