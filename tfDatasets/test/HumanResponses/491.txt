hello fellow lambchop fanatics. it's nice to be joining you all at this wonderful blog. sometime ago i posted a message at the 'chop yahoo group regarding kurt's artwork for how i quit smoking . i was wondering about the inspiration behind the images, with particular reference to the amazing suit that mr. wagner and david dunlap decorated. anyway, i didn't get any response and was just hoping that someone might have more to say about it all. on the cd cover there are 19 numbered images and rather cryptic 'messages', some of which seem to refer to war or human rights issues (biko, mlk, sarajevo). anyone know who steve owens is? the suit is a marvel, consisting of what seems to be many (or all?) of the images and epigrams featured on the cover. do we know if kurt still has the suit? remember, 'everything resembles something'.
