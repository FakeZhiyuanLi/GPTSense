back once again. i'm going to change my eating, work, spending and cleaning habits. really. i am. i've been working at making god the center of my life more the past week and it seems to have helped. i don't want to be this way anymore. but i don't want to lose what i like. i shut down and i don't like that. i don't want to avoid or delay, but there are some things i don't have a solution for, so i don't know how to face them. anyway. took my measurements and weighed in today. height: 245 pounds chest: 57.5 inches waist: 49 inches hips: 57 inches i want to take care of myself. i need to take care of myself. i just don't think i know how.
