father, make the deepest desire of my heart be for me to live to glorify you and have you glorified in me. there is nothing else that can fit your will completely in me. help and give me a mindset with this in mind. i want to die to my flesh, so that i may be able to walk in your spirit and likeness. i want to reject any part of myself and gain all of your qualities. i need you to save me from myself, or before i know it, i will kill myself, but not to you but to the world. save me from everything, give me your strength. love, hannah
