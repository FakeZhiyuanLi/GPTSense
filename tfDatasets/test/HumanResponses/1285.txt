hello how is you? what are you doing here? i am here to help you guys. the best thing you can do in here is read books and sleep, isn’t it? what else can i do here, me alone? i want to do my assigned task but i always feel lonely and tired of using windows me. so i must change windows me to another windows or any open source os. the best os i prefer is lynx. but that’s really confusing for other people who are familiar with windows based system. so i must choose windows of another version. probably i shall choose windows 98 that i like most among all other windows. windows 98 is the best way of doing something simple. now i've decided to write a novel. just to spend my lazy days. here is my first project .called 'choloman bikol' which means 'moving junk'. comments and suggestions are always welcome. come back soon.
