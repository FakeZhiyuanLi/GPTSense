well im just listening to some old belle and sebastian, and im thinking way too much. its reminding me of times gone past. and im getting too old. funny story, my dad looks at me yesterday and asks me how old i am, and i say 24. he was amazed, he thought i was 21 going on to 22. pretty funny. my birthday was a bust, i worked all day, went to the nutritionist at 8:30am, and i haven't gained anything, i really don't get it. yeah so think i did nothing all night, my friend a gave me a call, he gave me two prints of his (really nice and contemporary) and some underwear. but all was well, elliott wrote me an email whising me a good b-day, and offering to buy me a drink this weekend. im trying not to be attracted to him, its hard, ironic don't you think. well thats about it for now.
