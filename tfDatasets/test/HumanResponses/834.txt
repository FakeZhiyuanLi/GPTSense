i never thought i'd say this, but there is no place like home. it's not so much my home i missed on my week-long hiatus from home, but my room, or rather, my "womb", as it has been aptly named. i spend hours upon hours in here, doing "god knows what" (the parents). i actually spend it here, on the computer, like a loser. i'm not really sure where i'm going with this, so i'm going to stop and save myself the grief of scratching my head thinkin' "what the hell am i talking about?" ***end transmission***
