yes you watch star trek and you know what a borg is. are there any actually living wth us? not the tv type but there are a ton of people who i consider to be real borg. the word borg is a shortened form of the word cyborg which is a just a person with non-organic parts. these parts must augment the persons life in some way such as a person with a pacemaker is a borg because they have an embedded device that keeps them alive. (if that is not an augmentation of their life them what is?) i am a borg because of my use of electronic devoces to control pain. i use a tens machine all the time. i also have other devices i use all the time such as my pocket pc and other devices in my personal area network (pan). i believe there are a ton of us out there and we need to gather the collective via the internet and hopefully we can do this by using blogs and im. \\//_ llap .||.
