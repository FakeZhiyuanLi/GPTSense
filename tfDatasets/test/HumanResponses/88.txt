hey you all, im stoned whoooooo! i had just recently come in from the outside where i smoked a bowl and a half of kb, and i may smoke more if the cw-monster would contact me back. im currently listening to aphrodites child, a band that is made up of vangelis, and some other not too important guys, but if you got a good high going on like if you've eaten mushrooms a little while ago, your balls would be l-o-w down to the fucking floor. aphrodites is a great band, their album "666" is like reading a passage out of mythology or the apocalypse (i dont know, ive never read the bible). music is just better when youre high (im high) and when you listen to music that has low drums in the background going "thump! thump! thump!" and so on (im listening to aphrodites child, who play with beats like that)
