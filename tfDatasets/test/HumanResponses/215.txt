as i sit here munching on crunchie flavoured ice cream thoughts stumble through my head often differeing in subjects. often thoughts about life and living. too live ones life is coragous and admirable, i pity the souls who make plans yet do not carry these adventuras plans out. too live life what does too live life mean to an individual does it involve going from day to day performing meaningless taske, to stay within ones comfort zone? or may it mean too take risks too never remain in that comfort zone. i as an indvidual believe to live ones life is too experience every waking moment as if its the last this involves risks taken to have bad and good experiences, the good will always overide the bad experiences hey ted just thinkinghow was your sleep?
