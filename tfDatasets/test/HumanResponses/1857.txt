grrr weekends over. i had a shitload of homework last night and was like crying cause i was so tired. english finals happened today which i most likely failed (we were supposed to do 7 out of 10 questions i did 4). after school i walked to taryns house and ate everything there. i dont even ask if i can open her fridge anymore its offically my second home. after a hustle and bustle with my mom and brother looking for me (i really wish my mom would get a cell phone) i was driven to the spaghetti dinner at my church. will and ray made up a new name for me and laura slores. figure it out on your own. now im stuck with like a years supply of meatballs and bread. i feel awfully italian. well, i have finals again tomorrow and mostly likely another shitload of homework headed my way, so i guess ill go coaxe my faja into taking my to cvs for important reasons. later dudezeys! - izzy (-_-)
