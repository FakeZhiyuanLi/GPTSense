never thought i'd find myself here. i used to think blogs were for those with weak containers for their thoughts.then i looked upon the pad and pen i kept at my desk for writing my thoughts down on paper. what's the difference, really? my pen and paper are totally private.then again, so is the internet "blog" where nobody really knows me, right? well, this is enough for a test post, i think, lol.
