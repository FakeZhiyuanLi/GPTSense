irish diplomacy is the ability to tell a man to go to hell, so that he will look forword to making the trip. that's awesome. went to the fair last night with liddie and greg. was fun. my sister stopped by today i love my sissy. we watched movies and ate pizza and ice cream. it's almost 6 and i'm still in my pajamas. i feel like i'm a princess :d lol. the only thing i have to do today.(or want to do) is pick up my book at barnes and nobles. woohoo*riverdancing* but i could have gone camping w/t lydia today. :p but my momma didn't want me to because she's crazy. c'est la vie. so now i can't hang out with lydia all weekend. which sucks jopa because i never get to see liddie anyways. and if i end up going to minnisota i'm gonna kill someone. anyways much love .end. daniela
