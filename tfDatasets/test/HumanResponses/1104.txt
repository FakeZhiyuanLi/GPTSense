i don't like pessimism. i don't like goths. i can barely stand skaters or preps. i hate cliques. these things depress me, and i don't think anyone deserves that. i think that in the end i want to be alone. i just want everyone and everything to disappear, even for only a split-second, just so i can know what it really means to be alone: to be surrounded by nothingness and to be empty. .i hope that death is nothingness.
