when i was a kid, i was made to believe that god is "up there" in heaven while we are all down here below. average christians, i guess, think this way. the following message of st. paul, most especially the last line, should change the way many of us think about god, our understanding of the line "our father, who art in heaven" in the lord's prayer, and our understanding of heaven itself. the god who made the world and everything in it.gives all men life and breath and everything else. from one man he made every nation of men, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he determined the times set for them and the exact places where they should live. god did this so that men would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us. for in him we live and move and have our being. acts 17.24-28
