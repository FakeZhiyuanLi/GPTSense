on the three hour mad drive from bangalore airport to mysore past the crowds of people, ox carts, sari clad multicolored motorcycle divas, i had my first experience of deep devotional prayer since arriving in india. the fact that the subject of this prayer was for my own selfish desire to survive does not diminish from fervor which i applied to my devotion. we did in due course arrive at the hotel. since then i have been guided through more a more traditional puja at a temple to shiva where after circling around the lingam stone, holy water was thrown into my open eyes and red powder spread on my skin. i have been assured i am now immune from small pox and duly blessed. my first meeting with guruji was good and meeting up with the small international community of yoga students has been great. i look forward to practice, sanskrit classes - daily aruvedic massage and lots of work deepening and refining my art which has been flowing from my heart since arrival- welcome to india david
