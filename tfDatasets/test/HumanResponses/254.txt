i'm tired.have been all week. i hope i don't come off as a serial bitcher in this blog, but it really bugs me that i sleep 7-8 hours a day, and find it almost impossible to get up in the morning. i mean, shit, i'm waking up so that i can watch wimbledon! what the hell? this morning was really awfulit's as if it's physically painful for me to get out of bed. if i was so damned annoyed by the sound of my alarm, i totally wouldn't get up at all. maybe i should go to bed earlier, but still, i might as well tattoo a giant "l" on my forehead if i go to bed at 9:30 pm. soanywaythis really isn't going anywhere. it's depressing to be tired all the time, but if you don't get enough rest, depression can set in. so which happens first? or is it a vicious cycle thing? how does one break out of it, if at all?
