crawford, texas - after claiming that the new leaders of iraq were "ready to take the training wheels off," president george bush fell off his bicycle and slightly injured himself. officials blame bush's tumble on the soil, which they said was "loose" because it had been raining. however, precipitation records for the area show no sign of rain. "we will get to the bottom of this," said bush, "and find the people who did this." bush did not comment on the iraqi situation. it is now known whether bush will put the training wheels back on his bicycle.
