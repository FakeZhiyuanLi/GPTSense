well to start the day off i woke up(duh) around 1:30pm, new record. then a few hours later my sister arrived with her guests, it was quite nice having them over i hadn't seen them in ages! they're very nice and funny people. the rest of my day was quite boring just watched some tv and went on the computer and surfed around.god i cant wait till i get to denver i want to do so much when im there i just hope we have the time do what we want, speaking of that my brother told me over the phone that he's going to take me white water rafting. i was like "oh hell no", i dont weigh much and i've seen how u get tossed around on that raft when your going down river i'll probably get tossed right out of that boat.*david scared* :(. talk to you later blog, hehe.
