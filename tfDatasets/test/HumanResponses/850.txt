i am sitting here typing into my computer when i could be just dictating it, except the voice control for computers is just not there yet. i would like to do this with my pocket pc but it's not even ready to take commands yet.there is the new voice command for pocket pc but with only 128 meg of ram and no hard drive having enough storage space for the software and the tables and pattern analysis software is not going to fit. on the pc you can do some with microsofts new voice command sdk. but the recognition rate is lower then the rate on my 10 year old mac. for now the part of a borg that listens is still the biological part.
