in the beginning. this blog is for those of you that are tired of the daily grind. whether you work in an office downtown or a third shift position breaking your back. it's for those of you who like to live life one day at a time and figure things out as you go. anyone interested in posting may do so, however, try not to use full names or post messages letting everyone know that your barely legal and anyone can pay 5 bucks to access your website because i will never be that bored or desperate. so cheers, and lets have some laughs, vent, and come up with some good conversation to use while having a pint at the end of a long day!
