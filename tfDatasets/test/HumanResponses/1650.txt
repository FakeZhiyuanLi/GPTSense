this poem isnt that great, but i guess its ok. i really expresses how i feel about myself. in case you cant tell, my self esteem is at zero at the moment. i am (c) karlee reid i am broken. no ones there to help me pick up the pieces of the life that you shattered so easily. i am stereotyped. i am what they tell me i am and i can do nothing. i am alone. no one to hold on to anymore. i am helpless. in need of a strong hand to pull me to my feet again i am myself. but even i don’t know who that is. i am disgusting. i hate every detail of myself, every cell of my soul, ever fibre of my body. i am immense. taking up too much space in the world. i am masked. shielded by my own fear of this world. i am nothing. nothing that anyone could or would ever love, care for or wate their time on. and so i end it. all i need is courage and my little silver blade. r.i.p, karlee reid i am… dead.
