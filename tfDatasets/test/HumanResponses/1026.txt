preppygoths suck arse. to be a goth you can't just dress goth talk morbid and read nietszche (however much i admire him). what you need is the attitude, the mind and maybe the body to match it. plain and simple: be a real 'goth'. if you cry or feel bad whenever someone however close to you says anything bad to you, you're worse than them all. normally you accept it as their opinion and don't react. you're better than that. there's enough gothic material on the net, i'm not going to repeat it, this is just my opinion, don't complain. :)
