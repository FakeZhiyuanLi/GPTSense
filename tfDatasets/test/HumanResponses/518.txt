this is really just a test blog to make sure everything is working o.k. this blog is currently about all my interests in general  so posts here from me will probably be varied widely in topic and scope. later on though, i may find myself publishing a lot of blogs on a certain topic, in which case i'll specialize in blogging about only that subject  we'll see what happens. anyway, i hope i can make this an interesting place to visit, and if you ever come here and have suggestions, or any other type of comment you'd like to leave, please feel free too.
