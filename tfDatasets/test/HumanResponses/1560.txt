this is what i want to write about. i like this realm.i can be creative i can create my own world. i can create humans or aliens.you notice how in most books about a galaxy far far away, there are always human or human like being that look like us and speak english haha. i know they have too or the book would really suck. i know i'm not getting very far with this idea of a book, but i'm moving this week and well i'm focusing on that. i did have an idea for a memory eraser. like in mib or paycheck but you know what has been done. obviously! it's too hard to come up with new ideas that will revolutionize the genre right. i mean there is so much that has already been done.from alternate universes to the night of the living dead haha. okay moving on. so my main character needs work, my plot and story needs work.guess what i've got nothing so far. sigh!
