i went wine tasting with michele today. it was a really good time and now i have a list of places which give free wine tasting. after the trip was done i was pretty messed up. i've gotta do it again soon maybe before a ferry trip. each winery will do things differently but you'll encounter one of these 3 things: 1) some places charge you a small fee (anywhere from $3 to $8) and you get to taste a set list of wines 2) other places will charge you per wine you want to taste. anywhere from (50 cents to 4 bucks) 3) other places where you can to try whatever you want for free (these are my favorite) there is a map you can pick up at any winery which has phone numbers and locations of all the vineyard so you can call ahead and plan out the trip. that's what we did once we got the map.
