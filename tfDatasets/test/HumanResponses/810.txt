caedmon's call no one would love me if they knew all the things i hide my words fall to the floor as tears drip through the telephone line and the hands iâ€™ve seen raised to the sky not waving but drowning all this time i'll try to build an ark that they need to float to you upon the crystal sea *give me your hand to hold 'cause i can't stand to love alone and love alone is not enough to hold us up we've got to touch your robe so swing your robe down low swing your robe down low the prince of despair's been beaten but the loser still fights death's on a long leash stealing my friends to the night and everyone cries for the innocent you say to love the guilty too and i'm surrounded by suffering and sickness so i'm working tearing back the roof repeat * and the pain of the world is a burden and it's my cross to bear and i stumble under all the weight i know you're simon standing there and i know you're standing there
