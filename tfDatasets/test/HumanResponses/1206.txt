my japanese friends just got back from a visit to toronto. they found the people there much more patient and easy to communicate with than here in gainesville, fl. and toronto is probably the most "americanized" city in canada. another proof that canadians are a more considerate breed. but why is that all canadians envy you when they find out you're in florida? most of them haven't lived here, that's why. sure, 3x the sunshine is nice. no snow is good, too. but if you ask me, the most important thing about a place is the culture of the people. eager canadians who head south for the warm weather will gradually come to realize there's no place like home.
