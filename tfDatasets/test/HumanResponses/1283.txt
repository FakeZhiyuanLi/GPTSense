i am a goddess in every part of me my lips, my eyes, my hair, my thighs if only you could see. maybe abstract beauty nowhere near perfection round and full, alive and whole do you think you could make an exception? whatever happened to the beauty within the heart the love, the strength, the honesty that sets us all apart? everyone has a need to love and be loved in return but superficial expectations leave us to crash and burn. i appear to be nothing like her so delicate and petite but i am still a woman from my head down to my feet. we laugh the same, we cry the same have hopes and dreams and fears we long to have a hand to hold and shed the same small tears. but life is so much sweeter for her, than it is for me for outer beauty, not heart and soul is all the world can see. so i ask just one more time as you glance in my direction could you see the goddess in me and possibly make an exception?
