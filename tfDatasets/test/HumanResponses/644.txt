so today i am going to dci. i am so excited. today has started perfectly. i woke up and spoke to my wife (my camp wife at least) and then had jello loaf and toaster scrambles. mmm. they r sooo good. now i have a cherry coke and im really happy. i learned a chord on my new guitar, and then talked to syerra. after that i spoke with alexa and now im talking to brandi. its a day full of kick ass dci and talking to people i love. i think that in honor of dci i might even shave. maybe. i dunno, i thought that i might grow it out, but i think ill shave. anyways im still hungry so im gettig more food. i might add more later. so for now, ciao
