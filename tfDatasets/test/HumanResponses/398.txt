wowisn't it wierd how you think you are really good friends with someone. then all of a sudden they are in a bad mood.so they decide to be rude. i hate moody friends. it's like what is the point of keeping them. you never know from one day to the next if they are even going to like you. one day they are the nicest person in the world. the next you can't do a damn thing right. some of my friends are like that. one in particular, and sometimes people decide to follow
