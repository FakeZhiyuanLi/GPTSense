it sucks to be a teenager. you have all the worries and tasks of an adult, without most of the perks. i'm badly in need of a job, but no one is hiring, or won't hire me on account of my age. in short, i've got zero cash and a birthday and christmas coming up. why the hell do we chop down a tree anyway? we celebrate birth and the so-called "new beginning" of life by killing another living thing? what's up with that? don't get me started on miseltoe. i know this much for certain: i'm going to end up famous. the only problem is i have no idea if it will be in a good way or bad way yet. you ever just stop whatever you're doing, and think? i mean, not think at all. just kinda pondering whatever floats into your head. thoughts running like a river that just had that mental dam implode. it'll make sense if you think about it long enough, trust me. you'll see a lot of rambles like this. this is all from 6 minutes of thought. get used to it.
