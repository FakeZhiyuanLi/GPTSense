ralf schumacher has a broken back, not just a concussion as a result of his 250km/h sideways shunt into the wall at indianapolis. how things though have changed in formula 1 safety wise. imagine that the last few years had been done with the safety standards in place as of 1975 odd. how many of the current f1 drivers would still be alive? button? his shunt at monaco last year would have done him in. sato. would be the human jelliefish having broken every bone in his body by now. michael schumacher too would be dead. he had that nasty head on that broke both his legs a few years back that could have been much worse. alonso has had a number of impressive wipeouts. lets not even consider the wipout at this years monaco race as a result of sato's cloud of smoke - giancarlo fisichella ended up upside down after ploughing into the back of dc. all things told, the f1 grid would be lacking a number of familiar faces if earlier era equipment and rules were being used.
