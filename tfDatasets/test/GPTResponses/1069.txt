The ancient Egyptians used saffron, turmeric, and other plant materials to dye fabrics yellow. These natural dyes could be boiled in water and the fabric was then soaked in the solution for an extended period of time to absorb the color. Richer yellow shades were achieved by using larger amounts of these plants. Another material called weld was also used to make bright yellow dyes. Weld was a plant that was grown in Egypt and harvested for its yellow flowers, which were then dried and ground to create a yellow dye.
