Otto von Guericke is known for inventing the first vacuum pump in 1650. He used this pump to conduct his famous Magdeburg hemispheres experiment, in which he demonstrated the power of atmospheric pressure by using the vacuum pump to separate two large copper hemispheres which were held together only by atmospheric pressure.
