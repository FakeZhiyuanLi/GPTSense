1. Advancements in turbine technology: The development of modern turbine technology, particularly the invention of the three-bladed horizontal-axis wind turbine in the early 1980s, greatly improved the efficiency and power output of wind turbines.2. Government subsidies and incentives: Governments around the world have implemented policies and incentives to encourage the growth of renewable energy, including wind power. Subsidies for wind energy development and tax credits for wind turbines have helped reduce the cost of wind power and make it more competitive with traditional energy sources.3. Public awareness: Greater public awareness of the negative environmental impacts of traditional energy sources like coal and oil, as well as concern over climate change, has created demand for cleaner and more sustainable energy sources like wind power.4. Collaborative research and development: Collaboration between the private sector, universities, and government research institutions has helped to accelerate the development of new technologies and improve the efficiency and power output of wind turbines.5. Economies of scale: As the wind power industry has grown, the cost of manufacturing and installing wind turbines has decreased due to economies of scale. This has made wind power more cost-effective and attractive to investors.
