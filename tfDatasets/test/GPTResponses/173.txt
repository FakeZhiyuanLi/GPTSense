Development anthropologists look at the relationship between plans and outcomes to understand the effectiveness of development projects. They examine how well the project's objectives and goals have been achieved, how the community has responded to the project, and how it has impacted their lives. They analyze the cultural, social, economic, and political factors that may have influenced the project outcomes, and identify potential areas for improvement in future projects. Additionally, they take into consideration the diverse perspectives and voices of the community to ensure that the project is empowering and sustainable in the long term.
