Glaciers release meltwater due to several factors, including:1. Warm temperatures: When the average temperature increases, the surface of the glacier begins to melt, and the water runs off in the form of streams and rivers.2. Increased pressure: As more snow and ice accumulates on top of glaciers, the weight and pressure increase, causing the ice lower down to melt and release meltwater.3. Friction: Friction between the glacier and the rock below can cause heat to build up and melt the glacier, leading to the release of meltwater.4. Sunlight: Sunlight can cause the surface of the glacier to melt, especially during summer months.5. Global warming: The melting of glaciers has been accelerated by global warming, which is causing temperatures to rise and resulting in the rapid melting of glaciers.
