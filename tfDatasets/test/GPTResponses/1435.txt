A bi-directional data translator or converter, also known as a bridge, can perform bidirectional data translation between two different standards. These bridges work by receiving data in one format, interpreting or translating it as needed, and then transmitting it in a completely different format. This process can occur in both directions, allowing data to flow seamlessly between different systems or networks that use different protocols or standards. Examples of bridges include protocol converters, media converters, and application layer gateways.
