The construction of large hotels in the Alps began in the mid-19th century, around the 1840s to 1850s. This was during the time when wealthy Europeans began to visit the Alps for leisure and tourism. The construction of large hotels continued throughout the 20th century, with many being built during the post-World War II boom in tourism.
