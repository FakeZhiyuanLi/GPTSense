Quantum mechanics describes the behavior of particles at a very small scale, such as atoms and subatomic particles. It is based on the principles of wave-particle duality, probability, and superposition.Wave-particle duality: Particles can exhibit both particle-like and wave-like properties. For example, photons (particles of light) can behave like waves with a certain frequency and wavelength, while electrons can behave like particles with a certain mass and charge.Probability: Quantum mechanics uses probability to describe the behavior of particles. Instead of predicting a single outcome for an experiment, quantum mechanics predicts all possible outcomes and assigns a probability to each one.Superposition: Particles can exist in multiple states at the same time, known as superposition. For example, an electron can exist in multiple energy levels simultaneously.Quantum mechanics also includes other important concepts such as entanglement, where two particles can become linked such that their properties are correlated, and uncertainty, where the position and momentum of a particle cannot be measured with complete accuracy at the same time.Overall, the physics of quantum mechanics is complex and can be counterintuitive compared to classical physics. It has numerous practical applications in fields such as computing, cryptography, and energy production.
