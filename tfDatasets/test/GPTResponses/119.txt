Countrywide Financial used several predatory lending methods, including:1. Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) that started with low interest rates and then increased dramatically, often leaving borrowers unable to make their payments.2. No-documentation loans that allowed borrowers to get mortgages without providing any proof of income or assets.3. Low down payment requirements that allowed borrowers to get into homes they couldn't afford.4. Steering borrowers toward higher-cost subprime loans, even if they qualified for traditional loans with better terms.5. Excessive fees and penalties for late payments and other loan-related services.These and other predatory practices led to Countrywide's role in the subprime mortgage crisis of 2008, which wreaked havoc on the U.S. economy and led to a wave of foreclosures and bankruptcies.
