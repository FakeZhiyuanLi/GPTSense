Students have been used as workers throughout history. In some cultures, children were expected to contribute to the family income from a young age. During the Industrial Revolution, many children were employed in factories, mines, and other industries. In more recent times, student workers may be employed in part-time jobs while still attending school, or they may take internships or apprenticeships to gain experience in their chosen field.
