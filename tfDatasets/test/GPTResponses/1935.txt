Greek festivals were celebrated throughout the year, with many occurring during the major seasons and events such as harvest time and the passing of the seasons. Some of the most important festivals in ancient Greece were the Olympic Games, the Dionysia (a festival dedicated to the god Dionysus), the Panathenaea (a festival in honor of the goddess Athena), and the Eleusinian Mysteries (a festival dedicated to the goddess Demeter). They were celebrated at different times throughout the year, depending on the specific festival.
