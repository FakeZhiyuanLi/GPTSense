Before post-punk, music was categorized into various genres, some of which were not entirely accurate or appropriate. For example:1. Punk rock: Although post-punk grew out of punk rock, it had distinct differences that set it apart. Punk was characterized by its simplicity and rawness, while post-punk was more complex and experimental.2. New Wave: While some post-punk bands were associated with the New Wave movement, not all of them fit neatly into that category. New Wave was more pop-oriented and commercially viable than post-punk, which was often darker and more introspective.3. Gothic rock: Some post-punk bands, such as Siouxsie and the Banshees and Bauhaus, were associated with the gothic rock movement. However, gothic rock had its own distinct sound and aesthetic that didn't always overlap with post-punk.4. Indie rock: In the 1980s and 1990s, post-punk influenced a generation of indie rock bands, but the two genres are not interchangeable. Indie rock often incorporates elements of folk, pop, and other genres that were not part of post-punk.
