Marxist scholars like Stuart Hall and Raymond Williams viewed culture as a site of political struggle and contested meanings. They argued that culture is produced, circulated, and consumed in relation to social and economic structures, and that it reflects and reinforces the dominant ideologies and power dynamics of a given society. However, they also recognized that cultural practices and meanings are not fixed or universal, but are constantly being negotiated and redefined by social actors. As such, they saw culture as a crucial terrain for challenging and transforming oppressive structures and fostering more egalitarian and democratic social relations.
