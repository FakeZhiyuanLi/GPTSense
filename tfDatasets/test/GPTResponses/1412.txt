External drives typically include a hard disk drive, solid-state drive, or a combination of both within an enclosure that has a USB or Thunderbolt interface for connecting to a computer or other device. They may also come with backup software, encryption features, and/or portable power options. Some external drives also offer additional features like water resistance or shockproofing for added protection.
