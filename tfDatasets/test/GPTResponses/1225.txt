Pantheism is the belief that the universe (including all things in it) is identical with divinity or that divinity is found in all things. It asserts that God is not a separate entity from the world, but rather that God is the world and everything in it. Pantheists value the interconnectedness of all things and view the universe as a living, conscious entity. They reject the idea of a personal God who intervenes in human affairs and believe that there is no division between the natural and the supernatural. Pantheism has been a part of many religions, including Hinduism, Taoism, and various forms of Paganism.
