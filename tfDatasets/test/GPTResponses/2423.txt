A metastable isotope returns to the ground state from an excited state by releasing the excess energy as a gamma ray photon. This process is known as gamma decay. The gamma ray photon is a high-energy photon that has no mass or electric charge and travels at the speed of light. The energy of the gamma ray photon is equal to the difference between the energy levels of the excited state and the ground state, and it is emitted with a very short wavelength. Once the metastable isotope has released this excess energy, it returns to its ground state and becomes stable.
