CD-V (Compact Disc-Video) was a format that combined audio and video on a single disc. It was used primarily for music videos, promotional videos, and other short-form video content. CD-V discs could hold up to 20 minutes of video material, making them ideal for music videos and other short-form content. However, due to the limited video capacity, CD-V never gained widespread adoption and was eventually replaced by other video formats such as DVD and Blu-ray.
