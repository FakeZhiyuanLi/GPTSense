A major factor when it comes to electrification is the availability of reliable and affordable sources of electricity generation. This includes access to clean and renewable energy sources like solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power, as well as traditional sources like coal, natural gas, and nuclear power. The development of efficient and affordable electricity storage systems is also important, as it allows for the efficient use of intermittent renewable sources like solar and wind power. Additionally, the deployment of a modern and resilient electricity distribution infrastructure is critical to allow for the widespread adoption of electric vehicles and other electrified technologies.
