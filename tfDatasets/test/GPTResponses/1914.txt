The main tool in the US to track and stimulate voluntary actions is tax incentives. The government offers tax incentives to individuals and businesses to encourage them to engage in certain activities that are deemed beneficial to society, such as charitable giving, investing in renewable energy, and creating jobs in certain areas. These incentives can include tax deductions, tax credits, and other tax breaks, which can significantly reduce the amount of taxes that individuals and businesses owe to the government. By providing these incentives, the government aims to create a culture of voluntary action that benefits both individuals and society as a whole.
