When zinc is manipulated to temperatures between 100 and 150 degrees Celsius, it undergoes a process called "annealing." This process involves heating the metal to a specific temperature range, holding it at that temperature for a certain period, and then allowing it to cool slowly.During annealing, the zinc grains (individual crystals within the metal) grow larger and become more ordered, reducing defects and improving the mechanical properties of the material. Additionally, any residual stresses within the metal are relieved, making it more ductile and easier to form or shape.Overall, annealing can result in improved strength, ductility, toughness, and other properties in the zinc metal.
