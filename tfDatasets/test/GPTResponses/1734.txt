There are several losses that take place in transformers and inductors during the conversion/transmission process, including:1. Core losses: Core losses occur due to the magnetization of the transformer core. These losses include hysteresis loss and eddy current loss.2. Copper losses: Copper losses occur due to the resistance of the windings. These losses include resistive losses and skin effect losses.3. Dielectric losses: Dielectric losses occur due to the insulation resistance between the windings.4. Leakage losses: Leakage losses occur due to the leakage inductance of the transformer.5. Radiation losses: Radiation losses occur due to the magnetic field radiation from the transformer.Overall, these losses result in decreased efficiency, increased heat dissipation, and reduction in power output.
