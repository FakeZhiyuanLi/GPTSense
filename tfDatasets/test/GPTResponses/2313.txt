Zinc chloride can be found in chemical supply stores, specialty hardware stores, and online retailers that specialize in chemicals and lab supplies. It may also sometimes be available at larger hardware stores or home improvement centers. However, it is important to note that zinc chloride is a highly corrosive substance and should be handled with care and possibly only by those with proper training or experience working with chemicals.
