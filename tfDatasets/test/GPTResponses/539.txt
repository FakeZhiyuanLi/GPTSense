The Monte Carlo method is a computational technique used in statistical analysis and probabilistic modeling. It involves using random sampling and probability distributions to simulate a wide range of possible outcomes and calculate the uncertainty of results. The method was first developed by physicists working on the Manhattan Project during World War II to simulate the behavior of neutrons in nuclear reactions. Today, it is used in many fields, including finance, engineering, and scientific research. The name "Monte Carlo" comes from the famous casino resort in Monaco, where the method was first used to test gambling strategies.
