Activist anthropology is a type of anthropology that focuses on a political agenda rather than on contributing to science. It involves using anthropological theory and methods to advance a social or political cause, whether it is to promote human rights, challenge oppression and inequality, or advocate for environmental sustainability. Activist anthropologists often work alongside social movements, non-governmental organizations, and community groups to bring about social change, and may use their research and advocacy to influence policy, public opinion, and cultural norms.
