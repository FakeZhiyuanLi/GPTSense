does this mean?When it is said that insects are considered terrestrial, it means that they live and thrive on land, as opposed to living in water or other aquatic environments. Terrestrial insects are adapted to live and move around on solid ground, which includes various habitats such as forests, grasslands, deserts, and even human-made environments like homes, offices, and gardens. They have a variety of specialized features, such as wings, legs, and antennae, that allow them to navigate through different terrains and survive in their surroundings.
