Cilia are hair-like structures found on the surface of some cells in the body, including the lining of the respiratory tract and the fallopian tubes. They are used for various functions, such as moving mucus or other substances in a particular direction, or helping cells move. Cilia are made up of microtubules and are capable of beating in a coordinated fashion, allowing them to propel fluids or particles along a surface.
