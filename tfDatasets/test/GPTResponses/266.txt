Peremptory norms, also known as jus cogens, are fundamental and non-derogable principles of international law that are considered to be universally recognized and accepted by the international community. These norms are distinguished from other principles of customary law in that they cannot be modified, altered, or deviated from by agreement or customary practice.Other principles of customary law, on the other hand, are subject to modification and adaptation through changes in state practice and the evolution of customary law. They are also subject to the principle of treaty law, which allows for states to negotiate and enter into agreements that may modify or deviate from customary law principles.Furthermore, peremptory norms are considered to be higher in rank than other principles of customary law, meaning that they can override conflicting provisions in treaties or other sources of international law. This distinguishes them from other principles of customary law, which may be superseded by treaty law or other sources of international law.Overall, the distinguishing feature of peremptory norms is their fundamental and non-derogable status in international law, which sets them apart from other principles of customary law that are subject to modification and adaptation over time.
