Unfortunately, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this question as I do not have the current population data of Majuro and Ebeye on hand. However, in 2011, the combined population of Majuro and Ebeye was approximately 24,300 out of a total population of the Marshall Islands of around 68,000. This is equivalent to a fraction of about 0.36 or 36%. It is important to note that this information may not be up-to-date and the fraction may have changed since then.
