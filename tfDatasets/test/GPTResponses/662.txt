The Planck constant was not formerly known by any other name. It was named after the German physicist Max Planck who first described it in 1900 as a fundamental physical constant that relates a photon's energy to its frequency. It is denoted by the symbol h and has a value of approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 joule-seconds.
