Rías Altas is a geographical area located in the northwestern part of Spain, in the autonomous community of Galicia. It is known for its rugged coastline, which is characterized by deep inlets or estuaries called "rías" (meaning "fjords" in Galician language) that provide sheltered harbors for fishing boats and sailboats. "Altas" means "high" or "tall" in Spanish, referring to the elevated cliffs and hills that line the coastline.
