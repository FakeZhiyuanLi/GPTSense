Efforts were made to reduce analog HDTV to approximately twice the bandwidth of SDTV, which is about 6 MHz. This was achieved through the use of digital compression techniques such as MPEG-2 and MPEG-4, which allowed for more efficient use of the available bandwidth. This enabled broadcasters to transmit HDTV programming using the same amount of bandwidth as SDTV, making it possible for consumers to receive high-quality digital television signals without having to invest in expensive new equipment or pay higher subscription fees.
