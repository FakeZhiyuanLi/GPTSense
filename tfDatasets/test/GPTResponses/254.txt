No, John von Neumann did not rule out hidden variable theories. In fact, he was a proponent of such theories and believed that they could potentially explain the uncertain predictions of quantum mechanics. However, his work ultimately contributed to the development of quantum mechanics as a probabilistic theory, rather than a deterministic one based on hidden variables.
