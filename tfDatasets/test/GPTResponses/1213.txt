Multiple companies have contributed to the development of USB (Universal Serial Bus) technology. However, the key players that formed the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) and created the initial USB 1.0 specification in 1996 were Intel, Microsoft, Compaq, IBM, and Hewlett-Packard. Since then, many other companies have been involved in further development and improvement of the USB standard, including Apple, NEC, Philips, and others.
