Annelids use their jaws for feeding. Jaws or mandibles are a specialized mouthpart that helps them to capture and grind food. The type and shape of mandibles vary according to the feeding habits of different annelids. For example, predatory annelids like the marine polychaetes have sharp, pointed jaws for capturing prey, whereas earthworms have simple and muscular jaws for crushing and grinding their food. Some annelids, such as leeches, do not have jaws and feed by swallowing their prey whole.
