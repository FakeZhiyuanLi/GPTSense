When the Ottoman Empire conquered a region, the people, their resources, and their territories also became a part of the empire. This included their political systems, economies, cultures, and religions. The Ottomans were known for their policy of assimilation, which meant that they tried to incorporate the conquered peoples into the Ottoman way of life. This included giving them rights and privileges, such as the right to practice their religion and the right to govern their own communities to some extent, as long as they paid taxes and remained loyal to the Ottoman state. Over time, some of these groups became fully integrated into the Ottoman Empire, while others maintained distinct cultural and religious identities.
