The oldest script that is still in use today is most likely the Phoenician alphabet, which dates back to around 1200 BC. While it is no longer used as a writing system, it was the basis for the Greek and Latin alphabets, which are still used today. Additionally, some modern scripts such as Hebrew and Arabic also have roots in the Phoenician alphabet.
