External portable USB hard drive disks offer additional storage capacity for storing data, files, and documents that cannot fit into the original storage space of a computer, laptop, or tablet. They provide a convenient way of carrying around large amounts of data, allowing users to have easy access to their files wherever they go. External portable USB hard drives are also a form of backup and provide an extra layer of protection against data loss in case the original storage device fails. They are lightweight, compact, and easy to use, making them a popular choice for both personal and business use.
