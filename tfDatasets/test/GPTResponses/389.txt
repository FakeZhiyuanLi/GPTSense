After the decline of the Gupta Empire, it reverted to smaller feudal states ruled by local maharajas or chieftains. These states frequently struggled for power and were constantly attacked by outside forces such as the Huns and the Turks. This period is known as the Post Gupta period or the Early Medieval period in Indian history.
