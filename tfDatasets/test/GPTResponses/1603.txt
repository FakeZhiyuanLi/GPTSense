The concept of a factory system can be traced back to the Industrial Revolution in Europe in the 18th century. However, specific individuals cannot be credited with the founding of factories as the system developed gradually over time through the efforts of many people. Some pioneers in the development of factory systems include Richard Arkwright, Samuel Slater, and Eli Whitney.
