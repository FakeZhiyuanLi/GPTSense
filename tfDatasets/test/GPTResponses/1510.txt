Baruch Spinoza believed that everything in the universe is part of God, and that God is not separate from the natural world. He believed that the laws of nature were equivalent to the commands of God, and that the universe is self-sufficient and eternal. Therefore, Spinoza did not use any traditional proofs for the existence of God based on morality or design, but rather argued for God's existence as a necessary and intrinsic component of the natural world.
