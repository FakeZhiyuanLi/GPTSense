The Trinity in Christianity is the belief that God exists in three forms: the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit. This is also referred to as the Triune God. Christians believe that each person of the Trinity is co-equal and co-eternal, and that they are distinct but inseparable. The doctrine of the Trinity is considered a fundamental belief in Christianity.
