The air mass lying above the Sahara is known as the Sahara Air Layer (SAL). It is a hot, dry, and dusty layer of air that can extend several kilometers into the atmosphere. This air mass often contains a mix of sand, dust, and other particulate matter, and it can have a significant impact on weather patterns both locally and around the world. The SAL typically moves westward from the Sahara towards the Atlantic Ocean and can influence the formation of tropical storms and hurricanes over the Atlantic.
