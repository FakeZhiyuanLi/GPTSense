Deep house music emerged in the 1980s in Chicago and was popular with the LGBTQ+ community, primarily African American and Latino people, who frequented clubs such as The Warehouse and The Music Box. It later gained popularity in various cities such as New York, London, and Berlin, among other places. Today, it has a global fan base, but its roots and early influences come from Chicago's underground club scene.
