There are several reasons why the wind industry in the USA is able to produce more power at a lower cost:1. Technology advancements: The technology used in wind turbines has improved significantly over the years, making them more efficient and capable of producing more power. The development of larger turbines with longer blades, innovative blade designs, better materials, and advanced control systems has increased the capacity factor and overall efficiency of wind farms.2. Favorable policies: The federal government and some states have implemented policies such as production tax credits, investment tax credits, and renewable portfolio standards that provide financial incentives for wind energy development. These policies help to reduce the cost of wind energy and make it more competitive with conventional sources of energy.3. Economies of scale: As the wind industry continues to grow, economies of scale have come into play, resulting in reduced costs for wind turbine production, operation, and maintenance.4. Competitive procurement: Some utilities and power purchasers, particularly in the Midwest and Great Plains regions, have adopted a competitive procurement process for wind energy. This has led to lower costs for utilities and consumers.5. Improved project development: Wind project developers have become better at selecting prime locations for wind farms, improving project siting and design, and reducing costs associated with project development.Overall, the combination of technological advancements, favorable policies, economies of scale, competitive procurement, and improved project development has helped the wind industry in the USA produce more power at a lower cost.
