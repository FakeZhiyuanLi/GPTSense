the angular momentum of a particle or system of particles. It is a fundamental property of particles with non-zero intrinsic angular momentum, or spin, such as electrons, protons, and nuclei. The gyromagnetic ratio is denoted by the symbol gamma (γ) and has units of radians per second per tesla (rad s⁻¹ T⁻¹). It determines the precession frequency of the spin in a magnetic field and is a key parameter in many applications of magnetic resonance, such as MRI and NMR spectroscopy.
