One example of a mutually beneficial process indicating the coevolution of plants and insects is the relationship between fig trees and fig wasps. Female fig wasps lay their eggs inside the figs, and in the process, they pollinate the flowers. The fig tree provides a habitat and food for the wasps, and the wasps help the fig tree reproduce. This relationship has coevolved over millions of years, with each species adapting to better suit the needs of the other.
