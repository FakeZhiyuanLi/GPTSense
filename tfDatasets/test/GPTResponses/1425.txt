MTP (Media Transfer Protocol) became the primary storage access protocol of the Android operating system for several reasons:1. Security: MTP provides a more secure way to transfer files between devices. Unlike USB Mass Storage, MTP offers read-only access to the device's storage, preventing malicious software from infecting the device or its data.2. Compatibility: MTP is a standardized protocol, which means it's supported by most devices, including macOS, Linux, and Windows. This ensures that Android devices can be easily connected to and used with other devices, regardless of their operating system.3. Convenience: MTP offers more convenient file management options than USB Mass Storage. For example, MTP allows users to browse and transfer files while the device is still in use, without having to wait for a "safely remove" process.4. Synchronization: MTP is designed to synchronize multimedia content (such as music and videos) between devices, making it ideal for media players and other multimedia devices.5. Speed: MTP provides faster data transfer rates than USB Mass Storage, allowing users to transfer large files more quickly and efficiently.Overall, MTP represents a more modern, reliable, and secure file transfer protocol, which is why it has become the primary storage access protocol of the Android operating system.
