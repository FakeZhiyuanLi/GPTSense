An author may utilize experimental narratives in literature for several reasons:1. To challenge traditional storytelling techniques: By experimenting with narrative techniques, an author can subvert readers' expectations and challenge the traditional ways in which stories are told.2. To explore the nature of reality: Experimental narratives often blur the boundaries between reality and fantasy or allow characters to experience multiple, conflicting realities, allowing the author to explore the nature of truth and perception.3. To express subjectivity: Experimental narratives allow authors to express the subjective experiences of their characters in unique and creative ways.4. To break down barriers: By eschewing traditional narrative structures and techniques, authors can break down the barriers between different genres or forms of writing, creating a more fluid, open-ended approach to storytelling.5. To encourage reader participation: Experimental narratives often require a more active engagement from readers, challenging them to interpret the story in their own way and encouraging them to think critically about the text.
