USB devices are linked to a computer or other devices through a USB port, which is a standardized interface for connecting peripheral devices. The device is connected to the USB port via a USB cable, and the computer or device recognizes the device through the operating system's USB drivers. Once connected, the device can interact with the computer, allowing data transfer, communication, or other actions depending on the specific device. Multiple USB devices can be connected to a single computer or device, and USB hubs can be used to expand the number of available ports.
