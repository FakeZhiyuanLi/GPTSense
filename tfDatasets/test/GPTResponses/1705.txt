The main requirement for electric feeder stations is to receive high voltage electrical power from long-distance transmission lines and distribute this power at a reduced voltage to homes, businesses, and other electrical loads in the local area. These stations must have transformers, circuit breakers, switches, and other equipment to regulate and control the flow of electricity, as well as backup generators and other systems for reliability and safety. Additionally, feeder stations must also be strategically located near the areas that they serve and designed to handle the expected peak electricity demand.
