In 1964, a Greek Cypriot nationalist organization called EOKA-B, with the support of the Greek military junta, attempted to overthrow the Cypriot government and unify the island with Greece. This led to a series of violent clashes between Greek and Turkish Cypriots and eventually a Turkish military intervention in 1974.
