The USB 3.1 standard increases data transfer rates up to 10 Gbps (gigabits per second) which is almost twice as fast as the previous USB 3.0 standard. It also includes a reversible Type-C connector that is smaller, more durable, and can be used for both power and data transfer. Additionally, USB 3.1 can deliver more power to devices, up to 100 watts, which allows for faster charging of devices such as smartphones and laptops.
