When a home is worth less than the mortgage loan, it is commonly referred to as being "underwater" or having negative equity. In such a scenario, the financial incentive for the homeowner is limited as the value of the home is less than the outstanding mortgage loan. However, if the homeowner is struggling to make their mortgage payments, they may be motivated to negotiate with their lender to seek a loan modification, a short sale, or a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. In some cases, the lender may agree to reduce the principal balance of the loan or facilitate a refinance to help the homeowner avoid foreclosure. It is important to note that the impact of being underwater on a home's value may vary depending on the local housing market and economic conditions.
