The Patriot Act made it easier for law enforcement to search several things, including:1. Communication records: The act allowed law enforcement agencies to gain easy access to telephone, email, and internet communication records.2. Financial records: It permitted the government to access financial records of individuals or businesses.3. Library records: The act authorized the FBI to seek and obtain library records that could be deemed relevant to an ongoing investigation.4. Surveillance: The act expanded the use of surveillance cameras and wiretapping by federal law enforcement agencies.5. Border searches: It increased the ability of law enforcement agencies to conduct searches at the US borders, such as airport and passport checks.6. Roving wiretaps: The act allowed federal intelligence agencies to use "roving wiretaps," which permit eavesdropping on any phone line linked to a particular target, not just the phone specified in a warrant.
