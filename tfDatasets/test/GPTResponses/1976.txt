Insects have a three-part body structure, known as the thorax, abdomen, and head. This body structure is common to all insects and is often referred to as the "insect body plan." The thorax contains the wings and legs that are used for movement, while the abdomen contains the digestive and reproductive organs. The head contains the eyes, antennae, and mouthparts, which are used for sensing the environment and feeding. The body of an insect is typically covered with a hard exoskeleton, which provides protection and support.
