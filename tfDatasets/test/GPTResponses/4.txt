The Rhine river falls into depths at the Rheinbrech due to a geological feature known as the "Rhine Rift Valley". This steep valley was formed millions of years ago by the movement of tectonic plates, causing the land to sink and the river to carve out a deep channel. The Rhine falls specifically at the Rheinbrech due to the strong flow of water encountering the hard rock base of the valley, creating a dramatic waterfall.
