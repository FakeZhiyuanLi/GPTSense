A manifold vacuum plays an important role in the performance and efficiency of a car’s engine. It is the vacuum pressure that is created in the engine’s intake manifold when the throttle is closed or partially closed.The manifold vacuum serves various functions, including:1. Regulating the air-fuel mixture: As the manifold vacuum changes, it affects the carburetor’s fuel metering and the engine management system’s fuel injection, regulating the air-fuel mixture to ensure optimum performance.2. Power brakes: Most modern cars use a vacuum-operated power brake booster. The manifold vacuum assists the brake pedal apply extra pressure to the brakes so that the driver can apply the brakes with less effort.3. HVAC system: The vacuum created by the engine via the manifold vacuum is also used to work the HVAC system to move air through the vents.4. EGR system: Automotive manufacturers often use an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve to decrease engine emissions. This valve is opened by the application of vacuum pressure from the engine’s intake manifold.Overall, the manifold vacuum is critical for the proper functioning of a car's engine and various systems.
