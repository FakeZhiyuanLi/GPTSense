In a Unix or Linux operating system, a pipe is a special type of file that allows for communication between two or more processes. It is named at the time of creation, often with the pipe symbol "|" followed by a unique identifier. For example, a pipe could be named as "my_pipe" or "log_pipe". The name of the pipe is used by processes to read and write data to or from the pipe.  Overall, pipes are primarily used for inter-process communication, allowing different processes to share data and work together seamlessly.
