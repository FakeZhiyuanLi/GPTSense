According to the 2011 census data, the Turkish Cypriot population on Cyprus was approximately 294,906. However, it is worth noting that this number is disputed due to the division of the island into the internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus and the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which is recognized only by Turkey.
