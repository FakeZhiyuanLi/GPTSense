If disagreements exist within a party regarding the interpretation or implementation of a treaty that is unclear whether it is self-executing or non-self-executing, it can lead to a legal dispute. In such cases, courts may have to determine whether the treaty is self-executing or not, which can affect its legal status and the degree to which it can be enforced in domestic law. If the treaty is considered non-self-executing, it may require additional domestic legislation to give effect to its provisions. This can further complicate matters and potentially lead to delays in implementation, as well as potential conflicts between international and domestic law.
