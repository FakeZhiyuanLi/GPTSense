If all of Greenland's ice were to melt, global sea levels could rise by 23 feet (7 meters). If Antarctica's glaciers were to completely melt, sea levels could rise by around 200 feet (60 meters). However, the complete melting of these regions is highly unlikely to occur within the next few centuries. Nonetheless, even somewhat smaller amounts of melting could still result in significant increases in sea level that would have profound consequences for coastal cities and communities around the world.
