The US Constitution outlines a process for amending the Constitution in Article V, which states that amendments may be proposed by a two-thirds vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, or by a national convention called for by two-thirds of the state legislatures. These proposed amendments then must be ratified by three-fourths of the state legislatures or by conventions in three-fourths of the states within a specified time period.
