security and data protection purposes?The ability to boot write-locked SD cards with a USB adapter can be advantageous for security and data protection purposes because it prevents unauthorized modifications to critical system files and data stored on the card. By setting the card to read-only mode, any attempt to modify or delete files on the card will be denied, making it harder for hackers or malware programs to compromise the system or steal sensitive information.Furthermore, a write-locked SD card can also be used as a secure boot device, where the boot process is protected against unauthorized changes or tampering. This can provide an added layer of security to devices such as IoT devices, embedded systems, and mission-critical applications that require a high level of reliability and trustworthiness.Overall, the ability to boot write-locked SD cards with a USB adapter is advantageous for security and data protection purposes as it helps to prevent unauthorized access, modification, and theft of critical system files and data.
