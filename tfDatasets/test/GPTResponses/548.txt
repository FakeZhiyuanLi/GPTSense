Medial moraines are formed when two glaciers meet or converge. As the glaciers move towards each other, they pick up rocks, sediment, and debris from the valley walls and floor. These materials are then transported along the surface of the glaciers towards the point where they meet.When the two glaciers converge, their lateral moraines merge, forming a larger moraine in the middle of the two glaciers. This is known as a medial moraine. The debris carried by the glaciers is deposited on the glacier surface and forms a line along the center of the merged glacier.Medial moraines can be hundreds of meters long and several meters high. They are usually composed of unsorted rocks, sand, and mud. Over time, the glaciers continue to move and the debris in the medial moraines is slowly deposited onto the sides of the glaciers. As a result, the medial moraines become more prominent, and can be a visible sign of glacial movement and convergence.
