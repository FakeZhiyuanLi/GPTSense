Dielectric dispersion is regulated by several factors including the frequency of the applied electric field, the temperature, and the chemical composition and structure of the material. The interaction of electric fields with the molecules of the material also governs dielectric dispersion. The polarizability of the molecules, which depends on their shape and electron distribution, also plays a role in regulating dielectric dispersion. Additionally, the presence of impurities or defects in the material can affect the dielectric properties and cause dispersion.
