Yes, an energized segment of the third rail can pose a significant risk to pedestrians if left uncovered. The third rail typically carries a high voltage of electricity, which can result in severe injuries or even death if someone were to come into contact with an exposed segment. For this reason, it is crucial to ensure that all segments of the third rail are covered and secured at all times. In some cases, signs and barriers may also need to be put in place to prevent pedestrians from accessing the area around the third rail altogether.
