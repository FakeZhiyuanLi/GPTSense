The Irish Free State was a state in Ireland that existed from 1922 to 1937. It was established following the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921, which ended the Irish War of Independence and partitioned Ireland into two territories: Northern Ireland (part of the United Kingdom) and the Irish Free State (a self-governing entity within the British Commonwealth). The Irish Free State had its own government and parliament, but still recognized the British monarch as its head of state. In 1937, the Irish Free State was replaced by the modern-day Republic of Ireland, following a new constitution and the renunciation of the British monarch as head of state.
