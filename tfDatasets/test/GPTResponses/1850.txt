There are several factors that can lead to the wastage of energy in electric trains:1. Friction losses: Energy is lost due to friction in the train's bearings, wheels, and track. This can be reduced through proper lubrication and maintenance.2. Aerodynamic drag: Trains moving at high speeds experience significant air resistance, which results in energy losses. Shaping the train's body and adding fairings can reduce this drag.3. Braking: When an electric train brakes, energy is lost as heat. Regenerative braking systems can recover some of this energy, but not all.4. Inefficient motors: Electric trains that use inefficient motors, or motors that are not matched to the load, can waste energy.5. Excessive weight: Electric trains that are too heavy require more energy to move, resulting in increased energy consumption. This can be reduced by using lightweight materials in construction.
