One of the first philosophers to argue for the reality of creation was the Greek philosopher Plato. In his famous work "Timaeus", he describes the creation of the world and the universe by a divine craftsman, who forms them out of pre-existing matter. This idea of a divine creator and the existence of a pre-existing material form was the first argument for the reality of creation.
