Kaminfegerkinder is a German phrase that literally means "Chimney Sweeper Children". It refers to children who were historically employed as chimney sweeps in Germany and other European countries. The practice of using children as chimney sweeps was widespread in the past, particularly during the 18th and 19th centuries. These children were often from poor families and were forced to work long hours in dangerous conditions, inhaling soot and facing the risk of falls, burns, and other injuries. Today, child labor laws and increased awareness of the dangers of chimney sweeping have largely eliminated the use of children in this profession.
