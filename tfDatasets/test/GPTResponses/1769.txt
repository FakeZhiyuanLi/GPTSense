One example of an insect that can walk, fly, and swim is the water strider. These insects are often found on the surface of calm freshwater bodies such as ponds or lakes. They primarily use their long and slender legs to walk and run on the surface tension of the water. They can also fly short distances and swim by paddling their legs.
