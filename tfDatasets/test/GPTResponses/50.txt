Some believe that the Treaty of Versailles assisted in causing World War II by imposing harsh penalties on Germany, leading to economic and political turmoil in the country. The treaty's provisions, including the disarmament of Germany and the allocation of war reparations, contributed to the growth of resentment and nationalism in Germany, paving the way for the rise of the Nazi Party and the subsequent invasion of Poland in 1939. Additionally, the treaty's failure to address colonialism, self-determination for colonized peoples, and the global economic conditions of the time may have contributed to the outbreak of the Second World War.
