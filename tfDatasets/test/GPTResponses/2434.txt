Evaporation in a vacuum refers to the process where a substance is transformed from its liquid phase to its gaseous phase without the presence of a medium, such as air or water. This occurs in a vacuum because the absence of air molecules means that the pressure is lower and so the substance requires less energy to evaporate.Sublimation in a vacuum refers to the process where a substance is transformed directly from its solid phase to its gaseous phase without passing through the liquid phase. This can occur in a vacuum because the lower pressure and absence of air molecules means that the energy required to go from solid to gas is less. Sublimation occurs more readily in a vacuum than in normal atmospheric conditions.
