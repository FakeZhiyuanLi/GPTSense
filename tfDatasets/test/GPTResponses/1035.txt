During the final days of World War II, some of the German high command, including Adolf Hitler and his inner circle, sought refuge in underground bunkers located beneath the city of Berlin. Others attempted to flee the country and seek refuge in other parts of the world. Some fled to Switzerland or Spain, while others attempted to escape to South America using false identities and forged travel documents. Many were eventually captured and brought to justice for their war crimes. Some, however, managed to evade capture and live out their lives in hiding.
