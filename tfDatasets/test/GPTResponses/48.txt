The Zuiderzee brackish lagoon was transformed into the freshwater IJsselmeer lake through the construction of a dam (Afsluitdijk) in 1932, which closed off the North Sea from the shallow lagoon. This was done to prevent flooding and to reclaim land for agriculture and housing. The IJsselmeer lake is now the largest freshwater lake in the Netherlands.
