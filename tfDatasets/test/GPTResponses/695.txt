The Polish szlachta incorporated noble and aristocratic families, landowners, military officers, and influential figures in politics and culture. The szlachta was a privileged class that held significant power and influence in Poland-Lithuania during the 16th-18th centuries. They were granted rights and privileges such as exemption from taxes and conscription, and the ability to elect the Polish kings. The szlachta were also known for their love of freedom and individualism, which led to the development of a unique democratic system of government in Poland-Lithuania called the "Golden Liberty."
