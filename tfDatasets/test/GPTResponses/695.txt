Both Germany and the Soviet Union needed military machinery, as they were both heavily involved in World War II and required advanced weaponry and vehicles to compete in battle. However, the Soviet Union had a greater need for military machinery due to the extensive nature of their war efforts, including the need to defend against invasion and conduct large-scale military operations on multiple fronts. Additionally, the Soviet Union was more focused on industrialization and building up their military machine during this time period, while Germany was already relatively well-established and had a more streamlined military infrastructure.
