The process of selecting a candidate for a job or college admission can sometimes seem arbitrary today. Even though applicants may have similar qualifications and experiences, the final decision on who gets selected can often come down to subjective factors like an interviewer's personal preferences or unconscious biases. This can be frustrating for applicants who feel like they have put in a lot of effort but still don't receive the opportunity they believe they deserve.
