According to Avicenna, reason interacts with sensation in the brain. Avicenna believed that the brain was the central organ of sensation and that the sensory input from the various sense organs was processed and interpreted by the brain. He proposed that the sensory information was first received by the sensory faculties, or the "common sense", which then transmitted this information to the "imagination", which is responsible for forming mental images or representations of objects. Finally, the "imaginative power" interacted with the "rational power", or reason, to form concepts and judgments about the sensory information. Thus, reason and sensation worked together in the brain to create knowledge and understanding of the world.
