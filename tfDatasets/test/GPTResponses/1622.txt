Trains are able to turn around after each completed journey by using a turntable, a wye or a loop. A turntable is a rotating platform that can be turned by hand or by machinery to change the direction of the train. A wye is a track layout that has a triangular shape with two tracks leading to a common track or junction, which allows the train to turn around by switching tracks. A loop is a track layout that has a loop shape that can be used to change the direction of the train without creating any switches or junctions. The train can continue in the same direction, but in reverse, by following the loop. The chosen method will depend on the track layout, the length of the train, and the availability of resources.
