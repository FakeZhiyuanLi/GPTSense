The meeting that brought about changes in France's policy towards its colonies was the Brazzaville Conference in 1944. At this conference, General Charles de Gaulle, the leader of the Free French, announced a policy of “association” between France and its colonies, which signaled a move towards greater autonomy for the colonies. This marked a departure from the previous policy of “assimilation” which aimed to make the colonies fully French. The Brazzaville Conference paved the way for the decolonization process in France's African colonies.
