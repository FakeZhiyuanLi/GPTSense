One cause of dielectric losses in a capacitor is the presence of impurities or defects in the dielectric material which causes the energy to be dissipated as heat due to the resistance of the imperfect structure. Another cause could be the polarity reversal of the capacitor when AC voltage is applied, which generates hysteresis loss and other dissipative losses in the dielectric material.
