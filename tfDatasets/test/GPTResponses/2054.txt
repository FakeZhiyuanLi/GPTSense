The quality of a partial vacuum refers to the level of pressure reduction, or the degree to which the pressure of a gas is lowered below atmospheric pressure. It can also refer to the purity of the gas within the vacuum, as a lower pressure can increase the chance of contamination due to the greater ease with which particles can diffuse into the vacuum space.
