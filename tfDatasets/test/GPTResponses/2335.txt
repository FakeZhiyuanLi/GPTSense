Gas exchange patterns can contain various types of ventilation, including:1. Diffusion: The movement of oxygen and carbon dioxide molecules from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration.2. Convection: The movement of air through the respiratory system by muscular action, typically via breathing movements.3. Countercurrent exchange: The exchange of gases between two fluids moving in opposite directions, often seen in fish gills.4. Crosscurrent exchange: The exchange of gases between two fluids moving in perpendicular directions, as observed in bird and mammal lungs.5. Tidal ventilation: The movement of air in and out of the lungs, which is the most common form of ventilation in terrestrial animals.6. Unidirectional ventilation: The continuous flow of air through the respiratory system, typically seen in aquatic animals like fish and some amphibians.
