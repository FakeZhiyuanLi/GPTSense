Boris Yeltsin was in Moscow during the coup in August 1991. He was the first President of Russia at the time and was a vocal opponent of the attempted coup by communist hardliners who were trying to overthrow Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Yeltsin played a key role in opposing the coup and rallying support for Gorbachev's reform policies. He famously stood on a tank in front of the Russian White House, the seat of the Russian government, and urged people to resist the coup. This helped to galvanize opposition to the coup and contributed to its eventual failure.
