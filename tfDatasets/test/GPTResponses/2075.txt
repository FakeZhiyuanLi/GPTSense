The Vedas are a collection of ancient Hindu scriptures that describe various aspects of life such as spirituality, philosophy, mythology, ritual practices, ethics, and social values. The Vedas contain hymns, prayers, and mantras that were recited by the ancient seers or Rishis to appease the gods and seek their blessings. They are considered to be the oldest and most authoritative scriptures of Hinduism and provide the fundamental knowledge of Hindu culture and religion. The Vedas are divided into four main texts: Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda, and Atharvaveda.
