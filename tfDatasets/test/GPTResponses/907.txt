The central theme of the Gospel of John in the resurrection is the belief in the divinity of Jesus Christ and the triumph of life over death. The resurrection of Jesus is presented as the ultimate proof of his identity as the Son of God and the Messiah, and the fulfillment of God's plan of salvation for humanity. The resurrection also emphasizes the power of God's love and the promise of eternal life for those who believe in Jesus.
