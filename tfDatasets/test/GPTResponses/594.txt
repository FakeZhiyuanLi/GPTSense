Islamic scholars and historians generally maintain that there was a treaty between Prophet Muhammad and the Banu Qurayza tribe, which was subsequently breached by the tribe during the Battle of the Trench. The story is documented in various Islamic sources, including the Quran and hadiths. However, some non-Muslim scholars and critics have cast doubt on the authenticity of the story, claiming that it may have been exaggerated or invented in order to justify the expulsion and punishment of the Banu Qurayza.
