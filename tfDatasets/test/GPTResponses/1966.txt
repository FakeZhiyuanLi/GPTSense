Other states became part of Mexico at various times during the country's history. Mexico gained its independence from Spain in 1821 and initially included parts of modern-day Mexico, the United States, and Central America. Over the following decades, Mexico expanded its territory through military conquest and colonization.Some of the states that became part of Mexico through territorial expansion include:- California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Texas, Colorado, and Wyoming were incorporated into Mexico after gaining independence from Spain. These territories were later ceded to the United States following the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848.- Chiapas, Tabasco, and Yucatan (which included Quintana Roo, Campeche, and parts of Belize and Guatemala) were part of the Captaincy General of Guatemala under Spanish rule. They joined Mexico shortly after its independence.- Baja California and Baja California Sur were colonized by Spain in the 16th century but remained sparsely populated until the 19th century. They became Mexican states in 1952.Overall, Mexico's territorial history is complex and spans several centuries.
