China has a long history of centralized power, dating back more than 2,000 years to the time of the Qin Dynasty (221-206 BCE) when the first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, established a centralized imperial system. Throughout China's history, different dynasties and rulers have attempted to consolidate power and create a centralized system of government. The modern history of China's centralized power began with the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, which remains one of the most powerful centralized governments in the world.
