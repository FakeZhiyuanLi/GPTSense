The natural defensive response that is hindered by cells in granulomas that can't send antigen to lymphocytes is the activation of adaptive immunity. The immune system requires the presentation of antigens to lymphocytes, through a process known as antigen presentation, in order to activate an immune response. Granulomas, which are clusters of immune cells that form in response to persistent infections, can inhibit this process by blocking the access of antigens to lymphocytes. As a result, the immune system may not mount an effective response against the infection, leading to chronic inflammation and tissue damage.
