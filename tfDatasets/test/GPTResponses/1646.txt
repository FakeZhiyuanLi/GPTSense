One problem with biomass is that it requires a large amount of land to produce enough material for energy production. This can lead to competition for land use between energy production and food production, which can have negative impacts on food security and ecological balance. Additionally, if not managed sustainably, biomass production can also cause deforestation, soil degradation, and loss of biodiversity.
