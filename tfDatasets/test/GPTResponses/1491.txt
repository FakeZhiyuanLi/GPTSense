It can be difficult to diagnose active TB by patients' symptoms alone, as the symptoms may be similar to other respiratory illnesses such as the flu or a cold. Common symptoms of active TB include persistent coughing, coughing up blood, fever, fatigue, night sweats, and unintentional weight loss. However, these symptoms can also be present in other conditions, making it important for patients to undergo medical testing such as a TB skin test or chest x-ray to confirm a diagnosis.
