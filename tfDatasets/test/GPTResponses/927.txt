According to the Apostle Paul's writings in the New Testament, the crucifixion and the resurrection are closely related. Paul emphasizes that Jesus' death on the cross was necessary for the forgiveness of sins and to redeem humanity. In his letter to the Romans, Paul writes, "For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his" (Romans 6:5). This suggests that through his death and resurrection, Jesus achieved victory over sin and death, and those who believe in him can have eternal life. Overall, Paul's teachings assert that Jesus' death and resurrection are essential for the salvation of humanity.
