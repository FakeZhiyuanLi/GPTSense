Political economists have most recently focused on the issues of income inequality, globalization, and climate change. The widening gap between the rich and the poor is seen as a significant concern for political economists, as it has a profound impact on the distribution of wealth, economic growth, and social stability. Globalization is another critical area of focus, as it involves the integration of national economies into a global network, with implications for employment, trade, and governance. Lastly, climate change has emerged as an important issue, as its impacts can significantly affect the economic dynamics of countries and regions, particularly in relation to resources, production, and consumption patterns.
