Parapodia are paired, segmental, protruding appendages found on the body of polychaete worms, which are a type of marine annelid. They play an important role in locomotion, sensory perception, and respiration. Parapodia are covered with numerous bristles or setae, which the worm uses to crawl or swim through the water. The shape, size, and number of parapodia vary greatly among different species of polychaetes, and they can be used to identify and classify the different types of worms.
