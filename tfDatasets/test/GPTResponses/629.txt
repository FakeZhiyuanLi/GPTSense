Avicenna, also known as Ibn Sina, grounded his psychology on the concept of the soul (nafs) and the intellect (aql). He believed that the soul is the principle of life and consciousness in living organisms and that the intellect is the faculty of the soul that enables it to acquire knowledge and understanding. He also emphasized the importance of the senses and perception in the acquisition of knowledge, and he developed a detailed theory of perception that distinguished between various types of sensory experiences. Additionally, Avicenna believed in the existence of the unconscious mind and recognized the role of emotions in human psychology.
