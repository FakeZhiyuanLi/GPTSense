The darker post-punk bands started to appear in the indie scene in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Some of the notable bands include Joy Division, Bauhaus, Siouxsie and the Banshees, The Cure, and The Chameleons. Their dark and brooding sound and style were a departure from the upbeat and jangly sound of the earlier indie and punk rock bands. The influence of these bands can still be felt in many contemporary indie and alternative rock bands.
