The locomotives could run on four speed levels by having a system that allows for the greater or lesser amount of power to be supplied to the locomotive's engine as needed to increase or decrease the speed. This system could be controlled through a mechanism such as a throttle or a computerized control system that the engineer could use to regulate the locomotive's speed. Depending on the design of the locomotive and the technology used, the locomotive could have four discrete speed levels that correspond to different levels of power fed to the engine or more granular control that allows for a nearly infinite range of speeds.
