The number of electrons that builds up on the negative plate is equal to the number of electrons that departs the positive plate. This is due to the conservation of charge, which states that charge cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or redistributed. Therefore, for every electron that leaves one plate, another electron must enter the other plate to maintain a balance of charge.
