The stage of development that differentiates a 4-stage metamorphosis from a 3-stage metamorphosis is the pupal stage. The pupal stage is notably absent in a 3-stage metamorphosis, where the larval stage directly transforms into the adult stage without an intermediate pupal stage. In a 4-stage metamorphosis, the larval stage transforms into a pupal stage, which eventually transforms into the adult stage. This additional stage allows for significant anatomical and physiological changes to occur before the adult stage, resulting in a more complex and differentiated life cycle.
