The feature unique to laserdisc that made bonus content possible was the ability to store a large amount of additional content in the form of interactive menus, behind-the-scenes documentaries, and director's commentaries on a separate track on the disc. This feature allowed viewers to access and explore additional content beyond the main feature film, making it popular for home theater enthusiasts and film collectors.
