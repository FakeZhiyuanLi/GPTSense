Sociology and culture have roots in various fields such as philosophy, political science, economics, anthropology, and history. These fields contributed to the development of the study of society and its culture. The modern discipline of sociology emerged in the late 19th century and early 20th century, with the works of famous sociologists such as Auguste Comte, Herbert Spencer, Karl Marx, and Ã‰mile Durkheim. These early sociologists helped to establish the foundation for the study of society and its culture, which has continued to evolve over time.
