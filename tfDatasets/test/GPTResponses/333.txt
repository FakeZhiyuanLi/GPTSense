If a treaty included an expiration date, it can be assumed that the parties intended for the treaty's obligations to cease upon the expiration of the specified date. The expiration date is a mutually agreed upon end date for the treaty's validity, beyond which the treaty's provisions will no longer be in effect. The inclusion of an expiration date indicates that the parties did not intend for the treaty to be a permanent commitment, but rather a fixed period of time during which the provisions of the treaty would apply. Once the expiration date is reached, the parties are no longer bound by the obligations set out in the treaty.
