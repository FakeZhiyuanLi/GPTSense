In quantum mechanics, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that it is impossible to simultaneously measure certain pairs of physical properties, such as position and momentum, with arbitrary precision. This means that when attempting to measure one property with high precision, the uncertainty in the measurement of the other property increases. Therefore, any measurement in quantum mechanics involves making trade-offs between the precision of different properties that are being measured. The forces that drive this trade-off are the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics and the limitations of the measurement apparatus.
