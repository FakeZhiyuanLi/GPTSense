The English word "god" is derived from the Germanic word "gudan," which is related to the Old Norse word "gu√∞," both of which mean "god" or "divine being." These words are derived from the Proto-Germanic word "gudan," which is believed to have come from the Proto-Indo-European root "gheu," meaning "to invoke."
