Anyone who is adversely affected by an administrative order should be able to challenge it in court. This includes individuals, groups, and other organizations that have been directly or indirectly affected by the order. In some cases, administrative orders may affect a larger community or the public at large, such as environmental regulations or zoning laws. In such cases, public interest groups or advocacy organizations may also be allowed to challenge the order in court.
