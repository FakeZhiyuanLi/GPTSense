Stalin signed the Non-Aggression Pact with Nazi Germany in August 1939 for several reasons:1. Buying time: Stalin knew that a war with Germany was inevitable but was not ready for it at the time. By signing the pact, he hoped to buy time to prepare his military and industry for war.2. Securing Soviet borders: Stalin was concerned about the security of the Soviet Union's borders, especially after the failure of collective security during the Spanish Civil War. Signing the pact with Germany allowed him to secure the western border and avoid a two-front war.3. Distrust of the West: Stalin did not trust the Western powers, which he believed were more interested in containing the Soviet Union than defeating Nazi Germany. By signing the pact, he hoped to prevent the Western powers from turning against the Soviet Union.4. Division of Poland: Under the pact, Germany and the Soviet Union agreed to divide Poland between them. Stalin saw this as an opportunity to regain some of the territory lost by the Soviet Union during the Polish-Soviet War of 1919-1920.5. Ideological similarities: Despite their ideological differences, Stalin saw a common interest with Hitler in opposing the Western capitalist democracies.
