There are several components that can be added to the equivalent circuit of a capacitor to deal with leakage current and parasitic effects:1. Leakage resistor: A leakage resistor can be added in series with the capacitor to limit the flow of leakage current.2. Dielectric absorption resistance: Dielectric absorption is a phenomenon where a capacitor retains its charge even after the charging voltage has been removed. This effect can be mitigated by adding a resistance in parallel with the capacitor to discharge it more quickly.3. ESR and ESL: Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR) and Equivalent Series Inductance (ESL) are parasitic effects that can reduce the performance of a capacitor. These effects can be mitigated by adding a small resistance in series with the capacitor and a small inductor in parallel with the capacitor respectively.4. Lead resistance: The resistance of leads used to connect the capacitor can also affect its performance. This can be accounted for by adding a small resistance in series with the capacitor.5. Temperature effects: The performance of capacitors can be affected by changes in temperature. This can be accounted for by adding a temperature coefficient to the equivalent circuit.
