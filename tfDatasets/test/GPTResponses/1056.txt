Native earthworms were killed by glaciers in areas that were covered by thick glacial ice during the last Ice Age, which occurred approximately 2.6 million to 11,700 years ago. Glacial ice is extremely cold and can reach temperatures well below freezing, which is lethal to earthworms and many other organisms. As glacial ice receded, new habitats were created for earthworms to colonize, leading to the development of different species and populations around the globe.
