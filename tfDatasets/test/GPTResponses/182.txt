Feminist anthropologists are centrally concerned about understanding the ways in which gender and power intersect in different societies and cultures. They examine how gender inequalities and social hierarchies are perpetuated through cultural practices, norms, and institutions, and how these affect women's lives in particular. Feminist anthropologists also study how gender intersects with other aspects of identity such as race, class, sexuality, and nationality, and how these multiple identities affect people's experiences of marginalization and oppression. Moreover, they explore how women have agency and resist gender inequalities, contribute to social change, and reinterpret their own cultural ideals and practices.
