A null hypothesis is a statement that there is no significant difference between two sets of data, or that a certain observed phenomenon is random and not caused by a specific factor. Therefore, a null hypothesis is tested against an alternative hypothesis, which suggests that there is a significant difference or relationship between the data or phenomenon being studied. The null hypothesis is typically the default assumption in a statistical analysis, and the goal of statistical testing is to either reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.
