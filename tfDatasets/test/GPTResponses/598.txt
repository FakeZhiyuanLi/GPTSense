is known as hoarding or stockpiling. This means that the government buys up large quantities of food, often to store or export, rather than ensuring that it is distributed fairly to those who need it most within their own country. This can lead to price increases, scarcity and even famine. Additionally, corruption and mismanagement within the distribution system can also impact food security, as food may not reach those who need it most. Lack of access to basic infrastructure such as roads and storage facilities can also impact food security by making it difficult to transport and store food, especially in remote or rural areas.
