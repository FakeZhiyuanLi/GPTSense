Polychaetes, also known as bristle worms, have a segmented body with a pair of ganglia, or nerve clusters, in each segment. These ganglia act as their brain and are connected by a ventral nerve cord that runs along the length of their body. Therefore, polychaetes have multiple brains distributed throughout their body.
