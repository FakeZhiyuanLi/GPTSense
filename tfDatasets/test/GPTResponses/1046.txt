Muslims form one of the largest minority groups in India and account for approximately 14% of the country's population. They have been an integral part of the Indian population for centuries and have contributed significantly to the country's social, economic, and cultural development. Muslims are found in all parts of India, with the majority living in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, and Assam. In terms of socio-economic status, Muslims are generally considered to be among the most disadvantaged communities in India, with higher rates of poverty, illiteracy, and unemployment compared to the national average. Despite this, many Muslims have achieved success in various fields, including business, politics, and entertainment.
