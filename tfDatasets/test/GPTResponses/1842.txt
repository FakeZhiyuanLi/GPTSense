The third movement that influenced the Ottoman literary scene was modernism or "tanzimat" in Turkish. This movement aimed to modernize Ottoman society and literature by incorporating western ideals and techniques while still maintaining Ottoman identity and tradition. Tanzimat literature often dealt with social issues and political reform, and emphasized individualism and realism in style.
