The attempt to understand other societies on their own terms is cultural relativism. It is an approach to anthropology and other social sciences that involves attempting to understand the beliefs, practices, and values of a culture from within that culture's own framework, rather than imposing the values and norms of one's own culture onto the other. The goal of cultural relativism is to gain a deeper appreciation and understanding of different cultures and to avoid ethnocentric assumptions and judgments.
