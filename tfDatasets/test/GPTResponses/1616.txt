Some groups started looking for methods to release their music themselves in the late 1970s and early 1980s with the rise of punk and independent music scenes. These groups wanted more control over their music and the ability to release it without relying on record labels. The development of cassette tapes and home recording technology also made it easier for independent musicians to produce and distribute their own music.
