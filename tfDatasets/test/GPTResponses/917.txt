The two main approaches to defining the concept of the rule of law are:1. Formal approach: This approach emphasizes the importance of having clear and predictable laws, impartial and independent courts, and the proper application of laws by the government. Under this approach, the rule of law is seen as a procedural concept that ensures equal treatment under the law and protects individual rights, such as due process and fair trial.2. Substantive approach: This approach highlights the values and principles that underpin the rule of law, such as accountability, transparency, and the protection of human rights. It goes beyond the mere existence of laws and institutions to include the quality of justice and the degree to which laws are enforced fairly and consistently. Under this approach, the rule of law is seen as a substantive concept that promotes the common good and ensures the legitimacy of government actions.
