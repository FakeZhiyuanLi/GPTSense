People have been living on the edge of deserts for thousands of years. Some ancient civilizations such as the Sumerians and the Egyptians settled along the Nile River, which is surrounded by a desert. Nomadic tribes have also traditionally inhabited the fringes of deserts, such as the Bedouins in the Arabian and Sahara deserts. The exact timeline of when people began settling on the edge of deserts is difficult to determine due to the lack of written records from that time period. However, archaeological evidence suggests that it has been happening for thousands of years.
