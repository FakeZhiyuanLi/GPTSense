The influence of the Atlantic Ocean that makes the temperatures fluctuate more than on the coast is the ocean's moderating effect. The Atlantic Ocean moderates the temperature on the coast, keeping it cooler in summer and warmer in winter, due to its slower warming and cooling compared to land. This moderating effect is less pronounced further inland, where temperatures can vary more widely, with hotter summers and colder winters. This difference in temperature variability between coastal and inland regions is known as the continentality effect.
