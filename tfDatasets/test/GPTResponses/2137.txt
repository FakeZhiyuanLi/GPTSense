Gothic rock is a subgenre of post-punk and alternative rock that emerged in the late 1970s, characterized by its dark and melancholic sound and its heavy use of reverb and other effects. It often features haunting, introspective lyrics and gothic themes, such as death, romance, and the supernatural, and takes inspiration from genres such as punk, new wave, and classical music. Major gothic rock bands include Joy Division, Bauhaus, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and The Cure.
