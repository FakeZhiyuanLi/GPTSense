The action that affirmed Portugal's status as a transcontinental nation was the signing of the Treaty of Tordesillas on June 7, 1494, between Portugal and Spain. This treaty divided the newly discovered lands outside Europe between the two countries, with Portugal receiving everything to the east of a designated line, which included Brazil, parts of Africa, and Asia. This effectively made Portugal a transcontinental nation, as it had territories in both Europe and other continents.
