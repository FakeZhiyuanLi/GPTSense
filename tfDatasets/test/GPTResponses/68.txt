Applied anthropology is used to analyze and find solutions to real-world problems. It involves the application of anthropological theories, methods, and data to address practical issues in various fields, including health, education, environmental management, economic development, human rights, and social justice. Applied anthropologists work with diverse communities, stakeholders, and policymakers to identify problems, develop interventions, and evaluate their effectiveness. They also strive to foster cross-cultural understanding and collaboration in the pursuit of social change and sustainable development.
