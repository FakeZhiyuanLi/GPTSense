In equilibrium, a hot object will absorb and emit radiation at the same rate. The light absorbed by the object is converted into thermal energy, causing the object to heat up. The amount of radiation absorbed by the object depends on its temperature and the wavelength of the radiation. A hot object typically absorbs more radiation at shorter wavelengths (i.e. higher energy) than at longer wavelengths (i.e. lower energy). This is known as the Planck distribution or Planck curve, which describes the spectral density of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a black body in thermal equilibrium at a given temperature. The curve has a peak that shifts to shorter wavelengths at higher temperatures, which explains why hot objects such as stars or incandescent light bulbs appear "blue-white" and emit more ultraviolet and visible light compared to cooler objects like the sun or a candle flame, which appear "yellow-orange" and emit more infrared radiation.
