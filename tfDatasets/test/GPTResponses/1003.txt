The German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact of 1939 included a secret protocol that divided Eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence. As a result, several regions were redrawn:1. Poland: Germany and the Soviet Union agreed to divide Poland between them, with the Germans taking most of the western and northern regions, and the Soviets taking the eastern regions.2. Baltic States: The Baltic states of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania were also included in the Soviet sphere of influence.3. Romania: The Soviet Union demanded that Romania cede Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union.4. Finland: The Soviet Union demanded that Finland cede parts of its territory, including the Karelian Isthmus and other territories near Leningrad.These territorial divisions were designed to improve relations between Germany and the Soviet Union by avoiding direct conflict and creating a buffer zone between the two powers. However, the agreement ultimately failed when Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941.
