Thysanura and Pterygota are two subclasses of the class Insecta, which includes all insects. Thysanura, also known as "bristletails," are wingless insects that have a long, thin, segmented body and long antennae. Pterygota, on the other hand, are insects with wings, which allow them to fly or glide through the air. This subclass includes the vast majority of insect species.
