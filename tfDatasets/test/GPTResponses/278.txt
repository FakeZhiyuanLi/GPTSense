The two philosophers who contrasted "culture" with the state of nature are Thomas Hobbes and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.Hobbes argued that human beings in a state of nature would be in a constant state of war, and life would be "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short." He believed that humans needed strong central authority to maintain order and prevent chaos.Rousseau, on the other hand, believed that humans in a state of nature were inherently good but were corrupted by society and civilization. He argued that culture and society led to inequality, oppression, and conflict. He envisioned a society based on individual freedom and equality, with minimal government intervention.
