Dielectric materials are used in capacitors to increase the capacitance by storing electrical energy between two conductive plates separated by an insulating material (the dielectric). However, dielectric breakdown can occur if the applied electric field exceeds a certain threshold value, resulting in the flow of current and ultimately damaging the capacitor.To limit the absolute breakdown voltage of capacitors, dielectric materials with high breakdown strength are used. The breakdown strength is the maximum electric field that a material can withstand without undergoing breakdown. High breakdown strength ensures that the dielectric material can endure the maximum voltage without failing.Another way in which dielectric material is used to limit the breakdown voltage is by increasing the thickness of the dielectric between the two conductive plates. The breakdown voltage is directly proportional to the dielectric strength and the thickness of the dielectric. By using thicker dielectric, the maximum voltage that the capacitor can withstand before breakdown increases.Moreover, the choice of dielectric material also depends on other factors such as the operating temperature, frequency, and application. Some dielectric materials have better high-frequency characteristics than others, while some have lower temperature coefficients. Factors such as these must be taken into consideration while selecting a dielectric material for a specific application.
