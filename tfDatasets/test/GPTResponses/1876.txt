Toxicity in insects is often displayed visually through bright or contrasting colors on their bodies. This coloration is known as aposematism and serves as a warning to potential predators that the insect is poisonous or unpalatable. For example, monarch butterflies have bright orange and black wings, which signal their toxicity to predators. Similarly, ladybugs have bright red and black coloration, which also indicates their toxic nature. These warning colors help predators to learn and avoid potential prey that may be harmful to them.
