Changing the values of n or the Boltzmann constant may result in a change in the spectral distribution curve of Planck's law. Increasing the value of n (the frequency of the photons) leads to a higher peak of the curve, which means that more energy is emitted at higher frequencies. Decreasing the value of n, on the other hand, leads to a lower peak of the curve, which means that more energy is emitted at lower frequencies.Changing the value of the Boltzmann constant affects the overall shape of the Planck's law curve. Increasing the Boltzmann constant leads to a shift of the curve towards longer wavelengths (lower frequencies), while decreasing the Boltzmann constant leads to a shift towards shorter wavelengths (higher frequencies).Overall, changing the values of these variables provides insight into how the energy emitted by a blackbody changes with temperature and frequency, which is an important concept in thermodynamics and astrophysics.
