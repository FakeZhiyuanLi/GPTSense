Partial vacuum refers to a region of space where the gas pressure is lower than the atmospheric pressure. It is a state in which the gas particles are less dense than normal, resulting in a lower pressure. This term is often used by physicists to describe conditions in which there is very little or no matter, such as in outer space or in vacuum chambers used for scientific experiments.
