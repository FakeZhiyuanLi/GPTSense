Marginal crevasses form on the edge of a glacier due to tensional stresses created by the differential velocity of ice across the width of the glacier. As the ice moves downstream, the center of the glacier moves faster than the edges, causing the ice on the edges to crack and pull apart. The tensional stresses will cause the edges to split and create a crevasse. This phenomenon is especially common where the glacier is thinning or narrowing, resulting in a reduction in lateral support. Additionally, the melting and refreezing of surface ice can weaken and crack the ice, leading to the formation of marginal crevasses.
