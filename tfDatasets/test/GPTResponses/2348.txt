Insects typically hatch from eggs laid by adult female insects. The location of egg-laying varies among different species of insects - some lay eggs in soil, others in water, while others may lay eggs on plants or inside other organisms. Once the eggs hatch, the newly emerged insects undergo several developmental stages before reaching adulthood.
