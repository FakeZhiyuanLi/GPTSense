The Faraday constant represents the amount of charge in one mole of electrons and is equal to 96,485.3329 coulombs per mole. It can be quickly calculated by multiplying the Avogadro's constant (6.022 x 10^23) with the charge on a single electron (1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs), which gives the result of 96,485.3329 coulombs per mole.
