A cirque is a bowl-shaped depression or hollow on a mountainside caused by glacial erosion. It is characterized by steep walls, a flat bottom, and often contains a small lake or pond. They are often found in high-altitude environments and are typically formed by the erosive power of glaciers. Circques are one of the most striking and dramatic landforms of glaciated regions.
