The development of Estonian national identity was accompanied with the era of national awakening or national revival in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when the Estonian people began to assert their cultural and political rights and aspirations under the rule of the Russian Empire. This period was marked by the emergence of national symbols, literature, music, and political movements that aimed to preserve and promote the Estonian language, culture, and identity. The Estonian War of Independence (1918â€“1920) also played a significant role in the formation of Estonian national identity, as it helped to establish Estonia as an independent nation-state and gave a sense of pride and unity to the Estonian people.
