tension "skin" on the surface of the water due to centrifugal force. As the bucket spins faster, this surface tension becomes stronger, pulling the water towards the sides of the bucket and forming a concave shape. Eventually, if the bucket spins fast enough, the water will start to climb the sides of the bucket and overflow, due to a balance between centrifugal force and gravitational force. This is known as the "spinning bucket experiment" and is often used to demonstrate the effects of centrifugal force.
