The 1689 Bill of Rights contributed to Parliament's growing power by establishing that the power to make laws and levy taxes rested with elected representatives in Parliament rather than the monarch. This secured the principle of parliamentary sovereignty, which remains a cornerstone of the British constitution to this day. The bill also declared several other important rights, such as the right to free speech, the right to bear arms, and the right to petition the government. Overall, the 1689 Bill of Rights strengthened Parliament's influence and authority over the monarchy and laid the foundations for a more democratic system of government in Britain.
