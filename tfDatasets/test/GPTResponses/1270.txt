Before 200 AD, people built earthen mounds for religious purposes, often known as burial mounds or tumuli. These were usually built to honor deceased rulers or important individuals in a community, and could be found in various parts of the world including North America, Europe and Asia. These mounds were often designed to mimic natural hills and would typically contain valuable treasures, artifacts, and offerings for the afterlife of the deceased.
