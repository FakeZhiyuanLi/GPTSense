The measurement of the Rhine river has a long history dating back to the Roman Empire. However, more modern and standardized measurement techniques were introduced in the 19th century. The International Rhine Commission, established in 1815, played an important role in developing these techniques and establishing a system of hydraulic benchmark gauges along the river.
