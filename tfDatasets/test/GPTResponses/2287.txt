The Soviet army did not initiate a blockade specifically on Estonia. However, after World War II, the Soviet Union established control over Estonia and implemented policies and measures that restricted the country's sovereignty and economic freedom. Additionally, in 1990, Soviet troops blockaded military bases in Estonia, which led to diplomatic tensions between Estonia and Russia.
