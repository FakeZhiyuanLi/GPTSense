In the mid-19th century, the prevailing theory to explain the presence of "folded" mountain chains was the geosynclinal theory. This theory suggested that large, long, and narrow depressions in the Earth's crust, called geosynclines, were filled with sediment over time. As the sediment accumulated, it created a thick layer of rock that eventually became heated and compressed by tectonic forces. This compression caused the rock layers to fold and buckle, creating the folded mountain chains that we see today. The geosynclinal theory was widely accepted until the 1960s when plate tectonics became the dominant theory for explaining the formation of mountain chains.
