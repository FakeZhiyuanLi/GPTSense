The three gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) speak of the presence of Jewish priests, particularly the chief priests, during the trial and crucifixion of Jesus. These priests were members of the Sanhedrin, the ruling council of Jewish elders in Jerusalem. They were responsible for enforcing Jewish law and were viewed as the religious and political leaders of the Jewish people. In the Gospels, the chief priests play a prominent role in the events leading up to Jesus' death, as they were the ones who brought charges against him and ultimately had him condemned to death by the Roman authorities.
