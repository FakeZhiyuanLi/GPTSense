Boris Yeltsin was standing on a tank during the failed coup attempt in Moscow in August 1991. He was one of the main leaders of the opposition to the coup and was using his position to rally support for the pro-democracy movement. His actions helped people feel more confident in resisting the coup and played a major role in its eventual failure.
