The rules of the specific sport determine which team gets possession first when extending a game to break a tie. It can vary between different sports and even between different leagues or competitions within the same sport. In some sports, such as soccer, the teams may do a coin toss to determine who gets possession first. In other sports, such as basketball, a jump ball may be used. In some sports, such as hockey, the teams may switch ends and play a sudden death overtime period, where the first team to score wins.
