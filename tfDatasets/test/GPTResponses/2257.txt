The symmetry group of the general theory of relativity includes both coordinate transformations (diffeomorphisms) and local Lorentz transformations. Coordinate transformations describe changes of coordinates that preserve the geometry of spacetime, while local Lorentz transformations correspond to rotations and boosts at each point in spacetime. Together, these symmetries form the basis for the structure of the theory of general relativity, allowing it to describe the behavior of spacetime under a wide range of physical conditions.
