There are several subjects that Avicenna studied but did not develop a theory on. One such subject is botany. While Avicenna did study plants and their medicinal properties, he did not develop a comprehensive theory or system of botany. He primarily used his observations of plants as a basis for his medical writings, rather than focusing on their classification or morphology.
