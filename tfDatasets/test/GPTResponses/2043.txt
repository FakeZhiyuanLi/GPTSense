A vacuum is a space that is completely devoid of matter, including gas, dust, and particles. In physics, it is defined as a region with pressure less than atmospheric pressure, where the gas pressure is so low that its effects can be ignored. Vacuum is commonly used in a variety of applications, including scientific experiments, manufacturing processes, and household cleaning devices like vacuum cleaners. It is also the medium through which electromagnetic waves, including light, travel.
