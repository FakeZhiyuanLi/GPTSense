According to the Gospels, Jesus made seven statements on the cross. These statements are known as the Seven Last Words of Christ and are as follows:1. "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." (Luke 23:34)2. "Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise." (Luke 23:43)3. "Woman, behold your son! . . . Behold, your mother!" (John 19:26-27)4. "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Matthew 27:46 and Mark 15:34)5. "I thirst." (John 19:28)6. "It is finished." (John 19:30)7. "Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit." (Luke 23:46)
