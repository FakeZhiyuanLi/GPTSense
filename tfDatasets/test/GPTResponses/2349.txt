is observed in the behavior of quantum systems at a fundamental level. One of the most well-known time-asymmetric phenomena in quantum mechanics is the arrow of time, which refers to the fact that physical processes generally only occur in one direction of time. In other words, the laws of physics are time-symmetric in theory, but they are observed to be time-asymmetric in practice. This is most commonly observed in the decay of particles, where the decay products can only occur in one direction of time, as well as in the behavior of quantum systems, which exhibit properties such as entanglement and non-locality that are inherently non-reversible. Other time-asymmetric phenomena in quantum mechanics include quantum decoherence, which refers to the progressive entanglement of a quantum system with its environment, leading to a loss of quantum coherence over time, and quantum measurement, which refers to the process by which a quantum system collapses into a definite state upon being measured.
