Zinc is typically extracted from its ores through the process of electrolysis, which involves passing an electric current through a solution containing dissolved zinc ions (such as zinc sulfate or zinc chloride). The electric current causes the zinc ions to be reduced at the cathode, depositing pure zinc metal, while the sulfate or chloride ions are oxidized at the anode. Alternative processes for zinc extraction include smelting and roasting.
