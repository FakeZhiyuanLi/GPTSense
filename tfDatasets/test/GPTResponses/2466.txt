It is not accurate to say that Steven Spielberg was ever embarrassed by his family being Jewish. In fact, he has been very open about his Jewish heritage and has even explored Jewish themes in many of his films. However, he did face some anti-Semitic bullying when he was younger, which may have been a source of discomfort or shame at the time.
