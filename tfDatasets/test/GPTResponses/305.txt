The disagreements in child labour numbers for present day can be caused by a variety of factors, including:1. Different definitions of child labour: Different organizations and countries may have different definitions of what constitutes child labour. Some may focus on specific sectors or industries, while others may include all forms of work that are harmful to children.2. Varying data sources and methodologies: The data on child labour come from a range of sources, such as national surveys, censuses, and administrative records. These sources may differ in their coverage and reliability, and the methodologies used to collect and analyze the data can also vary.3. Differences in age ranges: Child labour estimates may also vary depending on the age range used to define "child". For example, some countries may include children up to the age of 14, while others may include those up to 18.4. Underreporting: Child labour is often hidden and difficult to detect, particularly in informal or illegal sectors. This means that some cases of child labour may go unreported, leading to underestimates of the true extent of the problem.5. Political and economic factors: Child labour is often linked to poverty, inequality, and weak governance. Countries with different political and economic contexts may therefore have different levels of child labour, making it challenging to compare estimates across countries.
