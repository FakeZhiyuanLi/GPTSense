A hot object in equilibrium absorbs as much energy as it emits. This balance is referred to as thermal equilibrium, and it occurs when the rate at which energy is absorbed by an object is equal to the rate at which it is emitted. At this point, an object will neither heat up nor cool down, but will maintain a constant temperature. The concept of thermal equilibrium is important in many areas of science, including meteorology, physics, and material science.
