The mother wasp usually provides her eggs with food, water, and protection when they hatch. Some species of wasps also secrete a special kind of saliva that forms a protective covering over the eggs. This covering protects the eggs from predators and also helps to regulate their moisture levels. Additionally, some species of wasps lay their eggs on or near hosts that will provide food for the developing larvae, such as caterpillars or spiders.
