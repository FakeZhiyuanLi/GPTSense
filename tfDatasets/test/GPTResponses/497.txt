Glaciers require a permanent snow cover, which accumulates over hundreds or thousands of years, and eventually turns into ice due to pressure, compaction, and melting/refreezing cycles. The snow cover acts as a source of mass for the glacier, as it flows downhill under the force of gravity, driven by the weight of the ice and the slope of the terrain. Temporary snow cover may occur on top of the glacier, due to seasonal variations in temperature and precipitation, but it does not necessarily contribute to the glacier's long-term stability or growth.
