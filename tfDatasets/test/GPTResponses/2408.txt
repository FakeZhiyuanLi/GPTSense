1) The vacuum tube: The vacuum tube, also known as a valve, was an essential component in early electronic devices such as radios and televisions. It works by controlling the flow of electrons within a vacuum, allowing for the amplification and manipulation of electrical signals.2) Particle accelerators: Particle accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider use the vacuum property of space to accelerate particles to incredibly high speeds. The absence of air and other particles in the vacuum chamber allows particles to travel without being impeded, enabling scientists to study fundamental particle physics and create new materials.
