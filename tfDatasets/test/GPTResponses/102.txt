The instrumental methods of applied anthropology produce a variety of outcomes that vary based on the specific approach used. Some common outcomes include:1. Ethnographic studies: Ethnographic studies involve the in-depth exploration of cultural practices, values, and beliefs within a particular community. The outcomes of this approach can include a better understanding of the needs and desires of the community members and the identification of potential areas where interventions can be made.2. Participatory research: Participatory research involves working closely with community members to design and implement research studies. The outcomes of this approach can include increased community engagement, a better understanding of community issues, and the development of strategies for addressing those issues.3. Program evaluation: Program evaluation involves assessing the effectiveness of specific interventions or programs. The outcomes of this approach can include improved program design, increased accountability, and a better understanding of the impact of the program on the target population.4. Community development: Community development involves working with community members to promote positive change and development. The outcomes of this approach can include improved social cohesion, increased economic development, and enhanced community participation.Overall, the instrumental methods of applied anthropology produce a range of outcomes that are intended to improve the lives of individuals or communities through the thoughtful application of anthropological knowledge and tools.
