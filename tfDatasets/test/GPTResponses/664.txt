Some Marshall Island residents have recent Asian ancestry from countries such as China, Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines. This is due to the historical migration of people from these Asian countries to the Marshall Islands for economic and political reasons. Today, a significant population of Marshallese people in Hawaii also have recent Asian ancestry.
