Barotrauma is caused by changes in pressure between the inside and outside of the body, usually due to changes in altitude or depth. It can occur in the ears, sinuses, lungs, and other body cavities. Some common causes of barotrauma include scuba diving, flying in an airplane, and being in a pressurized environment such as a hyperbaric chamber. Other factors that can contribute to barotrauma include congestion or infection in the respiratory system, earwax buildup, and a deviated septum.
