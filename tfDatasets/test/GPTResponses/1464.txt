Many philosophers and theologians have addressed the question of the existence of God over the centuries, so it's difficult to attribute this statement to a single individual. However, the idea that God's existence is difficult to prove or disprove is often associated with the concept of agnosticism, which suggests that the existence of God is ultimately unknown or unknowable. Some famous agnostics include Thomas Huxley, Bertrand Russell, and Carl Sagan.
