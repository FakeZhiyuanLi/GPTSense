Von Neumann's method for solving partial differential equations numerically, known as the Finite Difference Method, is considered to be the first of its kind. It was developed during the Manhattan Project and was used to solve complex equations related to the design of the first atomic bomb. The Finite Difference Method is still widely used today in many fields of science and engineering, including fluid mechanics, electromagnetics, and finance.
