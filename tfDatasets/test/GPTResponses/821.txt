The East India Company introduced the Permanent Settlement System, also known as the Zamindari system, in Bengal in 1793. Under this system, the Company recognized certain intermediaries, called zamindars, as the owners of land instead of peasants who previously had been cultivating it. Zamindars, in turn, had to pay a fixed amount of revenue to the East India Company annually, regardless of the agricultural yield or profits. This system was designed to ensure a fixed and regular flow of revenue to the Company and transform land into a commodity that could be traded and taxed. However, the system had negative consequences for the peasants who lost their right of ownership and were subjected to exploitative practices by zamindars.
