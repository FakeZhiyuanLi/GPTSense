Ottoman Divan poetry was primarily inspired by the Arabic and Persian poetry traditions, which in turn were influenced by ancient Greek and Roman poetry. The themes of love, spirituality, nature, and war were commonly explored in the poetry of the Ottoman court, with language and style of the poetry reflecting the elegant and refined lifestyles of the courtly elite. Additionally, Sufism, an Islamic mystical tradition, also had a significant influence on the themes and language of Ottoman Divan poetry, particularly in the use of symbolism and allegory to explore spiritual and emotional experiences.
