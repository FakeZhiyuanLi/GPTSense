Equal temperament became accepted as the dominant musical temperament during the 18th century. It gained popularity due to its flexibility, allowing for the use of all 12 semitones in an octave with equal distances between each. This made it possible for composers to write music in a wider range of keys, eliminating the need for various temperaments for different keys. Today, virtually all Western music is performed and written in equal temperament.
