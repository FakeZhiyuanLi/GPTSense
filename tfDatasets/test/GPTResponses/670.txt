There were several factors that reduced Germany's need for Soviet goods:1. Increasing trade with other countries: Germany started to increase its trade relations with other countries, especially with the United States and Western Europe. This reduced its dependence on Soviet goods.2. Domestic production: The post-war economic boom in Germany led to a significant increase in domestic production. This reduced the need for imports from the Soviet Union.3. Improved technology: Germany developed advanced manufacturing technology, which brought down the cost of production and made it more competitive in the global market.4. Political tensions: The relations between the Soviet Union and Germany became strained due to political tensions, which further reduced the demand for Soviet goods.5. Diversification of supply: Germany diversified its supply sources, seeking alternative suppliers in Asia and Africa, which further reduced its reliance on Soviet goods.
