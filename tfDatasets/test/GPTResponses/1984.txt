The Estonian War of Independence ended as Estonia was born. The war lasted from 1918 to 1920, and Estonia formally declared independence on February 24, 1918, just as the war was beginning. The war ended in victory for Estonia, leading to the recognition of the country as an independent state by the Soviet Union in February 1920.
