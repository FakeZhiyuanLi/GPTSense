Besides Bachelor's degrees, Fachhochschulen (FHs) also offer Master's degrees and Doctorate degrees. However, FHs do not typically offer traditional doctoral programs but usually offer "doctorate-like" programs such as "Doctor of Engineering" or "Doctor of applied sciences" which are geared more towards industry and applied research. FHs may also offer diploma programs, which are shorter and less intensive than Bachelor's or Master's degrees, and are more commonly found in fields like engineering and business.
