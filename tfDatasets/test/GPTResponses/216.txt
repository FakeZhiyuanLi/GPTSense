The Persian king who wanted tribute from the tribes of northern India was Darius I, also known as Darius the Great. He launched an invasion of the Indus Valley in 518 BC and established the Achaemenid Empire's westernmost boundaries in the region. He demanded tribute from the local tribes, including the Gandhara, Kamboja, and Punjab.
