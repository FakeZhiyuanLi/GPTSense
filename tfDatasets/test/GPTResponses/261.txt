Tamil literature has thrived for over two millennia, with its golden age being from the 5th to the 10th century CE. This period is known as the Sangam Era, and it produced some of the greatest works in Tamil literature, including the poems of the Sangam anthologies, such as the Purananuru, Ainkurunuru, and Kuruntokai, as well as the epics Silappatikaram and Manimekalai. Tamil literature continued to develop and flourish through the medieval period, with works such as Kamba Ramayanam, Naladiyar, and Thirukkural being written during this time. Today, Tamil literature is still being produced and continues to thrive in modern times.
