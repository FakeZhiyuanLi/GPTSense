The first widely used object in the process of vacuum was the vacuum pump, which was invented by Otto von Guericke in the 17th century. In the late 19th century, Thomas Edison and his colleagues developed a practical vacuum pump that could create a vacuum with a pressure of less than one-thousandth of an atmosphere, which allowed for the creation of incandescent light bulbs and other vacuum-based technologies.
