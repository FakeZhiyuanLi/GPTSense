There have been various claims of individuals or groups who have stated that they were responsible for the death of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. However, none of these claims have been verified, and the circumstances surrounding Gaddafi's death remain unclear. The official account is that Gaddafi was captured and killed by rebel forces during the Libyan Civil War, but there have been allegations of extrajudicial killing and war crimes against those involved.
