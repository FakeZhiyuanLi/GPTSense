The British version of cultural studies emerged in the late 1950s and early 1960s, with the founding of the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies (CCCS) at the University of Birmingham in 1964. The CCCS was led by Stuart Hall and other scholars who sought to explore the relationship between culture and society in a critical and interdisciplinary way, drawing on Marxist and feminist theories as well as insights from anthropology, psychology, and other fields. The CCCS and its affiliated scholars produced groundbreaking work on popular culture, media, race, class, gender, and other topics, helping to establish cultural studies as a major academic field in the UK and beyond.
