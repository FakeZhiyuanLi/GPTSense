Plants can store water in various parts of their structures to avoid adverse conditions, such as drought or extreme heat. Some plants store water in their roots, stems, or leaves, while others store water in specialized structures such as bulbs, corms or succulent leaves. Succulent plants, such as cacti, have specialized water-storage tissues in their stems that allow them to survive in arid environments. Many trees, like oak or eucalyptus, store water in their bark and cambium layer, which helps them to survive during dry seasons. Other plants, such as succulent grasses, store water in their leaves or blade sheaths. Overall, plants have developed multiple strategies to store water and survive in different environments around the world.
