Devolution in the UK has led to the transfer of powers from the central government in London to regional and national administrations in Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales. This process began in the late 1990s, with the creation of the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly, and Northern Ireland Assembly. These bodies have been given varying degrees of autonomy in areas such as healthcare, education, and transport, while still remaining part of the wider UK political system. This has led to greater local representation and decision-making, as well as increased power for regional governments. However, devolution has also led to political tensions between different parts of the UK, especially over issues such as funding and constitutional reform.
