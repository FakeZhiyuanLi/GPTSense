Inner city burials were not banned at once. The trend of banning inner city burials started in the mid-nineteenth century and continued over several decades. Different cities and countries followed different timelines for implementing the ban. For instance, London banned burials in most of its inner city cemeteries from the 1850s to the 1870s. In the United States, New York City implemented a ban on burials below 86th Street in Manhattan in 1851. Other cities and countries followed similar patterns, but the process of banning inner city burials was gradual and uneven.
