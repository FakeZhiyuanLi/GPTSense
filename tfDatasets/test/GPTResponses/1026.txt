Chlorophyll absorbs both long (red) and short (blue) wavelengths of light during photosynthesis. The absorbed energy is then used to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose, the primary source of energy for plants. Chlorophyll is particularly efficient at absorbing blue and red light, which is why plants appear green (due to the reflection of green light) and are often grown under red and blue LED lights in controlled environments to optimize photosynthesis.
