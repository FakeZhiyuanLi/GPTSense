Luis Moreno-Ocampo, the former Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), claimed in 2011 that Muammar Gaddafi had ordered his soldiers to use rape as a weapon against opposition women during the Libyan Civil War. He described it as a "premeditated act" and said that evidence showed hundreds of women were raped during the conflict.
