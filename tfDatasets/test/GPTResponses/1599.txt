The Bakerloo and District lines were rewired to a three-rail system in the early 20th century as part of a plan to electrify London's underground railway network. The three-rail system allows trains to draw power from a central live rail and two outer rails, which act as a return circuit. This allowed for a more efficient and reliable power supply, and also increased the capacity of the lines by allowing faster and more frequent trains. Additionally, the three-rail system allowed for easier interconnection between different railway companies' networks, as it was a more standardized system. Overall, the rewiring of these lines to a three-rail system was part of a wider effort to modernize London's rail infrastructure and improve transportation in the city.
