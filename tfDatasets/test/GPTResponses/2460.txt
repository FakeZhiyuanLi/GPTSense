The mechanical action that allows insects to make sound is the movement of their wings or body parts against each other, creating friction and vibrations which produce sound waves. Some insects like crickets and grasshoppers produce sound by rubbing their wings or legs together, while others like cicadas create sound by vibrating special structures on their bodies. The sound produced is often used for communication and mating purposes.
