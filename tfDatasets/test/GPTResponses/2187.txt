Ether was originally thought to be a substance that filled all space and was necessary for the transmission of light through a vacuum. It was believed to be a physical substance with properties such as density, viscosity, and elasticity. However, the Michelson-Morley experiment in 1887 proved that ether did not exist, and that the speed of light was constant regardless of the motion of the observer. This led to the development of the theory of relativity by Albert Einstein, which revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and the nature of the universe.
