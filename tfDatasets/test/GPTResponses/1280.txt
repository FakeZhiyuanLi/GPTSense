Morphosyllabic refers to a type of writing system or script in which each written symbol (or "character") represents a morpheme, which is the smallest unit of meaning in a language, and typically corresponds to a syllable or group of syllables. The most well-known examples of morphosyllabic scripts include Chinese characters, Japanese kanji, and Korean hanja, amongst others. In these scripts, each symbol typically represents a combination of one or more simple shapes or strokes that correspond to individual sounds or syllables, as well as additional markings or features that indicate the meaning or grammatical function of the morpheme.
