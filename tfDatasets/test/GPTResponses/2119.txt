Joy Division helped in the development of post-punk music, which emerged in the late 1970s as a response to the punk rock movement. Post-punk combined the aggressiveness and rebellion of punk rock with a more experimental and complex sound, incorporating elements of art rock, electronic music, and avant-garde. Joy Division's moody, atmospheric sound and introspective lyrics were a key influence on the genre, and the band is often cited as one of the pioneers of post-punk along with bands like Siouxsie and the Banshees, Public Image Ltd, and The Fall.
