If the photoelectron's frequency is too low, it will not have enough energy to overcome the binding energy of the electron in the atom. As a result, the electron will not be ejected from the atom, and the photoelectric effect will not occur. Only photons with a frequency that is at least equal to the minimum threshold frequency required to overcome the binding energy of the electron will be able to eject the electron and produce the photoelectric effect.
