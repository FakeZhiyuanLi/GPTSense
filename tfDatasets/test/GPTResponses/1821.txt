There can be a number of reasons for this:1. Some railway lines may not be fully electrified, so diesel trains are used to cover the non-electrified sections of the journey.2. In some cases, electrification infrastructure may be temporarily out of service for maintenance or repairs, and diesel trains are used as an alternative until the electrification is restored.3. Maintenance of electric locomotives and electric train sets can be more time-consuming and expensive compared to diesel trains. As a result, some railway companies may choose to continue using diesel trains rather than investing in electric trains.4. Some trains may be required to travel on non-electrified branches or sidings, so diesel locomotives are used to haul the train over these sections.Overall, the reasons why diesel trains are still used on electrified routes can be complex and dependent on various factors specific to each railway network.
