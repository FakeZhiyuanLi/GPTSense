A substance that acts like a liquid but is under the freezing temperature is called an amorphous solid or a glass. Examples include glass windows, plastics, and some types of candy or chocolate. They may have the appearance and behavior of a liquid but are technically solids because their molecules are arranged in a disordered or random pattern instead of a crystalline lattice.
