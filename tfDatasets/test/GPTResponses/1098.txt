1) Spin of the nucleus: The gyromagnetic ratio is directly proportional to the magnitude of the nuclear spin. Thus, the larger the spin of the nucleus, the larger the gyromagnetic ratio.2) Magnetic moment: The gyromagnetic ratio is also affected by the magnetic moment of the nucleus. The magnetic moment is a measure of the strength of the magnetic field that a nucleus can generate. The larger the magnetic moment, the larger the gyromagnetic ratio.3) Atomic number: The gyromagnetic ratio is also dependent on the atomic number of the nucleus. As the atomic number increases, the gyromagnetic ratio decreases due to the increased electronic shielding of the nucleus by the additional electron shells.
