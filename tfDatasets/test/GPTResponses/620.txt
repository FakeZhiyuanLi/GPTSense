One philosopher whose argument is similar to Avicenna's that the soul is without quantitative extension is Rene Descartes. Descartes believed that the soul or mind is a non-physical substance that is not extended in space, meaning that it has no physical dimensions or measurable size. He argued that the soul is distinct from the body and interacts with it through the pineal gland in the brain. Descartes believed that the soul could exist independently of the body and was immortal. Like Avicenna, he rejected the Aristotelian view that the soul is a form or principle that is inseparable from the body and has quantitative extension.
