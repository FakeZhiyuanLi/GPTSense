ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) invaded and took control of several regions in Iraq, primarily in the northwestern and central parts of the country. They captured the cities of Mosul, Tikrit, and Fallujah, among others. These regions were predominantly Sunni Muslim and had long-standing grievances with the Shiite-led government in Baghdad. The ISIS invasion began in 2014 and resulted in a protracted and bloody conflict with the Iraqi military, Kurdish forces, and other international allies.
