The Rhine River is the most significant and longest river in Germany, and it contributes the most to the country's water resources. Several tributaries feed into the Rhine, including the Main, Moselle, Neckar, and Ruhr rivers. However, it should be noted that the importance of each tributary varies depending on factors such as its flow rate, water quality, and its role in supporting aquatic ecosystems.
