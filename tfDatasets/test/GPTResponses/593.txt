Roche moutonnée have a smooth and polished "down" side that is often shaped like a gently sloping ramp or an elongated dome. This shape is created by the movement of glaciers over the rock surface, which caused the rock to become eroded and polished in the direction of ice flow. The smooth surface on the down side of a roche moutonnée is typically distinguished from the rough and jagged surface on the up side, which was more exposed to weathering and erosion.
