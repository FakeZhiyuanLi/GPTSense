Ã‰mile Durkheim suggests that the existence of God or gods is a social construct created by the collective consciousness of society. According to Durkheim, religion is a reflection of the social and moral values of society and provides individuals with a sense of belonging and purpose, as well as a framework for understanding and interpreting the world. Durkheim believed that religion was necessary for social stability and cohesion, and that it played an important role in controlling and regulating behavior. However, he did not express any personal beliefs about the existence of God.
