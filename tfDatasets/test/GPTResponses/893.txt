A radical without context or a clear purpose may be meaningless. It needs to have a specific goal or intention in order to be relevant and impactful. Otherwise, it may just be seen as a meaningless gesture or a misguided attempt at change. It's important to have a clear understanding of the problem or issue you are trying to address, as well as a thoughtful and strategic approach to solving it.
