The political group that created problems between the Soviet and German governments was the Nazi Party, led by Adolf Hitler. The Nazi Party rose to power in Germany in the 1930s and pursued an aggressive foreign policy, seeking to expand German territory and influence in Europe. This clashed with Soviet interests and led to diplomatic tensions between the two powers, eventually leading to the outbreak of World War II.
