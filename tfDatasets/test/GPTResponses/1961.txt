A taxonomist may split or lump together organisms based on their characteristics, genetic relationships, and evolutionary history. This means that taxonomists may either separate organisms into different species or combine them into one species based on their similarities and differences. Ultimately, the goal of taxonomists is to classify and name organisms in a way that accurately reflects their evolutionary history and relationships with other organisms.
