One weather phenomenon that can weaken storms but cause major ice events in northwest North Carolina is cold air damming. Cold air damming occurs when cold air is trapped against the eastern slopes of the Appalachian Mountains and is unable to escape. This leads to the development of a shallow layer of cold air near the surface, which can cause rain to freeze on contact with the ground and other surfaces. The resulting ice can accumulate quickly and cause significant damage, including power outages and hazardous driving conditions. While cold air damming can weaken storms by suppressing cloud development, it can also create conditions that are conducive to the formation of freezing rain and ice storms.
