It is difficult to generalize across all cultures as child labor practices vary greatly depending on socio-economic, cultural, and political factors. However, in many cultures, girls are more likely to be subjected to child labor due to gender-based discrimination, limited access to education, and cultural norms that prioritize male children over female children. In some cultures, boys may be more likely to be thrown into child labor due to poverty and the need to contribute to their family's income.
