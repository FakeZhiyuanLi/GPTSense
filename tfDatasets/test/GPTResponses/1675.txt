Rock musicians today mostly use electric mandolins, which are similar in construction to electric guitars but with eight strings instead of six. Some popular electric mandolin models are the Gibson F5, the Epiphone Mandobird IV, and the Michael Kelly Legacy Flame mandolin. Some also use acoustic-electric mandolins, which have pickups and can be plugged into an amplifier.
