Pigments are responsible for absorbing and reflecting different wavelengths of light. In the case of the color green, pigments absorb all colors of light except for green, which they reflect back to the viewer's eye. This is why leaves and other green objects in nature appear green to our eyes - the pigments in these objects absorb all other colors of light and reflect green light back to us.
