This question is not specific enough to give a clear answer. The strength of air current can vary depending on various factors such as wind speed, direction, altitude, temperature, and location.In general, wind speeds tend to be strongest at high altitudes, such as in the upper atmosphere, where they can reach speeds of up to 200 mph. On the other hand, wind speeds tend to be weaker near the ground due to friction and other factors.However, there are also some areas where winds tend to be consistently strong due to local weather patterns or geographic features. For example, places such as mountainous regions, coastal areas, and narrow valleys may experience strong and frequent wind gusts. Additionally, hurricanes and tornadoes can generate extremely powerful winds with destructive forces.
