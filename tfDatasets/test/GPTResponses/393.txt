The amount of data being read and processed must be reduced in order to allow laserdisc playback time to increase. This can be achieved by minimizing the use of video and audio effects, reducing the resolution or quality of the video, and using compression techniques to reduce the amount of data being stored on the disc. Additionally, optimizing the hardware and software used for playback can also help to increase laserdisc playback time.
