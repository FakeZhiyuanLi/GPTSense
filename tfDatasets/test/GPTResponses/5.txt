This question is a bit vague, so I'll give two answers:- If you are asking about where cold and warm water meet within a plumbing system, the answer is typically in a mixing valve. This valve helps regulate the temperature of the water coming out of a faucet or shower by combining hot and cold water to reach the desired temperature.- If you are asking about where cold and warm ocean currents meet, it depends on the location. There are several places around the world where different ocean currents converge, including the Gulf Stream in the North Atlantic and the Kuroshio Current off the coast of Japan. When warm and cold currents meet, they can create areas of increased productivity for marine life, as well as weather patterns and ocean currents that affect global climate.
