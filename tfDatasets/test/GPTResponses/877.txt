Formalist definitions of the rule of law focus on the following aspects:1. Clarity and predictability of laws: Laws must be clear and predictable, so that individuals can understand what is expected of them and can plan their behavior accordingly.2. Uniformity of laws: Laws must apply equally to all individuals, regardless of their social or economic status. No one should be above the law, and no one should be subject to arbitrary or discriminatory treatment.3. Separation of powers: The powers of government should be divided among different branches (such as the legislative, executive, and judicial), so that no one branch has unchecked authority.4. Judicial independence: The courts must be independent from the other branches of government, and judges must be impartial and free from external pressures.5. Access to justice: All individuals should have access to the courts and other legal institutions, regardless of their social or economic status. Legal procedures must be fair and accessible, and legal services must be affordable and available to everyone.6. Protection of individual rights: The rule of law requires that individual rights and freedoms be protected by the legal system. This includes protections against government interference with speech, religion, privacy, and property rights, as well as due process rights in criminal proceedings.
