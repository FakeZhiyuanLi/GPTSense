Governments with a high degree of the "rule of law" have limited discretion when it comes to enforcing their laws and policies. The "rule of law" refers to a system in which laws are applied equally to all individuals and decisions are made in a fair and impartial manner based on established legal principles. This means that governments with a high degree of the "rule of law" are bound by legal frameworks and procedures that dictate how they must act in various situations.In such governments, the discretion of government officials is limited by established laws and regulations, and they are required to act in accordance with these rules. This restricts the potential for arbitrary or discriminatory actions by government officials, as they must act within the established legal framework. However, governments with a high degree of the "rule of law" may still have some discretion in areas such as policy-making and interpretation of laws, as long as their actions are consistent with established legal principles.
