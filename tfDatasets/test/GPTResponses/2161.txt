Leibniz argued that "truth" has no existence apart from the existence of objections. In other words, for something to be considered true, it must not only correspond with reality but must also be capable of withstanding criticisms and objections. This concept is known as the principle of sufficient reason, which states that every fact must have a reason or explanation for its existence. Leibniz believed that objections serve as a way to test and validate the truth of a claim.
