Outgassing becomes important in all solid or liquid materials when they are placed in a vacuum or low-pressure environment. This is because the decrease in pressure causes trapped gases and other volatile substances within the material to be released, leading to potential contamination or adverse effects on the surrounding environment. In certain industries such as aerospace, electronics and semiconductor manufacturing, outgassing is a critical factor to consider as it can impact the performance and reliability of the final product.
