Earthworms play a vital role in maintaining healthy soil. They help to aerate the soil by burrowing through it, creating channels that improve air and water circulation. This allows plant roots to grow more deeply, which improves the overall health of plants. Earthworms also help to break down decaying organic matter, such as leaves and dead plant roots, through their digestive process. This helps to release nutrients and minerals that are essential for plant growth. Additionally, worm castings or excrement are rich in nutrients that are important for soil fertility, improving soil structure and increasing soil water-holding capacity. Overall, the presence of earthworms in soil helps maintain a healthy and productive ecosystem.
