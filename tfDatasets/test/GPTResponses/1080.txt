Leeches have been used for blood-letting for thousands of years in various cultures around the world. However, their use became more widespread in Europe during the 19th century. It is believed that the modern medical use of leeches for blood-letting began in France, where physician Fran√ßois-Joseph-Victor Broussais popularized the practice in the early 19th century. Leeches were also commonly used in Victorian England, and even after blood-letting fell out of favor as a medical practice, leeches continued to be used for certain medical conditions, such as treating inflammation and improving blood flow.
