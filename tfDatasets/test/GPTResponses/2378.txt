Polymorphism refers to the occurrence of different forms or variations within a single species. These variations can manifest in different physical traits, colors, patterns or behaviors. Polymorphism can occur due to genetic mutations or as a result of environmental factors. It is a common phenomenon found in nature, especially in insects, birds, and mammals. Polymorphism can provide certain advantages to a species, such as camouflage or better adaptation to a changing environment.
