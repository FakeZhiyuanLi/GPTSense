In the past, rural children were often employed in agriculture, working on family farms or as hired labor for larger farms. They may have also worked in fishing or forestry industries. Additionally, some worked in domestic service, such as as maids or kitchen helpers for wealthier families. In some cases, children were employed in factories or mines, although this was less common in rural areas.
