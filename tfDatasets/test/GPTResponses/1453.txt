Standard connectors were designed to be robust in order to handle a wide variety of harsh environments and physical stresses. They need to resist environmental factors such as dust, water, and temperature fluctuations. In addition, they may be subjected to rough handling or repeated use, which could cause them to break. Therefore, they are designed with materials that are strong and resilient so that they can handle these factors and ensure reliable and consistent performance over their lifespan. The robustness of standard connectors also helps to prevent frustration and downtime for users that could be caused by connector failures or malfunctions.
