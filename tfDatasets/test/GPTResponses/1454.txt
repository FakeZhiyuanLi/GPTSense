Stephen Jay Gould referred to philosophy that deals in the supernatural as "non-overlapping magisteria" or NOMA. This concept suggests that science and religion occupy separate and distinct domains of inquiry, with science dealing with empirical facts and religion dealing with ultimate meaning and moral values. Gould argued that conflicts between science and religion arise only when they are improperly conflated or when one attempts to invade the domain of the other.
