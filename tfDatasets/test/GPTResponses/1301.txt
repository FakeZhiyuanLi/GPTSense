One factor that critically affects the breakdown voltage of the capacitor is the distance between the capacitor plates. The closer the plates are to each other, the lower the breakdown voltage, while increasing the distance between the plates increases the breakdown voltage. This is because the closer the plates are to each other, the easier it is for an electrical discharge to occur between them, leading to a breakdown in the capacitor's insulation.
