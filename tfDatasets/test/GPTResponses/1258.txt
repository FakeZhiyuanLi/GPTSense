Scholars believe that the name Adonai originated from the Hebrew language and is derived from the Hebrew word 'Adon', which means 'lord' or 'master'. It was used as a respectful and reverential way to address God and to avoid using the personal name of God (Yahweh) which was considered too sacred to be spoken aloud. Instead, the name Adonai was used in its place.
