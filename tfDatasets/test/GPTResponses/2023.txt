Water is a scarce resource on Cyprus, as the island receives low rainfall and has limited freshwater sources. This issue is further exacerbated by the increasing population and tourist numbers, as well as climate change impacts such as drought and higher temperatures. Cyprus has implemented various water management strategies, including desalination plants and water recycling, to address this challenge.
