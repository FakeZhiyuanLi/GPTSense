Leibniz argued against several philosophical ideas and concepts, including:1. Cartesian dualism: Leibniz rejected the idea that the mind and body were separate substances, instead arguing that they were "psychophysical monads" that were indivisible units of reality.2. Materialism: Leibniz argued that everything in the universe was made up of immaterial substances, or monads, which had their own unique qualities and characteristics.3. Determinism: Leibniz believed in the principle of sufficient reason, which stated that everything that happened had a reason or cause. However, he argued that there was still room for free will within this framework, since individuals could still make choices and decisions within the constraints of their circumstances.4. Atomism: Leibniz rejected the idea that the universe was made up of indivisible particles, instead arguing that there was an infinite number of smaller and smaller parts that could be divided without end.5. Nominalism: Leibniz believed that there were universal concepts and ideas that existed independently of human language or individual experiences, rejecting the idea that all knowledge was based on individual perceptions and experiences.
