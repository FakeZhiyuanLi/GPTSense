As an Islamic philosopher and physician, Avicenna (Ibn Sina) started an inquiry into various fields, including metaphysics, epistemology, logic, medicine, astronomy, and physics. He made significant contributions in these fields and is considered one of the greatest thinkers in the Islamic Golden Age. Specifically, he started an inquiry into the nature of existence, the limits of human knowledge, the use of reason in argumentation, the properties of the physical world, and the causes of disease and their treatments. His comprehensive worldview influenced Western philosophy and science for centuries.
