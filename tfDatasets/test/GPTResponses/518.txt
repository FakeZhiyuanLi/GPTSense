Glaciers require a combination of factors such as abundant snowfall, low temperatures, and slope of the land to form. While polar deserts are cold, they receive very little precipitation in the form of snow, which is essential for the formation of glaciers. Additionally, the terrain in polar deserts tends to be relatively flat and subject to high winds, which can remove any snow that has accumulated. Therefore, the lack of sufficient snowfall and the terrain's flatness and high winds limit the formation of glaciers in polar deserts.
