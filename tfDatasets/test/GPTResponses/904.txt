A democratic system of government is considered as a component of the rule of law. This is because in a democratic system, the law is applied equally to all citizens, and the government operates based on the principles of transparency and accountability. In addition, the separation of powers ensures that the judiciary is independent and can uphold the rule of law. Overall, a democratic system of government promotes the rule of law by ensuring that the government operates in accordance with the law and that citizens' fundamental rights and freedoms are protected.
