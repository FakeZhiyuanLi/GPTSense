Laser lock is a process used to stabilize the frequency of a laser beam. During laser lock, a feedback loop is created that uses a locking signal to adjust the laser's frequency until it matches the frequency of a reference signal. This reference signal can be an atomic or molecular transition or another laser with a known frequency.Once the laser frequency is locked, it remains stable and can be used for a variety of applications that require precise, stable laser light. For example, laser lock is commonly used in atomic clocks, precision measurement, and spectroscopy.
