There is no specific term that universally refers to the "corrupted high culture" of indigenous peoples. It is important to note that describing a culture as "corrupted" can be culturally insensitive and perpetuate negative stereotypes. Additionally, the idea of a single, uniform indigenous culture is a Western construct that does not accurately reflect the diversity and complexity of indigenous societies. It is more respectful to refer to specific cultural practices or beliefs, and to acknowledge the agency and autonomy of indigenous peoples in shaping their own cultures.
