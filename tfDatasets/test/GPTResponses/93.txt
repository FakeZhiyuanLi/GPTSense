Regulatory frameworks and policies. As financial markets and financial instruments continue to evolve and become more complex, regulations and policies have not always kept pace. This can lead to regulatory gaps, loopholes, and ineffectiveness, which can leave consumers, investors, and the economy at risk. Additionally, regulatory bodies may struggle to understand and oversee new financial technologies, which can create challenges in ensuring safety and stability in the financial system.
