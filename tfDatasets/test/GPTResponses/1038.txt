Gandhi espoused non-violent means to gain self-rule, such as civil disobedience, boycotts, strikes, and peaceful marches. He believed that through these actions, the Indian people could demonstrate their desire for independence from British colonial rule without resorting to violence or aggression. By mobilizing the masses and demonstrating their commitment to the cause, Gandhi believed that the British would eventually be forced to negotiate and grant India self-rule. He also emphasized the importance of moral and spiritual transformation, encouraging individuals to embody the values of truth, justice, and compassion in their daily lives as a means of promoting social and political change.
