The wire filament in a thermal conductivity gauge is heated through the passage of an electrical current. The gauge contains a small coil of wire, which is connected to an electrical circuit. When a current is applied to the coil, the wire filament heats up and begins to emit thermal energy. As gas molecules flow past the wire, they exchange heat with the filament, causing its temperature to change. This change in temperature is then measured by the gauge and used to calculate the thermal conductivity of the gas.
