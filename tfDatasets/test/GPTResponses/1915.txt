The landowner gains a regulatory certainty that the government will not take enforcement action against them for any incidental take of listed species resulting from their actions. This can provide the landowner with some level of immunity from prosecution or other legal actions. Additionally, the landowner may also receive some regulatory relief or incentives for their conservation efforts.
