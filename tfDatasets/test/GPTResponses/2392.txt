The Singing Revolution was a series of non-violent protests and demonstrations in the late 1980s and early 1990s in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, which were part of the Soviet Union at the time. The demonstrations were aimed at achieving political and economic independence from the Soviet Union and establishing democratic and free societies. The protesters were demanding the restoration of their national identity, culture, language, and rights. The singing festivals, which were a significant part of the revolution, were a peaceful and powerful way to express national pride and unity, and to demand freedom and democracy. Ultimately, the Singing Revolution was successful, leading to the independence of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania in 1991.
