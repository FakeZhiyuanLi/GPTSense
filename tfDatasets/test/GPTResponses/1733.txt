The USA Patriot Act (Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act) of 2001 expanded the definition of terrorism to include acts that are aimed at causing "mass destruction" or "mass casualties" as well as other activities that threaten national security. It also broadened the scope of what can be considered a terrorist offense to include activities that may not be violent, such as providing material support to terrorists or engaging in money laundering to fund terrorist activities. Furthermore, the Act authorized law enforcement agencies to engage in surveillance activities, including wiretapping, and increased the government's ability to detain and interrogate suspected terrorists without trial. The Patriot Act's expanded definition of terrorism has been controversial, with some critics suggesting that it could be used to target individuals and groups who are not involved in any violent activity but may hold unpopular political views or engage in peaceful protests.
