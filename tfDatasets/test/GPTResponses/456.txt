There were several factors that restricted child labour in Australia during the 1870s:1. The introduction of the Factories Act of 1870: This act created minimum age limits and maximum working hours for children.2. Public outcry: There was growing public concern about the exploitation of children in the workplace.3. Pressure from trade unions: Trade unions played an important role in advocating for the rights of workers, including children, and campaigned for legislative change.4. Economic growth: As the Australian economy grew, there was less of a need for child labour, as there were more adults available to work.5. Education: The introduction of compulsory education meant that children were required to attend school, reducing the number of children available for work.
