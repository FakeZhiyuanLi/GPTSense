King Charles II's charter established the Province of Carolina, which was a colony in the southern region of British North America. The charter granted land rights and governing power to eight of his loyal supporters, known as the Lords Proprietors. The charter also included provisions for religious freedom and encouraged settlement and development of the colony.
