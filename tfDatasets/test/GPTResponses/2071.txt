The Vedas are oriented with the philosophy of Vedanta, which emphasizes the existence of an ultimate reality and the interconnectedness of all beings. The Upanishads, which are part of the Vedas, also contain elements of Samkhya and Yoga philosophies, which focus on the nature of creation and the attainment of spiritual liberation, respectively. Additionally, the Vedas contain hymns and prayers that reflect the ancient Vedic religion, which involved the worship of nature deities and the performance of sacrificial rituals.
