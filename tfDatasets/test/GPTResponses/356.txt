There is no historical evidence to suggest that Avicenna learned from an unpopular philosopher's text. However, he was heavily influenced by the works of Aristotle and Plato, which were not always popular during his time. He also studied the works of Muslim philosophers such as Al-Farabi and Ibn Sina, as well as pre-Islamic Greek philosophers.
