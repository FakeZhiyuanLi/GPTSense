Einstein did not advocate Mach's principle, but rather he was critical of it. Mach's principle, named after Ernst Mach, states that an object's apparent acceleration is determined by the distribution of matter in the universe as a whole, rather than just the local matter around it. Einstein considered Mach's principle to be very vague and difficult to quantify, making it hard to use as a basis for scientific understanding. Instead, Einstein proposed his own theory of gravity, general relativity, which provided a more concrete explanation of how matter warps spacetime and creates gravitational attraction.
