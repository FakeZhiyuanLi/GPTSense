The number of devices that can be connected to a host controller varies depending on the type of controller and the technology being used. For example, a USB 2.0 host controller typically supports up to 127 devices, while a USB 3.0 host controller can support up to 127 devices as well. However, the actual number of devices that can be connected may also depend on the power supply and bandwidth available on the host controller.
