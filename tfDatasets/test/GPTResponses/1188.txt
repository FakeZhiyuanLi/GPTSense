A kilogram is defined as having a Planck constant of 6.626 x 10^-34 Joule-seconds. This definition was adopted by the General Conference on Weights and Measures in 2018, replacing the previous definition based on a physical prototype of a platinum-iridium cylinder known as the International Prototype of the Kilogram (IPK).
