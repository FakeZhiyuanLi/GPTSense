The charge on the electrodes of a capacitor is directly proportional to the voltage across the capacitor. This relationship is described by the equation Q = CV, where Q is the charge, C is the capacitance, and V is the voltage or potential difference. Therefore, if the capacitance is constant, the charge on the electrodes will be directly proportional to the voltage applied across the capacitor.
