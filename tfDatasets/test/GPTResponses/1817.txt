The primary consideration for determining if projects may be carried out in areas with endangered species is the impact of the project on the endangered species and its habitat. The project's potential impacts on the species' survival, reproduction, and overall well-being must be evaluated and assessed before any decisions are made regarding carrying out the project in the area. This assessment involves careful consideration of the species' current status, the likelihood of the project's impacts, and the mitigation measures that can be taken to minimize the impacts on the endangered species and its habitat.
