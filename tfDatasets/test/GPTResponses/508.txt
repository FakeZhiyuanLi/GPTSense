The concern of a missile gap was the fear that the Soviet Union had a significant advantage over the United States in terms of the number of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) they possessed. This fear arose in the late 1950s and early 1960s during the Cold War when tensions between the US and Soviet Union were high. The US feared that a significant missile gap would give the Soviet Union the ability to launch a devastating nuclear attack on the US, which could potentially tip the balance of power in favor of the USSR.
