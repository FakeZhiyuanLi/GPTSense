I'm not sure which specific encroachments you are referring to, but historically the Church of Cyprus has faced a number of challenges to its authority and autonomy. These have included attempts by foreign powers to interfere in the church's affairs, conflicts with secular authorities over matters such as control of church property and the right to appoint bishops, and disputes with other religious communities over matters such as access to holy sites. In each case, the Church of Cyprus has sought to defend its interests and maintain its independence, often through a combination of legal and political means.
