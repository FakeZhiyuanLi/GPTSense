One aspect of a visit to the Rotunda for the Charters of Freedom is viewing the original documents that shaped the United States: the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights. Visitors can see these historic documents up close and learn about their significance in American history. Additionally, exhibits in the Rotunda provide context and background on the creation of these documents and the events that led to their creation.
