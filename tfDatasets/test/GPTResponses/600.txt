Jaipal's subjects believed that he brought disaster upon them by going to war against Mahmud of Ghazni in 1001 AD. The battle resulted in a crushing defeat for the Indian army, with Jaipal losing all his resources and men. This made the people lose confidence in his leadership and his ability to protect them from external threats. His actions were seen as reckless and hasty, resulting in the loss of thousands of lives and the weakening of the kingdom's military power. As a consequence, his subjects believed that he had brought disaster upon their land.
