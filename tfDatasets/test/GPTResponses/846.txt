"The Magna Carta" may have a significant impact on contemporary law making practices. This document, signed in 1215, established the principle that everyone, including the king, was subject to the law. It also guaranteed certain rights to the people, such as the right to a fair trial and the right to due process. The Magna Carta is often cited as a foundational document for modern constitutional law and the protection of individual rights. Its principles can be seen in many contemporary legal systems, including the United States Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.
