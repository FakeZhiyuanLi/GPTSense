When lobbying is controlled, there are several factors that are considered to determine improper influencing, which can include:1. Gifts and favors: If lobbyists offer gifts, trips, or other incentives to public officials in an attempt to sway their decisions, this may be considered improper influencing.2. Disclosure: If lobbyists fail to disclose their full client list or the amount of money they are being paid, this may indicate an attempt to hide their influence.3. Insider access: If lobbyists use their connections to gain access to sensitive or confidential information or meetings, this may be seen as an attempt to improperly influence policy decisions.4. Misrepresentation: If lobbyists misrepresent facts or use misleading information in an attempt to sway public opinion or policy decisions, this may be considered unethical or even illegal.5. Threats or intimidation: If lobbyists resort to threats or intimidation to get their way, this is clearly inappropriate and may be considered a criminal offense.Overall, the key consideration in determining whether lobbying is improper influencing is whether it involves an attempt to unduly influence policy decisions or public opinion through unethical or illegal means.
