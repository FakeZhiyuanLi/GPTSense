Burrowing marine annelids play an important role in ocean ecosystems by aerating and rejuvenating the seafloor. They burrow through the sediment, creating tunnels and mixing the layers, which helps to bring nutrients, oxygen, and fresh water to deeper layers. This makes it possible for other organisms living within the sediment to breathe and obtain nutrients that are brought to the surface layer. They also transport nutrients between different depths of the water column, enabling the flow of energy within ocean ecosystems. Additionally, the burrows provided by these worms create habitats for other invertebrates such as clams and crabs, which further contributes to the health and diversity of the ecosystem.
