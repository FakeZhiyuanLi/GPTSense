It was customary for those wearing shoes indoors in the Ottoman Empire to remove their shoes upon entering a home or mosque as a sign of respect and cleanliness. This tradition was linked to Islamic customs and hygiene practices. Guests were often provided with slippers, or "terlik," which were kept specifically for indoor use.
