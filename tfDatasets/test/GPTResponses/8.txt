Increased sediment and delta growth in the Rhine River have also produced ecological changes, including alterations to the river's habitats and species composition. The deposition of sediments can smother aquatic vegetation and bottom-dwelling organisms, while the construction of levees and other structures can alter the natural connectivity and flow of the river, affecting the migration and spawning of fish species. Additionally, the influx of nutrients and pollutants from agricultural runoff and urbanization can lead to eutrophication and harmful algal blooms in downstream areas.
