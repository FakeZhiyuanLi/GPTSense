In some ways, the light quantum behaves as a particle or a discrete unit of energy. This is because the concept of the light quantum, also known as a photon, is based on the idea that light can be absorbed or emitted in discrete amounts of energy. This behavior is similar to that of particles, which can also exhibit discrete quantized energy states. However, in other ways, such as its wave-like properties, light behaves as a wave. This is because it can exhibit interference and diffraction, which are hallmarks of waves. Therefore, the nature of light can be seen as a duality, with both wave-like and particle-like characteristics.
