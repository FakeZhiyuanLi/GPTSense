The soldiers rebelled against issues such as low pay, racial discrimination, the introduction of the new Enfield rifle cartridges which were rumored to be greased with animal fat (including cow and pig fat, which were sacred and taboo to Indian Hindus and Muslims, respectively), and the overall control and dominion of the British East India Company. The rebellion was also fueled by the growing Indian nationalism and resentment towards British rule.
