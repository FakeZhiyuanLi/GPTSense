One perfect example of a filled vacuum showing a curvature would be the shape and behavior of a soap bubble. When it is filled with air or gas, the bubble automatically forms a spherical shape due to the surface tension of its thin film. This demonstrates how the presence of air inside a vacuum can cause the space to take on a curved shape.
