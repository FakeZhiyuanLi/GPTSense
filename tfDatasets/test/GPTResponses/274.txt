HDTVs increase the effective image resolution by not using interlacing. Interlacing was a method used for transmitting video signals in standard-definition televisions that split each frame into two fields and transmitted them alternately. This led to a loss of image clarity and detail, especially during fast-moving scenes. HDTVs use progressive scanning, which displays each frame in its entirety, resulting in a sharper and clearer image.
