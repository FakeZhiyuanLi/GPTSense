The study of the shapes of crystals is known as crystallography, and several scientists have made contributions to this field over time. Some notable scientists who have studied the shapes of crystals include:1. René-Just Haüy: A French mineralogist who is known as the father of crystallography, Haüy developed the theory of crystal structure based on the observation of crystal faces.2. Auguste Bravais: A French mathematician who developed the concept of lattice structure in crystals. This provided a mathematical foundation for crystallography.3. William Hallowes Miller: A British mineralogist who developed the Miller index notation system, which is still used today to describe crystallographic planes.4. Pauling and coworkers: Linus Pauling and coworkers developed the concept of chemical bond valence and used it to explain the crystal structures of many minerals.5. Rosalind Franklin: A British scientist who used X-ray diffraction to study the structure of DNA, also made contributions to the field of crystallography.6. Max von Laue: A German physicist awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1914, for his discovery of the diffraction of X-rays by crystals.7. Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin: A British chemist awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964, for developing the technique of X-ray crystallography to determine the three-dimensional structure of molecules, including penicillin and insulin.
