The official record of parliamentary debates is known as Hansard. Hansard contains a nearly verbatim account of everything said in the chamber, including interjections, points of order, and other procedural matters. Hansard is published daily for the House of Commons and the House of Lords in the United Kingdom, as well as for other parliamentary bodies around the world. It is considered a primary source for anyone studying parliamentary proceedings or researching the history of a particular legislative body.
