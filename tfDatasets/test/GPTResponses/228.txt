They have made numerous first ascents of difficult peaks all around the world, and have established themselves as some of the most skilled and experienced climbers in the world.It is difficult to say exactly when Swiss mountaineers have ascended most of the peaks, as new routes and variations are still being established all the time. However, it is safe to say that Swiss mountaineers have had a significant impact on the history and culture of mountaineering, and continue to play a major role in the global climbing community.
