Transparency is a key qualifier for determining good governance. This means that the government and its officials should be open and clear in their decision-making processes, ensuring that the public has access to information about how decisions are made and how resources are allocated. Good governance also involves accountability, participation, and responsiveness to the needs of citizens. By ensuring transparency, governments can promote trust and confidence in their actions, and help people feel secure in their rights and privileges.
