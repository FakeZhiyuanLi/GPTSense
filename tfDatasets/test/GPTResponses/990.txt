The green color in malachite pigments is derived from the mineral malachite (Cu2CO3(OH)2). Malachite is a copper carbonate hydroxide mineral that is used as a pigment in various applications, including painting and cosmetics. The color comes from the presence of copper ions in the mineral, which absorb certain wavelengths of light, resulting in the green color.
