Brass is believed to have been first used in the Near East, around 500 BC. The exact origins of brass are not known, but historians believe that it was accidentally discovered when copper and zinc-rich ores were put in a furnace together. The resulting metal was a harder and more durable material than pure copper, which led to its widespread use in various applications, such as making weapons, tools, and decorative objects.
