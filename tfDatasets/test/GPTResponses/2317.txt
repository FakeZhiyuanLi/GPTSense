During World War II, the Germans invaded and occupied Estonia with the help of local collaborators. There were Estonians who supported and cooperated with the Germans, including members of the Estonian Self-Administration, Estonian Security Police, and the 20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Estonian). However, it is important to note that not all Estonians supported the German occupation, and many resisted and fought against the German forces.
