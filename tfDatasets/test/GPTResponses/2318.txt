In American football, if the ball is closer to the goal line than the usual distance of a penalty (which is 10 yards), the penalty will be half the distance to the goal line. For example, if the offensive team commits a penalty from the 3-yard line, the penalty will be half the distance to the goal line, which is 1.5 yards. Therefore, the ball would be placed on the 1.5-yard line, and the offense would have to gain that distance to score a touchdown.
