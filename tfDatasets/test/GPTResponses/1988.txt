One particular loophole that aids roadside zoos and private collectors is the exemption provided by the Animal Welfare Act (AWA) for certain facilities that operate as "roadside menageries" or "carnivals". These facilities are only required to hold a USDA Class C exhibitorâ€™s license, which has much lower regulatory standards than the Class B license required for animal dealers or the Class A license required for zoos and research facilities. As a result, many roadside zoos and private collectors can continue to operate without proper oversight and regulation.
