Scholars say the times are different depending on the gospel it's written in because each gospel was written by a different author for a different audience and purpose. The gospels were written at different times in history, with different theological and cultural perspectives.For example, the Gospel of Mark was likely written around 70 AD during a time of persecution of Christians in Rome, and its audience was likely Gentile Christians who were unfamiliar with Jewish traditions. In contrast, the Gospel of Matthew was likely written sometime between 80-90 AD for a predominantly Jewish Christian audience.Therefore, the times are different depending on the gospel it's written in because each gospel reflects its own particular historical, cultural, and theological context.
