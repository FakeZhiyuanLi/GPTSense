A pharynx is a muscular tube-like structure located in the back of the throat that connects the oral cavity to the esophagus and the nasal cavity to the larynx. It is responsible for conducting air and food during the process of swallowing and breathing. The pharynx plays an important role in both the respiratory and digestive systems.
