British post-punk emerged in the late 1970s, following the end of the punk rock movement. It was characterized by a more experimental and diverse sound, incorporating elements of art rock, funk, and electronic music, among others. Some of the key players in this genre include Joy Division, The Cure, Gang of Four, and Siouxsie and the Banshees.
