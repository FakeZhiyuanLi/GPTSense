In classical times, Apollo's strong function in popular religion was as a god of light, music, poetry, prophecy, and healing. He was one of the most important deities in the Greek pantheon and was typically depicted as a handsome young man holding a lyre or a bow and arrows. Apollo was also associated with oracles, especially the famous oracle at Delphi, where he was believed to provide advice, guidance, and prophecy to those who consulted it. Additionally, he was seen as a healer and was often invoked to cure diseases and to provide protection against various forms of harm.
