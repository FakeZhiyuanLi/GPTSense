In the 2004 US presidential election, the gap between George W. Bush's and John Kerry's popular vote was approximately 3 million votes, with Bush receiving approximately 62 million votes and Kerry receiving approximately 59 million votes. However, it is important to note that the outcome of the election is determined by the electoral college, not the popular vote.
