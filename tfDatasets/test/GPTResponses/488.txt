Glaciers in Africa are primarily located on Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania and on Mount Kenya, both of which are located near the equator. There are also smaller glaciers on Mount Stanley in Uganda and on the Rwenzori Mountains on the border between Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. However, due to climate change, these glaciers have been receding rapidly in recent years.
