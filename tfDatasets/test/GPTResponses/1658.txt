One example of a fully maturing technology that offers a ready disposal mechanism is recycling. Recycling allows for materials to be reused and repurposed instead of being discarded and potentially becoming waste. Recycling has become increasingly common and accessible in many communities, with established systems and facilities for collection and processing of materials. This technology offers a sustainable and environmentally-friendly disposal mechanism for a variety of materials, including plastics, paper, metals, and glass.
