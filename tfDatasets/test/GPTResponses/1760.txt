Industrial music gets its name from the term "industrial society," which refers to the shift from an agrarian-based economy to a manufacturing-based economy during the Industrial Revolution. The music is characterized by its use of mechanical or electronic sounds, often resembling factory or machinery noises, in combination with traditional musical instruments. The term was first used to describe the experimental music of bands like Throbbing Gristle and Cabaret Voltaire in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
