Leibniz's arguments trade heavily upon principles such as the Principle of Sufficient Reason, the Principle of Non-Contradiction, the Principle of Identity, the Principle of the Best, and the Principle of Harmony. These principles are central to his philosophy and are essential to his arguments regarding the nature of reality, the existence of God, and the relationship between mind and body.
