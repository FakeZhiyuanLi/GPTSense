Luís de Camões wrote the epic poem "The Lusiads" (Os Lusíadas in Portuguese), which is considered one of the greatest works of Portuguese literature and a masterpiece of the Renaissance. It was first published in 1572 and tells the story of Portugal's voyages of discovery and conquest during the Age of Exploration, particularly focusing on Vasco da Gama's journey to India.
