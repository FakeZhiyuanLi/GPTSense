The neocortex, a part of the cerebral cortex that is responsible for higher cognitive functions such as sensory perception, spatial reasoning, conscious thought, and language, is the brain structure that most strongly differentiates mammals from other vertebrate species. Mammals have a significantly larger neocortex relative to their brain size compared to other vertebrates, allowing for complex behaviors and greater adaptability to their environments.
