The British Empire did not replace the Maratha Empire in a specific year. The Maratha Empire gradually declined during the late 18th and early 19th century due to a combination of internal conflicts and external invasions by foreign powers like the British. The British East India Company gradually established its dominance over the Indian subcontinent, including the Maratha Empire, through a series of wars and treaties until the British Raj was established in 1858.
