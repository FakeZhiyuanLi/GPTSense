the Ottomans would refer to as "commoners" or non-elite individuals outside of the palace or aristocracy. The YalÄ±s, or seaside mansions, of the Pashas were typically where the elite would entertain guests and organize lavish feasts, often showcasing the best foods and culinary creations of the Ottoman Empire. As non-elite individuals were sometimes employed as staff or servants at these gatherings, they may have had the opportunity to taste and learn about Ottoman cuisine through these experiences. Similarly, as Ottoman cuisine became a symbol of wealth and status, some commoners may have attempted to replicate these dishes at home, or learn the techniques used by elite chefs in order to elevate their own culinary skills.
