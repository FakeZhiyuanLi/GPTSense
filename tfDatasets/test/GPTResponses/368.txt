Von Neumann's method used a process called Monte Carlo simulation to solve mathematical problems. It involved using random numbers and probability to simulate the behavior of complex systems and analyze the results. The method is widely used in computational physics, chemistry, financial modeling, and many other fields, and it has also been used to solve optimization problems and create computer algorithms.
