In the nineteenth century, popular paints and pigments were highly toxic because they contained substances such as lead, arsenic, mercury, and chromium. These substances were used as pigments or to improve the durability and quality of the paint. However, they posed serious health risks to those who worked with them, as well as to those who used the final product. Exposure to these toxic substances could result in a range of health problems, including respiratory issues, neurological damage, and even death. The dangers of these substances were not widely understood in the nineteenth century, and so it was common for them to be used in paint and other products without adequate safety precautions.
