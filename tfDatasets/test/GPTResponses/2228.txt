A hydrostatic gauge is used to measure the pressure of liquids or fluids, such as water or hydraulic fluid, by means of hydrostatic pressure. The gauge consists of a sealed flexible diaphragm that is connected to a movement and a scale to display the pressure reading. Hydrostatic gauges are commonly used in various industries, including oil and gas, water treatment, and manufacturing, as they provide accurate and reliable measurement of fluid pressures.
