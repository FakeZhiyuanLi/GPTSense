Many capacitors contain a dielectric material that raises the capacitance. The dielectric material is a non-conductive substance that is placed between the conductive plates of the capacitor to increase the distance between them and reduce the electric field. This increases the amount of charge that can be stored on the capacitor, and thus the capacitance is raised. Some common dielectric materials used in capacitors include ceramic, paper, plastic, and electrolytic fluids.
