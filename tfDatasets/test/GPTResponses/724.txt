Many European countries, including the United Kingdom and France, were afraid of a pact between Germany and the Soviet governments. They feared that such an alliance would strengthen Germany's position in Europe and threaten the balance of power. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, was also wary of Germany's intentions and sought to protect its own interests. Ultimately, the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in 1939 between Germany and the Soviet Union shocked the world and marked the beginning of World War II.
