Other methods used for determining the structure of molecules rely on the two effects of diffraction and spectroscopy. Diffraction techniques include neutron diffraction, electron diffraction, and powder diffraction, while spectroscopic techniques include nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, infrared (IR) spectroscopy, and UV-Visible spectroscopy. These methods allow for the determination of molecular geometry, bond lengths, bond angles, and the identification of functional groups within a molecule.
