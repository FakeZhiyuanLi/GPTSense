The systematic study of color theory began in the late 18th century, although there were earlier attempts to understand the properties of color. One of the most significant early works on color theory was published in 1810 by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, called "Theory of Colours". In the early 20th century, the field of color theory developed further with contributions from artists and scientists such as Albert Munsell, Johannes Itten, and Josef Albers.
