There are several metals that can be absorbed in an ultra high vacuum system, including:1. Titanium (Ti): Titanium is a commonly used metal in vacuum systems due to its high strength and low outgassing rate. It is often used for components such as vacuum chambers, flanges, and fittings.2. Tungsten (W): Tungsten is another metal that is frequently used in ultra high vacuum systems due to its high melting point and low vapor pressure. It is often used for filaments in electron guns and ion sources, as well as for heater elements and thermocouples.
