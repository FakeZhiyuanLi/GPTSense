It is common for monotheistic religions such as Christianity, Judaism, and Islam to believe that God has no sexual partner. In these religions, God is often depicted as a masculine figure and is not associated with any sexual desire or reproduction. However, some polytheistic religions like Hinduism have gods who are often depicted as having a sexual partner.
