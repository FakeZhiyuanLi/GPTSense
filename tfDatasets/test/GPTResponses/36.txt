The delta in the Netherlands starts at the mouth of the Rhine River and extends through the estuaries of the Maas (Meuse) and Scheldt (Schelde) rivers. The delta region covers most of the southwestern part of the country, including the provinces of Zeeland, South Holland, North Brabant, and Utrecht. The Dutch Delta Works, a system of dikes, dams, and other constructions, were built to protect the low-lying delta region from flooding caused by storm surges from the North Sea.
