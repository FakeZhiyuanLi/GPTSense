There were several issues that led to the English colonists leaving Virginia, including conflicts with the Native Americans, disease, and the harsh conditions of the environment. However, the main issue was the inability of the colonists to develop a viable agricultural economy. The soil was not fertile enough to support large-scale farming, and the settlers lacked the necessary skills and resources to adapt to the new environment. As a result, they were unable to sustain themselves and were forced to abandon the colony in 1587.
