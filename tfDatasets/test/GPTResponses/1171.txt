Paper capacitors were first manufactured in the early 1900s. The first known patent for a paper capacitor was filed in 1907 by a German scientist named Georg Simon Ohm. They became widely used in electronic circuits throughout the 20th century until they were largely replaced by newer technologies like ceramic and film capacitors in the 21st century.
