Insects have a complete digestive system that consists of a mouth, esophagus, crop, gizzard, midgut, hindgut, and anus. The digestion of food happens primarily in the midgut, which is the central digestive organ. Enzymes are secreted in the midgut to break down food into simpler molecules that can be absorbed into the insect's body through the walls of the midgut. The hindgut, which includes the rectum and anus, is responsible for processing and excreting waste products from the insect's body.
