It became possible to share the voltage for different types of trains through the development of standardized electrical systems and equipment. Historically, different types of trains used different electrical systems and voltages, making it difficult for them to share tracks and power sources. However, over time, engineers and manufacturers developed standard designs for electrical components such as transformers, rectifiers, and traction motors. This allowed trains to be outfitted with interchangeable equipment and made it possible for different types of trains to use the same power source and voltage. Today, most trains around the world use standardized electrical systems, allowing for easier interoperability and flexibility on shared railway networks.
