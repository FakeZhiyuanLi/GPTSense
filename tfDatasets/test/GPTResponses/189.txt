Solar balloons are often used for recreational, educational, or scientific purposes, such as for exhibitions, experiments, or photography. They can also be used for weather forecasting, atmospheric research, and for communication purposes. However, the use of solar balloons is limited to specific conditions, such as appropriate weather, low wind speeds, and suitable locations with enough sunlight. Additionally, solar balloons may not be suitable for long-term or high-altitude flights due to their vulnerability to changing weather conditions and limited control over their trajectory.
