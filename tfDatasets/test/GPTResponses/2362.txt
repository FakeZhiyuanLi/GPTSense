Fertilization is the fusion of sperm and egg, resulting in the formation of a zygote, which contains a complete set of genetic information from both parents. After fertilization, the zygote undergoes a series of rapid cell divisions called cleavage. These divisions eventually lead to the formation of a blastula, a hollow ball of cells that contains a fluid-filled cavity called the blastocoel.During gastrulation, the blastula undergoes a series of complex rearrangements to form a three-layered embryo, with an outer ectoderm, an inner endoderm, and a middle layer called the mesoderm. The ectoderm gives rise to the skin, nervous system, and other structures, while the endoderm forms the digestive and respiratory organs. The mesoderm differentiates into muscle, bone, blood vessels, and other tissues.In the process of neurulation, the nervous system starts to form, with the development of the neural tube, which eventually becomes the brain and spinal cord. As the embryo continues to develop, various structures, such as the heart, eyes, and limbs, begin to form and mature.Overall, the process of fertilization and subsequent embryonic development is a complex and highly regulated series of events that results in the formation of a fully formed organism.
