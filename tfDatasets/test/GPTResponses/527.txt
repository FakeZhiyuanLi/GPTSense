The four gospels of the New Testament, namely Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, provide a biographical account of Jesus' life, ministry, teachings, death, and resurrection. They detail his birth in Bethlehem, his baptism by John the Baptist, his teachings, miracles, and parables, his crucifixion, death, and resurrection from the dead. The gospels also discuss his disciples, his encounters with religious and political leaders of his time, and the establishment of his church. Additionally, they explore the themes of faith, grace, love, forgiveness, salvation, and the Kingdom of God.
