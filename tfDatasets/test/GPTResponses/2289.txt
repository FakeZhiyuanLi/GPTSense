Within 5 yards from the line of scrimmage, defensive players can legally contact offensive players who do not have the ball. After 5 yards, defensive players can only contact an offensive player if the ball is in the air and within the allowable contact zone (within 1 yard of the line of scrimmage for a forward pass, or within the entire field for a pass made behind the line of scrimmage).
