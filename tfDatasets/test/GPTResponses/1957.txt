The idea of the Iraq War was initially popular in some Western countries, particularly the United States and the United Kingdom. However, public opinion gradually turned against the war as it became clear that the intelligence used to justify the invasion was flawed and that the war was costing both lives and resources. By the mid-2000s, the Iraq War was widely unpopular in Western countries, leading to protests and a truncation of military involvement.
