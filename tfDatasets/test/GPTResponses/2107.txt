The existence of virtual particles was mathematically predicted in the 1930s through the theory of quantum mechanics. However, their existence was not directly confirmed experimentally until the 1940s and 1950s through a series of experiments in high-energy physics, such as the Lamb shift and the anomalous magnetic dipole moment of the electron. Since then, the existence of virtual particles has been well-established in the scientific community.
