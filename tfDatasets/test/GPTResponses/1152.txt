Nasser met his anti-colonialist teacher, Sheikh Hassan al-Banna, at the age of 16 in 1933 in Ismailia, Egypt. Al-Banna was the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist political organization that advocated for the rejection of colonization and the establishment of an Islamic state. Nasser was influenced by al-Banna's ideologies and worked closely with the Muslim Brotherhood before eventually breaking off to form his own nationalist movement.
