The main action that both AC (Alternating Current) and DC (Direct Current) systems have to deal with is the movement of electrical charge or current through conductive materials. In AC systems, the current changes direction periodically, while in DC systems, the current flows in one direction only. Both types of systems require the proper management and control of the flow of electrical energy to ensure safe and effective operation.
