Early HDTVs, also known as first-generation HDTVs, were introduced in the late 1990s and early 2000s. These TV sets typically had large screens and were very expensive at the time. The prices for early HDTVs ranged from several thousand dollars to more than ten thousand dollars depending on the size, brand, and features. For example, a 42-inch Plasma HDTV from Pioneer introduced in 1997 cost around $9,000, while a 50-inch Rear-Projection HDTV from Sony cost around $14,000 in 2002. These prices have significantly decreased over the years as new models and technology advanced.
