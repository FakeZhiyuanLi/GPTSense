Female insects have specialized glands in their reproductive system called accessory glands. These glands secrete substances that are used to produce and nourish eggs, as well as to aid in sperm storage and fertilization. Depending on the species of insect, there may be multiple types of accessory glands present, each with their own specific functions.
