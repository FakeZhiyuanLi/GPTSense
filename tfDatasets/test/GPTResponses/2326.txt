is known about the properties and behaviors of glass. For example, when a force is applied to glass, the molecules and atoms within the glass are pushed and pulled in different directions. As these forces become too great for the glass to withstand, the bonds holding the molecules together begin to break, causing the glass to fracture and shatter. This process can be explained using Newton's laws of motion, which describe how forces affect the motion and behavior of objects. Additionally, the physical properties of glass, such as its hardness, brittleness, and elasticity, can further contribute to its propensity to break or shatter under certain conditions. By understanding these fundamental principles of physics and the unique properties of glass, we can gain a better understanding of how and why glass breaks.
