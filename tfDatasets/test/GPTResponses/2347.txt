A lack of zinc in children can cause growth retardation, delayed sexual maturation, poor appetite and poor immune function. It can also lead to dermatitis, diarrhea, emotional disorders, and a general feeling of weakness and fatigue. Prolonged deficiency may eventually cause stunted growth, impaired cognitive performance, and delayed wound healing.
