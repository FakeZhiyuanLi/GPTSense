constant and the same?The speed of light in a vacuum is constant and is approximately 299,792,458 meters per second. According to the theory of relativity, the speed of light is an invariant quantity and is the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion. This means that no matter how fast an observer is moving, they will always measure the speed of light to be the same value. This principle is a fundamental tenet of the theory of relativity and has been confirmed through many experiments and observations.
