The offshoots of polychaetes that are only segmented in the rear are called epitokes. Epitokes are specialized reproductive structures that are formed by some polychaete species as part of their reproductive cycle. They are formed when certain segments of the worm's body become enlarged and fully mature for the purpose of releasing gametes during spawning events. These segments, which are typically found in the posterior portion of the worm, are called epitokous segments, and they are distinct from the rest of the worm's body, which is referred to as the atokous portion.
