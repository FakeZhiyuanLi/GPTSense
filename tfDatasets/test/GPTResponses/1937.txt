The Manhattan No Wave scene started becoming more dance-oriented in the late 1970s and early 1980s with the emergence of bands like Liquid Liquid and ESG, who blended punk, funk, and disco rhythms to create danceable, high-energy grooves. These bands played in downtown clubs like the Mudd Club and Danceteria, where audiences were more interested in dancing and having fun than in the avant-garde experimentation of earlier No Wave acts like DNA and Teenage Jesus and the Jerks.
