God or nature. This substance is infinite, eternal, and indivisible. According to Spinoza, everything in the universe is an aspect or expression of this one substance, including human beings, animals, and even inanimate objects. He believed that God and nature were interchangeable terms and that the laws of nature were identical to the will of God. Spinoza also believed that humans could achieve freedom and happiness by understanding and accepting their place in the universe and by living in accordance with its laws.
