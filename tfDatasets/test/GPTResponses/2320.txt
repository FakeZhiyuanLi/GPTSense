A QED (quantum electrodynamics) vacuum, also known as a "perfect vacuum," is impossible to achieve due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. This principle states that it is impossible to know both the position and the momentum of a particle with absolute certainty. In a vacuum, even if there are no particles present, there are still virtual particles and energy fluctuations that are constantly appearing and disappearing. These fluctuations violate the idea of a QED vacuum, as they cause the vacuum to have a certain amount of energy and excitations at all times. Therefore, a perfect vacuum can never be achieved as it would require the absence of all virtual particles and energy fluctuations, which is impossible due to the uncertainty principle.
