The Sahara is known for its intense heat and high atmospheric pressure, which can reach up to 1,040 millibars (mb). This is due to the massive expanse of hot desert air, combined with the lack of moisture and vegetation to absorb the sun's energy, resulting in high temperatures and pressure. The intense pressure in the Sahara can cause dehydration, exhaustion, and other health issues for those living and traveling in the region.
