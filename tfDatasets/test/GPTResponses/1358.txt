When a USB device is first connected to a host, the host computer will initiate a process called device enumeration. This process involves the host computer sending requests to the USB device to gather information about the device, such as its device class, vendor ID, product ID, and other parameters. Once the device is identified, the host will load any necessary drivers and configure the device for use. Depending on the type of device, additional applications or services may also be started to facilitate communication between the host and the device.
