Muslims believe that Trinitism too closely resembles polytheism or the worship of multiple gods, which goes against the fundamental belief in monotheism (the belief in one god) that is central to Islam. Muslims believe that God is indivisible and there is no concept of plurality in His being, as stated in the Quran. Therefore, the belief in the Trinity is seen as a violation of this principle and conflicting with the Islamic concept of tawhid (oneness of God).
