In the early days of sociology, there were several concerns related to culture:1. Defining Culture: One of the early concerns in sociology was how to define culture. Culture was seen as a complex and multifaceted concept that was difficult to define and measure.2. Cultural Relativism: Another concern was cultural relativism, the idea that different cultures have different values and practices, and that these differences must be understood and respected.3. Ethnocentrism: A third concern was ethnocentrism â€“ the tendency to judge other cultures based on one's own culture. Sociologists were concerned that this could lead to misunderstandings, stereotypes, and prejudice.4. Cultural Change: Sociologists were also concerned with understanding how culture changes over time. They saw culture as an evolving system that was influenced by social, political, and economic factors.5. Socialization: Finally, sociologists were interested in how culture was transmitted from one generation to the next. They studied the process of socialization, which was seen as a critical factor in shaping culture and individual behavior.
