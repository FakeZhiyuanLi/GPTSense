crystalline solids such as quartz, feldspar or mica. This is because both glass and crystalline solids have a highly ordered arrangement of atoms or molecules, and a distinct three-dimensional structure. While crystalline solids have a regularly repeating pattern that extends throughout the entire solid, glass lacks this pattern and instead has a more random structure.
