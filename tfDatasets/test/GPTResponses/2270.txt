Insects typically excrete their waste through an opening called the anus or rectum. Depending on the insect, the dry pellet or frass (fecal matter) may be discarded on the ground or on leaves or other surfaces where the insect resides. Some insects, such as termites and ants, have designated areas within their nests or colonies for waste disposal.
