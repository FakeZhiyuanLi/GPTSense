The Geneva Declaration of the Rights of the Child was adopted by the League of Nations on September 26, 1924. However, it was not an official international treaty and did not have legal binding force. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child replaced the Geneva Declaration and was adopted on November 20, 1989. It has since been ratified by 196 countries.
