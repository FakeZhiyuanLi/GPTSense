different types?The breakdown field strength for air dielectric capacitors can vary depending on the specific type of capacitor. However, the general order from lowest to highest breakdown field strength is:1. Parallel-plate capacitors2. Cylindrical capacitors3. Spherical capacitorsIt's important to note that the breakdown field strength can also depend on other factors such as the voltage rating, spacing between the electrodes, and the size and shape of the electrodes.
