Some philosophers and scientists argue that the fundamental laws of physics are laws of temporal evolution. One prominent proponent of this view is the physicist and philosopher of science, David Lewis. Lewis argues that the laws of physics are not just static descriptions of how the world is, but are rather dynamic principles that explain how the world changes over time. According to Lewis, the fundamental laws of physics are concerned with the evolution of physical systems, and they provide the causal basis for all events that occur in the world. Other proponents of this view include Ernst Nagel, Bas van Fraassen, and Nancy Cartwright.
