One of the most important and complex of the Olympian deities in classical Greek and Roman religion is the god Zeus (Jupiter in Roman mythology). As the king of the gods, he was considered the ruler of the universe and was highly respected and worshipped by the ancient Greeks and Romans. Zeus was known for his various roles and attributes, including being the god of the sky, thunder, lightning, laws and order, hospitality, and fertility. He was also associated with various symbols, such as the eagle, oak tree, and thunderbolt. In addition, Zeus was often depicted as a powerful and wise figure, but also one with human-like flaws and weaknesses, which made him a complex and relatable deity for many people.
