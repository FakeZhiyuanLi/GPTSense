At the beginning of the 4th century BCE, the phrase "Great King" became merely a formula of adulation. It was particularly used to describe the rulers of the Achaemenid Empire, which was then the most powerful empire in the world. The phrase was originally meant to emphasize the greatness and power of the king, but over time, it became an empty phrase used to flatter and praise the king for no real reason. The phrase "Great King" was often used in inscriptions and official documents, and it became a way for people to show their loyalty and obedience to the king. However, the phrase lost its original meaning and became a standard way of addressing the king, whether or not he deserved the title.
