The area around Miami was originally inhabited by indigenous tribes such as the Tequesta, Calusa, and Seminole. They did not have a specific name for the area, but referred to it as "Manahtíaan" meaning "big water" in their respective languages. When Spanish explorers arrived in the late 16th century, they referred to the area as "Bahía de Biscayne" or "Bay of Biscayne".
