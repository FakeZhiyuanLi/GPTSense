According to reports, former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf allowed the US to use at least three airbases in Pakistan for its military operations in Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks. These airbases were the Shahbaz Airbase in Jacobabad, the Pasni Airbase in Balochistan, and the Dalbandin Airbase in Chagai district. However, the exact number of airbases used by the US military may vary depending on the source.
