It is estimated that around 1,000 modern Portuguese words have Arabic origins. These words are a reflection of the influence of the Arabic language and culture in the Iberian Peninsula during the medieval period. Some common examples include "açúcar" (sugar), "azeitona" (olive), "alfândega" (customs), "alface" (lettuce), "alfazema" (lavender), and "algarismo" (digit).
