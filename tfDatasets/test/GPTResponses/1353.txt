Piezoelectricity is especially problematic in applications where it is necessary to measure or detect small electrical signals or voltages. These applications include strain gauges, accelerometers, and sensitive electronic instruments. In these applications, the piezoelectric effect can introduce noise and interfere with the accuracy of measurements. It is also problematic in applications where it is necessary to control or dampen mechanical vibrations, such as in precision machining or aerospace technologies. Piezoelectric materials can amplify vibrations and make them harder to control, which can lead to mechanical failure or reduced accuracy.
