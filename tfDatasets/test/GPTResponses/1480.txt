The plates and dielectrics are often staggered in larger value capacitors to reduce the overall size of the capacitor. This is because as the capacitance value of a capacitor increases, the physical size of the plates also has to increase to accommodate the charge. Staggering the plates and dielectrics allows more surface area for the plates without increasing the overall size of the capacitor, thus reducing manufacturing costs and making the capacitor more efficient. Additionally, staggering the plates reduces the risk of arcing, as there is a larger distance between the plates when they are staggered.
