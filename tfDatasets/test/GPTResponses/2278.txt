Just after the attack on Pearl Harbor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt addressed Congress and famously referred to December 7, 1941, as "a date which will live in infamy." He requested a declaration of war against Japan, which was approved the same day. On December 8, the United States officially entered World War II. In the following months, the U.S. mobilized its military forces and joined the Allied effort to fight against Axis powers in Europe and the Pacific. The attack also led to the internment of Japanese-Americans, with more than 120,000 individuals forced to leave their homes and live in camps.
