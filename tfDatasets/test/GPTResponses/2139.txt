Satellites need to fire their engines periodically to keep their orbit stable and prevent them from drifting too far off their intended path. This is because despite being in space, satellites are subject to various environmental factors that can cause their orbit to change, such as atmospheric drag, solar wind, and gravitational pull from other celestial bodies. By firing their engines, satellites can adjust their speed and altitude and maintain their orbit. This process is known as orbital station keeping or maneuvering.
