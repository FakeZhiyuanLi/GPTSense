The Verdingkinder auctions were a controversial practice that took place in Switzerland from the 19th century until the mid-20th century. These auctions involved the selling of children to farmers as cheap laborers. The children, who were typically orphans, poor or from broken families, were forced to work on farms without pay and lived in inhumane conditions.The auctions were carried out by the Swiss government, and it was not until the 1980s that the country acknowledged the harm caused by this practice. In 2013, the Swiss government apologized to the victims of Verdingkinder and agreed to pay compensation to those affected by the auctions. A memorial was also erected in Bern to commemorate the victims of the practice.
