Renewable energy resources such as wind and wave power have been discovered offshore in recent years. For example, the development of offshore wind farms has been a growing trend worldwide to harness the power of wind to generate clean energy. Additionally, there has been significant investment in research and development of wave energy technologies, which can generate electricity from the motion of ocean waves. These renewable resources have the potential to provide a significant source of energy for many regions, reducing their dependence on fossil fuels and contributing to the fight against climate change.
