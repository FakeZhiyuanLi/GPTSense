The Faraday constant is determined experimentally by measuring the amount of charge transferred during the electrolysis of a given substance. The constant is defined as the amount of charge that is required to deposit or liberate one mole of any element, ion, or radical during an electrochemical reaction. The Faraday constant is then calculated as the product of the Avogadro's number and the charge of a single electron (1.602 x 10^-19 Coulombs). Its value is considered to be approximately 96,485 Coulombs per mole.
