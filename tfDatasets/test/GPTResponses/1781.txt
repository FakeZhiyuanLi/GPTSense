It is not clear which specific millet (religious community) was subject to Justinian's code. The Code of Justinian, also known as Corpus Juris Civilis, was a codification of Roman law that aimed to clarify and systematize existing laws. It applied to all subjects of the Eastern Roman Empire, regardless of their religion or ethnicity. However, some scholars have noted that the code did have implications for religious minorities, such as Jews and Christians, who were granted certain rights and protections under the law.
