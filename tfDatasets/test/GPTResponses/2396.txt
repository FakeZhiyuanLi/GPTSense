In the event of an electoral tie, in which both candidates receive the same number of electoral votes, the decision would go to the House of Representatives. The House would hold a special vote in which each state delegation would cast one vote. The candidate who receives the majority of votes from the state delegations would be declared the winner. This process is outlined in the 12th Amendment to the United States Constitution.
