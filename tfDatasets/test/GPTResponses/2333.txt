Statistical mechanics is asymmetric in regards to time-reversal, meaning the forward and backward processes are not identical. This is because the laws of thermodynamics, upon which statistical mechanics is based, are not time-reversal invariant. For example, the Second Law of Thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system always increases over time, which means that the system becomes more disordered or chaotic with time. This process is irreversible, which means that the time-reversed version of the system (with entropy decreasing instead of increasing) is not physically possible. Therefore, statistical mechanics is a fundamentally irreversible theory.
