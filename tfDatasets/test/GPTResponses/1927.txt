The group most likely to be the heirs to the shamanic religions of Asia are the indigenous peoples of Siberia, Central Asia, and the Arctic regions. These groups have a long history of shamanism, and many of their traditional practices and beliefs are still alive today. Additionally, some indigenous groups in the Americas, such as the Inuit and Navajo, also have shamanic traditions that share similarities with those of Asian shamanism.
