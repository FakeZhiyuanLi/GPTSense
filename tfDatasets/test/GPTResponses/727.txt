The epistle that describes the cross is the Epistle to the Galatians, where the apostle Paul explains the significance of Christ's death and resurrection on the cross for the salvation of humanity. In Galatians 6:14, he writes, "But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world."
