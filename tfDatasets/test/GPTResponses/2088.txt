Post-punk era artists were more interested in challenging their audiences with experimental sounds, unconventional instrumentation, and abstract lyrics, rather than entertaining them with catchy pop songs. They aimed to provoke and engage their listeners by exploring themes such as political activism, societal critique, and personal struggles. The focus was on creating a visceral and immersive experience for the audience, rather than simply providing them with enjoyable music. Many post-punk artists also rejected the traditional rock star image of the past and instead presented themselves in a more confrontational and confrontational manner.
