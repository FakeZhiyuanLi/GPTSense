One potential recipient of funds from enterprises like the bookstore and dining centers at KU could be the University of Kansas itself. The funds generated from these enterprises could be used to support various programs and initiatives at the university, such as scholarships, research, and campus improvements. Additionally, student groups and organizations may also receive funding through the bookstore and dining centers, either through direct contributions or sales of merchandise and food items.
