Legalism was created by the Chinese philosopher Han Feizi, who lived during the Warring States period in China (475-221 BC). The supervision of the orders of the gods and the demand for moderation and harmony were advocated by Confucianism, which was also developed during the same period by the philosopher Confucius. However, Legalism and Confucianism were two separate and distinct philosophies with different beliefs and principles.
