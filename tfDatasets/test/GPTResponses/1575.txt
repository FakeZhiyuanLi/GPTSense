Operation Serval was a French military intervention launched in January 2013 with the main goal of stopping the advance of Islamic extremist groups in Mali and protecting the Mali government. Additionally, it aimed to prevent terrorist groups from using Mali as a safe haven, restore stability in the region, and support the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA).
