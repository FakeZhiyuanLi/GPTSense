A RTD (Resistance Temperature Detector) is used to measure the temperature of the thermal conductivity gauge sensor. The thermal conductivity gauge measures the thermal conductivity of the gas around the sensor, and the temperature of the sensor affects the accuracy of this measurement. Therefore, the RTD is necessary to ensure that the temperature of the sensor is constantly monitored and maintained at a consistent level, allowing for accurate readings of the thermal conductivity of the gas.
