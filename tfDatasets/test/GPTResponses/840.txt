The principle of limitations on the power of kings as detailed in Deuteronomy influenced later opposition by providing a basis for questioning and challenging the absolute authority of monarchs. The restrictions on the power of kings outlined in Deuteronomy included the need for rulers to follow God's laws and principles, not to accumulate wealth, not to take advantage of their position to mistreat their subjects, and to serve the needs and interests of the people. These principles became a reference point for those who were opposed to the rule of monarchs who had become corrupt or who were using their power for personal gain, leading to movements that challenged and ultimately toppled many such rulers throughout history.
