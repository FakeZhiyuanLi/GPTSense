The ancient harbor of Athens was called Piraeus, which was located about 10 kilometers southwest of the city center. It was a major port for Athens and played a significant role in its economic and military success. In the 5th century BC, Athens fortified the harbor with a long wall, which made it an entirely separate town connected to Athens by two small gates. Today, Piraeus still serves as a major port for Greece and is a hub for ferry travel to the Greek islands.
