The later conflict that some considered the first world war was the Napoleonic Wars (1799-1815). These were a series of wars fought by various European nations against the French Empire under Napoleon Bonaparte. The Napoleonic Wars involved many of the major powers of Europe and spanned multiple continents, resulting in widespread devastation and loss of life. Some historians have argued that the Napoleonic Wars were the first truly global conflict and a precursor to the more famous World War I.
