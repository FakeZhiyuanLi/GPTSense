During the reign of Gaddafi, Freedom House rated Libya as "Not Free," with consistently low scores on political rights and civil liberties. The country was ranked among the least free nations in the world, with no independent media, limited freedom of speech or assembly, and widespread human rights abuses. Political opposition was brutally suppressed, with thousands of dissidents imprisoned or executed. As a result, political participation and access to justice were severely restricted.
