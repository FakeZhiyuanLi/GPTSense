Non-federal government activities that might impact critical habitat are often subject to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) because the Act requires federal agencies to ensure that their activities are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of endangered or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat. Therefore, federal agencies are required to consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Marine Fisheries Service to determine whether their activities may impact such species or habitats.In addition, some state and local governments also have laws and regulations that require consideration of endangered species and critical habitat in their decision-making processes. These laws might require the conduct of studies or the implementation of conservation measures to protect endangered species and critical habitat. For example, a state may require a developer to obtain a permit that requires mitigation measures to protect habitat for an endangered species.Overall, non-federal government activities that might impact critical habitat are subject to the ESA through federal agency consultation and potentially through state and local regulations, in order to ensure the protection of endangered species and critical habitat.
