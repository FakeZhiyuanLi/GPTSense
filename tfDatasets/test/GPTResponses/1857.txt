The writers of the Tanzimat period hoped to accomplish several things with their publications. First, they aimed to introduce new literary forms and styles that would be more accessible to the wider public. They sought to revolutionize Turkish literature and make it more reflective of the society from which it emerged. They also wanted to create a national identity and champion Turkish cultural heritage, which had often been suppressed under previous Ottoman rule. In addition, they aimed to promote the ideas of social equality, progress, and modernity, and to critique the injustices and inequalities inherent in Ottoman society, such as the position of women and minorities. Ultimately, the writers of the Tanzimat period hoped to contribute to the broader project of transforming Ottoman society, politics, and culture in response to the challenges posed by European imperialism and modernization.
