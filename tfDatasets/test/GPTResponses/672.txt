The values in between certain energy levels considered by the Planck constant are quantized, meaning that they can only take on specific, discrete values. This follows from Planck's equation, E = hf, where E is energy, h is Planck's constant, and f is frequency. Since energy is quantized, the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation absorbed or emitted by an atom must also be quantized. This leads to the existence of discrete energy levels in atoms.
