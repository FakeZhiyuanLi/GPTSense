The deployment of three generations of renewable energy technologies dating back more than 100 years involves:1. First-generation technologies: These are the earliest forms of renewable energy technologies that were developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These include hydroelectric power, wind power, and biomass energy.2. Second-generation technologies: These refer to the more advanced renewable energy technologies that were developed in the mid-20th century. These include solar energy, geothermal energy, and ocean energy.3. Third-generation technologies: These are the most recent and advanced forms of renewable energy technologies that are still in research and development stages. These include biofuels, advanced solar technologies, and energy storage technologies.The deployment of these three generations of renewable energy technologies over the past 100 years has led to significant advancements in the renewable energy sector, making it a more viable alternative to traditional fossil fuel-based energy sources. This has resulted in reduced carbon emissions, increased energy security, and improved economic opportunities in various regions around the world.
