The claim made by the Black Book of Communism is that the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact promoted a joint effort by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union to dominate and exploit Eastern Europe. The pact supposedly allowed the Soviet Union to expand its influence and control over the Baltic states and parts of Poland, and enabled Nazi Germany to invade and occupy Western Europe without fear of Soviet interference. The book argues that this pact paved the way for the brutal occupation, persecution, and mass murder of millions of people during World War II.
