Besides the Caribbean, other regions with low rates of child labor include Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan, New Zealand, and the United States. These countries have strong laws and regulations protecting the rights of children and providing access to education and other basic needs. Additionally, many of these countries have high levels of economic development and social welfare, which helps to prevent children from having to work in order to support themselves or their families.
