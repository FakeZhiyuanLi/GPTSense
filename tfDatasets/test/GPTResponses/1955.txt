After the capture of its northern territory by Turkish troops in 1974, the ports in northern Cyprus came under the control of the Turkish Cypriot administration. The international community, including the United Nations, does not recognize the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus as a sovereign state, so the ports in the north are not considered legal. As a result, the internationally recognized government of Cyprus, which controls the southern part of the island, is the only legitimate authority that can manage the legitimate ports in the country, including the commercial ports in Limassol, Larnaca, and Vasiliko.
