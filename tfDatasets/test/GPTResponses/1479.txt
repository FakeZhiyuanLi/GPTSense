There are several natural features that can protect an island from storms such as:1. Barrier reefs - these reefs act as a buffer between the island and the open sea, reducing the impact of waves and storm surges.2. Coral formations - coral reefs absorb wave energy, providing a natural protection barrier.3. Mangroves - the roots of mangroves act as a natural barrier, trapping sediment and reducing wave energy.4. Topography - islands with steep cliffs or hills can provide a natural shelter, diverting winds and reducing their intensity.5. Coastal vegetation - trees and shrubs planted along the coast can help to stabilize the soil, reducing erosion and protecting the island from storm surges.
