During the Battle of Umm Qasr, which took place in March 2003 during the Iraq War, a coalition of forces comprising multiple nationalities worked together to capture the port city of Umm Qasr from occupying Iraqi forces. The coalition consisted primarily of American, British, and Australian forces, but also included smaller contingents from Denmark, Poland, and other countries.
