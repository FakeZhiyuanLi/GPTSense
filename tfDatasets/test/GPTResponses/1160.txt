There are several plants that have been worshipped for their ability to maintain their color through the winter season. One example is the holly plant, which is known for its bright red berries and deep green leaves that don't change color or fall off in winter. Another example is the evergreen tree, which is celebrated for its ability to stay green even during the harshest winter weather. In many cultures, both of these plants have been associated with the winter solstice and other winter holidays as symbols of vitality and resilience.
