Leeches have been used for blood-letting for thousands of years, dating back to ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome. However, their popularity as a medical tool peaked in the 19th century, during which time they were used extensively in Europe and America. Nowadays, leeches are still used for specific medical purposes, such as reducing blood clotting after surgery or restoring circulation to affected areas after tissue grafts.
