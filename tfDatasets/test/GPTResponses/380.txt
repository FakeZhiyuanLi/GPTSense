Marxists view leisure activities and goods as a product of capitalist society that aim to distract the working class from their exploitation and keep them content with their economic status quo. These leisure activities and goods include entertainment, sports, cultural events, and consumer goods such as luxury cars, designer clothing, and high-end technology gadgets.According to Marxists, the capitalist class creates and promotes these leisure activities and goods, which are often expensive and exclusive, to create a false illusion of wealth, status, and happiness. These activities and goods are not accessible to the working class, who cannot afford them and are forced to work long hours to make ends meet.Marxists argue that true leisure should involve activities that are meaningful and fulfilling, such as creative pursuits, community building, and personal development. However, under capitalism, leisure is commodified and treated as a consumer good, further exacerbating the class divide and perpetuating the system of exploitation.
