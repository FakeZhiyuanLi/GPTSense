Mandolins play an important role in traditional Brazilian music from the northeastern region, especially in the state of Pernambuco. The music style is known as "Choro," and it features a mix of European and African influences. Mandolinists such as Jacob do Bandolim and Luperce Miranda were influential in developing the genre in the 20th century.
