The biggest influence from the West on Ottoman literature was the introduction of printing and the widespread availability of printed materials. This allowed for greater dissemination of literary works and helped to standardize the Ottoman Turkish language, making it more accessible to a wider audience. Additionally, the Western literary genres of the novel and the short story had a significant impact on Ottoman literature, leading to the emergence of new literary styles and themes. Western literary movements such as romanticism and realism also had a significant impact on Ottoman literature, influencing the content and style of Ottoman literary works.
