The persecution of Jews in Spain occurred after the conclusion of the Reconquista, which was the 15th-century campaign by Christian kingdoms to recapture and unify the Iberian Peninsula under their rule. The Catholic monarchs, Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand, completed the Reconquista with the fall of Granada in 1492, and shortly after issued the Alhambra Decree, which forced all Jews to convert to Christianity or leave the country.
