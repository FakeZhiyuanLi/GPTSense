It is not possible to give an exact value for the density of primes that are congruent to a particular residue class modulo 9, because the distribution of primes is not fully understood. However, based on empirical evidence and heuristic arguments, it is believed that the density of primes congruent to 1 or 8 modulo 9 is roughly 22.5%, while the density of primes congruent to 2, 4, 5, 7 modulo 9 is roughly 77.5%. This means that for every 100 primes, we would expect approximately 23 to be congruent to 1 or 8 modulo 9, and approximately 77 to be congruent to 2, 4, 5, or 7 modulo 9.
