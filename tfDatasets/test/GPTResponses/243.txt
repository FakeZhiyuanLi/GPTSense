The physics of quantum mechanics includes special cases for various phenomena, including:1. Wave-particle duality: Quantum mechanics predicts that particles can behave both as waves and as particles. This is observed in phenomena such as diffraction and interference.2. Entanglement: When two particles are entangled, their states become correlated in such a way that measuring the state of one particle will instantly determine the state of the other, no matter how far apart they are.3. Superposition: Quantum mechanics predicts that particles can be in multiple states at once, known as a superposition. This is observed in phenomena such as the double-slit experiment.4. Tunneling: Quantum mechanics predicts that particles can penetrate through potential barriers that classical physics would consider impenetrable. This is observed in phenomena such as electron tunneling in semiconductors.5. Quantization: Quantum mechanics predicts that certain properties such as energy and angular momentum can only take on discrete values, not continuous ones.These and many other special cases are fundamental to our understanding of the behavior of atoms, molecules, and other quantum systems.
