Traditionally, furniture is carved using a variety of hand tools such as chisels, gouges, mallets, and knives. The carver marks out the design onto the wood surface and then slowly removes layers of wood to create the desired shape and texture. This could be done by making fine, shallow cuts or by roughing out larger chunks of wood with a mallet and chisel. The carving process may take several days or weeks to complete, depending on the complexity of the design and size of the piece. Once the carving is complete, the furniture is sanded and finished with stain, varnish or wax to protect the wood and highlight its natural beauty.
