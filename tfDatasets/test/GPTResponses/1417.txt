Pantheism is the belief that everything in existence is a manifestation of a divine being and that this being is synonymous with the universe itself. In other words, God, or whatever higher power one believes in, is not a separate entity, but rather exists in all things and is present in the natural world. Pantheists often view nature as sacred and believe that it should be respected and protected. The concept of pantheism has roots in both Eastern and Western philosophy and has been embraced by a number of religious and non-religious traditions.
