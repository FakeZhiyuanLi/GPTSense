It is estimated that around 80% of plant species worldwide rely on insect pollination for reproduction. Therefore, the absence of insects and their pollination role would have a devastating impact on a significant portion of the biosphere. This would include not only the loss of plant species but also the disruption of food webs and ecosystems that rely on these plants. Additionally, the loss of pollinators would also have a significant impact on agriculture, affecting the production of many crops that depend on insect pollinators such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds. Overall, the ecosystem services provided by insects and their pollination role are critical to the functioning and sustainability of the biosphere.
