Other parts of an insect's respiratory system include:1. Tracheae - a system of tubes that carry air to different parts of the body.2. Spiracles - small openings on the body surface that allow air to enter and exit the tracheae.3. Tracheoles - tiny branches of the tracheae that deliver oxygen directly to the cells.4. Air sacs - large, thin-walled chambers that help insects regulate their respiratory movements and store oxygen.Together, these parts make up what is known as the insect respiratory system.
