The goal of informal consultation is usually to gather feedback, suggestions, and advice from others in a less formal setting. It can be used to help refine ideas, improve processes, or make decisions. The aim is to promote open communication and collaboration among team members, colleagues or stakeholders to achieve a common goal. It can also be a way to build stronger relationships, trust and respect among parties involved in a project or initiative.
