The structure of the early Christian church was initially simple and decentralized, with individual communities and home churches led by local leaders and elders. However, as the church expanded and became more organized, a hierarchy of leadership emerged, with bishops, priests, and deacons appointed to oversee certain regions and congregations. The most influential of these bishops became known as patriarchs or popes, and they gradually came to have more authority over the church as a whole. Church councils and synods were also held to discuss matters of doctrine and establish rules and rituals for worship.
