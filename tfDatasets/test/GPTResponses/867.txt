Coelomata is a category of animals that possess a coelom, which is a fluid-filled body cavity lined with mesoderm. This group includes various phyla such as annelids, arthropods, mollusks, echinoderms, and vertebrates. The coelom provides several benefits to these organisms, including increased mobility, better organ organization, and space for complex circulatory and respiratory systems.
