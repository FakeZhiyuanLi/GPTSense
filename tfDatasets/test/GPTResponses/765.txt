Shivaji Bhosle, also known as Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, is credited with making the Marathas a strong power. He founded the Maratha Empire in the 17th century through his military campaigns and administrative skills. Shivaji encouraged religious tolerance and unity among his subjects, earning him the nickname "Hindu Padpadshahi" (emperor of Hinduism). He also introduced various military strategies and guerrilla warfare tactics to defeat much stronger Mughal forces, which helped him expand his empire. Shivaji's legacy was continued by his sons Sambhaji and Rajaram, as well as other Maratha leaders such as Peshwa Baji Rao I, who further strengthened the Maratha Empire through military campaigns and diplomacy.
