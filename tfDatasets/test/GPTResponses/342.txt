The temperature of a glacier can be measured from various locations, including:1. The surface: A thermometer can be inserted into the top layer of the glacier to measure the temperature at that point.2. The interior: Scientists may drill holes into the glacier and insert sensors to measure the temperature at different depths.3. The air: Air temperature can be measured near the glacier using instruments such as thermometers or weather stations.4. Satellite measurements: Remote sensing techniques can be used to measure the temperature changes of glaciers over time using satellite imagery.Overall, the temperature of a glacier can be measured from different locations depending on the research goals and methods used.
