The increasing demand for container traffic makes companies use intermodal transportation more often, which involves the use of multiple modes of transportation (e.g. ships, trains, trucks) to move goods in a single container from the point of origin to the destination. This method allows for more efficient and cost-effective transportation of large quantities of goods over long distances. Additionally, companies may rely more heavily on technology such as GPS tracking and automated systems to manage the movement of containers and ensure timely delivery.
