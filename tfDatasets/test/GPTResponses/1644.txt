Musharraf did not arrest Maulana Masood Azhar. In fact, Azhar was released by the Pakistani government in 1999 in exchange for hostages of an Indian Airlines flight hijacking that was orchestrated by Azhar's group, Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM). Musharraf was the President of Pakistan from 2001 to 2008, but there is no record of him ordering the arrest of Azhar.
