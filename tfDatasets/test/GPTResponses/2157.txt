he calls "correlatives," or objects that are in some way related to each other. According to Leibniz, space does not exist on its own, independent of these correlatives.In other words, space is not something that exists by itself, but is rather a framework or context within which objects and events can be described and related to each other. This view challenges the traditional notion of space as an absolute or independent entity that exists apart from the things it contains.Leibniz's theory of space is closely related to his broader philosophical ideas about monads and the nature of reality. He believed that the universe is made up of countless individual, self-contained entities or monads, each of which has a unique perspective on the world. From this perspective, space is simply the way that monads relate to each other and interact within the larger whole of the universe.
