related groups of insects. Both groups of insects undergo metamorphosis, but they differ in the way they develop wings. Paraneopterans have wings that develop externally and do not change much during metamorphosis, while endopterygotes have wings that develop internally and undergo dramatic changes during metamorphosis. Additionally, endopterygotes have more complex life cycles and more specialized mouthparts than paraneopterans.
