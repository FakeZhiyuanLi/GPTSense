Most in the 17th century believed that the universe was infinite, homogeneous, and devoid of any empty spaces or voids. This belief was based on Aristotelian cosmology and the prevailing geocentric model of the universe. However, with the advent of the telescope and the observations of Galileo, Tycho Brahe, and Johannes Kepler, this view was gradually challenged and replaced by the modern heliocentric model of the solar system, which acknowledged the existence of vast emptiness or voids between celestial bodies.
