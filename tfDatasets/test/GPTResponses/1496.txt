One difficulty when using surface mount components is that they are much smaller and harder to manipulate than through-hole components. This can present challenges in soldering and assembly, especially for those who are less experienced with surface mount technology. Additionally, surface mount components tend to be more delicate and may be damaged more easily than through-hole components, requiring careful handling and installation.
