The Afghan War or the Soviet-Afghan War that took place from 1979 to 1989 is considered to have given birth to al-Qaeda. During this war, the United States, Pakistan, and other countries supported the Afghan mujahideen fighters in their fight against the Soviet Union. Osama bin Laden, who later became the leader of al-Qaeda, also fought alongside the mujahideen during the war. The experience and knowledge he gained during this time played a significant role in shaping his ideology and vision for a jihadist movement.
