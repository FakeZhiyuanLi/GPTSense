Most polychaetes lack separate sexes and have internal fertilization, but they do not have specialized reproductive organs. Instead, the anterior segments of their bodies may become modified into gonads that produce and release both eggs and sperm. They release their gametes into the water, where external fertilization occurs. Some species, however, engage in asexual reproduction through fragmentation or budding.
