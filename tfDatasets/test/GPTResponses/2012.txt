Puerto Rico remained a Spanish speaking territory primarily due to the Spanish colonial administration which governed the island from 1493 to 1898. Spanish was the official language of the government and the educational system, and local populations were strongly encouraged to learn and speak Spanish. Even after Puerto Rico became a US territory in 1898, Spanish remained the primary language of communication and culture, reinforced by Puerto Rican nationalist and identity movements that emphasized the island's historical and cultural ties to Spain. Today, Spanish is still the dominant language in Puerto Rico, though English is also widely spoken as a second language.
