There are three main ways a species can be added to the endangered list:1. Endangered Species Act Listing: Under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in the United States, a species can be listed as threatened or endangered based on scientific evidence that it is at risk of extinction.2. International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List: The IUCN Red List is a global database of threatened and endangered species. A species can be added to the Red List if it meets certain criteria based on population size, distribution, and other factors.3. Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES): CITES is an international agreement that regulates the trade of endangered species. A species can be added to CITES if it is determined to be threatened by trade.
