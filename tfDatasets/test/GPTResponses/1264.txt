When the ratios of plate length and width to separation distance are large, the parasitic capacitance is small. This is because when the plates are further apart, there is less overlap between them, reducing the capacitance. Additionally, when the plates are longer and wider, the electric field lines from one plate do not reach the other plate as effectively, further reducing the capacitance. Therefore, in such cases, the parasitic capacitance is minimized.
