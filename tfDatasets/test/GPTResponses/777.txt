According to the rule of law, the determination for rules in a land should be held by a constitution, laws passed by a legitimate legislature, and established legal precedent or court rulings. These rules should be clear, consistent, and applied equally to all members of society regardless of their status or position. Additionally, decisions and actions of government officials should be subject to judicial review and accountability to ensure that they conform to the law.
