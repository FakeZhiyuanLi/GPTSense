In extreme vacuum exposure, substances with low boiling points can boil away. This includes liquids such as ethanol, acetone, and water, as well as gases such as helium and nitrogen. Basically, any substance that can vaporize at low temperatures and pressures is at risk of boiling away in extreme vacuum exposure.
