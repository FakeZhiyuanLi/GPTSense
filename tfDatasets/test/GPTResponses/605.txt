One of the prominent scholars who expanded on Avicenna's work in temporal logic was the Persian philosopher and theologian Mir Damad (d. 1631). He developed Avicenna's ideas on the nature of time and causality and introduced his own theory of the "temporal modalities" to explain the relationship between events and time. Other notable scholars who contributed to the development of temporal logic include Al-Farabi, al-Kindi, and Mulla Sadra.
