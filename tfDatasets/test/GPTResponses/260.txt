Glaciers can form both on land and in the sea. Glaciers that form on land are called continental glaciers or ice sheets. They are massive sheets of ice and snow that cover entire land masses, such as Antarctica and Greenland. Glaciers that form in the sea are called tidewater glaciers, which start on land and flow into the sea. They are found in coastal areas, such as Alaska and Norway.
