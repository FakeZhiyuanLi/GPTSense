A USB host can implement multiple host controllers, each responsible for managing multiple USB ports. The number of host controllers that can be implemented depends on the hardware capabilities of the host device and the design of the USB system. Some devices, such as desktop computers, can support multiple host controllers, while others, such as smartphones and tablets, may only have a single host controller.
