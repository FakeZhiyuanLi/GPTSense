The source of oracle bones was traced to the Shang dynasty in ancient China (c. 16th to 11th century BCE). These bones were discovered during archaeological excavations of the Shang capital in modern-day Anyang, Henan province, China. The oracle bones were used for divination by the Shang rulers and inscribed with questions about various aspects of life, such as harvest predictions, battles, and illnesses, and the answers were interpreted through cracks that formed after heating the bones over a fire.
