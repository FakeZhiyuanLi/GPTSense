After WWII, Hungary adopted a communist system of government with close ties to the Soviet Union. The system was characterized by a one-party state, central planning of the economy, state ownership of industry, and strict control over civil liberties and political freedom. This system lasted until the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989 and the subsequent transition to a multi-party democracy and market economy.
