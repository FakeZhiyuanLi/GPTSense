The major movement that occurred in Guam in the 80s and 90s was the push for political self-determination and decolonization from the United States. This movement was led by indigenous Chamorro activists who sought to assert their rights to sovereignty and control over their homeland. The movement culminated in the passage of the Guam Commonwealth Act in 1987, which established a formal political relationship between the United States and Guam as a self-governing territory. However, the issue of political status and decolonization remains contentious on the island today.
