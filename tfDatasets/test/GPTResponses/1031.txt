Chlorophyll first arose in the early photosynthetic bacteria that appeared on Earth more than 3 billion years ago. These bacteria used pigments such as chlorophyll and bacteriochlorophyll to convert sunlight into energy. Over time, more complex organisms evolved from these primitive bacteria, including green algae and land plants, which also use chlorophyll for photosynthesis.
