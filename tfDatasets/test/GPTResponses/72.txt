During Walpole's tenure as prime minister, the concept of cabinet government took shape. He created a system in which he appointed ministers who were loyal to him and worked together as a team. This allowed for greater control and coordination of government policies and actions. Cabinet government became a key feature of the British political system and has been used ever since.
