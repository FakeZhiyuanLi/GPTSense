Egyptian artists used a variety of materials to create their paints, including minerals, plants, and animal sources. They would grind these materials into a fine powder and then mix them with a binding agent, such as gum arabic or egg whites, to create a paintable paste. Some common materials used for coloring included oxides of iron and copper for reds and greens, charcoal and soot for blacks, and malachite and azurite for blues and greens.
