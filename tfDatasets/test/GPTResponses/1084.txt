Most laws in Thailand are decided according to the principles of constitutional monarchy, parliamentary democracy, the rule of law, and the protection of individual rights and freedoms. The Constitution of Thailand, which serves as the foundation of the country's legal system, upholds these principles and outlines the powers and functions of government institutions such as the monarchy, the legislature, the judiciary, and the executive branch. Additionally, Thai laws are often influenced by cultural and traditional values, as well as international agreements and conventions that the country has ratified.
