The issue of through traffic benefits can occur in various places such as urban areas, suburban areas, remote rural areas, and highways. It can particularly arise in areas with heavy traffic congestion where there is a debate about whether through traffic brings economic benefits to an area or causes more harm than good. In some towns and cities, there may be existing traffic management schemes and proposals to restrict or divert through traffic to improve local conditions.
