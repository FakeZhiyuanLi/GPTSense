When a LaserDisc is affected by dust or scratches, it can cause various video problems. Some of the common issues are:1) Dropouts - when dust or scratches make it difficult for the laser pickup to read the data, portions of the video or audio can be lost, creating black or silent gaps in the playback.2) Artifacts - dust or scratches can cause distortions to the image or colors, creating unwanted visual artifacts on the screen.3) Skipping - if a scratch is deep or long enough, the laser can lose track of where it is on the disc, causing the playback to skip to another section, or possibly freeze altogether.4) Image stability - dust or scratches can cause the image to flicker or warp, making it difficult to watch the video.Therefore, it is essential to handle LaserDiscs with care and keep them clean to prevent such issues.
