The Rhine is believed to have captured several streams during the Pliocene period, which occurred between approximately 5.3 million to 2.6 million years ago. This process of stream capture is known as stream piracy and is caused by changes in the topography of the land due to tectonic activity or erosion. The Rhine captured several streams in its upper course, which contributed to its development into a major river system in Europe.
