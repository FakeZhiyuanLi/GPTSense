The purpose of creating a Wikiproject is to coordinate efforts among a group of editors to improve a specific area of Wikipedia, such as a particular topic, type of article, or aspect of Wikipedia's organization. By working together and sharing resources, knowledge, and skills, Wikiproject members can create higher-quality articles, resolve disputes more quickly, and ensure that the information on Wikipedia is accurate and up-to-date. Additionally, by participating in a Wikiproject, editors can build relationships with other editors who share similar interests and gain recognition for their contributions.
