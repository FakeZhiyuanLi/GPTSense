Classical statistical mechanics requires three things to exist:1. A large number of identical particles: This is necessary to have enough particles to meaningfully apply statistical ideas.2. A macroscopic system: This means a collection of particles large enough to be observed and analyzed statistically.3. Equilibrium: The system must be in a state of equilibrium in order for statistical mechanics to be applied. This means that the macroscopic properties of the system (e.g. temperature, pressure, energy) are constant over time.
