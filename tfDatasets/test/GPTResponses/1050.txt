The Planck constant was first calculated by German physicist Max Planck in 1900. His groundbreaking work on blackbody radiation led him to propose that light energy was actually composed of tiny packets or quanta. To explain the way in which energy was transferred between these quanta, he introduced a constant to describe the relationship between energy and frequency. This constant became known as the Planck constant and was first calculated by Planck as 6.626 Ã— 10-34 Joule-seconds. The value of the constant was later refined through additional experiments and measurements, contributing significantly to the development of modern physics.
