does this mean for the body?The abdomen is less strong than the thorax because it has fewer layers of muscle and bone protection. This means that it is easier for the organs in the abdomen to be affected by external forces, such as injury or disease. Additionally, because of the relatively weaker abdominal muscles, the body relies more on the muscles in the thorax for many activities, such as breathing and movement. This can lead to imbalanced muscle development over time, which can cause postural imbalances and other issues.
