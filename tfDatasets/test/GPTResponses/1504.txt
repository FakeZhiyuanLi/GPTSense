This is a theory known as the social or evolutionary theory of religion, and it has been proposed by several scholars throughout history, including Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach, Herbert Spencer, and Ã‰mile Durkheim. However, the most famous proponent of this theory is probably Sigmund Freud, who argued that religion and belief in God are products of human psychological needs and desires, such as the need for security, comfort, and protection from the uncertainties and anxieties of life. According to Freud, the human mind creates gods and religions as a means of coping with the fundamental problem of existence: the knowledge of our own mortality and the fear of death. By creating gods and religious rituals, humans can project their hopes, fears, and desires onto external objects and thereby gain a sense of meaning, purpose, and transcendence in life.
