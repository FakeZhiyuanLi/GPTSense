The famous decorated havelis in Rajasthan were built by wealthy merchant families in the 18th and 19th centuries. Some of the most well-known havelis were built by the Shekhawati and Marwari communities in cities such as Jaisalmer, Jodhpur, Udaipur, and Bikaner. The havelis were decorated with intricate frescoes and carvings, depicting scenes from Hindu mythology, animals, and everyday life.
