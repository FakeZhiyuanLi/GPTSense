Noma is a severe bacterial infection that affects the oral cavity, causing painful, extensive tissue damage and eventually leading to facial disfigurement if left untreated. The infection is common in parts of Africa, South America, and Asia, where poverty and malnutrition are prevalent. It typically affects young children who have weakened immune systems due to malnutrition, poor hygiene, or other health conditions. Noma is a life-threatening condition that can cause severe pain, difficulty in eating, and even death if left untreated.
