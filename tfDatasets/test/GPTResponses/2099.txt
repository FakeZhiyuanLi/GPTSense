The Greeks named Palermo "Panormos" because the city's natural harbor appeared to them as a "all-surrounding harbor" or "all-encompassing harbor." The term "Panormos" in Greek combines the words "pan" (all) and "ormos" (harbor), implying that the harbor was very well protected and spacious enough to accommodate several ships.
