One profession that might suffer due to daylight saving time (DST) is agriculture. Farms and farmers rely heavily on sunlight to complete a full day's work, and if the sun sets an hour earlier after DST ends, it means they have less daylight to utilize in their work. This could affect the productivity of farms and the overall agricultural yield of the season.
