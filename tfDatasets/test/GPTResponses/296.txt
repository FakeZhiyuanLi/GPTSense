One method to protect the rights of the component states is through a federal system of government, where power is divided between a central government and individual state governments. This division of power allows states to govern themselves to a certain extent, while also being part of a larger whole. Additionally, the Constitution outlines the rights of both the federal government and individual states, including the Tenth Amendment which states that any powers not delegated to the federal government are reserved for the states. This helps to ensure that states have a degree of autonomy and can protect their own interests and rights.
