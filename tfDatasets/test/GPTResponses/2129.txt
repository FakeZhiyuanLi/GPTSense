Curvature in a vacuum can be produced by the presence of massive objects or energy. According to Einstein's theory of General Relativity, gravity is the manifestation of the curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of massive objects. In the absence of any massive objects, spacetime will still curve due to the energy and momentum of particles and fields. This means that even in a vacuum, there can be curvature due to the presence of energy, such as in the case of gravitational waves or the vacuum energy of the universe.
