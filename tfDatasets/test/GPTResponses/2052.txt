The Liburna was an ancient Roman ship that was used for both military and civilian purposes. It was a fast and agile vessel, used mainly for patrolling and raiding along the Mediterranean coast. The Liburna was easy to maneuver and had a shallow draft, which made it ideal for navigating shallow waters and evading larger enemy ships.
