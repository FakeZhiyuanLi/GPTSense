One Christian philosopher who ruminated on time is Saint Augustine of Hippo. In his book Confessions, Augustine reflects on the nature of time as a concept and its relationship to God's eternal nature. He explores the idea that the past, present, and future all have meaning only because of God's involvement in time. Augustine's thoughts on time have had a lasting impact on Christian theology and philosophy.
