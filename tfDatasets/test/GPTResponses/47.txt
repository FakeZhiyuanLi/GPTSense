The current sea level is rising due to a phenomenon known as global warming. Global warming is caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and other activities that release large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere and cause the Earth's temperature to rise, which in turn causes glaciers and ice sheets to melt, leading to an increase in the volume of water in the oceans. Additionally, the expansion of water as it warms also contributes to sea level rise. This rise in sea level has significant consequences for coastal communities, including increased flooding, erosion, and damage to infrastructure.
