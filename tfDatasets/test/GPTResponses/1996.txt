No, America did not try to make Puerto Rico an English-speaking territory. After Puerto Rico became a territory of the United States in 1898, Spanish remained the predominant language, and efforts were made to preserve and promote the island's cultural and linguistic heritage. In fact, Puerto Rican Spanish has been recognized as an official language of the territory alongside English since 1991.
