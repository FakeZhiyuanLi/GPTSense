Planck's law involved the introduction of the concept of quantization, which allowed for the calculation of the energy levels of photons emitted by a blackbody. This required the use of Planck's constant (h) and the concept of discrete energy levels. This mathematical step correctly predicted the observed blackbody emission spectrum and resolved the ultraviolet catastrophe problem.
