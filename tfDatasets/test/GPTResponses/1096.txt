Oligochaetes are believed to have evolved during the Paleozoic era, around 500 million years ago. They evolved from primitive annelid worms and diversified into various ecological niches, including freshwater and terrestrial habitats. Today, they are one of the most diverse and abundant groups of annelids, comprising more than 3,000 species worldwide.
