The main factors that cause child labor to still exist today are:1. Poverty: Families living in poverty often have no other option than to send their children to work to help make ends meet.2. Lack of access to education: Children who are not able to attend school are more likely to end up in the labor force, especially in developing countries.3. Cultural attitudes: In some cultures, it is considered acceptable for children to work, and in some cases, it is seen as a rite of passage.4. Demands from multinational corporations: Globalization has led to increased demand for cheap labor, which has led to more children being exploited in the workforce.5. Lack of enforcement and regulation: Even when laws exist to protect children from labor exploitation, there may be a lack of enforcement or inadequate regulation, allowing businesses to continue using child labor.
