The Endangered Species Act (ESA) mandates that the government take measures to conserve the critical habitats of endangered and threatened species. The Act defines "critical habitat" as the specific areas occupied by a particular species that are necessary for its survival and recovery.The Act requires federal agencies to consult with the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) or the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to ensure that any actions they undertake within an area designated as critical habitat will not adversely affect the species or its critical habitat. Federal agencies are required to modify their proposed actions if they are found to pose a threat to the species or its critical habitat.The ESA also provides for the designation of critical habitat for each endangered or threatened species listed under the Act. The USFWS and NMFS are responsible for identifying and acquiring lands needed to protect and restore such habitats.Overall, the ESA's provisions on critical habitat are intended to ensure that any development or other activities within a designated area will not lead to the extinction of an endangered or threatened species.
