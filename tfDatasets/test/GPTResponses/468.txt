Compact hydrogen bombs were useful for a variety of military and strategic purposes, including:1) Tactical nuclear warfare: Compact hydrogen bombs could be deployed in the battlefield to provide a high-yield explosion that could destroy enemy fortifications, vehicles, and troops.2) Nuclear deterrence: Compact hydrogen bombs could be used as a deterrent against potential adversaries, as they showcased the military prowess of a nation and could intimidate potential enemies into not attacking.3) Strategic nuclear warfare: Compact hydrogen bombs could be used as a part of a nation's strategic nuclear arsenal, which could be launched at enemy targets from long-range missiles.4) Space exploration: Compact hydrogen bombs could be used to provide propulsion for space exploration missions, as they could produce a massive amount of energy in a compact and efficient manner. However, this application was not pursued due to concerns about the potential risks and consequences of using nuclear energy in space.
