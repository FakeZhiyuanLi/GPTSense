The two groups into which "in a state of nature" was divided are:1. Hobbesian state of nature: This view, put forth by philosopher Thomas Hobbes, sees human beings as naturally self-interested, competitive, and violent in their pursuit of power and resources. In a state of nature, there would be a constant state of war among individuals, with no security or protection for anyone. According to Hobbes, only a strong central authority, such as a monarch or a government, could maintain order and protect people's rights.2. Rousseauian state of nature: This view, put forth by philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, sees human beings as naturally peaceful and cooperative, with a sense of compassion and empathy for others. In a state of nature, individuals would live in harmony with one another, sharing resources and working together for the common good. However, the development of private property, individualism, and social hierarchies would eventually lead to conflict and inequality. According to Rousseau, only a society based on a social contract, in which individuals surrender their personal interests for the greater good of the community, could achieve true freedom and equality.
