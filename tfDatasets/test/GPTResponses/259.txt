Laserdiscs were initially more costly to produce than their VHS counterparts. The process of replicating the discs involved more sophisticated technology, and the raw materials (such as the silver used for the disc surface) were more expensive. Additionally, the manufacturing process was slower and more labor-intensive than VHS, which added to the costs. However, laserdiscs typically had higher quality picture and sound than VHS, which made them more attractive to early adopters who were willing to pay the higher price.
