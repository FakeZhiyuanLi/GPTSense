Before he was arrested, Jesus had a last supper with his disciples, where he told them that one of them would betray him. He also washed his disciples' feet as an act of humility and servanthood. After the supper, they went to the Garden of Gethsemane where Jesus prayed fervently and sorrowfully, knowing what was about to happen to him. While he was praying, Judas arrived with a group of soldiers, and Jesus was ultimately arrested and taken away to be tried and ultimately crucified.
