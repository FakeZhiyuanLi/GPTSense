Each record group is classified based on its function, activities, or subject matter. Record groups can be broad or narrow in focus, depending on the organizational structure and activities of the entity creating and maintaining the records. For example, a record group for a government agency might be classified based on its administrative functions, such as personnel records or budgeting records. A record group for a nonprofit organization might be classified based on its programs, such as fundraising or volunteer management.
