The compression efficiency of encoders is defined by the level of compression achieved without any significant loss of information or quality in the output data. This is determined by several factors, including the complexity of the input data, the encoding algorithm used, the bitrate, and the coding parameters such as the quantization level and the motion estimation accuracy. In general, more efficient encoders are able to achieve higher compression levels while maintaining better quality output at lower bitrates, making them ideal for applications that require efficient storage, transmission or streaming of digital media content.
