Marxists believe that the means of production, which includes factories, machines, and other resources necessary for manufacturing or producing goods and services, must be controlled to essentially control a culture. This is because the ruling class in a capitalist society owns the means of production and uses it to exploit the working class, keeping them economically dependent and subservient. By controlling the means of production, the ruling class can also control the cultural institutions, such as media, education, and entertainment, that shape people's beliefs and values, thus maintaining their power and dominance over society.
