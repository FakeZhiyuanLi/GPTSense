The problem of the direction of time arises from several contradictory facts, including the irreversibility of certain natural processes (such as the increase in entropy), the time-invariance of many physical laws (such as the laws of motion), the apparent asymmetry of cause and effect, and the human perception of time as a unidirectional flow from past to future. It is difficult to quantify the exact number of contradictory facts, as the problem of the direction of time is complex and multifaceted.
