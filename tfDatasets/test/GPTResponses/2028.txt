Football matches became popular in the Ottoman Empire during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in urban areas like Istanbul. The game was introduced to Turkey by British expatriates and soon gained popularity among young men who were eager to participate in a fast-paced and exciting sport. Ottoman football clubs were established, and matches were played in local parks and other public spaces. The popularity of football continued to grow in the 20th century, with the establishment of national and professional leagues, and Turkey has become known as a country with a strong passion for the sport.
