There is no single answer to this question as many scholars, anthropologists, and sociologists have been influenced by the ideas and theories of Franz Boas, who is considered the founder of American cultural anthropology, and by extension, his student, Richard H. Thurnwald, who was heavily influenced by Boas and his ideas on culture. However, it's worth noting that there are comparatively few scholars who have specifically focused on the work of Adolf Bastian, who was one of Boas' key influences. Some notable anthropologists who have studied and written about Bastian's work include George Stocking, Jr., Eric Wolf, and James Clifford.
