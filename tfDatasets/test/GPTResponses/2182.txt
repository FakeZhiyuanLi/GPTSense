Mach argued that the water experiment would not work in an otherwise empty universe because the rotation of the bucket of water would be relative only to the stars, which have no physical significance or measurement. Without any other objects in the universe to provide a reference frame, it would be impossible to determine whether the water was truly rotating or if it was just the observer's frame of reference that was rotating. Therefore, he concluded that all motion can only be defined in relation to other matter and objects in the universe.
