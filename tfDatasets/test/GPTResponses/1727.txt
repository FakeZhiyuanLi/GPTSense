The literacy rate for the public in the empire at the end of the 19th century is believed to have been very low, estimated to be around 20 to 30 percent. This was mainly due to lack of access to education and poverty among the population. The Ottoman Empire was known for its strict social hierarchy, where education was primarily reserved for the elites and religious institutions. The government did make some efforts to improve literacy rates later on, but it was a slow process.
