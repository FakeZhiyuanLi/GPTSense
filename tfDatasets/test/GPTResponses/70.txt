1. High levels of poverty: The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has one of the lowest per capita incomes in the world, and many of its citizens live in poverty. The economy is heavily dependent on natural resources, particularly mining, and this sector has been prone to corruption and mismanagement. As a result, much of the population has not benefited from the country's economic growth.2. Instability: The DRC has experienced years of conflict, with armed groups and government forces vying for control of the country's natural resources. This instability has had a serious impact on the economy, with businesses closing down or operating at reduced capacity. The lack of security has also deterred foreign investment, further limiting the government's ability to develop the economy.
