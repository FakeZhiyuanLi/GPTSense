According to the biblical accounts in the Gospels, Jesus was tortured in several ways before he was crucified. These include:1. Scourging: Jesus was stripped and tied to a post, then soldiers whipped him with a whip that had sharp pieces of glass and metal on the end. This scourging would have caused significant physical trauma and pain.2. Crown of Thorns: After the scourging, soldiers twisted thorny branches into a crown and placed it on Jesus' head, causing further pain and humiliation.3. Mocking: The soldiers then mocked Jesus, spitting on him, hitting him, and kneading him like dough while he was bound and helpless.4. Carrying the Cross: Jesus was then forced to carry his own cross through the streets of Jerusalem while being mocked and abused by the crowd that had gathered.5. Crucifixion: Finally, Jesus was nailed to the cross and left to die, a slow and excruciating death that took several hours.Overall, the torture and suffering that Jesus endured before his crucifixion were extreme, and serve as a powerful reminder of the sacrifice that he made for humanity.
