The doctrine that seeks to study rules and their relationship with the economy is called "Economic Policy". It is the study of government policies and regulations that affect the economy and the way in which these policies influence economic growth, stability, and distribution of resources. This includes policies related to taxes, subsidies, tariffs, trade regulations, monetary policy, budget allocation, and other forms of economic intervention by the government.
