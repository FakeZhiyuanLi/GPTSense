The Downtown Manhattan No Wave scene transitioned into various forms of experimental and avant-garde music, including industrial, noise, and post-punk. Many musicians from the scene went on to form successful bands, such as Sonic Youth, Swans, and Lydia Lunch's various projects. The influence of No Wave can also be heard in modern experimental music and art rock.
