A deistic view of God is one that believes in the existence of a higher power or being that created the universe, but does not intervene in its affairs or human actions. Deists believe that reason and observation of the natural world are sufficient to understand and acknowledge the existence of God, and that organized religion and scripture are not necessary. They view God as a distant creator who set the laws of nature in motion and allowed the universe to develop without interference, and who does not intervene in human affairs or answer prayers.
