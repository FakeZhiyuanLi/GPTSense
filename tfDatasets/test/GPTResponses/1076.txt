Green facial makeup was worn by Ancient Egyptians because they believed it had magical and healing properties. The green pigment was derived from malachite, a copper mineral that was believed to have protective powers against eye infections and other illnesses. It was also associated with the goddess Hathor, who was associated with beauty, love, and fertility. Green makeup was often applied to the eyes, giving them a dramatic effect and believed to protect them from harmful rays of the sun. It was also used in other cosmetics, such as lip glosses and nail polishes. Additionally, green was a popular color in Ancient Egypt, representing growth, rebirth, and fertility.
