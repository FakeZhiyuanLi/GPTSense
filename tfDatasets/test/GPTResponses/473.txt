Child labor was first documented in Brazil during the colonial period, which lasted from the 16th century until the early 19th century. However, it was not until the 20th century that child labor began to be regulated and monitored by the government. The Brazilian Labor Code, which was passed in 1943, established minimum working age laws and restrictions on the types of work that children could perform. Despite these laws, child labor remains a problem in Brazil today, particularly in informal sectors such as agriculture, domestic work, and street vending.
