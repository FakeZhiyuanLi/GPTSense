Post-glacial rebound occurs very slowly, with rates ranging from a few millimeters to a few centimeters per year, depending on the location and geological conditions. In some areas, such as parts of Canada and Scandinavia, rebound rates can be as high as 10-15 millimeters per year. However, in most other areas, rebound rates are much lower, typically ranging from 1-5 millimeters per year. This slow rate of rebound is due to the slow flow of mantle material beneath the Earth's crust, which is responsible for the gradual uplift of the land.
