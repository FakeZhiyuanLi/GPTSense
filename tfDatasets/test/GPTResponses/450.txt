Ecclesiology is the study of the Christian Church, its characteristics, nature, structure, and mission. It considers the meaning of the Church as the community of all believers, and the roles and relationships of its members, especially those within and between different branches of Christianity. It also explores issues of church governance, leadership, and authority, as well as the Church's relationship with society, politics, and other religions.
