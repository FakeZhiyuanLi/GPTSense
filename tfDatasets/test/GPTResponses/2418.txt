The attitude indicator and heading indicator are vacuum-powered because they rely on a gyro mechanism for their operation, and the gyro needs a stable source of power to maintain its accuracy. The vacuum source provides a constant flow of air to the gyro, keeping it at a stable speed and allowing it to accurately measure the motion of the aircraft. Additionally, the vacuum source provides a consistent level of suction to the instrument, preventing any air or debris from interfering with the gyro mechanism. Overall, the vacuum-powered design allows for consistent and reliable operation of these critical flight instruments.
