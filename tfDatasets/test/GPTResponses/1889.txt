Illustrated manuscripts in the Ottoman Empire were usually commissioned by sultans, high-ranking officials in the court, and members of the nobility. Some wealthy merchants and patrons of the arts also commissioned illustrated manuscripts. The Ottoman court at various times employed a number of talented artists and calligraphers who were commissioned to create works for the Sultan and his officials.
