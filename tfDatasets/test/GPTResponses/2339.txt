The second law of thermodynamics in statistical mechanics is a fundamental principle that describes the behavior of systems composed of large numbers of particles. It is a law of physics that falls under the category of thermodynamics, which is the study of the relationship between heat, energy, and work. It is specifically related to the directionality of physical processes, and asserts that the entropy (a measure of the disorder of a system) of an isolated system will tend to increase over time.
