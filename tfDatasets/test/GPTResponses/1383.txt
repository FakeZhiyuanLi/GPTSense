The stretch of the railroad that was vital to the Confederates in the Civil War was the Virginia Central Railroad, which connected Richmond to the Shenandoah Valley and the western part of Virginia. This railroad was critical for transporting troops, supplies, and ammunition to the front lines, and for maintaining communication between the Confederate capital of Richmond and its armies in the field. The Union repeatedly targeted this railroad during the war, and its destruction had a major impact on Confederate operations.
