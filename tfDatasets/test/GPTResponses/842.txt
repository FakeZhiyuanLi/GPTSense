Artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is another source of mining that is dangerous to child workers. ASGM involves the extraction of gold from small-scale or informal mining operations, often done with simple tools and equipment. Children are often involved in ASGM as they are seen as more agile, easier to manipulate and control, and have smaller hands to work in narrow spaces. The use of toxic substances such as mercury to extract gold also poses health risks to child laborers who are often exposed to these chemicals without adequate protective gear or training. The United Nations estimates that more than one million children work in ASGM worldwide, making it a significant source of child labor and exploitation in the mining sector.
