Synthpop style of music benefited greatly from the gaining popularity of electronic music technology such as synthesizers, drum machines, and sequencers. These instruments allowed for a more futuristic and unique sound, enabling artists to produce catchy melodies and infectious rhythms. Additionally, the rise of music videos and MTV in the 1980s helped propel synthpop into mainstream culture, as visuals could fully showcase the genre's aesthetic and futuristic themes. The popularity of electronic dance music (EDM) and its sub-genres in recent years has also led to a resurgence of interest in synthpop, as many contemporary artists incorporate elements of the genre into their music.
