The conductive plates for larger value capacitors are often made using thin metal foils, such as aluminum or copper. These foils are layered together with insulating material between each layer to create a multi-layered structure. The layers can be wound into a cylindrical shape or stacked in a flat sandwich configuration. The plates are then coated with a dielectric material, such as ceramic or plastic film, to create the capacitor.
