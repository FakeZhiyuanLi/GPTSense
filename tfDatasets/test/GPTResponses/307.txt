A bicameral legislature is a type of legislative body that consists of two separate chambers or houses. This typically includes an upper house (often referred to as the Senate or House of Lords) and a lower house (often referred to as the House of Representatives or House of Commons). The purpose of having two separate chambers is to provide a system of checks and balances that prevents any one group or individual from having too much power. In some countries, such as the United States, both chambers must approve legislation before it can become law.
