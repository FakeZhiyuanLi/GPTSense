The primary goal of the US invading Afghanistan in 2001 was to eliminate the Taliban government that was harboring Al-Qaeda terrorists responsible for the 9/11 attacks on the United States. The US also aimed to disrupt and dismantle Al-Qaeda's terrorist infrastructure in Afghanistan, prevent the resurgence of the Taliban, and establish a stable democratic government in the country. Additionally, the US sought to promote human rights, support economic development, and strengthen security in Afghanistan.
