Mountain valleys are created through the process of erosion, where water and other natural agents gradually wear away the surrounding bedrock over time. The characteristic "V" shape of mountain valleys is formed through the combination of erosion and gravity.In the early stages of valley formation, rainfall and other natural agents such as rivers and streams cut into the bedrock, causing small channels and gullies to form. As these channels deepen and widen, they cause the surrounding rock to become unstable and prone to collapse.Over time, the collapsed debris accumulates and is carried away by the moving water, gradually cutting the valley deeper into the bedrock. This process creates steep, rocky walls on either side of the valley, giving it its characteristic "V" shape.Before glaciation, mountain valleys were also shaped by other natural agents such as wind, frost, and plant roots. These agents contributed to the erosion process by breaking down the rock and soil, further deepening and widening the valley over time.
