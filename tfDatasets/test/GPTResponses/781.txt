In authoritarian forms of government, leaders are often not held to the same laws as ordinary citizens. This includes monarchies, dictatorships, and some forms of communism. In these systems, the leader or ruling party holds absolute power and can make or change the laws as they please, often exempting themselves from prosecution for their actions. However, in democratic systems, leaders are typically held to the same laws as ordinary citizens under the principle of the rule of law.
