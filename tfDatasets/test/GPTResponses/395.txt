A bit reservoir can be used while encoding a variable bit rate stream, such as an audio file compressed with a codec like MP3 or AAC. The bit reservoir allows the encoder to save bits from parts of the signal that require less data to encode, and use those saved bits in parts of the signal that require more data to encode. This results in more efficient use of the available bitrate and better sound quality, especially in complex parts of the audio signal.
