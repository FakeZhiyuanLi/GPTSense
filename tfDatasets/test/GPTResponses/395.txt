There is no conclusive evidence that Ibn Sina (also known as Avicenna) was involved in the burning down of the royal library. However, some historians speculate that he may have been blamed for it due to his association with the ruling dynasty at the time. Other theories suggest that it could have been accidental or the result of other political and military conflicts in the region. Ultimately, the exact cause of the library's destruction remains a mystery.
