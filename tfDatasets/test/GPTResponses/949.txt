The portion of the photoelectric effect that was in disagreement with the believed description of light behavior was that the intensity of light did not affect the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons, but rather the frequency of the light. This contradicted the classical wave theory of light which predicted that the energy of the emitted electrons should increase with increasing intensity of light.
