Lountza is a traditional Cypriot meat product made from pork loin. It is a type of smoked and cured meat that is usually sliced thin and eaten cold, similar to ham or bacon. Lountza is often seasoned with spices such as coriander and pepper, and it is a popular ingredient in salads and sandwiches. It is also commonly served as a meze (appetizer) in Cyprus.
