The Canadian government is a third source of research funding for institutions of higher learning in Canada. The federal government provides research grants and funding through various programs, including the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR). These organizations offer funding opportunities for research in a variety of fields and disciplines, supporting academic institutions across Canada in advancing knowledge and innovation.
