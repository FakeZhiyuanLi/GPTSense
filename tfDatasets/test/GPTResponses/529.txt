Chatter marks are a pattern of small, repetitive marks or ridges that appear on the surface of wood after it has been machined or planed. They are typically caused by vibrations or oscillations in the cutting tool or the workpiece itself, resulting in inconsistent cutting depth and surface quality. Chatter marks can affect the visual appearance and smoothness of the wood surface, as well as compromise its structural integrity by weakening the fibers.
