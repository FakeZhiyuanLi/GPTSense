Syllabaries differ because they were developed independently by different cultures and for different purposes. The phonetic structures of different languages and dialects also vary, making it necessary to create unique systems to accommodate the specific sounds and tones of each language. Additionally, syllabaries can evolve over time as changes occur in the language they represent. Therefore, factors such as geography, history, culture, and language development all contribute to the differences in syllabaries.
