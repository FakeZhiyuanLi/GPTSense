The process of producing a protein from a gene's DNA involves three key steps: transcription, translation, and protein folding.1. Transcription: In the first step, the DNA code is transcribed into a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule. This occurs in the nucleus of the cell and involves the unwinding of the DNA double helix to expose the gene sequence. The enzyme RNA polymerase then reads the sequence and synthesizes a complementary mRNA molecule.2. Translation: The mRNA molecule is then transported out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm. Here, it is read by ribosomes, which decode the sequence and assemble a chain of amino acids to form the protein. This process is called translation.3. Protein folding: Once the protein chain is assembled, it undergoes a process called protein folding, where it adopts its final three-dimensional shape. This is essential for the protein's function and can involve the assistance of chaperone proteins.Overall, the process of producing a protein from a gene's DNA involves three major steps – transcription, translation, and protein folding – and can involve numerous other molecular interactions and regulatory mechanisms.
