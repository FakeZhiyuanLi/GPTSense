Early Islamic metaphysics is imbued with a strong emphasis on the oneness of God (tawhid) and the idea that all reality stems from and is sustained by the divine being. It also emphasizes the importance of reason (aql) and knowledge (ilm) in understanding the nature of God and the world. Muslim philosophers in the early Islamic period saw the universe as a hierarchy of beings, with God at the top and the material world at the bottom, and sought to understand the relationships between these beings and the processes of creation, causation, and change. At the same time, early Islamic metaphysics was shaped by the influence of Greek philosophy (especially Aristotle), which Muslim thinkers integrated into their own theological and philosophical traditions.
