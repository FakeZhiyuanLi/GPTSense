The Cholas excelled in Dravidian architecture, a style characterized by intricately carved temples with pyramid-shaped towers called gopurams. They were known for their use of granite, a hard stone that they used to build monumental temple complexes, such as the Brihadeeswara Temple in Thanjavur. The Cholas also incorporated intricate carvings and sculptures that depicted mythological scenes and deities. Their architecture style had a significant influence on the later Dravidian temples in Tamil Nadu.
