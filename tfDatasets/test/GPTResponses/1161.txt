Lophophores are a group of specialized feeding structures found in some aquatic animals, mainly in the phylum Bryozoa, Brachiopoda, and Phoronida. The lophophore is a circular or horseshoe-shaped organ that surrounds the mouth and contains numerous tentacles that are covered in cilia or hair-like structures. These cilia create a water current that brings food particles to the lophophore, where they are filtered out and ingested. Lophophores are important for the feeding and survival of these animals and are a defining feature of these particular phyla.
