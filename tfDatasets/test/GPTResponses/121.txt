assets and a potential systemic crisis. When financial institutions de-leverage, they sell off assets and reduce their borrowing, which can lead to a decrease in the value of those assets and a loss of confidence in the financial system as a whole. If too many institutions are de-leveraging at the same time, it can create a domino effect of asset price declines, which can lead to a vicious cycle of further de-leveraging and more asset price declines. This is why central banks often step in during times of crisis to provide liquidity and prevent a systemic collapse.
