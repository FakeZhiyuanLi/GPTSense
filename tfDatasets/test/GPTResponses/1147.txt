A gap was left at the mouth of Leyden jars to prevent electrical discharge (spark) between the inner and outer coatings of the jar. This gap, also known as a spark gap, allows the jar to store and discharge electricity without damaging the glass. Additionally, the spark gap allows for controlled discharge of electricity, which is important for experiments and laboratory applications.
