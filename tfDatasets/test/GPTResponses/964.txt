During the early Han dynasty, the small seal script, a standardized form of Chinese characters, was developed. It was used as a means of communication and record-keeping and was also utilized in official government documents. The development of this script led to a more efficient and uniform system of writing, which had significant implications for the growth and stability of the Han dynasty.
