The Sahara desert is known for being one of the driest regions on the planet, with an average annual rainfall of less than 100 millimeters. Some areas of the Sahara go without rainfall for years or even decades. However, there is no specific time frame or frequency for how often the Sahara goes without rainfall, as it varies depending on factors such as climate patterns, atmospheric conditions, and geography.
