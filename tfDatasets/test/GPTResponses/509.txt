The Chalukya kings encouraged writers to use the Kannada language to create literary works. They believed in promoting and nurturing the local language, art, and culture, and thus supported Kannada literature. Many eminent poets and writers of the time wrote works in Kannada, which flourished under the patronage of the Chalukya dynasty. Some of the famous literary works from this period include Pampa Bharata, Vikramarjuna Vijaya, and Prabhulingaleele.
