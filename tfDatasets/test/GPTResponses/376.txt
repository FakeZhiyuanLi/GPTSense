Genes are expressed when the genetic information encoded in the DNA of a cell is used to produce RNA molecules and proteins. The timing and level of gene expression can vary depending on various factors, including the stage of development, environmental cues, and cellular signaling pathways. Gene expression can also be regulated at different levels, such as transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational regulation. Ultimately, gene expression determines the characteristics and functions of a cell, tissue, and organism.
