John von Neumann did not establish the concept of mean square ratio. The concept of mean square ratio was established by Karl Pearson in 1900, who used it to measure the degree of dependence between two variables. However, von Neumann made significant contributions to the field of statistics through his work on the theory of games and his development of the Monte Carlo method for solving mathematical problems through statistical simulations.
