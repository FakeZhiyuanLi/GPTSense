It is unclear what specific effects a local surface low pressure may have as it can vary depending on the location and surrounding weather systems. However, some possible effects of a local surface low pressure may include increased cloudiness, chance of precipitation, and cooler temperatures. It may also cause winds to swirl towards the low pressure center, resulting in converging air that can lead to thunderstorms or other severe weather.
