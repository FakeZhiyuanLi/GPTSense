Yes, unfortunately, child labour still exists in the 21st century, particularly in developing countries. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), there are approximately 152 million child labourers worldwide, with the majority working in agriculture, followed by the service and industrial sectors. These children are often forced to work long hours, under hazardous conditions, and for little pay. Child labour deprives children of their childhood, education, and health, and perpetuates intergenerational poverty. Efforts are being made to eradicate child labour, but it remains a complex issue that requires multi-dimensional solutions.
