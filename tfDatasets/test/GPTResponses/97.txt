When the price of a necessary commodity such as food or fuel is higher, consumers tend to have less money to spend on other goods. This is because their budget is limited, and they must allocate more money towards purchasing the necessary commodity. As a result, they have less disposable income to spend on other goods and services. This can lead to a decrease in demand for non-essential items, which can have a negative impact on businesses that sell those items. Additionally, higher prices for necessary commodities can increase inflation and reduce overall economic growth, further affecting consumers' ability to spend.
