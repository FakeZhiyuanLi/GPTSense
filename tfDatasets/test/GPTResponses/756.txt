The German-Soviet dividing line in regards to annexing Poland was agreed upon in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939. The pact included a secret protocol that divided Eastern Europe into spheres of influence, with Germany having free rein in most of Western Poland, and the Soviet Union taking control of Eastern Poland and the Baltic States. This division allowed both countries to annex parts of Poland without interference from the other. However, the pact was broken when Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, leading to a shift in alliances and the eventual defeat of Germany.
