The two systems that were compared in the Soviet Union in 1970 were the Soviet socialist economic model and the capitalist economic model of the Western countries. The Soviet Union asserted that its socialist system was superior to the capitalist system, highlighting the achievements of the planned economy, state ownership of industry and agriculture, and the absence of exploitation of the working class. The Western countries, on the other hand, emphasized the benefits of market economy and free enterprise, citing the ability of the market to allocate resources efficiently and the protection of individual liberties and property rights.
