Poland denied the proposal of the Soviet Union protecting them from a German attack because they did not trust the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union had signed a non-aggression pact with Germany, known as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which divided up Eastern Europe and gave Germany a free hand to attack Poland. Poland saw the Soviet Union as being complicit in German aggression and feared that any deal with them would lead to Soviet domination. Additionally, Poland hoped that France and Britain would come to their aid in case of a Nazi attack, which they ultimately did, leading to the outbreak of World War II.
