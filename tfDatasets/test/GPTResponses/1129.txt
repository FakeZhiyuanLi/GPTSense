The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, adopted at the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights, require the rule of law to be used in promoting and protecting human rights. This means that governments and organizations must ensure that laws are fair, just, and consistent with international human rights standards, and that they are applied equally to all individuals without discrimination. The rule of law also requires that individuals be afforded due process and access to justice, and that there is accountability for human rights violations. The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action emphasize that the rule of law is an essential component of a democratic society and the protection of human rights.
