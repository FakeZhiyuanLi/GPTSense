Annelids (segmented worms) release sperm through a structure called a gonopore, located on the ventral side of their body. The sperm is transferred from the male to the female during copulation. Some species of annelids also have external fertilization, where both the male and female release their gametes (sperm and eggs) into the surrounding water for fertilization to occur.
