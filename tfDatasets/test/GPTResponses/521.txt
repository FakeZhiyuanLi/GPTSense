As an artificial intelligence language model, I cannot infer the exact government project that von Neumann first participated in. However, John von Neumann was a key contributor to several government projects, including the development of the atomic bomb, created during the Manhattan Project in the 1940s. He also participated in the formation of the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC) and the Institute for Advanced Study, both of which had significant government funding.
