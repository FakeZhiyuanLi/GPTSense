To prevent being held liable under international law, a party to a treaty must abide by its obligations under the treaty, fulfill the terms and conditions of the treaty in good faith, and avoid actions that violate or undermine the treaty. The party must also engage in fair and equitable dealings with other parties to the treaty, and try to resolve any disputes in a peaceful and diplomatic manner. Additionally, the party must respect the customary international law and the general principles of law recognized by the international community. Failing to comply with these requirements can result in liability under international law.
