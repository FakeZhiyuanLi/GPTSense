The word Sibyl comes from the ancient Greek word "sibylla," which means prophetess or seeress. The ancient Greeks believed that the Sibyls were women with extraordinary powers of prophecy and divination who could communicate with the gods and foretell the future. The most famous Sibyl was the Oracle of Delphi, who was consulted by kings and leaders from all over ancient Greece. The Sibyls were also revered by the Romans, who saw them as powerful and influential figures who could help guide and shape the course of human history.
