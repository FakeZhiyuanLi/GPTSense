and series is that a sequence is a list of numbers that follows a certain pattern or rule, while a series is the sum of terms in a sequence. In other words, a sequence is a set of ordered numbers, whereas a series is the accumulation of those numbers. The terms in a sequence can be added up to form a series, which can be either finite or infinite. The distinction between sequence and series is important in many areas of mathematics, including calculus, analysis, and number theory.
