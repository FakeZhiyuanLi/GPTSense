Colorado suggested implementing a new system called ranked-choice voting (RCV), also known as instant-runoff voting. Under this system, voters would rank candidates in order of preference rather than choosing just one. If no candidate receives a majority of first-preference votes, the candidate with the fewest votes would be eliminated, and their votes would be redistributed based on the voters' second-preference choices. This process would continue until a candidate reaches a majority of votes. RCV is intended to ensure that winners have the broadest possible support among voters and could potentially reduce partisan polarization.
