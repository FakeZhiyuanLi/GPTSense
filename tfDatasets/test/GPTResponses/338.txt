Derrick May released an unusual single titled "Kaotic Harmony" in 1991, which featured a darker strain of house. The single was released under May's alias Rhythim Is Rhythim and is considered a classic of the Detroit techno scene. The track features heavy, distorted drums and a brooding bassline, creating a menacing atmosphere that is unusual for traditional house music. The use of harsh, industrial samples and haunting synth melodies further adds to the track's unique and unsettling vibe.
