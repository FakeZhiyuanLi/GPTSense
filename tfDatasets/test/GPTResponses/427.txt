After Buddha's death in 483 BCE, his teachings were carried forward by his disciples and spread across Asia. However, his image and presence were replaced by other deities or rulers in the ruling centers. In India, after the Mauryan dynasty, the Gupta dynasty replaced the Buddhist influence with Hinduism. In Cambodia, the Khmer kings replaced the Buddhist influence with Hinduism until Theravada Buddhism was revived in the 11th century. In China, Buddha's image was replaced by Taoism, Confucianism, and local/Shamanistic beliefs. In Japan, native Shintoism fused with Buddhism, creating a syncretic religious culture. In general, Buddhism's influence can still be seen in the art and religion of these regions even though Buddhism is not the dominant religion of these areas today.
