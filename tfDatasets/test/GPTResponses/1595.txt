One way to reach the economic goals of the Ottoman economic system was through promoting trade and commerce. The Ottomans established trade routes that extended from Europe to Asia, creating a vast network of economic activity. They also created efficient tax and revenue systems to support the economy. Another important factor was the promotion of agriculture, as the Ottomans recognized that a strong agricultural sector was crucial to their economic success. They invested in irrigation systems, provided loans to farmers, and encouraged the cultivation of cash crops such as cotton and tobacco. The Ottomans also established guilds and crafts associations to regulate and promote the production of various goods. Overall, the Ottoman economic system was characterized by a combination of state intervention, mercantilism, and free trade, all aimed at promoting economic growth and increasing the power and wealth of the empire.
