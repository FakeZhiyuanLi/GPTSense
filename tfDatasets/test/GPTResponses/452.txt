In 1888, child convicts were primarily sent to Australia, which was still a British colony at the time. The British government transported thousands of child convicts to Australia between 1788 and 1868 as a punishment and to increase the labor force in the country. This practice was eventually abolished due to criticisms and opposition from various groups.
