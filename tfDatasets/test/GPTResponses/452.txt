is commonly known as "cronyism" (the practice of favoring one's friends, associates, or relatives in hiring, grant of privileges, or the awarding of contracts or jobs). This often results in the aid not going to those who need it the most, but rather to those who have the most influence or are most closely connected to those in power. Additionally, those who are corrupt may siphon off aid funds for personal gain, further reducing the effectiveness of aid programs.
