1. Flow rate: The flow rate of a pumping system is the volume of fluid, usually measured in gallons or liters per minute, that the pump is capable of moving through the system. The flow rate is the rate at which the fluid is being delivered, and it is important to know in order to ensure that the system is delivering the amount of fluid required for the application.2. Total head: Total head is a measure of the total pressure that the pump has to overcome to deliver the fluid at the required flow rate. Total head is the sum of the static head (the pressure required to lift the fluid to the required height), the friction head (the pressure required to overcome the resistance of the piping and other components in the system), and the dynamic head (the pressure required to overcome any changes in velocity that occur in the system). Total head is important to know because it is the pressure that the pump has to be capable of delivering in order to meet the requirements of the application.
