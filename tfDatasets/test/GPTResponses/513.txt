Plants tend to form smaller, more compact growth forms such as low shrubs, grasses, and mosses at higher altitudes. Additionally, they may have adaptations to survive in extreme cold, high winds, and low oxygen levels. Some alpine and subalpine plants may also have specialized root systems to anchor themselves in rocky soils or to absorb nutrients from shallow, nutrient-poor soils.
