The records of the death of Jesus are primarily found in the four Gospels of the New Testament: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. These books provide detailed accounts of Jesus’ crucifixion, burial, and resurrection, including his trials before Pontius Pilate and Herod, his carrying of the cross, and his final moments on the cross. Other historical texts that may reference Jesus’ death include the works of Josephus, a first century Jewish historian, and Tacitus, a Roman historian who wrote in the second century. However, these sources are not considered as reliable as the Gospels.
