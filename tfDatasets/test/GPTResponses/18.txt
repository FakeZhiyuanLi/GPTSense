Wilson's theorem states that if n is a prime number, then (n-1)! is divisible by n. Therefore, if an integer n > 4 is to be considered composite (i.e. not a prime), then we can use the contrapositive of Wilson's theorem to determine that if (n-1)! is not divisible by n, then n is composite.In other words, if we want to find a factorial that must be divisible by n for n to be composite, we need to find the smallest integer k such that (k-1)! is divisible by n. This is because if (k-1)! is not divisible by n, then we know that (n-1)! is also not divisible by n (since (n-1)! contains a factor of (k-1)!), and therefore n must be prime.So, in summary, the factorial that must be divisible by n if n is composite is the smallest k such that (k-1)! is divisible by n.
