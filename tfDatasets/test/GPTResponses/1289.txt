Spanish explorers did not directly encounter Mississippian cultural people in the 16th century. The Mississippian culture emerged around 800 CE and was primarily located in the Mississippi River valley, which was not explored by the Spanish until the mid-16th century. However, when the Spanish did explore the region, they encountered several Native American tribes who were part of the Mississippian culture, including the Natchez and the Chickasaw.
