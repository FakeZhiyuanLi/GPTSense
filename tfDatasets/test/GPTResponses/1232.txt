There is no clear answer to this question as there is no official recognition of an "Eastern Tibet" by the Chinese government or the Tibetan government-in-exile. However, some regions that are sometimes referred to as Eastern Tibet include:1. Qinghai province: This region was historically part of the Tibetan Plateau and is home to a large Tibetan population.2. Sichuan province: The eastern part of Sichuan is sometimes considered part of Eastern Tibet. This region is known for its spectacular mountain landscape and numerous Tibetan Buddhist monasteries.3. Yunnan province: The northeastern part of Yunnan is sometimes considered part of Eastern Tibet. This region is home to a large number of ethnic Tibetans and has a rich cultural heritage.Overall, the term "Eastern Tibet" is more of a cultural and historical concept than a well-defined geographic region.
