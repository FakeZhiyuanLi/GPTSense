The sex determination system varies widely among insects. Some insects, such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, have an XX-XY sex chromosome system similar to humans, where females have two X chromosomes (XX) and males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY). Other insects, such as bees, have a haplodiploid sex determination system, where females arise from diploid eggs fertilized by sperm, and males arise from haploid eggs fertilized by sperm. Some insects, such as mosquitoes, have a system of sex determination based on environmental factors, such as temperature or the presence of certain hormones.
