Albert Einstein's theory of relativity was mainly influenced by his study of physics, mathematics, and philosophy during his early years, as well as his work as a patent clerk in Bern, Switzerland. However, his theory was also influenced by the works of other scientists such as Hendrik Lorentz, Henri Poincar√©, and Isaac Newton.
