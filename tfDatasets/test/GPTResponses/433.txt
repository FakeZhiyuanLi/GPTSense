is known as the Alps mountain range. This geological process, which began over 30 million years ago, resulted in the formation of some of Europe's most iconic peaks, including Mont Blanc, Matterhorn, and Eiger. The upthrusting is still ongoing, with the Alps rising at a rate of around 1-2 cm per year. The mountains play an important role in the economy and culture of both Switzerland and Bavaria, attracting millions of tourists every year for skiing, hiking, and sightseeing.
