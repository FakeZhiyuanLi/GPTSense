Cirri are slender, hair-like projections found on the surface of certain organisms, including some protists, invertebrates, and fish. They are used for a variety of purposes, including movement, sensing their environment, and capturing food. The word "cirri" comes from the Latin word for "curl," reflecting their hair-like appearance.
