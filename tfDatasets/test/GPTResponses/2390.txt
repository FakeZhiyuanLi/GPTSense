A vacuum is used to produce a low-pressure environment where electron beam welding and vacuum frying take place. In electron beam welding, a focused beam of high-energy electrons is used to melt and join the metal parts. In vacuum frying, the low-pressure environment allows for the reduction of frying temperature and pressures, resulting in a healthier snack with reduced oil content. Thus, the vacuum is not producing anything, but it is used as a medium for the processes of electron beam welding and vacuum frying.
