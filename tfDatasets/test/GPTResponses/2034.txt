The procuticle is thicker than the epicuticle in most insects. The procuticle makes up the majority of the cuticle and is responsible for providing structural support and protection for the insect. The epicuticle is a thin, waxy layer that covers the surface of the cuticle and helps to prevent water loss and protect the insect from environmental factors.
