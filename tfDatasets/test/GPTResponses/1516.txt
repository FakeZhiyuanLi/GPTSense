If a god is not omnipotent, it means that they do not have unlimited or absolute power. They have limitations in their abilities and may not be able to do everything. This could mean that certain things are beyond their control or that they have weaknesses or vulnerabilities that prevent them from achieving certain goals. It may also mean that they require the help of others or cooperation with other beings to accomplish their objectives.
