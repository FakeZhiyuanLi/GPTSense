The processes that simply alter the consent given by parties to a previously valid treaty rather than invalidating the consent completely include:1. Amendment - This process allows the parties to modify certain provisions of the treaty without completely invalidating it. Amendments are often made through negotiations and require the consent of all parties involved.2. Interpretation - Sometimes, a treaty's provisions may be open to interpretation or misunderstanding by the parties involved. In such cases, the parties may seek to clarify the meaning of the provisions through interpretation without invalidating the treaty.3. Reservation - A reservation is a statement made by a State at the time of acceding to a treaty that modifies the State's obligations under the treaty. This process allows States to accept a treaty while excluding certain provisions that they find objectionable.4. Revision - This process allows the parties to review and modify the treaty's provisions, often to update or improve them. Unlike amendment, revision requires the parties to renegotiate the entire treaty.5. Denunciation - This process allows a State to express its intention to withdraw from a treaty. The treaty remains in force for the withdrawing State during a specified time period, after which the withdrawal becomes effective. Denunciation does not invalidate the treaty for other parties involved.
