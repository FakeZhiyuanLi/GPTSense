Sociocultural anthropology is primarily interested in studying conflicts related to cultural diversity and social inequalities. It explores how different cultural groups interact with one another and how they negotiate power, resources, and social norms. It also examines how these interactions can lead to tension, discrimination, and marginalization, and how conflicts can be resolved through cultural adaptation, dialogue, and mutual understanding. Thus, sociocultural anthropology is interested in conflicts related to race, ethnicity, gender, class, religion, and other social categories that shape our identities and everyday experiences.
