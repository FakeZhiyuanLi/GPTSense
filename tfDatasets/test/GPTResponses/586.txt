Roche moutonnée (French for "sheepback rock") is a type of rock formation formed by the action of glaciers. It is characterized by a smooth, elongated ridge with a gentler, upstream slope and a steeper, downstream slope. The upstream slope is usually gently curved and polished, while the downstream slope is steep with rough, jagged edges. Roche moutonnée is typically found in areas that have been glaciated, such as in parts of Canada, Scandinavia, and Scotland. These formations are useful for identifying the direction of glacial flow during the last ice age.
