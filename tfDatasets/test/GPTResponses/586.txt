If one state party objects and opposes another's reservations, the legal obligation between the two parties will depend on the specific treaty or agreement that they have made. Generally, if a reservation is made by a state party and another state party objects, the reservation will only be effective if it is accepted by the other state party. If the other state party does not accept the reservation, it will not be binding on them.In some cases, a reservation may be deemed incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty or agreement, and therefore invalid. In such cases, the state party making the reservation may be required to withdraw it or face consequences such as non-compliance with the treaty or agreement.Ultimately, the legal obligations between two state parties will be determined by the provisions of the treaty or agreement they have made, as well as by international law principles such as good faith and mutual cooperation.
