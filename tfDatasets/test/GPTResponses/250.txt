of computer science?Von Neumann's abstract treatment allowed him to work on the foundational issue of computer science, which is to understand the theoretical underpinnings of the digital computer and its ability to perform calculations and manipulate data. Specifically, his work on the architecture of digital computers and the design of stored-program computers set the stage for the development of programmable computers, which could be reprogrammed to carry out different tasks without the need for physical rewiring of the machine. This paved the way for the development of modern computers, and his contributions to computer science continue to influence the field today.
