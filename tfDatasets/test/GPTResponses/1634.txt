AC locomotives can be supplied with different range of voltages through the use of transformers and rectifiers. The power from the overhead lines or third rail is fed through transformers to convert it to the desired voltage level. The rectifiers then convert the AC voltage into DC voltage, which is used to power the locomotive motors. The motors are designed to operate at specific voltage levels, which can be controlled using electronic speed controllers. Additionally, some locomotives have multiple power controllers or inverters to allow for different operating modes and power levels.
