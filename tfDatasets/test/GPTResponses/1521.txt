The three religions that share similar beginnings are Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. They all trace their roots back to the prophet Abraham and the belief in one God. They also share many of the same sacred texts, such as the Torah and the Bible, and have similar beliefs about the afterlife and the role of prophets.
