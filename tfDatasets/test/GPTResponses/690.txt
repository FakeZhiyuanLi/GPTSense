During a conflict, transport of materials can be prevented due to various reasons such as:1. Blockades: Enemy forces may block access to roads, ports, and other transportation routes, making it impossible to transport materials.2. Damage to infrastructure: Conflict can cause damage to transportation infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and railways, making it impossible to transport materials.3. Security risks: Conflict zones are often unstable and unsafe, making it difficult to transport materials due to the risks posed by armed groups and landmines.4. Lack of fuel: During conflict, access to fuel may be limited or non-existent, making it challenging to transport materials that require fuel.5. Economic sanctions: During a conflict, countries may impose economic sanctions that prevent the transport of materials to the opposing side, causing shortages.6. Lack of transportation vehicles: In a conflict, transportation vehicles such as trucks, ships, and planes may be damaged or destroyed, limiting the ability to transport materials.
