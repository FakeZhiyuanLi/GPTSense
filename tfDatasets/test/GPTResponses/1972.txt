Mathematical relations became necessary because they allow us to describe and analyze relationships between different quantities or variables. Without mathematical relations, it would be difficult to solve problems that involve multiple variables or to make predictions about how changing one variable will affect another. Mathematical relations also help to formalize and communicate complex ideas in various fields such as physics, economics, engineering, and other scientific disciplines. Overall, the use of mathematical relations has significantly enhanced our ability to understand, predict, and manipulate the world around us.
