A more familiar, standard literary narrative structure would be employed in fiction writing such as novels or short stories. This structure typically includes an introduction to the setting and characters, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution. It is a linear structure that tells a story in a traditional way, from beginning to end. Non-fiction writing and journalistic writing may also use this structure, but it depends on the specific topic and purpose of the writing.
