Marginal crevasses are the crevasses that form on the edges or margins of a glacier. They occur due to the differential movement of the ice, where the faster movement of the ice in the center of the glacier causes the ice at the edges to crack and open up. These crevasses can be deep and dangerous, providing a risk to mountaineers and climbers who traverse glaciers.
