After secession, some North Carolinians still refused to support the Confederacy and the war effort. These individuals were often Unionists who disagreed with the state's decision to secede from the United States. Some even opposed slavery and believed that the war was being fought for the wrong reasons. These Unionists faced persecution and discrimination throughout the war, and their beliefs were often seen as unpatriotic. Despite this, they continued to advocate for their beliefs and remained steadfast in their opposition to the Confederacy.
