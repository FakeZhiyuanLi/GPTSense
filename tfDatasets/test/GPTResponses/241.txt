The German scholar who argued that human creativity takes diverse forms and is as important as human rationality is Ernst Cassirer. He emphasized that human beings have a symbolic capacity to create and communicate meaning through language, art, science, and religion. According to Cassirer, this creative ability is essential for understanding and transforming the world, and it should not be reduced to mere instrumental rationality.
