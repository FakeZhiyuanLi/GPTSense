There are a few underground items that can lead to soil degradation, including:1. Underground storage tanks (USTs) - These are used to store petroleum and other hazardous chemicals. Over time, leaks and spills from USTs can contaminate the soil and groundwater, leading to soil degradation.2. Landfills - Landfills contain various types of waste, including hazardous waste, which can leach into the ground and cause soil degradation.3. Industrial waste disposal sites - These sites are used to dispose of industrial waste, which can also contaminate the soil and groundwater.4. Sewage treatment plants - Wastewater discharges from sewage treatment plants can contain high levels of nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, which can lead to soil degradation when the wastewater is used for irrigation.5. Chemical spills and leaks - Accidental spills and leaks of hazardous chemicals can contaminate the soil and groundwater, leading to soil degradation.
