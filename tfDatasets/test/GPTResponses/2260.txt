For accurate measurement of the composition of gases at high vacuums, a mass spectrometer is typically used. This instrument can analyze the masses and abundances of gas particles present in the vacuum, providing precise information about the gas composition. Other instruments that can be used in combination with a mass spectrometer include laser spectroscopy equipment and residual gas analyzers.
