Charles Towne (later Charleston) was named after King Charles II of England, who granted the land to eight of his loyal supporters in 1663. The original settlers, led by Sir Anthony Ashley Cooper, envisioned the area as a thriving port town. Cooper believed that Charleston's location at the meeting point of the Ashley and Cooper rivers would make it a natural hub for shipping and trade. Over time, this prediction proved correct as Charleston became one of the most important trade centers in the American colonies.
