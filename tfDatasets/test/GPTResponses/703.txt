Some species of leeches are endangered due to habitat destruction, pollution, and overharvesting for medicinal and scientific purposes. The destruction of wetland habitats, which are critical to the survival of many leech species, has had a particularly significant impact on their populations. Additionally, the unsustainable collection of leeches for their use in traditional medicines has caused declines in their numbers. Climate change, invasive species, and changes in water quality are also contributing factors to the endangerment of some species of leeches.
