If tuberculosis (TB) becomes chronic, it can cause permanent damage to the lung tissue, particularly the upper lobes. The lung tissue may become scarred or destroyed, which can lead to decreased lung capacity and difficulty breathing. This can also increase the risk of developing other respiratory conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or bronchiectasis. Additionally, chronic TB can cause pulmonary fibrosis, a condition in which scar tissue forms in the lungs and can lead to respiratory failure. It is important to seek prompt medical attention and complete the full course of treatment to prevent chronic TB and its lasting effects on the lungs.
