Hemimetabolous insects undergo incomplete metamorphosis, which means that they have three distinct life stages: egg, nymph, and adult. The nymphs look like smaller versions of the adults, but they lack wings and reproductive organs. As they grow and molt through several stages, they develop these structures fully and eventually become adults.
