The most diverse insects are believed to have coevolved with flowering plants (angiosperms). This is because many insects rely on nectar, pollen, or other plant resources for food or habitat, and therefore, their evolution and diversification has been closely linked to the evolution and diversification of flowering plants. In turn, insects have also influenced the evolution of plants by serving as pollinators, herbivores, or predators.
