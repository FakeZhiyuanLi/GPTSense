is known as multichannel audio. Multichannel audio allows for the creation and reproduction of audio programs with more than two channels or speakers. This means that sounds can be positioned and moved between speakers, creating a more immersive and realistic audio experience. Multichannel audio is used in various applications, such as movies, video games, music production, and virtual reality, to provide a more accurate representation of sound in the real world. The development of multichannel audio has significantly enhanced the quality and versatility of the audio industry.
