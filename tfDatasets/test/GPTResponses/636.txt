Many annelids are separated by septa or cellular walls that divide the body into segments. These septa help to compartmentalize body functions within each segment and allow for greater flexibility and movement. The septa also help to prevent the loss of body fluids and provide structural support to the body. Additionally, some annelids have specialized regions in certain segments, such as the gills in polychaetes or the clitellum in earthworms.
