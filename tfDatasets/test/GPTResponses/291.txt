The Satavahana Empire began to decline after the 2nd century CE, and by the 3rd century CE, it had started to disintegrate into smaller states due to internal conflicts and external invasions. However, there is no specific date or year for when the empire was officially divided into smaller states, as it was a gradual process that took place over several decades.
