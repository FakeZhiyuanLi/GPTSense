Richard Dawkins is an atheist, which means he believes that there is no evidence to support the existence of a god or gods, and therefore, there is no reason to believe in their existence. He argues that there is no empirical evidence to support the claims of religious believers, and thus, it is more rational and logical to reject the existence of a god or gods until sufficient empirical evidence is provided.
