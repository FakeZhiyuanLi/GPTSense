There is no clear evidence of any conflict of faith and beliefs at the end of von Neumann's life. He was not particularly religious and was known for being more interested in science and mathematics than philosophy or theology. However, towards the end of his life, he did express some concerns about the morality of nuclear weapons and their impact on the world. He also became increasingly interested in the idea of digital consciousness and the possibility of artificial intelligence. Nevertheless, there is no indication that these interests caused any significant conflict in his beliefs or worldview.
