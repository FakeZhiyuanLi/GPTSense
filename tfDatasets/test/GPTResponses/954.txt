Governments with a low degree of the "rule of law" typically have a high level of discretion, as there are often few checks and balances in place to limit the power of government officials. This can lead to abuses of power, corruption, and arbitrary decision-making, as there are limited legal remedies or avenues for citizens to challenge government actions. Without a strong legal framework and respect for individual rights, governments with a low degree of the "rule of law" are often characterized by instability, inequality, and lack of public trust in institutions.
