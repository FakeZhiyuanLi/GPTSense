Cheap variable capacitors typically use a fixed outer layer of aluminum and a movable inner layer made of plastic. By turning a shaft or knob, the plastic layer can be moved closer or farther away from the aluminum layer, thus changing the distance between the two layers and altering the capacitance. The plastic layer may have conductive material on one or both sides which will work as the second pole of the capacitor. The greater the distance between the layers, the lower the capacitance and vice versa. This variable distance between the layers is what allows for the cheap variable capacitors to vary their capacitance.
