Child labourers in West Africa work on various tasks depending on the industry and the region they belong to. Some children work in agriculture, particularly in the production of cocoa, coffee, cotton, and rubber. They are involved in tasks such as planting, harvesting, weeding, and processing. Others work in small-scale mining activities, such as gold mining, and are involved in tasks such as digging, washing, and transporting heavy loads. Children may also work in domestic services, street vending, and begging. In some cases, children are forced to work for armed groups or are trafficked for sexual exploitation.
