septa. Annelids are segmented worms, with a body composed of multiple repeating segments. Each segment contains its own set of organs and musculature, and is separated from adjacent segments by a septum, or wall. The body cavities or coeloms of annelids are also separated by these septa, creating a series of distinct compartments within the body. This allows for greater specialization of different organ systems and ensures efficient functioning of the organism as a whole.
