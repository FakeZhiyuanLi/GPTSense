Transition in glass is comparable to the transition between solids and liquids, known as the melting point. Just like the melting point, the glass transition temperature also represents a change in physical properties of the material, such as a change in viscosity and elasticity. However, unlike the melting point, the glass transition temperature is not a true phase transition, as the material remains a solid throughout the transition.
