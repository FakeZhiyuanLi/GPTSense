In the Council of Jerusalem, which took place in 50 AD, Christian leaders gathered to consider the question of whether Gentile converts to Christianity needed to follow Jewish law, including circumcision. The discussion centered around the issue of whether the gospel was meant for Jews only or if it was also intended for Gentiles.After much debate, the apostle Peter gave a speech advocating for the inclusion of Gentiles in the Church, saying that God had accepted them as equals. James, the brother of Jesus and the leader of the Jerusalem church, also spoke, emphasizing the need to avoid offending Jewish sensibilities and to maintain unity among believers. In the end, the council decided that Gentiles did not need to follow Jewish law but should avoid practices that would be offensive to Jewish believers.This decision was a significant moment in the development of Christianity as a separate religion from Judaism and helped to establish the Church's identity as a global, multi-ethnic faith community.
