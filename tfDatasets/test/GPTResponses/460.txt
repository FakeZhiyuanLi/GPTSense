The size of each frame in 1920x1080p25 video depends on the compression used and the bit rate. Without compression, a single frame of 1920x1080p25 video would require 50.625 MB of storage (1920 x 1080 x 3 x 8 bits per byte / 25 frames per second / 1,000,000 bytes per MB = 50.625 MB). However, most video codecs like H.264 or MPEG-4 use various compression techniques to reduce the size of each frame. The actual size can range from several hundred kilobytes to a few megabytes, depending on the amount of detail in the image and the bitrate used for encoding.
