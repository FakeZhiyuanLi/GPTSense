The Chalukya dynasty was known for developing the Chalukya style of architecture, which is a blend of Dravidian and Nagara styles. This style is characterized by the use of intricate carvings and sculptures, tall shikharas, and elaborate entrance gateways. Famous examples of Chalukya architecture include the temples of Pattadakal, Aihole, and Badami in present-day Karnataka, India.
