The site of the first action in the Seven Years' War was in North America, specifically in the Ohio River Valley. A British force commanded by Lieutenant Colonel George Washington clashed with a French force in what became known as the Battle of Jumonville Glen on May 28, 1754. This confrontation marked the beginning of the French and Indian War, a major theater in the global conflict that became known as the Seven Years' War.
