Kashmir was not sold to a dynasty in 1849. In 1846, the Sikh Empire (a dynasty ruled by Maharaja Ranjit Singh) ceded Kashmir to the Dogra Dynasty (a Hindu dynasty ruled by Maharaja Gulab Singh) through the Treaty of Amritsar. This transfer of power from the Sikhs to the Dogras marked the beginning of Dogra rule in Kashmir, which lasted until 1947 when the region was divided between India and Pakistan.
