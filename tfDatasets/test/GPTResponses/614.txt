1. Grazing: Herbivorous mammals such as deer, bison, and elk graze on vegetation, which can impact the density and composition of plant species in an area.2. Burrowing: Small mammals such as moles, gophers, and ground squirrels burrow underground, which can modify the soil structure and impact the distribution of plant roots.3. Nesting: Mammals such as squirrels, raccoons, and birds build nests and dens in trees, which can impact the availability of nesting sites for other animals.4. Foraging: Carnivorous mammals such as wolves, coyotes, and foxes forage for prey, which can impact the population dynamics of prey species.5. Migration: Migratory mammals such as caribou and wildebeest travel long distances across different habitats, which can impact the distribution of other species in those areas.
