An example of another paired relationship of uncertainly related to standard deviation could be the relationship between the mean and variance of a dataset. While the two are mathematically related (variance is essentially the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean), the variance can vary greatly depending on the spread of the data points, making it a less reliable measure of variability in comparison to standard deviation.
