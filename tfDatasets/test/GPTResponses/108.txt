Evolutionary anthropology is based on the scientific approach of evolutionary theory and natural selection. It views human behavior, biology, and culture as being shaped and transformed by evolutionary processes over time. The approach involves the integration of multiple disciplines, including genetics, paleontology, archaeology, primatology, and cultural anthropology to understand the evolution of humans and our closest relatives.
