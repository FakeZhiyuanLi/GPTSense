The Peshwas were a dynasty of prime ministers who served as the de facto rulers of the Maratha Empire in India from 1749 to 1818. They were appointed by the Chhatrapati (emperor) and were responsible for the administration, taxation, and military affairs of the empire. The word "Peshwa" literally means "first" or "foremost" in Marathi language, and the Peshwas were considered to be the foremost advisors to the Chhatrapati. The most famous Peshwas were Balaji Vishwanath, Baji Rao I, and his son Balaji Baji Rao, who expanded the Maratha Empire to its zenith in the 18th century.
