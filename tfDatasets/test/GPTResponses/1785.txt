Humans often try to control the spread of insects through the use of pesticides, insecticides, and repellents. Other methods include biological controls such as introducing natural predators or using pheromones to disrupt mating behavior. Physical barriers such as screens and nets can also be effective. In some cases, quarantine measures may be implemented to prevent the importation of new pests. Additionally, cultural practices such as crop rotation and sanitation measures can help reduce insect populations.
