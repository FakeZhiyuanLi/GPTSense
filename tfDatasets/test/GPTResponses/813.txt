its pharynx?An annelid's brain in a ring around its pharynx is known as a cerebral ganglion or nerve ring. Annelids are a group of invertebrates that include earthworms, leeches, and marine polychaetes. The cerebral ganglion is a concentrated mass of nerve cells that allows the animal to process sensory information and coordinate its body movements. This nerve ring is located in the head region of the annelid and sends nerve signals throughout the body via a ventral nerve cord.
