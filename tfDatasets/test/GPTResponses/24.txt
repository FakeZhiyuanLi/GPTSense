The Rhine measurement was changed to the International System of Units (SI) in 1932. Specifically, the old Rhine measurement unit of 1 metric foot was replaced by the SI unit of 0.3048 meters. This change was part of a global effort to standardize units of measurement for easier communication and consistency across different countries and scientific fields.
