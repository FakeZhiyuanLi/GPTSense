Black Wednesday refers to September 16, 1992, when the UK government was forced to withdraw the pound sterling from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). The decision was made after the pound was being sold heavily by currency speculators, and the government was unable to maintain the artificial exchange rate set under the ERM. The event caused major economic turmoil, with the pound losing over 15% of its value against the Deutsche mark and other currencies within hours. Black Wednesday is considered one of the most significant events in the economic history of the UK.
