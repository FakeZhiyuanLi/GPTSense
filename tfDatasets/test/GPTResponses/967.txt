Annelids without blood vessels use their nephridia, which are specialized tubes located in each body segment, to remove waste products from their bodies. The nephridia filter waste materials from the coelomic fluid, which is the fluid that fills the body cavity of the annelid, and excrete it as urine or solid waste through specialized openings on the body surface called nephridiopores. This process is called osmoregulation and helps to maintain a balance of chemicals and water within the annelid's body.
