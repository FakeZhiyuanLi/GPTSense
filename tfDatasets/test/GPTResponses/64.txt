A human universal is a feature, behavior, or characteristic that is present in every known human culture or society. These can include things like language, religion, social organization, family structures, emotions, and cultural practices. Universals are often seen as fundamental to the human condition and are believed to have developed early in human history, perhaps as a result of evolutionary adaptations.
