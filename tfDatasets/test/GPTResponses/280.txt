Some distinguishing glacial features are:1. Cirques - bowl-shaped depressions in the mountainside that were carved out by glaciers.2. U-shaped valleys - valleys with steep sides and a flat bottom that were formed by the movement of glaciers.3. Moraines - piles of rock, gravel, and soil that were carried and deposited by glaciers.4. Glacial erratics - large boulders or rocks that were transported far away from their original location by glaciers.5. Glacial striations - scratches or grooves on rocks that were made by glacial movement.6. Glacial lakes - large bodies of water that were formed by melted glacial ice.7. Eskers - long, narrow ridges of gravel and sand that were formed by meltwater flowing beneath glaciers.8. Kames - small, cone-shaped hills of sand and gravel that were left behind by glacial meltwater.9. Drumlins - elongated hills formed by glacial movement and erosion.10. Fjords - deep, narrow inlets of the sea that were formed by glacial erosion of valley walls.
