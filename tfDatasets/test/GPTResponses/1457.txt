A composite system is used in many applications such as in construction, aerospace, automotive, marine, and sports equipment manufacturing. Some examples include:1. Building materials: Composite materials are used in buildings for their resistance to weather, fire, and termites. They are also used in insulation, flooring, roofing, and wall panels.2. Automotive industry: Composite materials are used to manufacture lightweight yet strong car body parts such as hoods, fenders, and doors. They help to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions.3. Aerospace industry: Composite materials are used in the manufacture of aircraft components such as fuselages, wings, and empennages. They make aircraft lighter and more fuel-efficient.4. Sports equipment: Composite materials are used to make lighter, stronger, and more durable sporting equipment such as tennis rackets, golf clubs, and bicycle frames.5. Medical devices: Composite materials are used to manufacture prosthetics, orthotics, and surgical instruments due to their stiffness, strength, and biocompatibility.
