There is not a specific type of wood that can hold four times as much of a load when dried. However, in general, all types of wood become stronger and stiffer when they are dried. This is because the moisture content of the wood reduces, which improves its overall structural properties. Additionally, the density of the wood increases when it is kiln-dried, making it more durable and resistant to bending and breaking under a heavy load.
