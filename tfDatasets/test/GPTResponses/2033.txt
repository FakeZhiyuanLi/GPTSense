The people of Cyprus rely on a combination of groundwater, desalinated water, and treated wastewater for domestic and agricultural supply of water. Groundwater is the main source of water for Cyprus, but it is becoming increasingly depleted due to over-extraction and climate change. To address this issue, the government has invested heavily in desalination plants and wastewater treatment facilities. Desalinated water is used primarily for domestic purposes, while treated wastewater is used for irrigation in agriculture. The use of treated wastewater for irrigation is a sustainable solution to water scarcity in Cyprus, but it requires careful management to avoid contamination of crops and groundwater.
