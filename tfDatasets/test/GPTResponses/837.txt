Historians and researchers have suggested that the real numbers of Soviets wounded during the invasion of Finland may have been closer to a million. This is because the Soviet Union was known for downplaying its casualty figures in official reports and propaganda to maintain their image of strength and control. Additionally, some wounded soldiers may have been left to die or treated in field hospitals, which would also impact the official count.
