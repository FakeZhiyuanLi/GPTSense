Messiaen says that composition with prime numbers was inspired by his interest in mathematics, particularly in the idea of the "sieve of Eratosthenes," a method for identifying prime numbers. He also found inspiration in his study of ancient Greek music, which used a system of tuning based on prime numbers. Additionally, Messiaen believed that prime numbers had a spiritual significance and represented a divine order in the universe.
