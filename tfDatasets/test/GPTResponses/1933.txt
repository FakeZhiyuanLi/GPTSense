Candidate conservation agreements (CCAs) and Safe Harbor Agreements (SHAs) both aim to conserve and protect sensitive species and their habitats. However, they differ in their scope and goals:1. Scope: CCAs focus on protecting species that have not yet been listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), but are at risk of becoming endangered. SHAs, on the other hand, are geared towards species that are already listed under the ESA.2. Goals: CCAs are voluntary agreements between private landowners and government agencies to conserve a species and its habitat in exchange for regulatory certainty. The goal is to prevent the need for listing the species under the ESA, and to provide incentives for private landowners to actively manage habitat for species conservation. SHAs, on the other hand, are designed to encourage private landowners to improve habitat for listed species by providing assurances that if they undertake certain conservation measures, their land will not be subject to further regulatory restrictions.3. Duration: CCAs are typically long-term agreements that can be renegotiated periodically, whereas SHAs are usually short-term agreements with a fixed duration.4. Regulatory context: CCAs are primarily focused on proactive conservation, while SHAs are reactive in nature and provide a means for landowners to alleviate regulatory burdens associated with listed species.Overall, CCAs are often seen as a precursor to an ESA listing, while SHAs are a tool to incentivize private landowners to take conservation actions for already-listed species.
