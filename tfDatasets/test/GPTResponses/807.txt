Ganglia (singular: ganglion) are clusters of nerve cell bodies found in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) outside of the brain and spinal cord. Ganglia play a role in sensory and motor pathways by transmitting information between neurons in the PNS and the central nervous system. They can be found in a variety of organisms, from primitive invertebrates to complex vertebrates such as mammals. Examples of ganglia in humans include the trigeminal ganglion, which mediates sensation in the face, and the sympathetic ganglia, which control involuntary responses like heart rate and digestion.
