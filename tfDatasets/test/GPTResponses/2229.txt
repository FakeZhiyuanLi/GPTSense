Throughout the Middle Ages, the indigenous Estonians made several attempts to overthrow their Danish and German rulers. One of the most significant rebellions was the St. George's Night Uprising, also called the Great Uprising, which occurred in 1343-1345. This rebellion was an attempt by the Estonians to throw off the rule of the Teutonic Order and regain their freedom. The uprising was ultimately unsuccessful, and the Teutonic Order managed to tighten their grip on the region.
