The shape and structure of human cognition is influenced by various factors including genetics, environment, culture, education, and experience. These factors interact with each other and shape the way the brain processes information, forms beliefs, and perceives reality. Some specific processes that shape human cognition include memory, attention, perception, and problem-solving. The connections and neural pathways that form in the brain over time also play an important role in shaping cognitive processes. Additionally, socio-economic factors such as income, social class, and access to resources can influence cognitive development and performance.
