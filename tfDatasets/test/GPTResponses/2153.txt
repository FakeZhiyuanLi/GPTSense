There was no single treaty that gave the House of Savoy control over Italy. Throughout the 19th century, Italy was divided into several smaller states and territories. The House of Savoy played a significant role in the unification of Italy, which was achieved in 1861. The King of Sardinia, Victor Emmanuel II, became the first king of Italy, with the House of Savoy ruling over the new nation.
