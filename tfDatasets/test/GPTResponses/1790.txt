Francis Fukuyama pointed out that the name "war on terror" was a flawed concept because it provided no clear enemy or objective, and it allowed for an unlimited and indefinite use of military force without any measurable outcome or endpoint. He argued that the war on terror should be reframed as a struggle to counter violent extremism and address the root causes of terrorism through political, economic, and social means, rather than relying solely on military force.
