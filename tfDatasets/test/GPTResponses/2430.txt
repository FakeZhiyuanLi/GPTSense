The formation of Zn2Cl is indicated by the presence of zinc ions (Zn2+) and chloride ions (Cl-) in a solution, which can combine to form zinc chloride (ZnCl2). This reaction can be written as:Zn2+ + 2Cl- â†’ ZnCl2The formation of a white precipitate, which is insoluble in water, is also a sign of the formation of Zn2Cl.
