The vacuum state is considered the lowest-energy state of a physical system. It is the state in which there are no excitations or particles present, and all quantum fields are in their ground state. In quantum field theory, the vacuum state is also referred to as the "zero-point energy" or "vacuum fluctuations" due to the fact that even in the absence of particles, the vacuum still contains fluctuating fields with energy.
