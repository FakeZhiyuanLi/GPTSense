The Planck constant implies a fundamental relationship between the energy and frequency of electromagnetic radiation and the particle nature of atoms. It helps us understand the quantization of energy levels in atoms and the physics of small scales. It is also used in quantum mechanics to calculate properties such as orbital energy, momentum, and position.
