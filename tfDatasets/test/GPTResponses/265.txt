There are several types of ice that can form on the surface of a body of water:1. Clear or black ice: This is the most common type of ice that forms on lakes and ponds. It is formed from melted and refrozen snow or rain and is usually smooth and clear.2. White ice: This type of ice is formed from snow that has been compressed and frozen. It is rough and opaque.3. Pack ice: This is a thick sheet of ice that forms on the surface of a large body of water, such as the ocean or a lake. It is formed from freezing seawater or lake water and can be several meters thick.4. Pancake ice: This type of ice is formed when waves cause slushy ice to break up into circular pieces that can resemble pancakes.5. Ice floes: These are large sheets of ice that have broken off from pack ice and float freely on the water's surface. They are often seen in the Arctic and Antarctic regions.
