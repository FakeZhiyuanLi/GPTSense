One factor of lower energy consumption for electric trains could be the use of regenerative braking. Regenerative braking allows the train to recover energy that would otherwise be lost during braking and convert it into electrical energy that can be used to power the train. This results in less energy being required from the external power source, leading to lower energy consumption. Other factors could include the use of lightweight materials, efficient electrical systems, and optimized train schedules to minimize travel time and improve energy efficiency.
