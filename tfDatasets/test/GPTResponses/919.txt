Einstein was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect, which explained the nature of light and how it interacts with matter. This discovery paved the way for the development of electronic devices such as solar panels, photocells, and photoelectric sensors.
