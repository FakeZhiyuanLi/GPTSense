Annelids, such as earthworms and leeches, have a variety of sensors that allow them to detect different stimuli in their environment. These sensors include:1. Chemoreceptors – These are sensitive to chemicals in the environment, allowing annelids to smell and taste things.2. Photoreceptors – These sense changes in light, allowing annelids to detect light/dark cycles and changes in skylight.3. Mechanoreceptors – These detect vibrations and touch, allowing annelids to feel the ground and detect movement around them.4. Thermoreceptors – These detect changes in temperature, allowing annelids to move towards or away from hot or cold environments.5. Magnetic receptors – Some annelids have specialized cells that can detect magnetic fields, enabling them to navigate and orient themselves in their environment.6. Pressure receptors – These detect changes in water pressure, allowing annelids that live in aquatic environments to detect changes in tide and wave patterns.Overall, annelids' sensors enable them to adapt and respond to different environmental factors, helping them to survive and thrive in their habitats.
