The lifecycle of most insects typically begins with eggs being laid by the female insect. The eggs then hatch into larvae, which may go through several stages of growth and development. The larvae then undergo metamorphosis, transforming into pupae, which may also go through several stages of development before emerging as adult insects. The adult insects then mate, laying eggs to begin the lifecycle again.
