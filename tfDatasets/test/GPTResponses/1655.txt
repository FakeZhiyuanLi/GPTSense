There is a device called a commutator that allows a DC motor to rotate in either direction, hence the term "universal". The commutator consists of two half-rings made of a conducting material, typically copper. Attached to the commutator are carbon brushes. When a voltage is applied to the motor, it generates a magnetic field that interacts with the magnetic field produced by the stator. This interaction causes the rotor to begin turning. The carbon brushes make contact with the half-rings of the commutator, which reverses the current flow through the motor as the rotor turns. This change in current direction alternates between the two half-rings, allowing the motor to turn in either direction.
