The later kings of the Rashtrakuta Empire were influenced by Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism. They patronized and encouraged the arts, sciences, and literature, and supported the building of temples, tanks, and other public works. They also maintained diplomatic relations with neighboring kingdoms and empires, such as the Chalukyas, Pallavas, and Gurjara-Pratiharas.
