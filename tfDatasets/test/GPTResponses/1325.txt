There was no civil war in Tibet over succession that led to the collapse of Imperial Tibet. The collapse of Imperial Tibet occurred during the 9th century due to internal conflicts, invasion by neighboring tribes, and the decline of the Tang Dynasty in China, which had strong political and cultural ties with Tibet. The succession of Tibetan rulers was traditionally determined through a system of reincarnation, with the Dalai Lama being the most prominent figure in Tibetan Buddhism. However, the current political situation in Tibet is a topic of debate and controversy.
