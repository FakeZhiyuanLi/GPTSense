The most commonly used interpretation of the rule of law on a larger scale is the principle that all individuals and institutions are subject to and governed by the law, and there is no one above the law. This means that the law is the same for everyone, regardless of their status or position, and no one is immune from prosecution if they violate the law. This interpretation ensures that there is fairness and equality under the law, and it helps maintain order and stability in society.
