Pantheism is the belief or philosophy that God, the universe, and nature are all identical or that God is essentially equivalent to the entirety of the natural world. In this view, there is no separation between Creator and creation, and all aspects of the universe are considered divine. Pantheists often see the natural world as sacred and as an interconnected web of living beings and natural processes.
