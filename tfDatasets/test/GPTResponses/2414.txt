The two available sources of vacuum on a moving airplane are:1. Engine-driven vacuum pump: This type of vacuum system is common in small aircraft and is powered by the engine. It provides vacuum to operate the attitude indicator, heading indicator, and other flight instruments.2. Electric-driven vacuum pump: This type of vacuum system is used in larger aircraft and is powered by an electric motor. It provides vacuum to operate the same types of flight instruments as an engine-driven system. However, because it is not reliant on the engine, it provides a backup system in case of engine or power failure.
