Sociologists like Stuart and Raymond were influenced by Marxist and neo-Marxist theories, which emphasize the importance of class relations and the organization of production in shaping society. They believed that the dominant social classes were able to maintain their power and control through the control of the means of production (such as factories, land, and technology), and that the working class was exploited by the dominant class through their work.Additionally, Stuart and Raymond were interested in understanding the ways in which social structures impacted individual behaviors and identities. They argued that the organization of production influenced not only economic relationships, but also social relationships and cultural beliefs. By studying the social and economic conditions of different classes, they hoped to better understand the ways in which power, inequality, and resistance operated in society.
