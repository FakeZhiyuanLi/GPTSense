Kalinga was a formidable power in the arena of ancient India. Kalinga was a prosperous and powerful kingdom that existed in the eastern region of present-day India, in the areas of Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. It was known for its naval strength, trade, art, and culture. The Kalinga kingdom often engaged in wars with other powerful kingdoms of ancient India, including the Mauryas and the Satavahanas, and managed to remain independent for a long time. However, the bloody Kalinga War with Emperor Ashoka's Mauryan army proved to be disastrous, leading to the loss of thousands of lives and destruction of the kingdom.
