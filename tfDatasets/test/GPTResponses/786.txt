There have been multiple societies throughout history that have used suspension as a form of punishment. Some examples include the Native American Lakota Sioux, who used a punishment known as "thigh rope" in which an individual's ankles were tied together and then hoisted up by a rope attached to their thighs. This would cause the person to hang upside down, suspended in the air, for varying lengths of time.The Maori people of New Zealand also used suspension as a form of punishment. They would suspend an individual in a woven basket called a "turuwhenua" from a tree, leaving them exposed to the elements and insects for several days.In more recent times, suspension has been used as a form of punishment in some prisons and juvenile detention centers. In the United States, for example, some prisons have used a form of suspension known as "the restraint chair" to punish and control inmates. This involves strapping the person into a chair, often for extended periods of time, which can be a psychologically and physically traumatic experience.
