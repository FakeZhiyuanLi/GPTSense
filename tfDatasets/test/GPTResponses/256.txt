power and authority are unevenly distributed across different levels of government in a federal system. This means that one level of government, usually the central government, has more power and authority than the others. Asymmetric federalism can exist for a variety of reasons, such as historical, political, or economic considerations. For example, some regions or provinces may have more autonomy and control over certain policy areas while others do not, leading to an imbalance of power between different regions or provinces.
