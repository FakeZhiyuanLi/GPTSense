Hinduism has many gods and goddesses worshipped in various forms and manifestations, and followers may choose to worship one or more of these deities based on their personal beliefs and preferences.

Additionally, there are also atheists and agnostics within the Hindu community who do not believe in a divine being. Therefore, the range of belief in God in Hinduism is vast and varies widely among individuals and sects.
