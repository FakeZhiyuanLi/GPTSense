Frederick Mark Gedicks believed that unjust laws were not really laws because they did not meet the moral standards of society and were therefore void. He argued that laws should be evaluated based on their alignment with fundamental moral principles, rather than simply being accepted because they were written down by those in authority. To Gedicks, unjust laws were not legitimate laws because they violated these moral principles, and individuals had a duty to disobey or challenge them.
