Turkish Cypriots were prevented from participating in the political and economic life of the island of Cyprus for many years, particularly after the inter-communal violence and separation of Greek and Turkish Cypriots in 1974. They were faced with social, economic, and political isolation, with limited access to employment, housing, education, and healthcare. They also faced restrictions on mobility, with limited opportunities to travel, trade, or communicate with the outside world.
