Kleptocracy is a type of government or system of rule where the rulers or those in power use their position to exploit and steal resources or wealth from the people they govern. They use their political power to benefit themselves and their associates, often at the expense of the broader population. In a kleptocracy, corruption and the pursuit of personal gain become the primary motives of those in charge, while the welfare of the general public is neglected or ignored.
