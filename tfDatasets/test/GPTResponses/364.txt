Von Neumann did not specifically suggest a new method of linear programming, but he made significant contributions to the development of the simplex algorithm, which is a widely used method for solving linear programming problems. The simplex algorithm was first proposed by George Dantzig in the 1940s, and Von Neumann's work helped to formalize and improve the algorithm by developing the theory behind it.
