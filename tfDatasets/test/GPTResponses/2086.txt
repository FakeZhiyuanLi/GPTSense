Simon Reynolds described the era of post-punk as a match for the explosion of creative energy and experimentation that occurred in the early days of rock and roll in the 1950s. He argued that just as the birth of rock and roll saw a wave of artists pushing the boundaries of what was possible with music, so too did the post-punk era see a surge of innovation and experimentation, giving rise to a wealth of groundbreaking and influential music.
