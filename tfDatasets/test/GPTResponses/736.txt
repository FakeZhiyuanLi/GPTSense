Segments of an annelid share several characteristics including being ring-shaped, containing setae or bristles for movement, having a closed circulatory system, possessing a digestive tract, and having a nervous system consisting of a ventral nerve cord with ganglia in each segment. Additionally, many annelids have a coelom, or body cavity, that is divided by septa into distinct compartments within each segment.
