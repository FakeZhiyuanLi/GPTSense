The Endangered Species Act (ESA) had a significant impact on wildlife commerce. The ESA prohibits any trade or commerce involving endangered species, their parts or products without a permit. It also prohibits the trafficking of species listed as threatened or endangered under the Act.The ESA creates a system of permits and penalties that regulate the import, export, and trade of endangered species. It also prohibits the trade in certain products derived from endangered species, such as ivory, rhino horns, and some types of coral.As a result of the ESA, the trade in endangered species has been significantly reduced, and many endangered species have been protected from extinction. The ESA has also prompted many countries to create their own laws to protect endangered species, limiting the trade and demand for these animals and their products.Overall, the ESA has been a significant tool in protecting endangered species and their habitats, and has had a positive impact on wildlife commerce by reducing illegal and harmful trade.
