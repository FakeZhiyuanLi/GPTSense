The Guinea-Bissau Civil War was a conflict that occurred in the West African country of Guinea-Bissau between 1998 and 1999. Several factors contributed to the escalation of the conflict, including:1. Political instability and corruption: Guinea-Bissau had experienced numerous coups and political instability since gaining independence from Portugal in 1973. The country was also plagued by corruption, which resulted in a lack of trust in the government among the population.2. Drug trafficking: Guinea-Bissau is a major transit point for drug trafficking between South America and Europe. Drug traffickers often bribe government officials and use their influence to avoid arrest, which further erodes public faith in the government.3. Ethnic tensions: The conflict was also fuelled by long-standing ethnic tensions between the Balanta, who were perceived as the dominant group, and other groups such as the Fulas.4. Military interference in politics: The military has traditionally played a large role in Guinea-Bissau's politics, with several coups and attempted coups occurring in the past. This interference has destabilized the country and contributed to the conflict.5. Economic grievances: Guinea-Bissau is one of the poorest countries in the world, with high levels of unemployment and poverty. The population has become increasingly disillusioned with the government's inability to provide basic services and economic opportunities, which has exacerbated the conflict.
