The smallness of the Planck constant, h, shows that at very small scales, like the subatomic scale, the behavior of particles is quantized, meaning that energy, momentum, and other physical quantities can only take on discrete values. It also shows that the uncertainty principle, which states that the more precisely we know one property of a particle, like its position, the less precisely we can know another property, like its momentum, becomes more pronounced at smaller scales. The smallness of h is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics, which is the foundation of modern physics.
