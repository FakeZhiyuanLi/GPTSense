The area of the country that has a similar dialect to Miami is South Florida, particularly the cities of Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach. This region has a similar mix of Spanish and English influences in its language, as well as a similar rhythm and intonation. However, it should be noted that accents and dialects can vary greatly even within a relatively small area, so not all speakers in South Florida will sound exactly like those in Miami.
