The scarcity of water and fresh produce in Rajasthan had a major impact on the traditional cuisine. The lack of vegetables led the people to rely heavily on dried lentils, beans, and legumes, which could be stored for long periods of time. This gave rise to the use of a lot of spices and herbs to add flavor and complexity to the dishes.Additionally, the arid climate of Rajasthan made it difficult to cultivate crops, leading to a reliance on meat dishes made with lamb, chicken, and fish. The use of yogurt and buttermilk in many dishes is also a result of the limited access to fresh produce.Finally, the influence of the Marwari community, who are strict vegetarians, has also contributed to the unique flavors and techniques used in Rajasthani cooking. Many Rajasthani dishes, such as dal baati churma and gatte ki sabzi, are vegetarian and make use of locally available ingredients such as gram flour and millet.
