VHS tapes store their information in the form of analog signals on magnetic tape. The tape is coated with a magnetic oxide that can be magnetized in a specific pattern by recording an analog video signal onto it. The playback device reads the magnetized pattern and converts it back into the analog video signal for display on a TV screen.
