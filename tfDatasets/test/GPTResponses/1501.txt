People who have received the TB vaccination may still test positive for TB on the Mantoux test. This is because the TB vaccine (BCG) contains a weakened form of the TB bacteria and can cause a reaction on the Mantoux test. Therefore, for people who have received the TB vaccine, the Mantoux test may need to be interpreted differently, and further diagnostic tests may be necessary to confirm if the person has TB infection.
