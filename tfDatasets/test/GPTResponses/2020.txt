An insect's abdomen also has a ventral sternum, which is another hardened plate-like structure. Between the tergum and sternum, there is a softer, more flexible cuticle that allows the abdomen to expand and contract during breathing or digestion. The abdominal segments also contain various internal organs, such as the digestive, reproductive, and excretory systems.
