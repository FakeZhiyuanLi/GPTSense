The value that describes the permittivity of the dielectric in an ideal model of a capacitor is represented by the symbol ε (epsilon), also known as the electric permittivity or absolute permittivity. It is a measure of a material's ability to store electrical energy in an electric field. The value of ε depends on the type of dielectric material used between the two plates of the capacitor.
