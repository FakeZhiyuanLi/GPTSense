A federation is typically formed when a group of states or organizations agree to join together under a central government while retaining some degree of autonomy or independent power. The specific timeline or process for forming a federation can vary depending on the context and the agreement of the participating parties. For example, the United States was formed as a federal republic in 1787 through the ratification of the Constitution by the original 13 states, while the European Union evolved gradually over several decades through various treaties and agreements among its member states.
