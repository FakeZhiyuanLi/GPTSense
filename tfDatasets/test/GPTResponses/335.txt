Bristlecone pine trees can have growth ring proportions that are not determined solely by their rate of growth. These trees can have widely spaced growth rings or missing rings altogether, which can be caused by environmental factors such as drought, fire, or cold temperatures. Additionally, these trees can live for thousands of years, which can also affect the spacing and thickness of their growth rings.
