The unit cell volume is calculated by multiplying the lengths of the three edges of the unit cell together since it is a parallelepiped. The formula is:V = a x b x cwhere:V = unit cell volumea = length of edge 1b = length of edge 2c = length of edge 3This formula assumes that the unit cell is a rectangular prism with edges that are perpendicular to each other. For other types of unit cells, the formula may be different, but the principle remains the same â€“ the unit cell volume is the product of the lengths of its edges.
