A displacement current can flow in a capacitor when there is a changing electric field or a time-varying voltage applied across its plates. The magnitude of the displacement current is proportional to the rate of change of the electric field and the capacitance of the capacitor. As the electric field changes, the free charges on the plates of the capacitor experience a force, resulting in the flow of the displacement current, even though there is no actual flow of charge.
