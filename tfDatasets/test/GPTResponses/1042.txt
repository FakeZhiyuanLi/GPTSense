Earthworms prefer to live in soil that is moist and rich in organic matter, such as compost piles, garden beds, and fields. They are also commonly found in forest floors where there is a thick layer of decaying organic matter. On the surface, earthworms often burrow and move through soil to find food and shelter from predators. They are particularly sensitive to changes in moisture levels and temperature, and prefer stable conditions to thrive.
