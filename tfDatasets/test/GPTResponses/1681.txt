According to reports, Muammar Gaddafi's health care policies helped to minimize diseases such as tuberculosis, measles, and rubella. The World Health Organization (WHO) recognized Libya as having one of the best health care systems in Africa. Gaddafi's government invested heavily in health and education, providing free health care to all citizens, and building new hospitals and clinics throughout the country. This investment in health care resulted in a significant reduction in the incidence of infectious diseases and increased life expectancy in Libya.
