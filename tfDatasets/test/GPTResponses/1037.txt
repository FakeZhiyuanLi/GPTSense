The first scientific study of how earthworms help soil was conducted by Charles Darwin in his book "The Formation of Vegetable Mould Through the Action of Worms with Observations on their Habits" published in 1881. In this book, Darwin observed and experimented with earthworms and their impact on soil fertility, structure and texture. He documented how earthworms play a vital role in recycling organic matter, improving soil aeration and drainage, and enhancing nutrient availability for plants. Darwin's work was groundbreaking in its recognition of the ecological significance of earthworms and their contribution to soil health.
