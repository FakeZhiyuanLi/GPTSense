The Sicilian Wars, a series of conflicts between various powers seeking control over the island of Sicily, ended with the Peace of Callias in 405 BCE. This treaty recognized the control of Syracuse over the eastern half of Sicily, while Carthage retained the western half. The wars ended primarily due to the exhaustion of the combatants and the realization that continued conflict would only lead to further losses and instability. Additionally, the rise of new regional powers, such as Athens and Sparta, in the wake of the Peloponnesian War shifted the focus of major powers away from Sicily.
