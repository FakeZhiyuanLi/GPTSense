There are several signs that further price reductions are likely in coming years:1. Increased competition: if new players enter the market, or existing players ramp up their marketing efforts, prices are likely to come down in response.2. Increased supply: if there is a surplus of a product, prices are likely to come down until the excess supply is used up.3. Advances in technology: as technology improves, it often becomes cheaper to produce goods and services, which can lead to price reductions.4. Changes in consumer preferences: if consumers begin to prefer cheaper or more affordable goods and services, companies may adjust their prices downward to meet this demand.5. Economic downturns: during times of economic recession or slowdown, businesses may reduce their prices to stimulate demand and maintain their market share.
