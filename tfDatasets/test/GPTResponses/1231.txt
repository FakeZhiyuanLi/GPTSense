In an ideal model of a capacitor, the size of the plates is assumed to be infinite. This is because the capacitance of a capacitor is directly proportional to the area of its plates, and by assuming that the plates are infinite, the capacitance can be modeled as a constant value. In reality, the size of the plates is limited by practical constraints, such as manufacturing technology and cost, and the capacitance is also affected by the distance between the plates and the dielectric material between them.
