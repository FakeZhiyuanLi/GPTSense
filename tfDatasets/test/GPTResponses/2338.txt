BRT stands for Bus Rapid Transit. It is a high-capacity bus system that is designed to operate with many of the characteristics of a light rail or metro system but without the high cost usually associated with building such systems. BRT systems provide fast, efficient, and reliable public transportation with dedicated bus lanes, exclusive transitways or bus-only streets, innovative intersection designs, and advanced fare collection systems. These systems can provide a high level of service, comfort, and convenience to commuters, making them an attractive alternative to driving.
