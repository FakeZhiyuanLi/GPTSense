The subdivision of anthropology that concerns itself with the long-term development of the human organism is called biological or physical anthropology. It studies the biological and physiological evolution of the human species, including its genetic makeup, its physical adaptations, and its interaction with its environment over time. Biological anthropology combines knowledge and methodologies from different fields of science, such as biology, genetics, anatomy, and paleontology, to provide a comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary history and diversity of human beings.
