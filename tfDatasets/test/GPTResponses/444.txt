The substandard product that was used in LD manufacturing that caused "laser rot" was the adhesive layer between the two sides of the disc, which deteriorated over time and caused discoloration, distortion, and eventually made the disc unplayable. This issue affected the early CDs and LDs produced in the 1980s and early 1990s.
