many historians refer to as the "Age of Empires" or the "Age of Exploration". Beginning in the 15th century and continuing throughout the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, European powers began to establish colonies and territories around the world. This expansion of territory and influence was driven by several factors, including a desire for new markets and resources, competition between nation-states, and religious and ideological motivations.One of the key drivers of international trade during this period was the search for new markets and resources. European powers were growing rapidly, and they needed new sources of raw materials to fuel their economies. In addition, they were looking to expand their markets for exports, particularly manufactured goods. Meanwhile, many of the territories they colonized were rich in natural resources, such as gold, silver, and agricultural products like tobacco, coffee, and sugar.Another key factor driving international trade was competition between nation-states. European powers were engaged in intense competition for power and prestige, and colonialism was seen as a way to gain an edge over rivals. This led to the establishment of colonial empires in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The rivalry between European powers would lead to numerous conflicts, including wars and trade disputes, which would shape the geopolitics of the world for centuries to come.Finally, religious and ideological motives also played a role in the expansion of international trade. Many European powers saw themselves as defenders of Christianity and sought to spread their religion to new territories. Others believed in the superiority of their culture and sought to export it to other parts of the world. This led to the establishment of schools, hospitals, and other institutions in colonies that would help spread European values and ideas.Overall, the expansion of international trade through the empire was the result of a complex set of motivations and factors, driven by the economic, political, and cultural changes of the age.
