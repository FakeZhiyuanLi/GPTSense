Most computers have been able to boot from USB mass storage devices since the early to mid-2000s when BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) firmware began to support USB booting. However, some older computers may not have this capability or may require a firmware update to enable USB booting. Additionally, the specific configuration and settings of the computer may need to be adjusted to allow for USB booting.
