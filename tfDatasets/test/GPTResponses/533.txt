Merge sort is an efficient, general-purpose, divide-and-conquer algorithm that sorts an array or list of elements by dividing it into two halves, sorting each half separately and then merging the sorted halves until the entire list is sorted. The key idea behind the merge sort algorithm is to repeatedly divide the list in half until each sublist consists of only one element. Then, the merge operation merges adjacent pairs of sublists until there is only one final sorted list.The merge sort algorithm accomplishes this by recursively dividing the list in halves until one element is left (the base case), then using the merge operation to combine these sorted sublists into a larger, sorted sublist. The merge operation operates by iterating through the two sorted sublists and comparing the first elements of each. The smaller element is then removed from its sublist and added to the final, merged sublist. This process continues until both sublists are empty, at which point the merged sublist is fully sorted.The time complexity of the merge sort algorithm is O(n*log n), which is faster than many other popular sorting algorithms, including bubble sort and insertion sort. Additionally, merge sort is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that equal elements retain their relative order within the sorted list.
