In Avicenna's "Floating Man," the essence of a person could not be their material body, as the experiment is designed to imagine a person suspended in mid-air with their senses and limbs cut off. The essence of the person is explored through introspection and reason independent of sensory input, leading to the conclusion that the human essence is the mind or soul, which is separate from the body.
