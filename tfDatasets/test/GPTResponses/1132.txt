When an electric field develops across the dielectric of a capacitor, charges accumulate on each plate of the capacitor according to the following process:1. As the electric field is applied to the dielectric, electrons in the dielectric start to polarize and move towards the positive plate of the capacitor, leaving behind positively charged ions.2. This process creates an excess of negative charges on the surface of the dielectric facing the positive plate of the capacitor.3. The excess negative charges repel electrons in the positive plate of the capacitor, causing some of them to move towards the negative plate of the capacitor.4. The movement of electrons towards the negative plate leaves behind a deficiency of electrons, creating a positive charge on the surface of the positive plate facing the dielectric.5. Eventually, the accumulation of charges on each plate reaches a point where the electric field across the dielectric is balanced by the opposing charges on each plate, and the capacitor reaches a state of equilibrium.6. The magnitude of the charge on each plate depends on the capacitance of the capacitor and the voltage applied across the dielectric.
