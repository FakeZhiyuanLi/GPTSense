When a solution of metallic zinc is cooled in molten ZnCl2, a layer of solid zinc is formed on the surface due to the reduction of Zn2+ ions to metallic zinc by the electrons from the metallic zinc. This layer acts as a protective coating preventing further reaction between the metallic zinc and the molten ZnCl2.
