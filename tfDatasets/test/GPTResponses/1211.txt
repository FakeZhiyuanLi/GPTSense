Comcast's practice of bundling cable TV, internet, and phone services is often criticized as a monopolistic practice. This practice involves offering customers a discounted price for signing up for all three services together, which can discourage customers from choosing competitors for individual services. Additionally, Comcast's ownership of NBCUniversal has raised concerns about vertical integration and potential antitrust violations.
