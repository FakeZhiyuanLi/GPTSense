Hinduism is considered a major world religion and is the third largest religion in the world after Christianity and Islam. It is often referred to as Sanatana Dharma, which means "eternal religion" or "eternal way of living" and is practiced primarily in India and Nepal but also has followers throughout the world. Hinduism is a complex and diverse religion, encompassing many beliefs, rituals, and practices, and there is no one single authority or doctrine that defines it. It is characterized by a belief in a single, ultimate reality, called Brahman, which manifests itself in many different forms and is worshiped as different deities. The religion also emphasizes the concepts of karma, dharma, and moksha, or the cyclical nature of life and the pursuit of liberation from this cycle.
