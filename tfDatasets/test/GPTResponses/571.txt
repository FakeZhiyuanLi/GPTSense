According to Government Phonology, differences in surface realizations are caused by the interaction of two factors: prosodic structure and government relations.Prosodic structure refers to the grouping of sounds into syllables, feet, and phrases. In Government Phonology, these groupings are determined by a set of principles that prioritize the distribution of stress and the avoidance of certain sound combinations.Government relations, on the other hand, refer to the way sounds are governed by other sounds within a given prosodic structure. These relations are also determined by a set of principles that specify which sounds are allowed to appear together and how they interact.Together, these two factors create a complex system that accounts for the surface realizations of different types of linguistic structures, such as words, phrases, and sentences. The specific rules governing prosodic structure and government relations vary by language, which accounts for the many differences in surface realizations seen across different languages.
