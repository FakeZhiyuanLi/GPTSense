India accounts for a significant portion of the world's child labor. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), India has the largest number of child laborers in the world, with an estimated 10.1 million children aged 5-14 engaged in work. This represents approximately 20% of the global child labor force. However, it is important to note that the Indian government has taken steps to reduce child labor through various laws and initiatives.
