The annual average direct solar irradiation varies based on location and time of year, and can range from around 2,000 to 6,000 watt-hours per square meter per day. However, the specific value would depend on the latitude, longitude, altitude, and local climate of the area being considered. For example, the annual average direct solar irradiation in Phoenix, Arizona is about 6,000 watt-hours per square meter per day, while in Portland, Oregon it is around 3,000 watt-hours per square meter per day.
