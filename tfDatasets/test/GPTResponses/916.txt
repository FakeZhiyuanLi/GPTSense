Prior to the industrial revolution, children worked in various fields such as agriculture, fishing, and domestic labor. They were also employed in cottage industries like weaving and spinning, and some worked as apprentices or in family businesses. Additionally, children from wealthy families were often educated at home or in private schools. However, child labor was prevalent and children as young as seven or eight years old often worked long hours in dangerous conditions in mines or factories.
