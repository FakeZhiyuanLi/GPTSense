The word "insect" comes from the Latin word "insectum" meaning "cut into sections" or "divided into segments". This name was given to the group of animals because of their segmented bodies with three distinct body parts: the head, thorax, and abdomen. It is not clear who specifically coined the term, but it has been in use for centuries.
