There are several types of eukaryotes that have a large amount of non-coding DNA, including:1. Plants: Many plant species have significantly larger genomes than animals, often due to the presence of repetitive DNA sequences.2. Fungi: Some fungi have large genomes with extensive non-coding regions.3. Protists: Certain types of protists, such as amoebas and paramecia, have large amounts of non-coding DNA.4. Insects: Some insect species have genomes with a high proportion of non-coding DNA.5. Vertebrates: Certain vertebrates, such as salamanders and lungfish, have genomes with a large amount of non-coding DNA.
