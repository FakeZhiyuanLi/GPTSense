There is no historical record of a civilization that specifically founded Galician cities. Galicia, located in modern-day northwestern Spain, has been inhabited by various groups throughout history, including Celts, Romans, Visigoths, and Moors. Each of these groups likely contributed to the founding and development of cities in the region. Some of the earliest recorded cities in Galicia were Roman settlements, such as Braga (known as Bracara Augusta in Roman times) and Lugo (known as Lucus Augusti).
