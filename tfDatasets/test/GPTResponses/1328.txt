One of the most important aging factors in capacitors is the gradual loss of capacitance due to various internal mechanisms such as dielectric absorption, dielectric breakdown, and changes in the electrical properties of the materials used in the construction of the capacitor. This results in a decrease in the overall performance of the capacitor over time, which can eventually lead to its failure. Other aging factors include the effects of temperature, humidity, and voltage stress on the capacitor's internal components.
