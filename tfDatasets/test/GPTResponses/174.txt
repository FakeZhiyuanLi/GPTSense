The exact timeframe of the region under Tibetan Empire and Chinese rule varies depending on the specific regions.The Tibetan Empire, also known as the Empire of the Great Snow Land, was a Buddhist empire that originated in the Tibetan Plateau in the 7th century and lasted until the 9th century. At its peak, the empire extended to parts of modern-day India, Nepal, Bhutan, and China.Chinese rule over Tibet began in the 13th century under the Yuan dynasty. Control over Tibet fluctuated between different Chinese dynasties until the 18th century when the Qing dynasty established direct rule over Tibet. The Qing dynasty's rule over Tibet continued until the early 20th century when Tibet declared independence.Since then, Tibet has been under Chinese rule, with the Chinese government claiming that Tibet has always been a part of China. However, Tibetans argue that their region was an independent country and not a part of China historically.
