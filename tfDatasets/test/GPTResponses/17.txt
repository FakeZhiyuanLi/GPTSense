According to Fermat's Little Theorem, if p is a prime number other than 2 or 5, then 1/p will always be a repeating decimal with a period equal to p-1. This means that the decimal representation of 1/p will repeat the same sequence of digits after the decimal point every p-1 digits. For example, if p=7, then 1/7 = 0.142857142857142857... where the sequence 142857 repeats every 6 digits.
