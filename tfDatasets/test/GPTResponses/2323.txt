QCD stands for Quantum Chromodynamics, which is a theory that describes the strong interaction between elementary particles called quarks and gluons. It is a fundamental theory of particle physics and is part of the standard model of particle physics. QCD plays a crucial role in understanding the structure of matter, particularly the behavior of protons and neutrons in atomic nuclei.
