The founding of the capital refers to the establishment of a new capital city for a country or region. The event that precedes this may vary depending on the specific case. In the United States, for example, the founding of the capital in Washington D.C. was preceded by the passage of the Residence Act in 1790 which authorized the creation of a new capital on the Potomac River. In other cases, the founding of a new capital may be the result of a shift in political power, a change in the country's borders, or the need for a more centrally located capital for administrative purposes.
