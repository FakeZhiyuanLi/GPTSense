The process that replaces tissue damaged by TB is called fibrosis, where fibrous tissue replaces the damaged or dead lung tissue. This process aims to prevent the spread of the bacteria to other parts of the lungs or the body. Over time, the fibrotic tissue may also become calcified, forming small nodules or scars, which can be seen on imaging studies. However, in severe cases of TB, the fibrosis may progress to lung dysfunction and chronic respiratory disease.
