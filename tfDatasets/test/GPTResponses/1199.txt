High speed is usually only supported by devices or systems that have high-speed interfaces or components, such as high-speed internet connections, USB 3.0 or Thunderbolt ports, and SSDs. These devices or systems are designed to operate at higher speeds than normal, providing faster data transfer rates, faster processing times, and overall better performance. However, in order to take advantage of high-speed capabilities, both the source and the destination devices or systems must support the same level of speed.
