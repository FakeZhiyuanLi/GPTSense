Guam, being located close to Anatahan, a volcanic island, would have to worry about potential volcanic activity such as lava flows, ashfall, and possible volcanic explosions. Anatahan has been an active volcano since 2003, and the surrounding area would be susceptible to hazards. Guam's government closely monitors volcanic activity in the region and keeps residents informed of any potential threats. Additionally, the island may also have to worry about potential tsunamis caused by a volcanic eruption or other geological events.
