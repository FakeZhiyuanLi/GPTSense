The main practical difficulty in determining n is the lack of information or data available for analysis. Without sufficient data, it can be challenging to estimate the size of a population accurately. Moreover, even if there is some data available, it may not be representative of the entire population, leading to biased or incorrect estimations. Additionally, determining n can become more difficult when dealing with complex or dynamic populations that constantly change over time.
