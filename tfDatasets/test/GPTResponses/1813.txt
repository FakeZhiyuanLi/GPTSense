No Wave was a music and art movement that emerged in New York City in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The term "No Wave" was coined by artist Lydia Lunch and referred to the experimental and non-commercial nature of the music. It was characterized by its discordant, dissonant and aggressive sound, often using unconventional instruments and approaches to traditional song structures. No Wave artists rejected the conventions of mainstream rock and punk, seeking to create something new and challenging. Notable No Wave bands include DNA, Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, and James Chance and the Contortions. The movement also encompassed other avant-garde art forms, such as visual art and performance art.
