Vacuum fluctuation is a temporary change in the amount of energy in a point in space, caused by the spontaneous creation and annihilation of virtual particles. These particles appear out of nowhere for an extremely short period of time and then disappear, obeying the laws of quantum mechanics. Vacuum fluctuations are a manifestation of the uncertainty principle, which states that the more precisely the position of a particle is known, the less precisely its velocity is known, and vice versa. They play a vital role in many areas of physics, including quantum field theory, cosmology, and the study of black holes.
