The blood-brain barrier is primarily made up of specialized cells called endothelial cells that line the walls of the brain's blood vessels, as well as supporting cells called astrocytes. These cells work together to tightly regulate the flow of substances in and out of the brain, protecting it from potentially harmful agents while allowing essential nutrients and oxygen to pass through. Additionally, there are other cell types and molecules that contribute to the barrier's function, including pericytes, microglia, and tight junction proteins.
