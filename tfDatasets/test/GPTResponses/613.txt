There is no one answer to this question as the Muslim invaders had different policies and practices in the regions they conquered. Some Muslim rulers allowed religious freedom for non-Muslims, while others imposed strict Islamic laws and converted the population by force. In some cases, the invaders appropriated the architecture, arts, and administrative systems of the conquered territories, while in other cases, they destroyed them. It is essential to note that generalizations about Muslims as invaders are deeply problematic and can perpetuate harmful stereotypes.
