The Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) was designed to allow easy transfer of media files between portable devices and computers. It was created as a replacement for the older USB Mass Storage protocol, which did not provide a standardized way to manage media files on portable devices. MTP allows devices to communicate more efficiently and securely, with features like content protection, metadata exchange, and the ability to display and manage files and folders on the device itself. It also addresses issues with compatibility between different operating systems and file systems, allowing for seamless transfer of media files between devices regardless of their file format or storage method.
