Electromagnetic fields obey Maxwell's equations, which describe the behavior of electric and magnetic fields and their interactions with charges and currents. These equations govern the behavior of electromagnetic waves, including light, radio waves, and microwaves. They also describe many fundamental phenomena in electromagnetism, such as electromagnetic induction, electric and magnetic dipole moments, and the propagation of electromagnetic waves in different media.
