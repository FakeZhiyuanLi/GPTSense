When a defensive penalty is committed in their own end zone, the ball is placed at the one-yard line of the defending team, and the offensive team is awarded an automatic first down. This is known as a defensive pass interference penalty. If the defending team commits any other defensive penalty in their own end zone resulting in a safety, the ball is placed at the 20-yard line for the subsequent kickoff.
