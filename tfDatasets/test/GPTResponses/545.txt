One solution that was developed to address slow use of random numbers is the use of pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs). PRNGs use a deterministic algorithm to generate a sequence of seemingly random numbers. While they are not truly random, they are statistically random enough for most applications and have significantly faster performance than true random number generators. Additionally, some applications may use a combination of both true random numbers and PRNGs to ensure sufficient randomness and efficient use of resources.
