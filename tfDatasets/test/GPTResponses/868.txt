A phonetic indicator can be located on either side of a written word, depending on the writing system and language in question. Some languages, such as Mandarin Chinese, place phonetic indicators (also called phonetic radicals or phonetic components) on the left side of a character to indicate the sound of the entire character. Other languages may place phonetic indicators on the right side or even in the middle of the word.
