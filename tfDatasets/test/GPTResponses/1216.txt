The goal of USB (Universal Serial Bus) was to create a standard connector and protocol for connecting devices to computers. This allowed for easy plug-and-play functionality, faster data transfer rates, and the ability to power devices directly from the computer. The ultimate goal was to simplify connectivity between devices and computers, reducing the need for multiple connectors and cables.
