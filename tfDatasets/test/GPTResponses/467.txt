Originally, the golf club called the "wood" was made from a type of hardwood known as persimmon wood. This type of wood was known for its strength, durability, and uniformity, which made it ideal for use in making golf clubs. However, with advancements in technology and materials, most golf clubs made today are made from metal or composite materials.
