Each greater level of assembly generally includes a larger and more complex combination of parts, components, and subsystems. For example:1. Component level assembly: Individual parts or components are assembled to create a functional unit, such as a microchip or a resistor.2. Subassembly level assembly: Multiple components or subsystems are combined to form a larger assembly, such as a circuit board or a steering system.3. Intermediate level assembly: Multiple subassemblies are combined to create larger mechanical, electrical, or electronic systems, such as an engine or a computer.4. Final assembly: All intermediate-level assemblies are combined to create a complete product or system, such as a car or an airplane.
