Yes, many mathematicians were amazed by von Neumann's contributions to the field of mathematics. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century, and his work in fields such as game theory, computer science, and quantum mechanics had a profound impact on the development of these areas of study. His pioneering work on the theory of operator algebras, for example, helped establish the foundations of modern functional analysis, and his contributions to the development of the computer helped pave the way for the digital age. As such, von Neumann is still widely celebrated by mathematicians and scholars around the world.
