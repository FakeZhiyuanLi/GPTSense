Wood can be engineered into a variety of building materials, including:1. Mass Timber: A type of engineered wood used for constructing high-rise buildings.2. Plywood: A form of engineered wood made from thin layers of wood veneer.3. Laminated Veneer Lumber (LVL): LVL is made by bonding multiple layers of thin wood veneers together using adhesives.4. Oriented Strand Board (OSB): OSB is an engineered wood panel that is made from strands or flakes of wood, which are bonded together with resin.5. Cross Laminated Timber (CLT): Cross-laminated timber is made by layering several panels of wood crosswise and bonding them together with adhesives.6. Glulam: Glulam is short for glued laminated timber, made by gluing together multiple layers of wood to create large and strong structural beams.7. Wood-Plastic Composites (WPCs): A combination of wood fibers and plastics, WPCs are used to create decking, fencing, and other outdoor components.
