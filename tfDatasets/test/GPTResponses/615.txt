After the introduction of Islam, the use of fired clay bricks became a widely used construction material. These bricks were produced by firing natural clay, which was readily available in many regions of the Muslim world. The use of fired clay bricks allowed for greater uniformity in size and shape, as well as increased durability and resistance to weathering. This made them ideal for use in the construction of mosques, palaces, and other monumental buildings.
