Children have historically been employed in various industries in Switzerland, but child labor has been prohibited since 1877. Today, children are not allowed to work below the age of 15, with some exceptions for certain apprenticeships and artistic performances. Therefore, child labor is not a significant issue in Switzerland compared to some other countries.
