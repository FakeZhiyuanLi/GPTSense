Yes, according to the Christian faith, Jesus willingly sacrificed himself without fighting because he believed in God's plan for humanity and wanted to offer himself as a living sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins. He was arrested, tried, and crucified without putting up any resistance, even though he could have called upon angels to save him. Jesus' nonviolent sacrifice is a central tenet of the Christian faith and is considered to be a supreme act of love and selflessness.
