After the decline of post-punk in the late 1980s, several new music genres emerged in its aftermath. Some of the most significant ones include:1. New Wave: this was a movement of pop-oriented music that emerged in the late 1970s and influenced by punk music. It became mainstream in the early 1980s.2. Goth Rock: this was a darker, more melancholic version of post-punk that emerged in the late 1970s and was characterized by its use of introspective lyrics and heavy use of synthesizers.3. Industrial Rock: This genre evolved out of industrial music which drew influences from avant-garde genres such as Krautrock, experimental music, and noise rock.4. Alternative Rock: This term was coined in the early 90s to describe the non-mainstream rock music that emerged in the aftermath of the post-punk era.5. Emo: This sub-genre of alternative rock emerged in the 90s, characterized by its introspective and emotional lyrical content, and its use of melodic and punk rock-inspired instrumentation.
