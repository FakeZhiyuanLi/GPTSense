The Patriot Act expanded the government's ability to investigate, monitor, and detain immigrants suspected of terrorism or terrorism-related activities. It allowed for the indefinite detention of non-citizen immigrants, increased surveillance of non-citizen immigrants, and expanded the government's ability to share information across agencies regarding immigrants. It also made it easier for the government to deport immigrants, even those who are not involved in terrorism, by lowering the evidentiary standard required to deport them.
