Setae are a type of sensory bristle or hair found on the bodies of many invertebrate animals such as earthworms, spiders, and some insects. They are typically slender and pointed, and are used for a variety of functions including sensing touch, smell, and taste detecting vibrations and sound and aiding in movement and stability. Setae may be arranged in various patterns on an animal's body, and their number, shape, and size can vary greatly depending on the species and its adaptation to its environment.
