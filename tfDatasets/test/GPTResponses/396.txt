The term "cultural studies" was first coined by Richard Hoggart in the UK in the 1950s. However, it was Stuart Hall, who was a Jamaican-born cultural theorist, who introduced and popularized cultural studies in the United States in the 1970s as a way to examine the connections between culture, power, and identity.
