Pakistan attempted to remove the Taliban and Al-Qaeda from the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) which are located in the northwest region of the country. The FATA borders Afghanistan and has been a major hub for militant activity and terrorism. The Pakistani military, with support from the United States, launched several operations in the FATA, including Operation Zarb-e-Azb and Operation Radd-ul-Fasaad, to eliminate militant groups such as the Taliban and Al-Qaeda.
