Guam was ceded to the United States by the Kingdom of Spain in 1898 as part of the Treaty of Paris following the Spanish-American War. The war was fought between the US and Spain over Spain's colonial empire, which included Guam along with Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines. With their victory in the war, the US gained control over these territories and officially began its imperialist expansion.
