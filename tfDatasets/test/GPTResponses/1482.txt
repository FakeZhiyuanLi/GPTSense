The type of cells that gather around infected macrophages in a person infected with TB are usually T cells and macrophages themselves. These cells form a structure called granuloma, which is a cluster of immune cells that surrounds the infected macrophages to prevent the bacteria from spreading to other parts of the body. Within the granuloma, the infected macrophages are destroyed and killed by other immune cells, and the bacteria are enclosed in a capsule-like structure. However, in some cases, the bacteria can still survive within the granuloma and cause reactivation of the disease in the future.
