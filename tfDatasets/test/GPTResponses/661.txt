From the mid-13th century, the Delhi Sultanate dominated politics in northern India. The Sultanate was a Muslim dynasty that ruled over much of the Indian subcontinent from 1206 to 1526. It was established by Qutb-ud-din Aibak, a Turkish slave who rose to power under the command of the Ghurid dynasty. The Sultanate brought about significant changes to the political and cultural landscape of northern India, including the introduction of Islamic rule and the establishment of a centralized government.
