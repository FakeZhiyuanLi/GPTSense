According to Avicenna, the body and soul must be separate but connected in order to ensure the soul's individuation. He believed that the soul is a separate substance that is responsible for a person's consciousness and intellect, and that it interacts with the body through the faculty of imagination. Avicenna believed that the body is necessary for the soul to express itself, but that the soul must ultimately be independent of the body in order to achieve its full potential. This separation, however, must not be complete or absolute, as the body and soul must remain connected and mutually nourishing in order to maintain the person's existence.
