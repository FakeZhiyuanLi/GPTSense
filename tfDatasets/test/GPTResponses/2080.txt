Former rivers can be recognised presently through various methods, some of which include:1. Topographic maps: Maps that show the surface features of the land can help identify the path of former rivers. These maps may show the old riverbeds, meanders, and even where the river shifted course over time.2. Geological formations: The erosion caused by former rivers can leave behind distinct geological formations. The shape and composition of rocks, cliffs, and valleys may reveal the past presence of a river.3. Imagery: Aerial and satellite imagery can reveal the former path of rivers, even if they have been buried or replaced by human activities. The images may show patterns of vegetation, soil type, or changes in the landscape that suggest a water source.4. Fossils: The fossils of aquatic animals and plants can be found in sedimentary rocks along the old riverbeds. Such fossils can provide clues about the type and age of the river that once flowed there.5. Groundwater: Even if the river is no longer visible on the surface, its water may still be flowing underground. Monitoring groundwater levels and water quality can provide information about the former river's location, size and direction of flow.
