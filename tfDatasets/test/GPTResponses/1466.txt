The formula for the capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor without dielectric is:C = ε₀A/dwhere C is the capacitance, ε₀ is the permittivity of free space (8.85 x 10^-12 F/m), A is the effective area of the plates, and d is the distance between the plates.This formula assumes that there is no material between the plates of the capacitor, i.e. the capacitor is in vacuum. In this case, the only effect on the capacitance comes from the geometry of the plates and their separation distance.
