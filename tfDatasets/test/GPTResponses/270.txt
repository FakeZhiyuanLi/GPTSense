During the 19th century, the idea of culture in Europe reflected a growing interest in national identities and traditions. Countries throughout Europe were attempting to define their unique cultural identities and distinguish themselves from other nations. This led to an emphasis on literature, art, music, and other cultural expressions that were seen as representative of a country's history and values. The Romantic movement also played a significant role in shaping European culture during this time period, emphasizing the importance of emotion, imagination, and individualism. Additionally, the rapid industrialization and urbanization of Europe in the 19th century led to new forms of popular culture, including mass-produced literature, theater, and music.
