The Russians were not required to relocate from German-occupied regions during World War II. However, during the Soviet era, some ethnic groups were forced to move from their traditional homelands to other parts of the Soviet Union for political and military reasons. These forced relocations occurred over a period of several years, beginning in the late 1920s and continuing through the 1940s and beyond.
