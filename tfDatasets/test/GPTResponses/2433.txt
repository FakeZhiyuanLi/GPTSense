It is currently not completely understood how insects sense numbers. Some studies suggest that certain insects, such as bees, have the ability to distinguish and remember small numbers (up to about 4 or 5), while others suggest that they may also possess an approximate sense of larger quantities. However, more research is needed to fully understand the extent and mechanisms of insect numerical abilities.
