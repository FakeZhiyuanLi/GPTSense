During World War I and World War II, the Germans used a variety of tactics to avoid British blockades. These included:1. Submarines: The German U-boats were a significant threat to British shipping as they could attack convoys and sink vessels carrying supplies.2. Blockade runners: German ships were built to be fast and equipped with powerful engines. They could outrun British blockades and smuggle supplies through.3. Neutral countries: Germany relied heavily on neutral countries such as Sweden and Switzerland to smuggle important supplies into the country through covert channels.4. Air transport: The Luftwaffe provided support to transport crucial supplies in and out of Germany.5. Synthetic production: The Germans also began to develop synthetic materials as a substitution for natural resources such as rubber, metals, and fuel in response to British blockades.
