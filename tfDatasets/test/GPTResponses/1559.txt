The London Underground uses a rail-based transportation system that operates through a network of underground tunnels in central London, extending outward to suburban areas. The trains used on the system are electrically powered, and run on tracks which use a third rail to supply electrical power to the trains. The control and management of the system is handled by a central control room, which monitors train movements and coordinates the operation of signals and track switches to ensure the smooth flow of traffic throughout the network. The system also uses various safety features, including automatic train protection and a fail-safe system, to prevent accidents and protect passengers. Overall, the London Underground is a complex, technologically advanced transportation system that plays a critical role in the daily lives of millions of people in the UK's capital city.
