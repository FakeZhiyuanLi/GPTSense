One of the earliest philosophers to work with metaphysics and define the notion of empty space was Aristotle. He believed that empty space (or "void") did not exist and that everything in the universe existed within a continuous, interconnected substance or "ether." This view dominated Western philosophical and scientific thought until the 17th century, when the concept of vacuum or empty space began to emerge in the scientific revolution. This work was further developed by scientists such as Galileo, Boyle, and Newton, who explored the properties and behavior of empty space in increasingly sophisticated ways.
