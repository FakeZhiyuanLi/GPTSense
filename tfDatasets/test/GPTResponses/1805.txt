he calls "externalities," or the social and environmental costs of production and consumption. These externalities include pollution, resource depletion, and health impacts, among others. Because they are not factored into the price of goods and services, consumers and producers do not fully account for their true costs. This can lead to overconsumption, environmental degradation, and negative social consequences, and ultimately undermines economic sustainability. Brown argues that governments should play a larger role in regulating and incentivizing sustainability, rather than relying solely on market mechanisms.
