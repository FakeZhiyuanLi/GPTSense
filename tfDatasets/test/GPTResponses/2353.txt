There is no single answer to this question, as European film co-productions may be financed by a variety of sources. Some common sources of funding for European film co-productions may include national and regional film funds, the European Union's Creative Europe program, private investors, broadcasters, and a variety of public and private foundations and grants. Additionally, co-producers from different countries may each bring their own financing to the production, which can further diversify the funding sources.
