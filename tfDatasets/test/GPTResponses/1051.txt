The green color in the eyes is attributed to the amount and distribution of the pigment called melanin in the iris. The more melanin a person has in their iris, the darker their eye color will be. However, green eyes are not solely determined by the amount of melanin, as other factors such as genetics and lighting can also play a role in how green the eyes appear. Additionally, some people may have green-looking eyes due to the scattering of light in the iris, which can give off a greenish hue even if they do not have a large amount of melanin in their iris.
