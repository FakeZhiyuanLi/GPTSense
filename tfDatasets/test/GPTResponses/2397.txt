The Seven Years' War was considered as the prelude to the American Revolutionary War. The British victory in the Seven Years' War secured their dominance over North America and allowed them to expand their territorial holdings. However, the war also increased Britain's debt, leading them to try to raise revenue from their American colonies through measures such as the Stamp Act, which ultimately led to the American Revolution.
