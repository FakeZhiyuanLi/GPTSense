Albert Einstein's equations helped to imply the vanishing of the Ricci tensor. Specifically, in the context of General Relativity, Einstein's field equations relate the curvature of spacetime (expressed through the Riemann tensor) to the energy and momentum of matter and radiation in that spacetime. When the matter and energy are homogeneous and isotropic, as in the case of the early universe, the equations simplify and lead to the prediction that the Ricci tensor (a contraction of the Riemann tensor) vanishes. This is known as the Friedmann-Lema√Ætre-Robertson-Walker metric, which describes a homogeneous and isotropic expanding universe.
