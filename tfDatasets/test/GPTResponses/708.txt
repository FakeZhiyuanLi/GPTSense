Myelin in the brain can appear as white due to its high lipid content which reflects light, giving it a whitish color. This is why the brain's outer layer, the cerebral cortex, appears grey (gray matter) while deeper brain areas like the corpus callosum and white matter appear white due to the presence of myelin.
