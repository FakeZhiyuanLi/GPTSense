Glaciers form under circumstances where the accumulation of snow and ice exceeds the amount that is melted away by the sun and warm temperatures. This happens primarily in high-altitude areas and polar regions where temperatures are consistently low throughout the year. Precipitation, in the form of snowfall, is also necessary for the formation of glaciers. Over time, the accumulation of this snow and ice compresses and hardens into glacial ice, which moves downhill under the force of gravity.
