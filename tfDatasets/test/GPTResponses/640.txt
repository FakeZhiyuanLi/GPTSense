The use of psychoacoustic models and rate loops can be found in the audio coding scheme of the original MPEG-1 standard. These techniques are used to maximize the compression efficiency by removing irrelevant or less important information in the audio signal, while preserving the overall perceived quality of the sound. The psychoacoustic models take into account the limitations of human hearing perception, such as the masking effect, to determine which parts of the audio signal can be safely discarded without affecting the overall perceived quality. The rate loops, on the other hand, adjust the amount of compression applied to the audio signal based on the available bandwidth or the target bit rate. By using these techniques, the MPEG-1 standard was able to achieve high compression efficiency while still delivering good audio quality.
