Yes, child labour was common in European colonies during the colonial period. Children were often forced to work in fields, factories, and mines, and were subjected to unsafe working conditions, long hours, and low wages. The exploitation of child labour in colonies was fueled by the demand for cheap labour by European colonial powers. Many children were taken from their families and homes and put to work to support the economies of their colonizers. The practice was gradually abolished, but it took many years for it to be completely eradicated.
