Glaciers deform and flow due to the pressure and weight of the ice above it, as well as the effects of gravity. The weight of the ice causes the bottom layers of the glacier to become compressed and melt, creating a layer of water that helps the ice slide over the underlying bedrock or soil. This process is called basal sliding.Additionally, as snow accumulates on top of the glacier, it becomes compacted and transforms into ice, causing the glacier to become denser and increasing its weight. This weight causes the ice to flow downhill towards the terminus of the glacier.Finally, internal deformation can also contribute to glacier flow, as the ice crystals within the glacier deform and slide over each other due to the pressure and weight of the ice.
