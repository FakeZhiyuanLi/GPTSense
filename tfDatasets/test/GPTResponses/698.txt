The growth of the internet has disrupted the traditional business model of the press and journalism industry. The following are some of the major disruptions caused by internet growth:1. Decline in print circulation: As more people now prefer to read news online, the circulation of print newspapers has declined sharply. This has resulted in a decline in advertising revenue and has also led to the closure of many print newspapers.2. New forms of competition: The internet has opened up new forms of competition for the press, including blogs, citizen journalism, and social media platforms. This has led to a decline in the quality of news and the credibility of journalists as anyone can now publish news without proper vetting.3. Changing advertising landscape: As advertising revenue has shifted from print to online, many newspapers have had to adapt to new advertising models, such as pay-per-click and programmatic advertising.4. Disintermediation: The internet has also disrupted the traditional role of the press as an intermediary between sources of news and the public. This has led to a democratization of news, with consumers able to access news directly from the source.5. Fragmentation of audiences: The proliferation of news sources on the internet has led to the fragmentation of audiences, making it difficult for the press to maintain a loyal readership. This has resulted in a race to the bottom, with many newspapers resorting to sensational stories to attract readers.
