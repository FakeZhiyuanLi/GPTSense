The gut of siboglinidae (also known as beard worms or tube worms) is blocked by bacterial symbionts. These bacteria help the worms break down nutrients from the deep-sea hydrothermal vents where they live. The worms have no mouth or digestive system of their own, so they rely entirely on these symbionts to survive. The bacteria live inside specialized cells in the worm's body and exchange nutrients with their host through a complex process called chemosynthesis.
