The first Germanic words for God were neuter gender, such as Gothic "guþ" and Old Norse "guð". It wasn't until later that Germanic languages started assigning gender to the concept of God, with some languages using masculine gender (such as German "Gott") and others using feminine gender (such as Old English "goddess").
