Glacial moraines are formed by the deposition of material (rock, sediment, soil) carried and transported by glaciers. Glaciers move down slopes and valleys, scraping rock and soil from the sides and bottom of the valley. This can mix the material together giving it a disorganized appearance. As the glacier moves, it also picks up rocks and boulders that it carries. When the glacier retreats or melts, all that material is left behind in deposits along its path, forming what is called a moraine. The shape and size of the moraine depend on the glacier's speed, volume, and the terrain it moves through. There are four types of moraines: lateral, medial, terminal or end, and ground moraines. These various types of moraines take their names from their location and orientation with respect to the glacier.
