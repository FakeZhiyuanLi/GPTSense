The pieces of wood obtained by cutting a big tree will differ in size, shape, and quality depending on where they were cut from the tree. The pieces of wood from the trunk or the main branches will generally be straight-grained and suitable for use in construction, whereas the pieces from the smaller branches or the outer part of the trunk will have more knots and irregular grain patterns and may be more suitable for use in non-structural applications such as firewood, ornaments, or crafts. Additionally, factors such as the species of the tree, the age and health of the tree, and the environmental conditions it grew in can also affect the properties of the wood.
