During the Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries, the British turned a blind eye to child labour in factories and mines. Many children were forced to work long hours in dangerous and unhealthy conditions, often for very little pay. The British government and employers saw child labour as a necessary part of economic growth and development, and there were few laws or regulations to protect children. It wasn't until the late 19th and early 20th centuries that child labour laws were introduced, thanks in part to the efforts of campaigners such as Lord Shaftesbury.
