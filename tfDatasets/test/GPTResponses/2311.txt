In an ultra high vacuum system, contamination or adsorption of residual gases on the surface of aluminum or palladium becomes a concern. These materials have a high affinity for adsorbing gases, which can affect the performance and efficiency of the vacuum system. This can lead to decreased vacuum levels, increased outgassing, and reduced pump speed. Therefore, it is important to properly clean and treat the surface of these materials to minimize contamination and ensure optimal performance of the ultra high vacuum system.
