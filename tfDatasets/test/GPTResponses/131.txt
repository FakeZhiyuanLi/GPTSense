There is some evidence to support Peter J. Wallison's belief that the huge number of loans, particularly subprime mortgages, contributed to the financial crisis of 2008. Subprime mortgages were given to people with low credit scores or a history of loan defaults, and these loans became popular in the early 2000s when interest rates were low and housing prices were rising. The lenders who made these loans often packaged them together into mortgage-backed securities, which were sold to investors around the world.When housing prices stopped rising and began to fall, many borrowers were unable to keep up with their mortgage payments, and the value of the mortgage-backed securities plummeted. This caused huge losses for investors, who had relied on these securities for stable returns, and led to a credit freeze as banks became reluctant to lend money to each other.While there were many other factors that contributed to the financial crisis, including lax regulation and risky business practices, the proliferation of subprime mortgages was certainly a major factor. Wallison's belief that government policies encouraging homeownership and affordable housing played a role in fueling the subprime mortgage market is also supported by some economists and policy analysts.
