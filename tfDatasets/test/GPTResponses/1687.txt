There were several factors that led to the decline in living standards in Libya during the 1980s. One major cause was the decline in oil prices, which led to decreased revenue for the government and a recession in the economy. This also impacted government spending on social services, such as education and healthcare, leading to a decline in the quality of these services. The government also implemented policies that favored economic liberalization and reduced subsidies for food and other basic items, leading to increased prices and reduced access to necessities for many Libyans. Political instability and corruption within the government also contributed to the decline in living standards.
