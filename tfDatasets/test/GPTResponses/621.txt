The most successful dynasty in capturing most of central India was the Maratha dynasty. They expanded their empire from their base in the Western region of India and captured territories across central and northern India during the 17th and 18th centuries. Under the leadership of Shivaji Maharaj, the Marathas were able to defeat the Mughals and establish a strong empire extending from Gujarat to Bengal.
