In Newton's system, the frame of reference is relative to the observer or observer's frame of reference. The motion or position of an object is described in relation to a reference point, which could be another object that appears stationary to the observer. The observer's motion or position does not affect the motion or position of other objects in the system, as long as there are no external forces acting on them. Therefore, the frame of reference exists between objects within the system based on the observer's perspective or reference point.
