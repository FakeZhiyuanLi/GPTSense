Several glacial zones around the world report net loss in glacial mass due to climate change and other factors. One such area is the Arctic region, including Greenland and the Arctic islands, where ice sheets have been melting at an accelerated rate in recent years. Another area is the mountain glaciers in the Himalayas, Andes, Alps, and Rocky Mountains, which have also been rapidly shrinking. Antarctica, particularly the Western Antarctic Peninsula, has also experienced significant glacial melting in recent decades. Additionally, many smaller glaciers in various parts of the world are disappearing altogether.
