If the bit rate is too low, then the audio quality will be low and may contain audible artifacts such as distortion, compression, or poor dynamic range. The audio may sound muffled, thin, or lacking in detail. Additionally, there may be dropouts or interruptions in the audio stream. The overall listening experience may be unsatisfactory and make it difficult to discern individual sounds or voices.
