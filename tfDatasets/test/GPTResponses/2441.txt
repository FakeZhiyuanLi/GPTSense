The film "Munich" (2005) directed by Steven Spielberg addressed terrorism. It is based on the events that occurred during the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, when eleven members of the Israeli Olympic team were taken hostage by a Palestinian terrorist group called Black September. The movie portrays the Israeli government's response to the attack, which involved sending a team of Mossad agents to track down and kill those responsible for the massacre. "Munich" explores themes of revenge, justice, and the morality of response to terrorism.
