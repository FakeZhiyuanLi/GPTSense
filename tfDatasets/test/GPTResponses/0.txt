The Riemann hypothesis states that the source of irregularity in the distribution of prime numbers comes from the zeros of the Riemann zeta function. In particular, it predicts that all non-trivial zeros of the zeta function lie on a certain horizontal line in the complex plane, known as the critical line. This hypothesis has important implications for number theory and has been a major open problem in mathematics for over a century.
