Surface mount packages lack through-hole leads, which allows them to be placed directly onto the surface of printed circuit boards (PCBs). This differs from the traditional through-hole components, which require holes to be drilled into the PCB to accommodate their leads. Surface mount packages also tend to be smaller and more compact, making them ideal for high-density PCB designs.
