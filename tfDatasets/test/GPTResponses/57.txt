One of the conclusions of the U.S. Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission regarding the financial crisis of 2007 was that the crisis was avoidable and was caused by widespread failures in financial regulation and supervision. The commission highlighted the role of subprime mortgages, a lack of transparency in financial markets, and excessive risk-taking by financial institutions as contributing factors to the crisis. Additionally, the commission concluded that a culture of greed and over-reliance on credit ratings agencies also played a role in the crisis.
