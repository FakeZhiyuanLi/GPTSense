The club-oriented scene emphasized danceability and an infectious groove, rather than the intellectual and experimental qualities of earlier post-punk groups. The focus was on getting people moving and creating a party atmosphere, with DJs playing upbeat and energetic tracks, often incorporating electronic and dance rhythms. The emphasis was on fun and entertainment, rather than pushing boundaries or making a political or social statement.
