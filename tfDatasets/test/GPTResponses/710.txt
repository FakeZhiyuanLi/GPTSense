According to Christian tradition, the Roman soldiers who were responsible for carrying out the crucifixion kept watch over Jesus. However, there were also several other individuals present at the crucifixion, including Mary, the mother of Jesus, Mary Magdalene, and the apostle John. Additionally, Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor who ordered Jesus' crucifixion, was also present during the trial and execution.
