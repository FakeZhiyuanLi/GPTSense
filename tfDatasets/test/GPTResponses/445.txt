The style of worship of Hindu gods varies greatly, as there are many different traditions and sects within Hinduism. Generally, however, Hindus perform puja (worship) to their gods by offering flowers, food, incense, and other offerings at a temple or shrine. Mantras (sacred chants) and arati (ritual waving of a lamp) are also commonly used during worship. Many Hindus engage in personal devotional practices at home as well, such as meditation and reciting prayers or hymns. Some sects within Hinduism, such as the Hare Krishnas, may also engage in kirtan (devotional singing) and dancing as part of their worship.
