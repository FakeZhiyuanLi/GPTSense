The two main issues that caused a steady decline in the whooping crane population are hunting and habitat loss. Hunting was a significant threat to the survival of these birds in the early 20th century, as they were hunted for their feathers, meat, and other parts. Habitat loss, on the other hand, has been a major issue more recently, as human development has destroyed much of the wetland areas where the birds feed and breed. Additionally, pollution, predation, and climate change have also contributed to the decline of the whooping crane population.
