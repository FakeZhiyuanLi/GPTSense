The word "god" has roots in the Old English word "god" and the Germanic word "gudan," both of which likely stem from the Proto-Germanic word "guthan." The exact origins of this word are unclear, but it is believed to be related to the Proto-Indo-European word "ghu-to," which means "that which is invoked or invoked upon." The concept of a higher power or divine being has been a part of human culture and religion for thousands of years.
