Some non-single-sex polychaetes have separate sexes, with males and females having different reproductive organs. Others are hermaphrodites, meaning they have both male and female reproductive organs and can self-fertilize or exchange gametes with another individual. Some species also undergo sex reversal, with individuals changing from one sex to another during their lifetime. In some cases, individuals may even have multiple sexes simultaneously, known as simultaneous hermaphroditism.
