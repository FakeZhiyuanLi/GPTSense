The only state-run educational system in Ireland prior to comprehensive schools was the National School system, which was established in 1831. The National School system provided primary education to all children, regardless of their religion or social status. It was a key initiative of the British government during the 19th century to promote education and social cohesion in Ireland. However, secondary education was limited and only available to a small number of students who could afford fees for private schools.
