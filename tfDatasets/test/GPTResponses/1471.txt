The complex capacitance with the dielectric present can be mathematically represented by the following equation:C = C₀/K + jωεA/dWhere,C = Complex capacitanceC₀ = Capacitance without the dielectricK = Dielectric constantω = Angular frequencyε = Permittivity of the dielectricA = Area of the plated = Distance between the platesThe first term C₀/K represents the capacitance without the dielectric, which is divided by the dielectric constant K. The second term jωεA/d represents the effect of the dielectric on the capacitance, where j is the imaginary unit. This term includes the frequency ω, the permittivity ε of the dielectric, the area A of the plates, and the distance d between the plates.
