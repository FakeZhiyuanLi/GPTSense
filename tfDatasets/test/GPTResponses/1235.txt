The emergence of the industrial base of North Carolina was based on a variety of factors, including the availability of natural resources such as timber, gold, and tobacco, a skilled workforce, a favorable geographic location along major transportation routes, and government policies that encouraged economic growth. In the late 19th and early 20th century, industries such as textiles, furniture manufacturing, and tobacco processing became major drivers of the state's economy. More recently, sectors such as biotechnology, information technology, and aerospace have emerged as important contributors to North Carolina's economic growth.
