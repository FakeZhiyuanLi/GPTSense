The philosophy that combined with Descartes to push quantum activity in the 20th century is the philosophy of idealism. Idealism holds that reality is ultimately mental or spiritual in nature, and that the physical world and its properties are ultimately grounded in and determined by conscious beings or minds. This philosophy influenced the development of quantum mechanics by emphasizing the importance of the observer in determining the properties of quantum systems. The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, which is based on the idea of wave-particle duality and the collapse of the wave function upon measurement, reflects this idealist philosophy.
