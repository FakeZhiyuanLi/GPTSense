The Rhine River was considered a significant obstacle for invaders in WWII because it served as a natural defensive barrier. The German army used the river to their advantage by constructing forts and bunkers along its banks, making it challenging for the Allied forces to cross into Germany. The Rhine was also a crucial transportation route for supplies and troops, which made it a prime target for the Allied forces. In March 1945, the Allied forces launched a massive offensive across the Rhine, which helped to bring an end to the war in Europe.
