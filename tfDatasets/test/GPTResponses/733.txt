There is no one who can say with absolute certainty that the cross was made out of two beams. The Bible does not provide an exact description of the shape or composition of the cross used to crucify Jesus. However, artistic representations and historical accounts suggest that the cross was a vertical beam with a horizontal beam attached near the top. This design allowed for the placement of a sign with Jesus' name and crime above his head.
