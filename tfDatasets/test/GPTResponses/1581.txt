One way to ensure minimal current leak during power rail installation is to use good quality insulated wires and connectors. The wires should be able to carry the required current without overheating and melting the insulation. The connectors should be properly crimped or soldered to ensure a secure and reliable connection.Another way is to use isolation materials, such as electrical tape or heat shrink tubing, to protect the wires and prevent any accidental contact with other conductive materials.It is also important to follow proper installation procedures and guidelines, such as ensuring proper grounding and avoiding any sharp bends or kinks in the wires that could damage the insulation.Finally, testing the power rails for any potential current leaks using a multimeter or other specialized equipment can help identify and address any issues before they become a problem.
