The reign of King George I was a turning point in the growth of the position of prime minister in Britain. Robert Walpole served as the first prime minister of Britain under George I and was able to establish the position as the leader of the government and the one who holds the real power. George I relied on Walpole to manage the affairs of state and this role has continued to increase in importance over time, making the prime minister the most powerful political figure in Britain today.
