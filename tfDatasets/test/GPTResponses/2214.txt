It is important to clarify that "natives" refer to the indigenous peoples of New Mexico, while "Spanish speaking" refers to the descendants of Spanish settlers who arrived in the region hundreds of years ago.New Mexico has a long and complex history of colonization, conquest, and cultural exchange. Prior to the arrival of Spanish explorers in the 16th century, the region was home to numerous Native American groups, including the Pueblo, Apache, Navajo, and Comanche.The Spanish established the colony of Santa Fe in 1598 and began a campaign to convert Native Americans to Christianity and integrate them into Spanish colonial society. Over time, a mix of Spanish, Native American, and mestizo (mixed-race) communities developed, with Spanish becoming the dominant language of government, religion, and trade.According to the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey, about 47% of the population of New Mexico speaks Spanish at home. However, it is difficult to determine the percentage of Native Americans who also speak Spanish, as many have maintained their languages and cultural traditions despite centuries of colonialism and assimilation.
