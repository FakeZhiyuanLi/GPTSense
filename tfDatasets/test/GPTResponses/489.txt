Yes, unfortunately, there are still underage children working in Brazil, particularly in informal sectors such as agriculture, domestic work, and street vending. Despite efforts by the government and civil society organizations to combat child labor, it remains a significant issue in the country. The 2019 National Survey on Child Labor estimated that around 1.8 million children and adolescents between the ages of 5 and 17 were working in Brazil. The government has implemented laws and policies to protect children from labor exploitation, but more needs to be done to address the root causes of child labor and provide support for vulnerable families.
