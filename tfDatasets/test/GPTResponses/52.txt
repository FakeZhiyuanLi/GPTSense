The seating arrangement of the debating chamber varies depending on the country and the type of legislature. In general, the debating chamber is often designed with a horseshoe-shaped or circular seating arrangement, with seating for the presiding officer (such as the Speaker or the President) at the front of the chamber. Members of parliament or legislators sit facing each other, with government members usually sitting on one side and opposition members on the other. There may also be seating for staff, journalists, and members of the public who are observing the proceedings.
