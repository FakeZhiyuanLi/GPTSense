Panentheism is a belief system that posits that the divine (or God) is both immanent and transcendent. In other words, God is not only present and active within the world and its processes, but also beyond it, existing outside of space and time.Panentheism suggests that the universe is God's body or manifestation, but that God is not limited by or reducible to the universe. Rather, God is continually present and sustaining the world, while also transcending it.This worldview is often contrasted with pantheism, which asserts that God and the universe are one and the same, with no distinction or separation between them. In panentheism, there is a recognition of the unity and interdependence of all things, as well as a reverential awe for the divine mystery and complexity of existence.
