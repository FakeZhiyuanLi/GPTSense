Indentured servants were similar to what people in the early days of colonization would call "apprentices." These were usually young people who came from poor families and were bound to work for a certain number of years for someone else in exchange for food, shelter, and sometimes education or training. Both indentured servants and apprentices were not free to leave their agreement until their term had expired, and they were often subjected to harsh or abusive treatment by their masters. However, the main difference between the two was that apprenticeships were usually voluntary and focused on developing a trade or skill, while indentured servitude was often a forced or desperate choice made by people who needed to pay off debts or find a way to survive.
