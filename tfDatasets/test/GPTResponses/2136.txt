Virginia - Virginia was a reliably Republican state until the 2008 presidential election when it voted for Democrat Barack Obama. Since then, Virginia has become increasingly Democratic, and in the 2020 presidential election, it voted for Democrat Joe Biden.2. Colorado - Colorado was a Republican stronghold until the early 2000s when it started leaning towards the Democratic Party. In the 2018 midterms, Democrats won every statewide office in Colorado, including governor and both U.S. Senate seats.3. Nevada - Nevada was a Republican-leaning state until the 1990s when it started trending towards the Democrats. In recent years, Nevada has become a reliable Democratic state, and in the 2020 presidential election, it voted for Joe Biden.These are just a few examples, but there are many other states that have switched between the parties over the years.
