The trend to transform the anthropology of 'art' into an anthropology of 'visual culture' reflects a broader shift in the way anthropologists approach cultural analysis. Anthropology of art traditionally focused on the production, circulation, and meaning of 'art' objects within specific cultural contexts. However, the conceptualization of visual culture as a broader field of inquiry encompasses not only art but also various forms of visual representation, including popular media, advertising, photography, film, and digital media. This shift reflects a recognition that visual culture is central to our contemporary cultural experience, and that the analysis of visual phenomena can shed critical light on social, political, and economic processes. The anthropology of visual culture emphasizes the importance of visuality as a field of cultural production, social interaction, and political resistance, emphasizing the need to analyze the ways in which cultural and social practices are structured by visual representation.
