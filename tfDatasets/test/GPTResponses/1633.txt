The most economic solution for new grid-connected capacity in areas with good resources would likely be to invest in renewable energy sources such as solar, wind or hydro power. These sources of energy have become increasingly cost-competitive with traditional fossil fuels, and their prices are continuing to decline. In addition, renewable energy sources are environmentally friendly and reduce the carbon footprint of power sources. Many countries offer incentives and subsidies for the development of renewable energy, further reducing the cost of these projects. Finally, renewable energy has lower operating costs than traditional fossil fuel power sources, which makes it a more affordable option in the long run.
