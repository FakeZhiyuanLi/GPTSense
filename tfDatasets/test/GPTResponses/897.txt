In 1905, Rayleigh and Jeans showed that classical physics failed to explain the distribution of energy in blackbody radiation. They proposed a theory that stated that the energy of radiation was continuously distributed with respect to frequency, and that as frequency increased, the energy density in each frequency interval decreased. This theory, known as the Rayleigh-Jeans law, worked well for low frequencies but failed at higher frequencies, known as the ultraviolet catastrophe.At the same time, Einstein proposed a radically different explanation for blackbody radiation. He hypothesized that the energy of radiation was quantized, or in other words, came in discrete packets of energy (now known as photons). He used this theory to explain the photoelectric effect, and later it was used to explain other phenomena as well. This theory, known as the photoelectric effect, provided a more complete explanation of blackbody radiation and helped to lay the foundation for the theory of quantum mechanics.
