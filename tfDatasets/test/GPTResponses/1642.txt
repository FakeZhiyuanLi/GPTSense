Crosspicking is a technique used in playing stringed instruments, particularly the guitar, mandolin, and banjo, in which the player uses a combination of alternate picking and string skipping to create a fast, fluid, and rhythmic pattern of notes across multiple strings. It involves picking individual strings in a specific order while keeping the picking hand moving in a circular motion. It is commonly used in bluegrass, country, and folk music.
