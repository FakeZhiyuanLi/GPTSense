Visual arts, such as painting, sculpture, photography, and graphic design, rely on presenting scenes directly to the eye for their own visible sake. These art forms are primarily concerned with creating visual pleasure or communicating ideas and emotions through visual elements and principles. They use color, light, composition, form, and texture to engage the senses and evoke an emotional response from the viewer. Unlike performing arts, such as dance, theater, and music, visual arts are static and do not require movement or sound to convey their message.
