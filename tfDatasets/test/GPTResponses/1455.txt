A scientist could use fluorescence microscopy to detect certain microorganisms without the use of an acid-fast staining technique. By labeling specific antibodies with fluorescent dyes, the microorganisms can be visualized under fluorescent light. Another option is phase-contrast microscopy, which enhances the contrast of certain microorganisms that may not be visible under standard bright-field microscopy. Dark-field microscopy is also an option, which uses a dark background and a special condenser to make certain microorganisms appear bright and prominent.
