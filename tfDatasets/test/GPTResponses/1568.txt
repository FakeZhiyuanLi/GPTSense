Paris became largely into fashion in the 19th century, particularly during the 1850s to 1880s when the city became a global hub for haute couture and luxury fashion design. This was due to the rise of prominent fashion designers such as Charles Frederick Worth, who established the first haute couture house in Paris in 1858. The city also became a center for textile production and trade, making it the perfect location for fashion designers to showcase their creations.
