Miami's high water table limits construction and excavation projects as the ground is made up of porous limestone that is brought to the surface by water pressure. The limestone is prone to erosion and can create sinkholes, making it difficult and costly to build underground structures, such as basements or subway stations. The high water table also limits the placement of septic systems and underground pipes for sewage and drainage. In addition, the high water table can exacerbate flooding and storm surge during heavy rainfall or hurricane events.
