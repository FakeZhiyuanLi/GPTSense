The majority of an insect's digestion happens in its midgut or intestine. The midgut is responsible for the breakdown of food and absorption of nutrients, while the hindgut is responsible for water reabsorption and excretion of waste. Additionally, some insects have a foregut that contains the mouthparts and esophagus, which is responsible for the ingestion of food.
