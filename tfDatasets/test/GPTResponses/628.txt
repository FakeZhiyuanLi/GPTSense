The distinction between upper case and lower case letters is based on size and appearance. Upper case letters are usually larger in size and are used to begin sentences, proper nouns, titles, and headings. Lower case letters are smaller in size and are used for the majority of words in a sentence.However, there is also a third category of letters called title case or "lower upper case". These letters are capitalized similar to upper case letters but do not take up as much space. They are typically used for titles, subtitles, or headings within a text. The distinction between upper case and title case is primarily based on their usage and visual appearance.
