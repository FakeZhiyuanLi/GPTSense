Max Planck first recognized the value of the Planck constant in 1900 while developing his theory of black body radiation. He proposed that electromagnetic radiation was quantized, meaning that it could only exist in discrete packets of energy, which he named "quanta." The Planck constant was introduced as a fundamental constant needed to explain this concept.
