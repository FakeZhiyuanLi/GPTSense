A glacier is considered polythermal when the ice is a combination of cold ice and temperate ice. The boundary between cold and temperate ice is called the Firn Line. The temperature at which a glacier becomes polythermal depends on various factors, including location, altitude, and climate. Typically, a glacier will become polythermal when the mean annual temperature is close to or just above freezing point (0 °C or 32 °F). However, this can vary depending on the specific glacier and its surrounding environment.
