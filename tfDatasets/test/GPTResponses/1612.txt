The foundation for the structure of the economy of the Ottoman Empire was agriculture, which constituted the primary economic activity. The Ottomans were a primarily agrarian society, with a significant portion of the population engaged in farming, animal husbandry, and related activities. Agriculture provided the necessary sustenance for the population and was critical for the production of goods and commodities traded in markets. The Ottomans also placed significant emphasis on trade and commerce, with the establishment of trade routes and the development of trade relations with other countries in the region. The economy of the Ottoman Empire was diversified, with other sectors such as manufacturing and mining also contributing to its growth and prosperity.
