The Riemann hypothesis proposes that the prime distribution in short intervals near x follows the same pattern as the distribution of primes in the whole number line, namely that the prime counting function Ï€(x) is approximately equal to x/ln(x). This implies that the distribution of primes becomes increasingly sparse as x becomes larger, and that there are no predictable patterns or regularities in their distribution. The Riemann hypothesis also predicts that the distribution of primes in short intervals is subject to random fluctuations that are governed by the properties of the Riemann zeta function.
