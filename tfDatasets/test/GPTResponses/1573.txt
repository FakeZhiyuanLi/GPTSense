During World War II, the majority of political factions in Britain supported the view that Britain should remain united and continue to stand firm against Nazi aggression. This was reflected in the leadership of Prime Minister Winston Churchill and his strong speeches and iconic rhetoric, which helped to rally the nation and maintain morale during difficult times. The political factions also supported the decision to form alliances with other countries, particularly the United States and the Soviet Union, and work together towards victory against the Axis powers.
