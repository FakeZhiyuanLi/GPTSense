The form of Hinduism that does not believe in panentheism is called Dvaita Vedanta. This school of Hindu philosophy, founded by Madhvacharya, advocates strict dualism between God and the individual soul. According to Dvaita Vedanta, God (Vishnu) is a distinct and supreme entity, separate from the individual souls (Jivas), who are completely dependent on God for their existence and salvation. This school rejects panentheistic ideas such as the notion of a divine presence in all things, and instead emphasizes the transcendental nature of God.
