Instead of adopting the federalist model, the UK has opted for a unitary system, where power is centralised in the national government rather than being shared among different levels of government. This means that the UK government has strong control and authority over matters such as national defence, foreign policy, and taxation, while local governments have more limited powers over their specific regions. This system has evolved over centuries and remains in place today.
