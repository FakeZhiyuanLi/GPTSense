One verified effect of vacuum fluctuation is the Casimir effect. This effect arises due to the fluctuations of electromagnetic fields in vacuum, leading to a tiny but measurable force between two closely spaced metal plates. The Casimir effect provides strong evidence for the existence of vacuum fluctuations and has been verified experimentally.
