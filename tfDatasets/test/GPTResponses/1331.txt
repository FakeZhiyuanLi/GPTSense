Immigrants from England and the Scottish Highlands settled in various parts of North America, including the eastern coast of the United States, Canada, and the Caribbean. Some notable settlements include the Pilgrims in Plymouth, Massachusetts, the Puritans in Boston and Salem, Massachusetts, the Loyalists in Nova Scotia and Upper Canada (now Ontario), and Scottish settlers in areas such as Cape Breton Island and Prince Edward Island.
