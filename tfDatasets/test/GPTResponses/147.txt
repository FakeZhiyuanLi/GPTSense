This is a difficult question to answer definitively because it depends on the specific political division in question and what type of power it holds. However, generally speaking, political divisions that are weak or limited in their powers are less likely to utilize any power they do have. This could include subdivisions like cities or townships that have limited authority compared to state or federal governments. Additionally, some political divisions may be accustomed to working collaboratively or in a consensus-oriented manner, and thus may not frequently resort to using their coercive powers. Ultimately, the answer to this question will depend on the specific context of the political division in question.
