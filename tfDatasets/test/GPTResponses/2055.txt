On each side of a thoracic segment, there is a pair of ribs attached to the vertebrae, intercostal muscles, and nerves that supply the muscles and skin of that segment. There is also a portion of the thoracic cage, including the sternum and costal cartilages, on each side. Additionally, there are organs such as the lungs, heart, and major blood vessels that are contained within the thoracic cavity and extend across multiple segments.
