A common example of this is the Chinese character for "double," which is written as 双. The two characters in this word both contain the radical 又, which means "again" or "repeat." Another example is the character for "heartfelt," which is written as 恳. Both characters in this word contain the radical 心, which means "heart" or "mind."
