When an insect is resting, it exchanges gases with its environment through a system of air tubes called tracheae. During this process, the insect releases carbon dioxide (CO2) into the surrounding air. This CO2 is a waste product of respiration, which occurs in the insect's cells to produce energy. The insect takes in oxygen (O2) during respiration, which it uses to fuel its metabolic processes. However, during rest, the insect's oxygen demand is lower, and it mainly releases carbon dioxide into the air.
