There is no historical evidence that the Galicians specifically built defense systems to stop the Vikings from raiding. However, during the Middle Ages, many European countries built fortifications and castles to protect themselves from invasions and attacks from neighboring countries or groups. The Galicians likely had similar defenses in place to protect themselves from any potential threats.
