Mach described thought experiments as a way to explore and clarify theoretical concepts in science. He proposed that thought experiments like the bucket argument help us to better understand scientific theories and concepts by illustrating the logical consequences of certain assumptions or hypotheses. Mach believed that these experiments allowed us to think creatively and abstractly about the implications of scientific ideas, and to uncover new possibilities for future research and experimentation. Ultimately, thought experiments were seen by Mach as an important tool for advancing scientific understanding, and for pushing the boundaries of our knowledge and imagination.
