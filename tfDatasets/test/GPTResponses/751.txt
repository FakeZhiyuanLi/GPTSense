The segments of annelids are not different from true segments. Annelids have true segments, which are divided by septa and can be seen externally as ring-like structures. However, some segments of annelids may be modified or fused for specific functions, such as the pygidium, which is a fused segment at the posterior end of some annelids that functions in excretion and reproduction.
