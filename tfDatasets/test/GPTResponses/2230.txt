The return of an NFL team to the city of Baltimore in 1996 contributed to the demise of the CFL's American expansion. The Baltimore Stallions, a CFL team, had been successful in the city and won the Grey Cup in 1995. However, when the NFL's Baltimore Ravens returned, the Stallions were forced to relocate to Montreal. This, combined with financial struggles and logistical difficulties, led to the collapse of the CFL's American expansion.
