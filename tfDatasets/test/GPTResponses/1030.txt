In 1907, the US Congress was split between two major political parties: the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. The Republicans held a majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, with 57 seats in the Senate and 229 seats in the House of Representatives. The Democrats had 36 seats in the Senate and 167 seats in the House. There were also a few independent and third-party members in both chambers.
