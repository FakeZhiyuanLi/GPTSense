Coelom refers to the fluid-filled body cavity that is present in many animal species, including most advanced invertebrates and vertebrates. It is a key feature of the body plan in animals that have it, separating the gut and other internal organs from the outer body wall. The coelom plays an important role in the movement, support, and protection of internal organs, as well as in the exchange of gases, nutrients, and waste products within the body.
