The energy from one mole of photons can be computed using the following equation:E = N × h × νwhere E is the energy of one mole of photons in joules (J), N is the Avogadro constant (6.022 × 10^23), h is Planck's constant (6.626 × 10^-34 J·s), and ν is the frequency of the photons in hertz (Hz).For example, if we have photons with a frequency of 5 × 10^15 Hz, the energy of one mole of those photons would be:E = (6.022 × 10^23) × (6.626 × 10^-34 J·s) × (5 × 10^15 Hz)= 1.990 × 10^5 J/mol
