The cost of electricity from the grid is often regarded as marking the achievement of grid parity for PV (photovoltaic) systems. This means that the cost of electricity generated by a PV system is equal to or lower than the cost of electricity from the grid. This threshold varies depending on the location, as electricity prices differ from country to country, or even from region to region within a country. Generally, grid parity is achieved when the cost of electricity from a PV system is below the average retail electricity tariff in a given location.
