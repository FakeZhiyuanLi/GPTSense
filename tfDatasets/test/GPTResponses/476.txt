The Nalanda University reached its height during the Pala rule. It was one of the world's first residential universities which provided facilities for higher learning and research. The university attracted scholars from all over the world, and it became a major center of Buddhist learning, philosophy, and culture, as well as mathematics, astronomy, and medicine. The Pala rulers, who were great patrons of learning and education, provided financial and other support to the university, which enabled it to flourish and become a beacon of knowledge and enlightenment.
