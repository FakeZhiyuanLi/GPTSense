The parts inside a female insect's reproductive system are connected by a network of tubes called the reproductive tract. These tubes connect the ovaries, where eggs are produced, to the oviducts, where the eggs are fertilized or laid. The oviducts, in turn, connect to the uterus, where the eggs are nourished and developed before being laid outside the insect's body. The reproductive tract also includes accessory glands that produce and secrete fluids that are necessary for fertilization and egg development.
