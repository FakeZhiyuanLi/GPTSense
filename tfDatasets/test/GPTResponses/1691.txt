The Endangered Species Conservation Act (ESCA) added protection for threatened and endangered species to the wildlife definition of the Lacey Act. This means that it is illegal to transport or distribute any species listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA across state lines or internationally. The Lacey Act had previously only regulated interstate commerce of game and birds, but with the addition of the ESA to its wildlife definition, it became a more comprehensive law for protecting wildlife.
