Transaction translators are devices that allow USB devices with different speeds to communicate with each other. For example, a transaction translator may translate between a USB 2.0 device and a USB 3.0 host, allowing them to communicate seamlessly despite their different speeds. This is important for ensuring compatibility between devices and allowing them to work together effectively. Without transaction translators, USB devices with different speeds would not be able to communicate with each other, limiting their functionality and usefulness.
