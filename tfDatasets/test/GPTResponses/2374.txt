Astrophysicists use various methods to describe outer space beyond the Karman line, which is approximately 62 miles (100 kilometers) above sea level. These methods include:1. Telescopes: Astrophysicists use telescopes that can detect and analyze various forms of electromagnetic radiation from distant stars, galaxies, and other cosmic objects.2. Satellites and space probes: Space agencies like NASA and ESA launch satellites and space probes to explore and study the universe beyond our planet. These missions provide valuable data about the properties and behavior of celestial bodies.3. Computer simulations: Astrophysicists use supercomputers to create simulations of cosmic events, such as the formation of galaxies, star systems, and black holes.4. Mathematical modeling: Astrophysicists use mathematical equations and models to describe the behavior and interactions of celestial objects, such as the forces that govern the movements of planets and stars.5. Spectroscopy: Astrophysicists use spectroscopy to analyze the light emitted by celestial objects, which can reveal their composition, temperature, and other properties.
