Green was associated with the romantic movement in literature and art during the late 18th to mid-19th century, particularly in the works of the English Romantic poets such as William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. They used the color green to symbolize the beauty of nature, its restorative powers, and the infinite possibilities for growth and renewal. The Pre-Raphaelite artists, a group of English painters, also used green prominently in their works to convey a sense of idealism and escapism from the industrialized world.
