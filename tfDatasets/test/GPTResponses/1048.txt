In mathematics, expressions containing radicals (square roots, cube roots, etc.) can be grouped together using the same prefix (like "square root of" or "cubic root of") and the same radicand (the number under the radical sign). For example, expressions like √7 and √9 would be grouped together as "square roots of perfect squares" (since 7 is not a perfect square, but 9 is). Similarly, expressions like ³√27 and ³√64 would be grouped together as "cubic roots of perfect cubes" (since 27 is a perfect cube of 3, and 64 is a perfect cube of 4).
