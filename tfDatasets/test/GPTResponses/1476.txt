Larger value capacitors are often constructed using multiple smaller capacitors connected in series or parallel. This allows for the combination of the capacitance values to create a larger overall capacitance. Additionally, these capacitors may also have a larger physical size or be constructed with multiple layers of dielectric material to increase the overall capacitance. Electrolytic capacitors are also commonly used for larger values, as they can have a high capacitance per unit size.
