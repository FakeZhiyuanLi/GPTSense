and every why in the universe. This concept is called the Principle of Sufficient Reason. According to Leibnitz, there can be no arbitrary or unexplained events in the world because everything follows from some reason or cause. This principle applies to all aspects of reality, including physical phenomena, mental states, and moral choices. Leibnitz believed that this principle is essential for understanding the universe and for finding the ultimate explanation for everything in it.
