Microsoft Windows calculates daylight saving time (DST) by using a similar approach to that of zoneinfo. The operating system stores information about DST rules for different time zones and uses this information to determine the correct DST transition dates and times for each zone. However, there are some differences in the way Windows handles DST compared to zoneinfo. For example, Windows uses a different algorithm for calculating the transition dates and times, and it may not always update the DST rules in a timely manner, which can lead to issues with incorrect clock settings.
