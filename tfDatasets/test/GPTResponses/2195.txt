Vacuum is generally measured in terms of pressure. The unit used to measure vacuum is typically the Pascal (Pa) or its sub-multiple, such as milli-Pascal (mPa) or micro-Pascal (ÂµPa). However, common units of measurement for vacuum include torr, atmospheres (ATM), and millimeters of mercury (mmHg). A vacuum gauge, such as a thermocouple gauge or a Pirani gauge, is used to measure the pressure of the vacuum. Another common method to measure vacuum is by using a vacuum pump to produce a low-pressure environment, and observing the behavior of materials or objects placed in the vacuum.
