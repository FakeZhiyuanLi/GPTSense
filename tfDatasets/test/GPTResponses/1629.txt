There were several factors that contributed to Gaddafi's hatred of the United States:1. American military intervention in the Middle East: Gaddafi saw the United States as an imperialist power that was trying to spread its influence across the Middle East. He believed that American military interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan were examples of this imperialist agenda.2. Economic sanctions: The United States imposed economic sanctions on Libya in the 1980s and 1990s, which severely impacted the country's economy. Gaddafi blamed the United States for these sanctions and saw them as a form of aggression.3. U.S. support for Israel: Gaddafi was a strong supporter of the Palestinian cause and saw the United States' close relationship with Israel as a major obstacle to peace in the Middle East.4. U.S. support for anti-Libyan groups: The United States provided support to anti-Libyan groups during the Cold War, which Gaddafi saw as evidence of American aggression towards his country.Overall, Gaddafi's hatred of the United States was driven by a combination of perceived imperialist ambitions, economic sanctions, and U.S. policies towards Israel and Libya.
