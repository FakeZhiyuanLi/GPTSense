The Ottoman economic system was based on the region of Anatolia, where the Ottoman Empire was founded. It was also heavily influenced by the Islamic concept of waqf (charitable endowment) and the Islamic commercial law known as the Shariah. The Ottomans also had strong economic ties with neighboring regions, such as the Balkans, the Caucasus, and the Middle East.
