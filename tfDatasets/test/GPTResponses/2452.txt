The term "second hundred years' war" does not describe a historical event or conflict. There was only one "Hundred Years' War" that occurred between England and France from 1337 to 1453. It was a series of conflicts that spanned over a century and included battles such as the Battle of Agincourt and the Siege of Orleans.
