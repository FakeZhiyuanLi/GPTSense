Albert Einstein famously said, "Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind." He also wrote in a letter, "The religion of the future will be a cosmic religion. It should transcend a personal God and avoid dogmas and theology."Einstein believed that the question of whether or not there is a God cannot be answered definitively using empirical evidence or scientific methods. Instead, he believed that this is a question of philosophy, and that each individual must come to their own conclusion based on their personal beliefs and experiences.In summary, Einstein did not explicitly state that the question of God's existence is just like questions in natural science, but he believed that it was a question that cannot be answered through scientific means.
