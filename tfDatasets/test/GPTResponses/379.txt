A digital tuner or a television with a built-in digital tuner is needed for residents in the US to receive free, over-the-air programming. The digital tuner is necessary because all free over-the-air programming has been converted to digital signals, replacing the older analog signals. Without a digital tuner, viewers will not be able to receive these digital signals and view free content.
