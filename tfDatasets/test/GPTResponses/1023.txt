There were several parts of India that shaped the demands of the people for nationalism:1. British rule and colonialism: The oppressive policies of the British Empire and exploitation of India's resources led to a growing sense of resentment and desire for self-rule.2. Economic exploitation: The colonizers' private ownership of India's vast resources resulted in several famines and considerable impoverishment of the Indian people.3. Religious oppression: The British also exploited and imposed their faith-based beliefs on the Indian people by oppressing Hindu and Muslim religious practices.4. Social injustice: The British policies promoted inequality and division within Indian society, creating a divide between the privileged and the oppressed classes.5. Intellectual movements: The intellectual movements of the time, such as the Bengal Renaissance and the Indian National Congress, played a significant role in creating a sense of national identity and the demand for self-determination.6. Nationalist leaders: The leadership of prominent nationalist figures such as Mahatma Gandhi, Subhas Chandra Bose, and Jawaharlal Nehru provided direction and guidance to the growing nationalist movement.
