are today's borders.This statement is true. Treaties that established or redrew borders are legally binding and cannot be invalidated solely based on a claim of a fundamental change in circumstances. The principle of sanctity of treaties requires that once a treaty is ratified, it becomes a binding agreement between the parties involved and cannot be unilaterally altered or terminated. However, if the parties agree to modify or terminate the treaty, they can do so through mutual consent or by following the procedures set out in the treaty itself.
