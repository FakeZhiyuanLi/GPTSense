Leeches reproduce through sexual reproduction, where fertilization occurs internally. During mating, the male leech transfers sperm to the female's reproductive system, where the eggs are fertilized. The fertilized eggs are then deposited in a cocoon, where they develop and hatch after a few weeks. The cocoon is usually attached to a substrate in the water or on land, depending on the species of the leech.
