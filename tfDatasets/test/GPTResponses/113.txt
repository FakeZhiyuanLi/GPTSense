During the internecine struggles in Portugal, the people of the country struggled with political instability, economic uncertainty, and social unrest. The country was plagued by a series of coups, counter-coups, and political assassinations that created a climate of fear and paranoia. This led to a breakdown in governance and the rule of law, with different factions competing for power and control. As a result, the economy suffered, with high inflation and unemployment rates, and the quality of life for ordinary citizens was severely impacted. Additionally, social tensions between different groups in society, such as workers and business owners, added to the turmoil and made it difficult to find a path towards reconciliation and stability.
