The consistency of the written Tibetan language was influenced by several factors, including:1. The development of a standardized writing system based on the Indian Brahmi script by the Tibetan king Songtsen Gampo in the 7th century.2. The influence of Buddhism, which brought with it a large number of Sanskrit loanwords that were integrated into the Tibetan language.3. The work of early Tibetan scholars and translators who created a standard set of grammar rules and terminology for use in translations of Buddhist scriptures and other texts.4. The role of government and religious institutions in promoting standardized language usage, particularly during the time of the Fifth Dalai Lama in the 17th century.5. The relative isolation of the Tibetan people and language, which allowed for the development and preservation of traditional language forms and norms.
