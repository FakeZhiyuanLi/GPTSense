John von Neumann did not develop the first self-reproducing computer program. The first known self-reproducing program was written by a British computer scientist named John W. Conway in 1970. The program is called the Game of Life and it is a cellular automaton that is capable of creating new copies of itself. However, von Neumann did make fundamental contributions to the development of computer science and the design of self-replicating machines. He proposed a theoretical model of a self-reproducing machine in the 1940s, which became known as the von Neumann machine. This concept was later developed by others and led to the creation of the first self-replicating robots in the 1990s.
