Burrowers, such as earthworms and moles, loosen the soil by creating tunnels and burrows. This action helps to:1. Increase soil aeration: The tunnels and burrows created by burrowers allow air to circulate within the soil, which is essential for the growth of plant roots.2. Enhance water infiltration: The burrows created by burrowers allow rainwater to penetrate deeply into the soil, reducing runoff and increasing the soil's water-holding capacity.3. Improve nutrient cycling: The burrows created by burrowers provide pathways for nutrient-rich organic matter to penetrate deeper into the soil, improving nutrient cycling and making these nutrients available to plants.Overall, burrowers play an important role in soil health by improving soil structure, water retention, and nutrient cycling, which can lead to healthier and more productive crops.
