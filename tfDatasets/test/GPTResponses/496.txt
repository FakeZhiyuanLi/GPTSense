One modality of being that Avicenna analyzed is the concept of essence (al-mahiyah). He believed that every being has an essence that defines its nature and the properties it possesses. The essence of a being is what makes it what it is, and it is not dependent on anything else for its existence. Avicenna also believed that essence can be known through reason and intellect, and that it is distinct from existence (wujud).
