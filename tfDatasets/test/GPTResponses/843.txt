Annelids are capable of different defensive strategies to withdraw from danger.One of the primary means of defense is to retract the body into their burrows or shells when they perceive danger, especially in sedentary species like earthworms. If the earthworm detects any vibration or mechanical disturbance on the soil surface, it instantaneously contracts its longitudinal muscles, which reduces its body length, and hence, withdraws into the burrow.Some of the polychaete worms that live in tubes or burrows have bristles or chaetae that can extend out from their body. These chaetae are often decorated with venomous spines or hooks and can serve as a potent defense mechanism against predators. The worms can also rapidly retract these bristles back into their body when threatened, making it difficult for predators to catch them.Lastly, some annelids like leeches have a unique defense mechanism where they secrete a thick mucus layer that covers their body. This layer makes them slippery and challenging for predators to grasp, therefore serving as a passive defense strategy. They can also release chemicals that deter predators or play dead by retracting its appendages and becoming unresponsive to external stimuli.
