Full-duplex in Superspeed transfer mode refers to the ability of a device to transmit and receive data simultaneously at high speeds. This means that data can be sent and received at the same time without any interference, resulting in faster transfer rates and improved efficiency. In other words, full-duplex allows for constant communication between devices, which is crucial for high-speed transfers in modern computing and networking.
