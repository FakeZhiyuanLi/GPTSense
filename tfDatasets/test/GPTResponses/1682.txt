Italy did not invent or start using the AC system. The first modern air conditioning system was invented by Willis Carrier, an American engineer, in 1902. However, Italy was an early adopter of air conditioning technology for residential and commercial use, particularly in the hot and humid regions of the country, such as Rome and Naples. The widespread use of air conditioning in Italy began in the 1950s and 1960s with the growth of the post-war economy and the construction of modern buildings.
