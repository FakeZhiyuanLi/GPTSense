There is no specific effect called "when capacitors absorb sound waves." Capacitors are electronic components that store and release electrical energy, and they do not have a direct relationship with sound waves. However, in some audio circuits, capacitors may be used as filters to remove unwanted frequencies from a sound signal, which could indirectly affect the way the sound is heard.
