Polar molecules (or permanent dipoles) in the dielectric material cannot move instantly if a rapidly changing time varying voltage is driving the capacitor. This is because these polar molecules have a characteristic time constant for reorientation, also known as the relaxation time. This time constant limits the rate at which the dipoles can respond to changes in the electric field and thus limits the rate of change of the dielectric constant. As a result, the dielectric constant of a capacitor with a polar dielectric material may not be able to keep up with the rapidly changing voltage, leading to a decrease in the effective capacitance.
