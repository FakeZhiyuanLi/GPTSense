The capacitance of varactors varies as a function of voltage. As the voltage applied to the varactor changes, the depletion region width in the p-n junction of the varactor changes, which alters the effective capacitance of the device. The capacitance decreases as the voltage applied to the varactor increases. This property makes varactors useful in tuning circuits, frequency synthesizers, and voltage-controlled oscillators.
