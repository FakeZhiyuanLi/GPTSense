Rías Baixas is a region located in the northwest of Spain known for its coastal scenery, seafood, wine, and white sandy beaches. The term "Rías Baixas" means "lower rias" in Galician, referring to the estuaries or inlets created by the flooding of valleys near the coast. These inlets are important for the seafood industry and offer a unique landscape with a mixture of sea and inland characteristics. The region is also famous for its Albariño wine production, and the Denomination of Origin (D.O.) Rías Baixas is recognized for its high-quality varietals.
