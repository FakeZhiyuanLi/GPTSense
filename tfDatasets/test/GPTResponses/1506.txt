Larger capacitors generally have a higher capacitance, which means they are able to store more electric charge. This allows them to have a greater ability to filter out low-frequency signals or alter the timing of electrical circuits.However, larger capacitors also tend to have a higher equivalent series resistance (ESR) and equivalent series inductance (ESL), which can limit their performance in high-frequency applications.Overall, larger capacitors present a balance between a higher capacitance and higher ESR and ESL, which determines their effectiveness in different types of electrical circuits.
