Romance languages are considered to be dialects of Latin - the language spoken by the ancient Romans. As Latin spread throughout the Roman Empire, it was influenced by local languages and dialects, eventually leading to the development of distinct Romance languages such as French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Romanian. These languages are still closely related to each other and share many similarities in vocabulary, grammar, and syntax.
