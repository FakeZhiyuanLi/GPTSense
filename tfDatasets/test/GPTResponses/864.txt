Britain governed India through a system of indirect rule that was later known as "the British Raj". This system involved the use of a small number of British officials, supported by a much larger Indian civil service, to govern the country. The British depended on local rulers and elites to collect taxes from the local populace, and in return they supported these rulers and elites with resources and military protection.The British introduced a legal system, which was based on British common law, to India, and this helped to establish British authority over the country. They also implemented a system of infrastructure development, including road and railway construction, which helped to connect the various regions and facilitate movement and trade.The British also introduced English-language education in India, encouraging the adoption of British culture and values. However, this led to a loss of cultural identity for many Indians and further exacerbated divisions between the British and Indian communities.Overall, Britain's governance of India was characterized by a mixture of cooperation with local ruling elites, coercion and repression, and attempts to introduce British values and culture.
