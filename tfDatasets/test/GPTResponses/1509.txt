St. Anselm defined the existence of God through his famous ontological argument. He argued that our concept of God is the greatest possible concept that we can hold in our minds, and that this concept necessarily includes the attribute of existence. In other words, if we can conceive of a being that is perfect in every way, we must also be able to conceive of that being as existing in reality, otherwise it would not be perfect. Therefore, God exists necessarily and does not depend on anything else for his existence. This argument is commonly referred to as the "ontological argument for the existence of God."
