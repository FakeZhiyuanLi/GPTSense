After Planck's discovery of quantization of energy, it was realized that energy is not continuous, but actually comes in discrete packets called quanta. This contradicted the classical understanding of physics and revolutionized the field, leading to the development of quantum mechanics. This discovery also contributed to the development of modern technology, particularly in the field of electronics and computing.
