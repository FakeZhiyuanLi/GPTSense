Annelids have a cuticle that consists of several layers. The layers are arranged in the following order, starting from the outside and moving towards the inside:1. Epicuticle: This is the outermost layer of the cuticle, composed of lipids and waxes. It provides protection against desiccation and physical damage.2. Exocuticle: This layer is primarily composed of chitin and protein, and provides the cuticle with rigidity and strength.3. Endocuticle: This layer is typically thinner than the exocuticle and composed of chitin and other fibers. It functions as a flexible support layer for the exoskeleton.4. Epidermis: This is the inner layer of the cuticle and is composed of cells that produce the cuticle layers. The epidermis is responsible for the growth and repair of the cuticle.
