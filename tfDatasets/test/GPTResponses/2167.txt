No, Bush did not have the support of the United Nations when he decided to invade Iraq on March 20, 2003. Despite UN weapons inspectors failing to find conclusive evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, Bush and his administration argued that Saddam Hussein posed a threat to the US and its allies. However, UN Security Council resolution 1441, adopted in November 2002, did not authorize the use of military force against Iraq without further consultations and deliberations by the council. The lack of support from the UN is one of the key criticisms of the US invasion of Iraq.
