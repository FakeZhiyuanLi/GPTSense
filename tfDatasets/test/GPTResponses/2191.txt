he called "masses in motion," which we now refer to as forces. These forces can either cause a stationary object to start moving or change the direction or speed of a moving object. Mach believed that the concept of momentum could only be understood in relation to its observable effects on other objects and the environment. In other words, momentum is not an inherent property of an object, but a result of its interactions with other objects.
