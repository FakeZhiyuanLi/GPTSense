Laurisilva is a type of subtropical forest found in the Macaronesia region of the Atlantic Ocean, including the Azores, Madeira, and the Canary Islands. It is characterized by evergreen laurel trees and is considered a relic of the ancient laurel forests that once covered much of Europe, North Africa, and the Mediterranean Basin during the Tertiary period. The laurisilva is notable for its high biodiversity, containing many endemic plant and animal species, and is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site.
