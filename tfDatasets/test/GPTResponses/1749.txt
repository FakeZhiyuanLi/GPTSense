Section 215 of the Patriot Act allowed the FBI to seek the authorization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to obtain access to any tangible things (such as documents, records, and communications) that the government believed were relevant to an ongoing foreign intelligence investigation. This included the ability to collect bulk metadata from telecommunications companies, such as phone records and internet browsing history, without a warrant or individualized suspicion.
