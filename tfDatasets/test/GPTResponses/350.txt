If a representative or a state is coerced into consenting to a treaty, its consent is not considered valid or binding. The principle of free and voluntary consent is a fundamental principle of international law, and any coercion or duress undermines the legitimacy of the consent. Therefore, if it is found that the consent was given under duress or coercion, the treaty may be challenged or invalidated. In extreme cases, the state may even decide to withdraw from the treaty altogether.
