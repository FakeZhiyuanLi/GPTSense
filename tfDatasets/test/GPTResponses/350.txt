A polar glacier is typically defined as a glacier that exists within the polar regions or near the poles, where temperatures remain below freezing (0째C or 32째F) year-round. The temperature range for polar glaciers can vary, depending on the latitude and altitude of a particular glacier, but generally, the temperature must be cold enough to prevent melting and allow ice accumulation. Some polar glaciers can have temperatures as low as -50째C (-58째F) or colder.
