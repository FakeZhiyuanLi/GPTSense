Tigers did not become extinct in Sariska. However, in 2004, all tigers were reported to have vanished from the Sariska Tiger Reserve due to poaching and habitat loss. This was a result of ineffective conservation efforts, lack of proper management, and corrupt wildlife officials. The situation was later rectified by the Indian government, and tigers were reintroduced into the reserve in 2008. Today, the reserve is home to a growing population of tigers.
