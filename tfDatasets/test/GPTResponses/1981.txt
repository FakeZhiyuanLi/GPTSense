The exotic pet trade is one particular industry that exploits Endangered Species Act loopholes. People who want to own exotic pets, such as tigers, lions, and endangered reptiles, often purchase and smuggle them illegally, even if the animals are protected species. Some breeders and dealers take advantage of controls on sales of protected wildlife by applying for permits for the sale of endangered species for conservation purposes, but then sell them to customers as pets. This allows them to circumvent regulations and laws to make a profit.
