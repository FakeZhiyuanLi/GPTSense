The first Gulf War, also known as the Persian Gulf War, officially ended on February 28, 1991, when a ceasefire was declared between Iraq and the coalition forces led by the United States.The war began when Iraq, under the leadership of Saddam Hussein, invaded Kuwait on August 2, 1990. The United States and its allies responded by forming a coalition and launching an air and ground assault against Iraq on January 17, 1991.The coalition forces quickly gained control of the skies and began to bomb key Iraqi targets, including military installations, communication centers, and power stations. In addition, a large-scale ground invasion was launched on February 24, 1991, which resulted in the capture of Kuwait and the defeat of the Iraqi army.After nearly six weeks of fighting, a ceasefire was declared, and negotiations began between Iraq and the coalition forces to end the conflict. In April 1991, Iraq agreed to a series of UN resolutions that mandated the destruction of its weapons of mass destruction and the withdrawal of its military from Kuwait. The terms of the ceasefire were accepted by the coalition forces, and the first Gulf War officially came to an end.
