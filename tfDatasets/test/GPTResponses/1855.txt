The object of paean in the 4th century BCE was to honor and praise a god or goddess for their divine powers and blessings. Paeans were often sung or chanted during religious ceremonies or festivals in ancient Greece, and were accompanied by musical instruments such as lyres or flutes. The word "paean" also came to refer to a song or hymn of thanksgiving or celebration in general, beyond just religious contexts.
