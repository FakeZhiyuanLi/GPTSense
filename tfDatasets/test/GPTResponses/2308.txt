Zinc has been known to humans for thousands of years, with evidence of zinc mining dating back to ancient times in places such as India, China, and Greece. However, the credit for discovering zinc as an element is generally given to the German chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf, who first isolated pure zinc in 1746 by heating calamine ore (a zinc ore) with charcoal.
