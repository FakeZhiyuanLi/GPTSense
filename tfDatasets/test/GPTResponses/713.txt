Fossil signs of annelids, or segmented worms, include trace fossils such as burrows, tubes, and fecal pellets. These fossils provide clues about the behavior, ecology, and evolution of ancient annelids. Additionally, some soft-bodied annelids have been preserved as exceptional fossils in sediments with exceptional preservation, such as lagerst√§tten. Examples of annelids that have been preserved in this way include polychaete worms, oligochaetes, and leeches. These fossils can provide valuable information about the morphology, physiology, and diversity of ancient annelids.
