There is no canal in France that carries the Rhine's water. The Rhine is a river and flows through several countries, including Switzerland, Germany, and the Netherlands. However, there are canals in France that are connected to the Rhine, such as the Canal de la Marne au Rhin and the Canal du Rh√¥ne au Rhin.
