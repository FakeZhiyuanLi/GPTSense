The Prussian linguist who called for an anthropology is Wilhelm von Humboldt. He saw language as a key to understanding the cultural and social practices of a community, and believed that studying language and culture together was crucial for a comprehensive understanding of human society. Humboldt's call for an anthropology influenced the development of the field in Germany and beyond.
