The tone or color of the instrument's sound will also be affected by the wood used to make it. Different types of wood have different densities and can produce different overtones or harmonics, which can affect the overall character of the sound produced by the instrument. Additionally, the grain and texture of the wood can also influence the way sound waves travel through the instrument and affect the sound that is produced.
