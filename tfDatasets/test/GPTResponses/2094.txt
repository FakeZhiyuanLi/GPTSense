Augustine did not specifically say that time could not appear, but he wrote extensively about the nature of time and its relationship to God. In his book, Confessions, Augustine argued that time is a creation of God and cannot exist independently of God. He also believed that time is a mental construct that humans use to understand the world around them. Augustine's views on time were influenced by his belief in the existence of an eternal and unchanging God, who is outside of time and space.
