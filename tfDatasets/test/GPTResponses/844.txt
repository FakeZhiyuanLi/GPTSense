Planck's law correctly predicts the spectral distribution of the radiation emitted by a black body, which depends only on the temperature of the black body. The law explains the thermal radiation phenomenon, including the dependence of intensity, wavelength, and temperature. It also predicts that as the temperature of the black body increases, the radiation shifts to shorter wavelengths and increases in intensity, which is known as the black body radiation curve. Planck's law is essential for understanding the nature of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by objects at different temperatures, which is important in fields such as astronomy, thermodynamics, and quantum mechanics.
