is known as "supremacy" or "primacy" over state or provincial powers. This means that the central government has ultimate authority over the provincial or state governments and can overrule them if necessary. This is generally enshrined in the national constitution and is a key feature of federal systems. It is also important to note that although the central government has supremacy over the states or provinces, it is still limited by the constitution and must respect the rights and powers of the subnational governments.
