It is difficult to determine exactly who may have used only parts of Avicenna's works to support their own spiritual insights, as Avicenna's work has been studied and utilized by scholars and thinkers across various disciplines for centuries.However, it is worth noting that some mystics and spiritual teachers in the Islamic tradition have utilized Avicenna's ideas on the nature of the soul and the intellect in their own spiritual writings and teachings. For example, the Persian poet and mystic Rumi, who lived in the 13th century, referenced Avicenna's philosophy in his work, particularly in his exploration of the concept of the "human form" as a symbol of the divine.Similarly, the great Islamic philosopher and mystic Ibn Arabi, who lived in the 12th century, engaged extensively with Avicenna's ideas in his own writings on spirituality and metaphysics. Ibn Arabi used Avicenna's concept of the "Universal Intellect" as a foundation for some of his own ideas on the nature of consciousness and the divine.Ultimately, many thinkers throughout history have found inspiration and insight in Avicenna's work, using it as a springboard for their own spiritual inquiry and exploration.
