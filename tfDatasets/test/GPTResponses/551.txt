Scholars of the Enlightenment generally saw the Middle Ages as a period of darkness, superstition, and ignorance. They saw the period as being marked by feudalism, the subjugation of the individual to the will of the church and the state, and the oppression of the lower social classes. Enlightenment thinkers believed that the Middle Ages represented a time of intellectual stagnation and cultural decline, characterized by a lack of scientific inquiry, rational thought, and a focus on tradition and dogma rather than reason and progress. Many Enlightenment scholars were also critical of the church during the Middle Ages, seeing it as a corrupt and oppressive institution that stifled intellectual and social progress. Nonetheless, some Enlightenment thinkers did find value in certain aspects of medieval culture, including its art, music, and literature, which they saw as representing a blend of reason and emotion.
