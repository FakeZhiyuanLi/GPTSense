The branch of anthropology that is concerned with poverty is called economic anthropology. It explores the relationships between economic systems, human behavior, and culture. This includes examining poverty, inequality, and wealth distribution from a cultural perspective. Economic anthropologists study how people in different societies make a living, how they allocate resources, and how they develop economic networks and relationships. They also investigate the social and cultural factors that affect economic behavior and outcomes, including poverty, inequality, and access to resources.
