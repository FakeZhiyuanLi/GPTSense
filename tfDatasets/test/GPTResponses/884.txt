Paul Ehrenfest did not come up with the name "ultraviolet catastrophe". It was actually coined by the German physicist Max Planck in 1900, to describe the paradoxical prediction made by classical physics that the energy radiated by a black body should increase without limit as the frequency approached infinity, creating an "ultraviolet catastrophe". Planck's development of quantum mechanics provided a solution to this paradox.
