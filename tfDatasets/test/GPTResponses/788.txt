The assumption that black body radiation is thermal leads to the prediction that the spectral energy distribution of radiation emitted by a black body depends only on its temperature and is independent of the material and geometry of the black body. This prediction is known as Planck's law and has been experimentally verified for many different types of black body radiators. Additionally, the assumption leads to the prediction that the total energy emitted by a black body per unit area per unit time (also known as the Stefan-Boltzmann law) increases rapidly with temperature, which explains why hot objects glow brighter than colder ones.
