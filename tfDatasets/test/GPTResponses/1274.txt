The Native American tribes who lived in the regions where the religious mounds were constructed continued to build on to them and use them for religious and ceremonial purposes. Some of the tribes that are known to have contributed to the construction and use of these mounds include the Hopewell, Adena, Mississippian, and Cahokia cultures. These tribes are believed to have continued adding to and expanding these mounds over many centuries, often incorporating new religious symbols and practices into their use of the mounds.
