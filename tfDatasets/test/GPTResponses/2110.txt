Theodoric was a Gothic king who ruled over the Ostrogothic kingdom in Italy from 493 to 526 CE. While Theodoric was ethnically Gothic like many of his people, he differed from the Germanic Goths in a few key ways:1. Origin: Theodoric was born in Pannonia (present-day Hungary), while the Germanic Goths originated from what is now Sweden.2. Religion: Theodoric was an Arian Christian, while many of the Germanic Goths were pagans before their conversion to Christianity.3. Cultural Influence: Theodoric spent much of his youth in Constantinople and was heavily influenced by Roman culture. This led him to adopt Roman administrative practices, laws, and customs in his kingdom. In contrast, the Germanic Goths had a distinct and unique culture that differed from the Romans.4. Military Tactics: Theodoric was known for his skill in cavalry warfare, which he learned during his time as a hostage in Constantinople. The Germanic Goths were generally known for their prowess as infantry warriors.Overall, Theodoric's upbringing and experiences set him apart from the Germanic Goths in terms of culture, religion, and military tactics.
