to mitigate these effects?There are several methods that can be applied to mitigate leakage current and parasitic effects in a realistic model of a capacitor, including:1. Choosing the right dielectric material: The choice of dielectric material has a significant impact on the leakage current and parasitic effects in a capacitor. Low-loss dielectric materials such as ceramic or tantalum can help reduce the leakage current and parasitic effects.2. Increasing the thickness of the dielectric layer: A thicker dielectric layer can reduce the electric field strength, which in turn reduces the leakage current and parasitic effects.3. Reducing the operating temperature: Lowering the operating temperature can reduce the leakage current and parasitic effects by reducing the concentration of free charges in the dielectric layer.4. Shielding the capacitor: Shielding the capacitor from external electromagnetic noise can reduce parasitic effects such as capacitive coupling and electromagnetic interference.5. Using low-leakage capacitors: Low-leakage capacitors are specifically designed to have minimal leakage current and parasitic effects.6. Reducing circuit complexity: Simplifying the circuit design can help reduce the complexity of the interconnects and parasitics, thereby reducing parasitic effects in the capacitor.
