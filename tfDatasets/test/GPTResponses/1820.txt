The result of publicly funded links among computers in government labs and research institutes was the creation of the internet as we know it today. This network of interconnected computers allowed researchers to collaborate and share ideas, and eventually led to the development of the World Wide Web and the widespread use of the internet in our daily lives. It also facilitated the growth of e-commerce, social media, and other online businesses and services.
