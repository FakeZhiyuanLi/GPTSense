There were several cults that weakened Buddhism in India, including:1. The Saivite cult: This cult worshiped the Hindu god Shiva and believed that he was the ultimate reality. They thought that Buddhism was a heretical offshoot of Hinduism and tried to convert Buddhists to their own religion.2. The Vaishnavite cult: This cult worshiped the Hindu god Vishnu and believed that he was the supreme deity. They also tried to convert Buddhists to their own religion.3. The Tantra cult: This cult believed in esoteric practices and rituals that were not mainstream in Buddhism. They were also influenced by Hinduism and tried to merge the two religions.4. The Vajrayana cult: This cult emerged in the 7th century and was a form of Tibetan Buddhism that had a strong emphasis on esoteric practices and rituals. This led to a decline in the purity of Buddhist teachings.Overall, the influence of these cults weakened Buddhism in India, leading to its decline and eventual disappearance from the country.
