Objects that occupy a more or less space area could be any physical objects with volume, dimensions, and shape. Generally, larger objects take up more space than smaller ones, but it also depends on their shape and arrangement.For example, a house occupies a more significant space area than a bed, which occupies a more significant space area than a pen. Similarly, a car occupies a larger area than a bicycle, and a tree occupies more area than a small plant.In summary, objects that occupy a more or less space area are relative and can vary depending on the context and the perspective of the observer.
