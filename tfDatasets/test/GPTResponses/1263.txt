What are non-standard characters?Non-standard characters are those that do not belong to the standard ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) or Unicode character sets. Examples of non-standard characters include accented letters (é, ñ), mathematical symbols (π, √), and special characters (♠, ☀️).2. Which characters are often non-standard?Characters that are often non-standard depend on the context. For example, in programming, non-standard characters may include punctuation marks (!, &, #), mathematical operators (+, -, /, *), and brackets ([, ], {, }).
