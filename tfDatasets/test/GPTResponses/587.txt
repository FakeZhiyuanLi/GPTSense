Plants use several strategies to avoid water loss:1. They have a waxy layer on their leaves and stems that prevents water from escaping. This layer is called the cuticle.2. They close their stomata (tiny pores on the leaves) during hot and dry weather to avoid losing water through transpiration.3. Some plants have specialized structures called succulent leaves and stems that store water.4. They reduce the surface area of their leaves by curling them or having needle-like leaves, which reduces the amount of water that can evaporate.5. They can also reduce the rate of photosynthesis, which reduces the amount of water that is lost through transpiration.
