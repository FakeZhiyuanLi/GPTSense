Kleptocracy refers to a corrupt political system where those in power use their positions to steal, embezzle or seize public funds and resources for their personal gain, often at the expense of the general population. It is a type of government or leadership where economic and political power is used for personal enrichment rather than for the good of the country or its citizens.
