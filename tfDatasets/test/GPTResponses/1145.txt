The Faraday constant and the Planck constant are two separate and unrelated constants.The Faraday constant (symbol F or Fad) is a physical constant that describes the amount of electric charge carried by one mole of electrons, which is approximately 96,485.3399 coulombs per mole (C/mol). It is used in electrochemistry to convert between the number of moles of electrons and the amount of electric charge in a reaction.On the other hand, the Planck constant (symbol h) is a fundamental constant in quantum mechanics that relates the energy of a photon to its frequency. It has a value of approximately 6.62607015 x 10^-34 joule-seconds (JÂ·s).In summary, the Faraday constant relates to electrochemistry and the amount of electric charge, whereas the Planck constant relates to quantum mechanics and the energy of photons. They are not directly related to each other.
