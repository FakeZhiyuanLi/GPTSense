The United States has hosted professional Canadian football games. In fact, the Canadian Football League (CFL) has held regular-season games in the United States in the past. From 1993 to 1995, the CFL expanded into the United States, and the league had teams based in several American cities, including Baltimore, Las Vegas, and Sacramento. During that time, the CFL played some of its games in the United States.
