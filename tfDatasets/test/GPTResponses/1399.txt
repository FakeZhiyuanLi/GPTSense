Pandeism is a belief system that combines aspects of pantheism and deism. It posits that God, or a divine being, created the universe but then became one with it, transforming into the physical world itself. As such, everything in existence is considered to be part of the divine, with the implication that all things are imbued with sacredness and purpose. Pandeism emphasizes the interconnectedness and interdependence of all things, and encourages individuals to seek spiritual fulfillment through the exploration of the natural world and the cultivation of an attitude of reverence and gratitude towards all life.
