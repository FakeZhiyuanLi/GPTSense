The main reason for the Sahara becoming so dry is believed to be changes in the Earth's orbit and tilt, which caused a shift in the circulation of air masses and rainfall patterns. This led to the gradual drying of the region over thousands of years, ultimately turning it into the arid desert that exists today. Additionally, human activities such as overgrazing and deforestation may have exacerbated the desertification process.
