Einstein's theory of relativity fundamentally differs from Leibniz's theory of relationalism. Leibniz believed that space and time were not absolute concepts, but rather were defined by the relationships between objects. In his view, space and time were merely mental constructs, and did not have a real existence.Einstein, on the other hand, postulated that space and time were linked and formed a four-dimensional continuum known as space-time. He also theorized that the speed of light was a constant in all reference frames, and that the laws of physics were the same for all observers in uniform motion relative to one another.In essence, Einstein's theory provided a new and revolutionary understanding of space and time, and questioned the classical view that space and time were absolutes. Leibniz's theory, on the other hand, was more of a philosophical concept that did not have a firm scientific basis.
