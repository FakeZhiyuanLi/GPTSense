The genetic code is read through a process called gene expression, which involves two main steps: transcription and translation.1. Transcription: The first step of gene expression is transcription, which takes place in the nucleus of a cell. During transcription, the DNA code is transcribed (copied) into a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule. This is done by an enzyme called RNA polymerase, which reads the DNA code and adds complementary RNA nucleotides (A, U, C, and G) to create the mRNA molecule.2. Translation: The second step of gene expression is translation, which takes place in the ribosomes of a cell. During translation, the mRNA molecule is read by ribosomes, which use the information contained in the codons (groups of three RNA nucleotides) to assemble amino acids into a protein chain. Each codon codes for a specific amino acid, and the sequence of codons determines the sequence of amino acids in the protein.In summary, the genetic code is read by transcribing the DNA code into an mRNA molecule, and then translating the mRNA code into an amino acid sequence in a protein.
