Glacial zones are determined by several characteristics:1. Temperature: Glacial zones are characterized by extremely low temperatures, with the average temperature being below freezing.2. Precipitation: Typically, glacial zones receive high levels of precipitation, in the form of either snow or ice.3. Altitude: Glacial zones are typically found at high altitudes where temperatures are naturally low.4. Latitude: Glacial zones are also found at higher latitudes where the sunâ€™s rays hit the earth at shallower angles, resulting in lower temperatures.5. Topography: The terrain of a region can also impact glacial zones. Regions with high mountains and deep valleys are more likely to experience glacial activity.6. Climate change: The effects of climate change can result in alterations to the glacial zones over time. An increase in temperature or precipitation levels can shift the boundaries of these zones.
