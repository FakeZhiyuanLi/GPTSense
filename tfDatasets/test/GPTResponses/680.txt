The Soviet Union was not invited to participate in the Munich Conference of 1938, as the main participants were Britain, France, Italy, and Germany. The Soviet Union was not seen as a significant player in the negotiations over the Sudetenland crisis. However, some historians argue that the Western powers deliberately excluded the Soviet Union as they did not want to give the impression that they were aligning with the Soviet Union, which they viewed as a communist state.
