Sub-devices that are logically connected to a main device are typically referred to as peripherals or components. Examples of logical sub-devices include a mouse, keyboard, printer, scanner, or camera connected to a computer. These devices may operate independently of the main device but are essential for the functioning of the broader system. Logical sub-devices may also include internal components such as graphics cards, hard drives, or RAM that are integral to the overall operation of a computer or other electronic device.
