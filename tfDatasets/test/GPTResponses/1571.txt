There isn't a straightforward answer to this question as there are about 30 distinct Berber languages spoken in North Africa, many of which are mutually unintelligible. However, the majority of Berbers living in the Nafusa Mountains of western Libya traditionally speak the Nafusi dialect of Berber, which is a member of the Zenati language group. It is possible that some Berbers in this region may also speak Arabic, which is the official language of Libya.
