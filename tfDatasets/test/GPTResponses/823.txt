Aristotle believed a nation should be led by a just and virtuous leader who is knowledgeable in ethics, politics, and economics. He believed in a constitutional government with a balance of power between the ruling elite and the common people, advocating for a mixed government that combines elements of democracy, oligarchy, and monarchy. He emphasized the importance of moderation and avoiding extremes in political rule, arguing that the best form of government depends on the circumstances and characteristics of the people and the state.
