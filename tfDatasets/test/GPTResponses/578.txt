During the last glacial age, which lasted from approximately 115,000 to 11,700 years ago, the Earth's average temperature was about 5-6 degrees Celsius (9-11 degrees Fahrenheit) colder than it is today. There were also periodic rapid cooling events known as Heinrich events, where temperatures dropped by as much as 6-8 degrees Celsius (11-14 degrees Fahrenheit) in just a few decades. These colder temperatures led to the growth of massive ice sheets across much of North America and Europe.
