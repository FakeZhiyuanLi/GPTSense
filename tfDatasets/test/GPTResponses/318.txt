Simmel identifies four key sociological parts of culture:1. Forms of interaction and social structure: This includes the ways in which individuals and groups interact with each other, and the social structures that govern these interactions (such as social norms, values, and roles).2. Psychological aspects of culture: This includes the ways in which culture shapes individuals' perceptions, emotions, and behavior.3. Material culture: This includes the physical objects and artifacts that are produced and used within a particular culture (such as art, architecture, and technology).4. Symbolic culture: This includes the ideas, beliefs, and worldviews that are shared within a particular culture (such as religion, language, and myth).
