Thysanura is a group of wingless insects that include silverfish, firebrats, and Bristletails. They are characterized by a long, slender, and segmented body with three tail-like appendages at the rear. They are mainly nocturnal, and their diet includes starch, sugar, and dead insects. Thysanura can be found in damp or warm areas such as basements, attics, and bathrooms. They are considered as pests because they damage books, paper, and other household items.
