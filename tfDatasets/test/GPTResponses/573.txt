According to Avicenna's work "Floating Man", the soul is perceived as a separate entity from the body, independent and immortal. In the thought experiment, Avicenna asks the reader to imagine a person floating in mid-air with all their senses and organs disconnected from the body. He posits that even in this state, the person would still be aware of their own existence and consciousness, which he identifies as the soul or the "Universal Intellect." Avicenna sees the soul as a transcendent essence that is capable of existing independently from the material realm and continues to exist beyond the death of the body.
