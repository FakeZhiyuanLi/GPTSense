Monotheism is the belief in one God or deity. This belief is central to many religions including Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. The concept of monotheism states that there is only one supreme being who is the creator and ruler of the universe, and all things in it. This differs from polytheism, the belief in many gods, and atheism, the lack of belief in gods or deities.
