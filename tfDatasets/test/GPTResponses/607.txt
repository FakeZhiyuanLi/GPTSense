The value of e associated with quantum theories of energy was introduced by physicist Max Planck in 1900, not by Albert Einstein. The constant 'e' refers to the mathematical constant also known as the base of the natural logarithm, and is not directly associated with quantum theories of energy. However, 'e' does appear in various mathematical equations used in quantum mechanics, which Einstein helped develop in the early 20th century.
