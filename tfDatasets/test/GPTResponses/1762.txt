The Critical Habitat regulation requires federal agencies to consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Marine Fisheries Service before undertaking any actions that may affect designated critical habitat for threatened or endangered species. The consultation process ensures that the adverse impacts of the proposed action on critical habitat are minimized and mitigated. Additionally, the regulation requires the identification of specific areas that are essential to the conservation of the species concerned and are subject to special management considerations or protection. Designated critical habitats are required to be protected from destruction or disturbance that may result in the extinction or adverse modification of the species' habitat.
