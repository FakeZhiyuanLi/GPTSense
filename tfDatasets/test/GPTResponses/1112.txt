An electric field develops across the dielectric when a difference in charge is present on either side of the dielectric material. This can occur when there is an applied voltage or electric potential difference across the dielectric material, causing the electrons within the material to become polarized and creating a separation of charge. The resulting electric field is proportional to the applied voltage and dielectric constant of the material.
