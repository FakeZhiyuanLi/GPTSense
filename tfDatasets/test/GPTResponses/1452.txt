The polarization of a dielectric material may be unable to follow the voltage applied to it under certain conditions, such as:1. High frequency operation: at high frequencies, the polarization time lag becomes significant, and the dielectric material may not be able to follow the rapidly changing voltage signal.2. High voltage application: at high voltages, the dielectric material may become saturated, and no additional polarization is possible. This can lead to breakdown of the dielectric material.3. Thermal effects: at high temperatures, the molecules of the dielectric material may become so agitated that they can no longer respond to the applied voltage.4. Aging: over time, the dielectric material may degrade, reducing its ability to polarize in response to voltage.
