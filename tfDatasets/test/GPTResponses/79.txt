The main population source of the Portuguese people is a mixture of different ethnic groups, including Iberians (indigenous people of the Iberian Peninsula), Celts, Romans, Germanic tribes (Visigoths and Suebi), and Moors (North African Arabs and Berbers). Over time, these groups intermarried, resulting in a unique Portuguese identity and culture. Additionally, Portugal has a history of maritime exploration and colonialism, which led to the migration of Portuguese people, culture, and language to different parts of the world, such as Brazil, Angola, Mozambique, and other Portuguese-speaking countries.
