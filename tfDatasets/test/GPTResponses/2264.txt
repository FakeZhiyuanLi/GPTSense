The Estonian nationalist movement began in the late 19th century, around the time when Estonia was still part of the Russian Empire. Many Estonians wanted greater autonomy and national rights, and there were various cultural and political organizations formed to promote these goals. However, it wasn't until the aftermath of World War I and the fall of the Russian Empire that these nationalist aspirations began to take clearer shape, leading to the establishment of the first independent Estonian republic in 1918.
