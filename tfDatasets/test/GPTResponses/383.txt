Avicenna did not find any subject easier than medicine. He was a renowned physician and scholar who dedicated his life to the study and practice of medicine, as well as other fields such as philosophy, logic, astronomy, and mathematics. He believed that all knowledge was interconnected and that a deep understanding of various subjects was necessary to provide the best medical treatment. Therefore, Avicenna viewed medicine as a complex and interdisciplinary subject that required the integration of diverse knowledge and skills.
