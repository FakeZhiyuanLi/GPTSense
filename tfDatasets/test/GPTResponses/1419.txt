MTP (Media Transfer Protocol) was originally designed to facilitate the transfer of media files between digital cameras and personal computers. It was created as a standardized alternative to other proprietary protocols for the transfer of media files. Over time, MTP has become widely used for transferring media files between various devices, including smartphones, MP3 players, and tablets.
