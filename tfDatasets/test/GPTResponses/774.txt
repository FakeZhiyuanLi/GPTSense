Migrants from neighboring West African countries such as Burkina Faso, Mali, Guinea, and Senegal have worked on the Ivory Coast. They were primarily employed in the agriculture and mining sectors, working on cocoa, coffee, and rubber plantations, as well as in gold and diamond mines. Some migrants also worked in the construction and service industries. Many of these migrants were seasonal workers who moved back and forth between their home countries and the Ivory Coast. However, some chose to stay permanently and became part of the Ivorian society.
