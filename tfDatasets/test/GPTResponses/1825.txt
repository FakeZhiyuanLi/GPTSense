The true portrait of the no wave movement was characterized by its rejection of mainstream music, avant-garde experimentation, dissonant sounds, and nihilistic attitude. No wave was a short-lived scene that emerged from the New York City underground music scene in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It was a reaction against the polished, commercialized sound of punk and new wave music. No wave bands embraced an anti-commercial, anti-establishment philosophy that rejected traditional song structures, melody, and harmony. They used unconventional instruments, such as saxophones and metal percussion, and experimented with dissonant, abrasive sounds to create a chaotic, challenging musical experience. The movement was characterized by its emphasis on performance art and a provocative, confrontational style that rejected traditional standards of beauty and taste. Some of the most notable no wave bands include DNA, Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, and James Chance and the Contortions.
