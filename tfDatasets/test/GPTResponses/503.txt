Drug cartels often exploit child workers by forcing them to work in drug production and trafficking operations. Children may be used to grow and harvest illegal drugs, transport drugs across borders, or work in drug laboratories. These children are often subjected to dangerous working conditions, physical and emotional abuse, and exploitation by the drug cartels. In some cases, children may also be used as drug mules, carrying illegal drugs across borders in exchange for money or other rewards. The practice of using child workers in drug cartels is illegal and unethical, and can have long-term consequences for the physical and mental health of the children involved.
