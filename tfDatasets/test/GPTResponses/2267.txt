There are several other ways in which relativistic physics differs from classical physics, beyond the concept of invariance and symmetry groups. These include:1. Time dilation: In relativistic physics, time is not considered absolute, but instead depends on the observer's frame of reference. As objects move faster, time appears to slow down for them relative to objects at rest. This effect is known as time dilation.2. Length contraction: Similarly, objects moving at high speeds appear to be shorter in the direction of motion than objects at rest. This effect is known as length contraction.3. Lorentz transformations: To account for the effects of time dilation and length contraction, a new set of mathematical equations, known as the Lorentz transformations, were developed for relativistic physics. These equations relate the measurements made by observers in different frames of reference.4. Relativity of simultaneity: In classical physics, events that occur at the same time for one observer will also occur at the same time for all observers. However, in relativistic physics, this is not necessarily true. Observers moving at different speeds may not agree on the order in which events occur.5. Mass-energy equivalence: Perhaps the most famous concept in relativistic physics is the idea that mass and energy are equivalent, as expressed by the equation E=mcÂ². This means that an object's mass can be converted into energy, and vice versa.Overall, relativistic physics represents a major departure from classical physics, and requires a completely new set of mathematical tools and concepts to understand.
