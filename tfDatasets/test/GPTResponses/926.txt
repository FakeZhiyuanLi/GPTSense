The photoelectric effect is a phenomenon in which electrons are emitted from a metal surface when it is exposed to light of a certain frequency or energy. In other words, when light is shone on a metal surface, the electrons bound to the metal may absorb enough energy from the photons in the light to escape their attraction to the metal atoms, resulting in the emission of electrons. The photoelectric effect was first observed and explained by Albert Einstein in 1905 and has numerous practical applications, such as in solar panels and photocells.
