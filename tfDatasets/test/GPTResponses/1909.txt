The driving force behind voluntary green electricity within the EU is the growing public demand for sustainable and renewable energy sources. Many consumers are willing to pay a premium for electricity generated from renewable sources such as wind, solar, and hydro, in order to reduce their environmental impact and support the development of clean energy technologies. In response, many electricity providers and retailers in the EU have begun offering green electricity products, allowing customers to choose their electricity provider based on environmental criteria. Additionally, political initiatives, such as the EU Renewable Energy Directive, have established ambitious targets for increasing the share of renewable energy in the EU's energy mix, providing further incentives for voluntary uptake of green electricity.
