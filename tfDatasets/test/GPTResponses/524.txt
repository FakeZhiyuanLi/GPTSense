Warm air facilitates the transport of water vapor. When air temperature increases, the air molecules gain energy and move faster, which allows them to hold more water vapor. As a result, warm air has a greater capacity to hold moisture than cold air. When warm, moist air encounters cooler air, the cooler air cannot hold as much moisture and therefore the water vapor in the warm air is more likely to condense and form clouds. Additionally, warm air rises, which can create conditions for precipitation to occur as the air cools and releases its moisture.
