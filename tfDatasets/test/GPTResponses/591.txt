Corruption disregards ethical and moral values in politics. It manipulates and abuses power for personal gain or benefit, disregarding the well-being of society and the common good. Corruption creates an unfair advantage for those who engage in it, stifles economic growth, and undermines the rule of law. It erodes public trust in government institutions and hinders democracy. Corruption also creates a culture of impunity, where those who engage in corrupt practices believe they can get away with it.
