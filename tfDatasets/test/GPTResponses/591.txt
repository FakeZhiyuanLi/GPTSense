11 Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven."This passage describes Jesus' ascension into heaven after he had spent 40 days with his disciples following his resurrection. The disciples watched as Jesus was lifted up into the clouds and disappeared from their sight. Two angelic figures appeared to them and told them that Jesus would return in the same way he had left.While there is no detailed description of Jesus' physical appearance during his ascension, it is commonly believed by Christians that he ascended bodily into heaven. In art and popular culture, Jesus is often depicted with outstretched arms, signifying his ascent into heaven.
