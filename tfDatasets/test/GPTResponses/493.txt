The elements of federalism can be found in the United States Constitution, particularly in the text of the Tenth Amendment, which reserves certain powers to the states, and the Articles of Confederation, which established a weak central government and strong state governments. Additionally, the principles of federalism are further developed in court rulings and other legal precedents.
