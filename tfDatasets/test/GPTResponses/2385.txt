All CFL games can require tie-breaking rounds to continue until a winner results, including regular season games and playoff games. In the regular season, if a game ends in a tie after regulation time, there will be two five-minute halves played. If the game is still tied after these additional periods, the game will end in a tie.In the playoffs, if a game is tied after regulation time, there will be a full overtime period played. If the game remains tied after the first overtime period, the game will continue with additional overtime periods until a winner is determined. This is commonly referred to as sudden death overtime, as the first team to score in the overtime period wins the game.
