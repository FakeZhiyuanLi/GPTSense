In quantum mechanics, when a pair of alternatives are semantically determinate, it is frequently the case that they are complementary variables. This means that they are two properties of a quantum system that cannot be measured simultaneously with arbitrary precision. Examples of complementary variables include position and momentum, energy and time, and spin along different axes. This is known as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which states that the product of the uncertainties in the measurement of two complementary variables is always greater than or equal to a fundamental constant, known as Planck's constant.
