During development, the lower limbs of a tree may experience a reduction in growth or may even die off. This is because as the tree grows taller, the lower limbs receive less sunlight and nutrients, making them less efficient for the tree's survival. As a result, the tree may redirect its resources to the upper branches, which are more exposed to sunlight and have access to more nutrients, in order to continue growing taller and competing for sunlight with neighboring trees. Some trees, however, may sustain a healthy and vigorous crown throughout their lifespan, developing a well-structured canopy that allows efficient energy capture and growth.
