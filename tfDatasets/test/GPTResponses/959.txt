There is no specific script that runs counter to the traditional belief that the Qin Dynasty had one script only. In fact, the Qin Dynasty did standardize the writing system and created the basis for modern Chinese script. However, there were variations in the script during this time period and regional differences that continued to develop after the Qin Dynasty. Additionally, the traditional belief that the Qin Dynasty had one script only may be a simplification or misinterpretation of historical records.
