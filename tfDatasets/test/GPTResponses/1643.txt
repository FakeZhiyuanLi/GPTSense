The expansion of cultivation in the Ottoman Empire was caused by a combination of factors, including population growth, increased demand for agricultural products, advances in irrigation technology, and favorable government policies.As the Ottoman Empire's population grew, there was an increasing need for more food, raw materials, and other agricultural products. To meet this demand, farmers began to cultivate more land, particularly in areas that were previously unsuitable for agriculture due to lack of water or poor soil quality.Advances in irrigation technology, such as the introduction of the qanat system of underground canals, made it possible to bring water to previously barren areas and increase crop yields. This, in turn, allowed farmers to expand cultivation to more remote and arid regions of the empire.The Ottoman government also played a role in encouraging agricultural expansion by providing incentives to farmers, such as tax breaks and land grants, and investing in infrastructure projects like roads and irrigation systems.Overall, the development of agriculture in the Ottoman Empire was driven by a combination of natural and man-made factors, and was essential for supporting the growing needs of its population and economy.
