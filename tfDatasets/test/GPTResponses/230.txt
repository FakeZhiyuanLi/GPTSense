For example, some treaties may contain provisions for what to happen if one party violates the terms of the treaty or if there is a dispute between the parties. Other treaties may have provisions for what to do in the event of a natural disaster or a public health emergency. These provisions often outline specific steps, such as mediation or arbitration, that the parties should take in order to resolve the issue. Some treaties may also include provisions for adjusting the terms of the treaty over time as circumstances change. Overall, these provisions are designed to provide a framework for addressing various situations that may arise during the course of the treaty's implementation.
