Alexander's army finally mutinied in Opis, a city located in modern-day Iraq, in 324 BC. The mutiny occurred after Alexander decided to dismiss many of his veteran soldiers and replace them with Persians, which angered and disillusioned his troops who had been with him for years. The mutiny was eventually resolved after Alexander addressed his men and agreed to send them home with gifts and rewards.
