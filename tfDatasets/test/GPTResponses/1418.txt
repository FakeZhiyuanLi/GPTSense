In low capacitance devices, the dielectric material used is typically a low-loss material with a low dielectric constant. Examples of such dielectric materials include polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), ceramics, and glass. These materials have a low capacitance and can handle high frequencies without introducing significant losses. Additionally, they have good thermal stability and are chemically inert, making them suitable for a wide range of applications.
