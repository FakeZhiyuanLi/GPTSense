The social reform movement centered in Bengal in the 19th to early 20th century was known as the Bengal Renaissance. It was a cultural, social, and intellectual movement that aimed to reform the traditional Indian society and bring about modernity, education, and gender equality. The Bengal Renaissance was characterized by the efforts of writers, thinkers, and reformers like Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, and Swami Vivekananda who advocated for the eradication of social evils such as caste discrimination, Sati, child marriage, and illiteracy. They also emphasized the importance of western education, rational thinking, and scientific temper, which played a significant role in shaping the modern Indian society.
