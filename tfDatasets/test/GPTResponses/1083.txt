A watt balance, also known as a Kibble balance, is a scientific instrument that measures the mass of an object by relating it to electromagnetic forces. It does this by balancing mechanical forces against electrical forces using a precisely controlled electromagnetic field. The watt balance is used to redefine the unit of mass, the kilogram, in terms of fundamental constants of nature, such as the speed of light and Planck's constant. This allows for a more accurate and universal definition of the unit of mass.
