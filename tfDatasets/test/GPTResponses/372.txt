There is no definitive answer to how many times Avicenna read through the metaphysics of Aristotle, as there is no direct evidence on this matter. However, it is known that Avicenna was highly influenced by Aristotle's works and devoted a significant portion of his own writing to their interpretation and commentary. Avicenna's most famous work, The Book of Healing, includes a section on metaphysics that draws extensively from Aristotelian themes and concepts. Additionally, Avicenna's other works, such as The Canon of Medicine, indicate his familiarity with Aristotelian philosophy and its application to medicine and natural science. Therefore, it is safe to say that Avicenna read through Aristotle's metaphysics multiple times and deeply engaged with its ideas throughout his intellectual career.
