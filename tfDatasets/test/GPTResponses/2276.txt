The covariance group of the general theory of relativity is the covariance group of only one theory, which is the theory of gravity. The theory of general relativity describes the nature of gravity and the geometry of spacetime. The covariance group refers to the set of symmetries and transformations that leave the equations of the theory invariant, and this group describes the way in which the theory is independent of the choice of coordinates used to describe spacetime.
