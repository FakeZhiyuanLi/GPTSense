Bergschrunds and crevasses are both types of cracks or openings in glaciers or snowfields, but there are some differences between them:1. Origin: Bergschrunds are formed at the base of a glacier, where the ice is separated from the rock or debris underneath. Crevasses, on the other hand, are formed in the upper layers of the glacier, where the ice is subjected to tensile stress.2. Shape: Bergschrunds are usually wider than crevasses and have a more irregular shape. They can be several meters wide and deep, and may have a curved or stepped profile. Crevasses, in contrast, are usually narrower and longer, with a linear or diagonal shape.3. Hazard: Both bergschrunds and crevasses can pose a hazard to people traveling on or near the glacier. However, bergschrunds are generally considered to be more dangerous, as they can hide deep crevasses or seracs (blocks of ice) that can collapse suddenly, creating a crevasse field.4. Difficulty: Crossing a bergschrund is often more difficult and technical than crossing a crevasse. Bergschrunds require special techniques and equipment, such as ice screws, ropes, and anchors, to safely pass. Crevasses can often be crossed by using a ladder or snow bridge, or by simply jumping over them if they are narrow enough.
