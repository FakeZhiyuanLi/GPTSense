No, the redefinition of the kilogram was not solely based on the Planck constant. The previous definition of the kilogram was based on a physical object known as the International Prototype of the Kilogram, and its mass was defined as the exact mass of this object. However, this physical object could degrade over time, leading to inconsistencies in measurements.To address this issue, the new definition of the kilogram is based on the Planck constant, which is a fundamental constant of nature. The Planck constant relates the energy of a photon to its frequency and is used to determine the mass of an object based on its energy. Other constants of nature, such as the Avogadro constant, were also used to redefine the kilogram.In summary, while the Planck constant played a crucial role in the redefinition of the kilogram, it was not the only option. Other fundamental constants of nature were also considered and used to redefine the kilogram.
