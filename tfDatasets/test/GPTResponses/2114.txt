An artist who seemed to have been dominated by geometrical pattern and order is Piet Mondrian. His art style, known as De Stijl, was characterized by simple shapes and straight lines arranged in a grid-like pattern. Mondrian believed that art should be reduced to the basic elements of line, shape, and color, and that through this simplification, a universal harmony could be achieved. He used only primary colors and black and white in his compositions, further emphasizing the simplicity and order of his art.
