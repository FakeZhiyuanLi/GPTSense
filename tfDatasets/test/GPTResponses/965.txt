The energy of the photoelectrons depends on the frequency (or wavelength) of the light source, as well as the work function of the material that the light is shining on. The energy of photoelectrons is directly proportional to the frequency (or inversely proportional to the wavelength) of the incident light, as described by the photoelectric effect equation: E = hf - Φ, where E is the energy of the photoelectron, h is Planck's constant, f is the frequency of the incident light, and Φ is the work function of the material.
