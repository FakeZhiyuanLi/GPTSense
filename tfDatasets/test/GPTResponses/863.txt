Dr. Frederick Zugibe, a forensic pathologist, tried to prove his theories through various methods.1. Conducting experiments: Zugibe conducted several experiments to prove his theories about crucifixion. He studied the anatomy and physiology of the human body, and tried to replicate various aspects of crucifixion to understand how it affected the body.2. Performing autopsies: Zugibe performed several autopsies on people who had died from various causes, including crucifixion. He studied the wounds and injuries inflicted on the body and tried to understand how they contributed to death.3. Analyzing historical accounts: Zugibe analyzed historical accounts of crucifixion, including biblical texts and other ancient documents. He tried to understand how the practice of crucifixion evolved over time and how it was used in different cultures and societies.4. Consulting with other experts: Zugibe consulted with other experts in the fields of anatomy, physiology, and forensic pathology to gather additional insights and perspectives on his theories. He also presented his research at conferences and in academic journals to share his findings with other professionals in his field.
