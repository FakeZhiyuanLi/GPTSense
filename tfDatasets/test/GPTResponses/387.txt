To continue playback after 60 minutes, a laserdisc needed to have a feature called "Auto Reverse." This allowed the laserdisc player to automatically flip the disc over and continue playing the second side without any interruption. Some laserdiscs also had a special index signal or a noticeable pause in the picture and sound at the end of the first side, indicating to the player that it was time to reverse the disc.
