There are many parameter references other than CD parameters that can be used, depending on the context and application. Here are a few examples:1. File paths and file names - when working with files and directories, you can use parameters to specify file paths and names, such as %USERPROFILE%, %TEMP%, or %WINDIR%.2. User information - you can use parameters to refer to user information such as user name, user ID, or user group. For example, %USERNAME%, %USERID%, or %USERDOMAIN%.3. Environment variables - you can use parameters to refer to environment variables, such as %PATH%, %JAVA_HOME%, or %PYTHONPATH%.4. System information - you can use parameters to refer to system information such as the operating system version, computer name, or processor architecture. For example, %OSVERSION%, %COMPUTERNAME%, or %PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE%.5. Command line arguments - when running batch files or scripts from the command line, you can pass parameters as arguments to the command line. For example, myscript.bat arg1 arg2 arg3.6. Output from other commands - you can use parameters to capture the output of other commands or scripts and use it as input for subsequent commands or scripts. For example, dir > output.txt, where the output of the dir command is redirected to a file named output.txt.
