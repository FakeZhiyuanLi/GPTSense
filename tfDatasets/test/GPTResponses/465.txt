Ogives are formed by plotting the cumulative frequency of a data set on a graph. This graph is created by plotting the midpoint of each class interval on the x-axis and the cumulative frequency on the y-axis. The resulting curve is then smoothed out to create a gradual transition between each plotted point, forming a continuous line. The ogive can be used to visually represent the distribution of the data and allows for the easy determination of percentile values.
