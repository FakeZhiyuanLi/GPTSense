Von Neumann's model, also known as the von Neumann architecture, is an example of a computer architecture. This model serves as the basis for the design of most modern computers, including personal computers, servers, and supercomputers. It includes a central processing unit (CPU), memory, input/output devices, and a control unit that manages the flow of data between these components. The von Neumann architecture is named after mathematician and computer scientist John von Neumann, who first introduced the concept in the 1940s.
