The ownership over horses, wives, and wealth was regulated for Jewish kings in Deuteronomy.Deuteronomy 17:16-17 states, "The king, moreover, must not acquire great numbers of horses for himself, or make the people return to Egypt to get more of them, for the Lord has told you, ‘You are not to go back that way again.’ He must not take many wives, or his heart will be led astray. He must not accumulate large amounts of silver and gold."These restrictions were placed on Jewish kings to prevent them from becoming corrupt and losing focus on their duties as leaders chosen by God. It was also an attempt to limit their power and prevent them from becoming tyrannical rulers.
