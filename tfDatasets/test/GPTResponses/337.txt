Icebergs are formed when chunks of ice break off from glaciers or ice shelves into the ocean. This process is called calving. Icebergs are typically made of freshwater ice and can range in size from small pieces to massive structures that can be several hundred feet tall and many miles long. The size and shape of icebergs can be influenced by a variety of factors, such as the temperature and salinity of the water, the shape of the glacier or ice shelf, and the strength of ocean currents and winds. Some icebergs can float for years before finally melting away in warmer waters.
