Stimulus diffusion refers to the spread of an idea or innovation from one culture to another, with modifications or adaptations to suit the receiving culture's needs or preferences. It is a type of cultural diffusion in which an original concept is altered or transformed as it passes from one group to another. This can occur through direct contact or indirect means, such as media, social networks or marketing. The term was coined by anthropologist and linguist Edward Sapir in the early 20th century.
