There are many larvae that live like plankton, including:1. Zooplanktonic larvae of marine invertebrates such as crabs, shrimp, fish, sea urchins, and mollusks.2. Cnidarian larvae such as the planula larva of jellyfish and the polypod larva of corals.3. Larvae of marine worms such as polychaetes, which are known as trochophores.4. Larvae of some insects such as black flies, midges, and mosquitoes, which are known as aquatic larvae.5. Larvae of some amphibians such as frogs and salamanders, which are known as tadpoles.These larvae live in the open ocean and drift passively with the current until they reach their adult habitat. They are an important part of the ocean food chain and are essential for the survival of many marine organisms.
