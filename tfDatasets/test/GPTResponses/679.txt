After Max Planck's discovery in 1900, it was realized that physical action values were quantized, meaning that they exist in discrete, indivisible units. This was a fundamental departure from classical physics, which assumed that all physical quantities were continuous and could take on any value. Planck's discovery of this quantization of action led to the development of quantum mechanics and revolutionized our understanding of the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic level.
