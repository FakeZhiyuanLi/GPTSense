The idea of text in cultural studies can also include other forms of communication such as graphic novels, advertisements, photographs, music videos, television shows, movies, and social media posts. All of these forms of communication convey meaning and contribute to our understanding of culture and society. In cultural studies, the analysis of these non-written texts is often referred to as visual culture, media studies, or popular culture.
