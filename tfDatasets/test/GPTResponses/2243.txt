Yes, New Mexico's Spanish dialect (also known as New Mexican Spanish) is distinct from other Spanish dialects due to its mixture of vocabulary and grammar influences from both Spanish and Nahuatl (an indigenous language of Mexico). It also incorporates some unique words and phrases that are not commonly used in other Spanish-speaking regions. Additionally, the pronunciation and intonation of New Mexican Spanish are also distinct.
