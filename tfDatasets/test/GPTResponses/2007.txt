The incentive to use 100 percent renewable energy is driven by several factors, including:1. Climate Change: The use of fossil fuels is the primary cause of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. Switching to renewable energy sources eliminates the use of fossil fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the effects of climate change.2. Energy Security: Renewable energy is domestically available and does not rely on foreign oil sources. This reduces the vulnerability of countries to external energy supply disruptions and price spikes.3. Cost Savings: Renewable energy technologies have become more affordable, and their prices are continuing to decline. Using renewable energy can help reduce energy costs over the long run.4. Environmental Impact: Renewable energy sources have a much smaller environmental impact than traditional energy sources. They produce little or no greenhouse gas emissions, consume fewer resources, and have a lower impact on ecosystems.5. Health Benefits: Fossil fuel emissions are associated with various health concerns, including respiratory diseases and cancer. The use of renewable energy reduces these health risks, resulting in improved public health.
