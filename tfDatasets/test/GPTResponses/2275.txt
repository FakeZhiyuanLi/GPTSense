Density of oxygen like that of sea-level atmosphere is needed to breathe comfortably and sustain life. Oxygen is essential for the process of respiration and the human body needs a certain amount of it to function properly. At higher altitudes, the density of oxygen decreases, making it difficult to breathe and causing altitude sickness. Therefore, having a density of oxygen like that of sea-level atmosphere is crucial for human survival. Additionally, a certain density of oxygen is required for combustion to occur in fires and engines.
