Many plants are green because their cells contain chlorophyll, a pigment that absorbs light energy from the sun and converts it into chemical energy through a process called photosynthesis. Chlorophyll reflects green light, which is why plants appear green to the human eye. This allows the plant to utilize the energy from the sun to produce sugars and other organic compounds that it needs to grow and survive.
