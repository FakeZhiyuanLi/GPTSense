There is no definitive answer to this question as historical depictions of crosses vary widely in their design and number of "ends." Some crosses may have had just two "ends," while others may have had three, four, or more. Moreover, in the case of the Christian cross, different religious traditions have used different styles of cross, with varying numbers and arrangements of "ends." Ultimately, the number of ends on a cross depends on its specific cultural, religious, or artistic context.
