The part of the wire involved in phase break sections and arc drawing is typically the conductor or electrical wire carrying the electrical current. When a break occurs in the wire, such as due to damage or mechanical stress, the electrical current may arc or jump across the gap, potentially causing damage or other issues. Proper electrical maintenance and inspection can help prevent these types of problems.
