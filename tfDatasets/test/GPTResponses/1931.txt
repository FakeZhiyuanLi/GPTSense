There is no clear consensus among historians and scholars about the tutelary god of Wilusa, which is believed to be the ancient city of Troy. Different cultures and mythologies had their own gods and goddesses associated with Troy, and there were also localized deities who were worshipped in specific areas or communities within the city. Some of the gods and goddesses who were commonly associated with Troy include Apollo, Athena, Hera, and Poseidon among others. However, the specific tutelary god of Wilusa is unclear and remains a subject of debate and speculation.
