The Christian religion, particularly the Roman Catholic Church, as well as some branches of Protestantism, believe in the concept of God's simplicity and his immutability, which means that God is unchanging and not subject to time. Many theologians and philosophers like Thomas Aquinas, Augustine, and Anselm have explored the concept of God's simplicity and its implications for understanding God's nature and attributes.
