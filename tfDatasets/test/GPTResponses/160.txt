The process that converts solar energy into storable and transportable fuels is called artificial photosynthesis. It involves using a device called a photovoltaic cell to capture sunlight and convert it into electricity. This electricity is then used to power a chemical reaction where water molecules are split into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen gas can be stored as a fuel, while the oxygen can be released back into the atmosphere. This process produces a renewable and sustainable source of energy that can be used to power vehicles and homes.
