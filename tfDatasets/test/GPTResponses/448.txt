PAL and SECAM were color systems used for analog television broadcasting. PAL (Phase Alternating Line) was developed in Germany and used in most of Europe, Australia, and parts of Asia and Africa. Meanwhile, SECAM (Sequential Color with Memory) was developed in France and used in France, Russia, and some other countries in Europe and Africa. Both systems worked by using a combination of three primary colors (red, blue, and green) to create a full color image on a television screen.
