In the 1800 election, Thomas Jefferson received the second vote because the process at that time did not differentiate between the votes for President and Vice President. Each elector cast two votes, and the candidate who received the most votes became President, while the runner-up became Vice President. In this election, Aaron Burr tied with Jefferson for the most votes, but ultimately Jefferson was chosen as President by the House of Representatives.
