However, these changes were not without difficulties and there were conflicts and instability in some regions of the former Soviet Union.Additionally, the departure of Gorbachev marked the end of the Cold War era and a shift in global politics. The United States emerged as the sole superpower and there was a wave of globalization that swept across the world.Overall, the departure of Gorbachev marked a turning point not just for the Soviet Union, but for the world as a whole.
