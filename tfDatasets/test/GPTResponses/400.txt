CLV (constant linear velocity) format allows for more playback time per side compared to CAV (constant angular velocity) format. In CLV format, the disc is divided into several zones with varying linear speeds, allowing more data to be stored in each zone. CAV format uses a constant rotation speed, resulting in a shorter playback time per side.
