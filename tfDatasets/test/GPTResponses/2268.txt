A mass spectrometer measures the mass-to-charge ratio of ions in a gas sample to determine the composition and concentration of the gas. To do this accurately, the instrument must operate at a high vacuum to prevent interference from other gas molecules in the sample chamber. However, at high vacuum levels, it becomes difficult to accurately measure pressure using traditional pressure gauges since they rely on the detection of gas molecules colliding with a sensing mechanism.Therefore, a mass spectrometer often needs to be used in conjunction with a gauge that operates on a different principle, such as a capacitance manometer or a Pirani gauge. These gauges can accurately measure pressures in the high vacuum range and provide feedback to the mass spectrometer to ensure precise gas measurements. Without a reliable pressure measurement, the accuracy and precision of the mass spectrometerâ€™s gas measurements would be compromised.
