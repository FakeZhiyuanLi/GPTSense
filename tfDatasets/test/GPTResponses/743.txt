Conservationists are concerned about the development of rivers that cause harm to aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, disrupt natural habitats, and threaten biodiversity. They are particularly concerned about:1. Damming and diversion of rivers for energy production or irrigation purposes, which can harm fish species and other aquatic animals, affect riverine ecosystems, and reduce water availability downstream.2. Mining and infrastructure development near rivers, which can lead to soil erosion, deforestation, and habitat fragmentation, disrupting the natural balance of river ecosystems.3. Pollution from industrial, agricultural, and domestic sources, which can degrade water quality, threaten human health, and damage aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.4. Climate change and its impact on rivers, which can cause flooding, erosion, and other damages that affect river ecosystems and surrounding communities.Overall, conservationists aim to promote sustainable river management practices that balance human needs with ecological resilience and biodiversity conservation.
