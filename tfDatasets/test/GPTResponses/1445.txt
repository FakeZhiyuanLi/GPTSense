The division rate of the TB bacterium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is relatively slow compared to other bacteria. It has a generation time of around 24 hours, which is much longer than many other bacterial species that can divide every few hours. This slow division rate is part of what makes M. tuberculosis such a challenging pathogen to treat and eradicate.
