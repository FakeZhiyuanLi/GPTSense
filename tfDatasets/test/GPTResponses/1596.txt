During World War II, Londoners used a variety of bomb shelters, ranging from public air-raid shelters to private home shelters. Some of the most common types of bomb shelters included:1. Underground stations: Many underground stations in London were converted into air-raid shelters during the war. These stations provided a safe place for people to wait out air raids, and were equipped with bunks, first aid stations, and other amenities.2. Anderson shelters: These small, prefabricated shelters were distributed to families by the government. They were made of corrugated steel and could be erected in a backyard or garden. Anderson shelters were designed to protect against shrapnel and debris, but were not completely blast-proof.3. Morrison shelters: These were larger, indoor shelters that could be installed in a home. They were made of steel mesh and had a flat top, so that they could be used as a table when not in use as a shelter.4. Public air-raid shelters: In addition to underground stations, the government also built public air-raid shelters throughout the city. These shelters were often located in parks or other open spaces, and could hold hundreds of people.5. Private home shelters: Some Londoners built their own bomb shelters in their gardens or basements. These shelters ranged from simple earth bunkers to more elaborate structures made of brick or concrete.
