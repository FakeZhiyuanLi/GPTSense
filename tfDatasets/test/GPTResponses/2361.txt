Thermosphere is the outermost layer of the atmosphere, and it extends from the mesopause (which separates it from the mesosphere) to the exosphere (which separates it from outer space). The Karman line, located at an altitude of about 100 km above sea level, is often used as a boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and outer space.The reason why the thermosphere past the Karman line varies so greatly is because of two main factors:1. Solar activity: The thermosphere is highly influenced by variations in solar activity, particularly solar flares and coronal mass ejections. These events can cause significant increases in the amount of energy and particles reaching the thermosphere, which can lead to heating of the atmosphere and expansion of the thermosphere. This can cause the altitude of the thermosphere to increase by several kilometers.2. Atmospheric drag: Even though the thermosphere is extremely thin (less than 0.1% of the density of the Earth's atmosphere at sea level), it still experiences some drag from the residual gases and particles at that altitude. This drag can cause the thermosphere to contract and expand depending on the amount of solar activity and the density of the residual gases.Therefore, the thermosphere past the Karman line varies greatly based on the level of solar activity and the variation of residual gases and particles at that altitude.
