Voltage reversal can occur in RLC circuits when the inductive reactance and capacitive reactance are equal and cancel each other out, resulting in a purely resistive circuit. At this point, the voltage across the circuit reaches zero, and the current continues to flow in the opposite direction, causing a voltage reversal. This phenomenon is also known as resonant frequency in AC circuits.
