The colonial government expanded its territory and control by legal means, such as through land purchases and treaties with Native American tribes, as well as through the establishment of new colonies and the annexation of neighboring lands. They also passed laws and regulations to encourage settlement and economic growth, such as offering land grants and tax incentives to colonists. Additionally, they used their legal authority to impose their own government and legal systems on the colonies, cementing their control over these territories.
