Yes, there have been instances where an elector voted for the same candidate to be both president and vice president. The most famous occurrence of this was in the 1800 U.S. presidential election when Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr each received 73 electoral votes. As a result, the election was sent to the House of Representatives to break the tie. Alexander Hamilton, who despised Burr, urged Federalist House members to vote for Jefferson, whom he deemed less dangerous than Burr. After 36 rounds of voting, Jefferson was eventually elected president, and Burr became vice president.
