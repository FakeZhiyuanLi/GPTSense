In 2006, then-Senator John Kerry made a controversial comment about the Iraq War, saying, "You know, education, if you make the most of it, you study hard, you do your homework and you make an effort to be smart, you can do well. If you don't, you get stuck in Iraq." Many interpreted this as a criticism of the intelligence of soldiers serving in Iraq, even though Kerry later clarified that he had intended to criticize the administration's policies.
