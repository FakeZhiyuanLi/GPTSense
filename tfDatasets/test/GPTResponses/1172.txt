Free black people in the United States migrated to places such as Canada, the Caribbean, and West Africa because of the looser social system. Some also migrated to urban areas in the United States, such as New York City, where they could find more opportunities and a community of other free black people. Others joined abolitionist movements and relocated to communities established by white abolitionists, like the utopian community of New Philadelphia, located in Illinois.
