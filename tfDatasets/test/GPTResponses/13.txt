Sophie Germain primes are a type of prime number, meaning they are integers that are only divisible by 1 and themselves. They are named after the French mathematician Sophie Germain, who made important contributions to number theory in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.Specifically, Sophie Germain primes are prime numbers p such that 2p + 1 is also a prime number. For example, the first few Sophie Germain primes are:- 2 (since 2*2 + 1 = 5 is also prime)- 3 (since 2*3 + 1 = 7 is also prime)- 5 (since 2*5 + 1 = 11 is also prime)- 11 (since 2*11 + 1 = 23 is also prime)- 23 (since 2*23 + 1 = 47 is also prime)And so on. Sophie Germain primes are quite rare compared to regular primes, but they have interesting properties and applications in cryptography and other fields.
