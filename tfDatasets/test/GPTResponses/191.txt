A dominant-party system is a type of political system in which one political party has a clear and consistent advantage over competing parties, often resulting in the party's long-term control of the government. Although other parties may exist and occasionally win seats, they are unable to adequately challenge the dominant party's power. Examples of dominant-party systems include the Communist Party of China and the African National Congress in South Africa.
