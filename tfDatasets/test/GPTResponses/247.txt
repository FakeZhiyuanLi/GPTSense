In the 20th century, children were employed in various industries such as textiles, mining, agriculture, and domestic services. They were also employed as newsboys, street vendors, and in other forms of informal work. Child labor was prevalent in many countries, including the United States, Europe, and developing nations. Many children worked in hazardous conditions and for long hours, without proper education or healthcare. However, efforts were made to abolish child labor by the governments, international organizations, and civil society groups. Today, child labor continues to be a major concern in some parts of the world, despite the efforts made to eradicate it.
