The fluid in a manual pump is pushed into the pump's cavity when a small sealed cavity is expanded due to the principle of fluid mechanics known as Pascal's law. This law states that any change in pressure applied to an enclosed fluid at rest is transmitted uniformly in all directions and acts with the same force on all surfaces in contact with the fluid.When a small sealed cavity in a manual pump is expanded, it creates a low-pressure zone that causes the fluid to flow from an external source to fill the cavity. As the cavity is then compressed by a plunger or piston, the pressure inside the cavity increases, causing the fluid to be forced out of the pump and into a discharge pipe or hose.Thus, the fluid in a manual pump is pushed into the pump's cavity when a small sealed cavity is expanded due to the pressure difference created by Pascal's law.
