The Endangered Species Conservation Act (ESCA), passed in 1969, was the first federal law to provide protection and conservation strategies for endangered species in the United States. The ESCA provided several benefits for endangered species, including:1. Protection from hunting and exploitation: The ESCA made it illegal to hunt, kill, or sell any endangered species listed under the act. This greatly reduced the number of endangered species that were being hunted for profit or sport.2. Protection of habitat: The act required federal agencies to consult with the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) before taking any actions that might affect endangered species or their habitats. This helped to protect the habitats of endangered species from development, logging, and other activities that could damage or destroy them.3. Establishment of recovery plans: The USFWS was required to develop recovery plans for each endangered species listed under the act. These plans provided a roadmap for conserving and recovering each species, including goals, strategies, and timelines.4. Funding for conservation efforts: The ESCA established a fund to support conservation efforts for endangered species. This funding has been used to support research, monitor populations, and restore habitats.Overall, the Endangered Species Conservation Act helped to protect and conserve endangered species by prohibiting hunting and exploitation, protecting habitats, establishing recovery plans, and providing funding for conservation efforts.
