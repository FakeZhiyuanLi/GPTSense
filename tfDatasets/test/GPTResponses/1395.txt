Caoshu (草书) is a style of Chinese calligraphy that originated in the Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE), and became popular in the Eastern Jin dynasty (317 – 419 CE). It is characterized by its cursive, flowing brushwork, and simplified characters that are often abbreviated and linked together. Caoshu was developed for practical purposes, such as record-keeping and note-taking, and was often used by scholars and officials for writing official documents. Today, caoshu is considered a unique form of art and many calligraphers still practice and appreciate its beauty.
