The Egyptians were constructing large buildings as early as the Old Kingdom period (2686-2181 BC), with the construction of pyramids including the Great Pyramid of Giza. However, large scale building construction continued throughout the New Kingdom period (1550-1070 BC), with the construction of temples, tombs, and other monumental structures.
