The process by which macrophages try to get rid of the tuberculosis (TB) bacterium includes the following steps:1. Recognition and engulfment: When TB bacteria enter the lungs, they are recognized by macrophages as foreign invaders. The macrophages engulf the bacteria and try to destroy them.2. Formation of phagosome: The engulfed bacteria are enclosed within a membrane-bound compartment called a phagosome.3. Acidification of phagosome: The phagosome moves towards the lysosome, a cellular organelle that contains enzymes to break down the bacteria. The pH of the phagosome becomes more acidic, which helps to activate the enzymes.4. Fusion with lysosome: The phagosome fuses with the lysosome, creating a phagolysosome. The enzymes within the lysosome start to break down the TB bacteria.5. Release of bacteria: During this process, some of the TB bacilli may resist destruction and multiply within the macrophages, eventually causing the macrophage to burst and releasing bacteria into the surrounding tissue.In addition to these steps, macrophages also release cytokines and chemokines, which recruit other immune cells to the site of infection and activate them to fight TB infection. This process is important for the control of TB infection and the prevention of its spread.
