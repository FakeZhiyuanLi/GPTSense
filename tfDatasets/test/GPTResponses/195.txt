The epistemological shift away from positivist traditions in anthropology began to emerge in the mid to late 20th century, as anthropologists began to question the assumptions and methods of positivism, which emphasizes the use of scientific methods and empirical data to understand the social world. This shift was influenced by a number of factors, including critiques of colonialism and imperialism, postcolonial theory, feminist theory, and the recognition of indigenous knowledge systems. Some key developments in this shift include the emergence of interpretive anthropology, postmodernism, and critical anthropology.
