The number of devices that can be connected to a host controller depends on the type of host controller and the specific interface it uses.For example, a USB 2.0 host controller can support up to 127 devices, while a USB 3.0 host controller can support up to 127 devices per port and up to 16 ports, for a total of 2,032 devices.Similarly, a PCI Express host controller can support multiple devices, but the number of devices it can support depends on the number of available PCIe lanes and the bandwidth of the interface.In general, the number of devices that can be connected to a host controller is limited by the available bandwidth and the power supply of the host system.
