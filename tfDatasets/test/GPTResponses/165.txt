Time has an effect on the amount of available solar energy because solar energy is dependent on the position of the sun in the sky. The amount of solar energy that a specific location receives is determined by the angle at which the sun's rays hit it. The sun's angle changes throughout the day as it moves across the sky, and it is highest in the sky at solar noon. Therefore, the amount of available solar energy is highest around solar noon, and reduces as the sun moves closer to the horizon during sunrise and sunset. Additionally, the amount of available solar energy is affected by the season, because the angle at which the sun's rays hit a location changes as the Earth's position in relation to the sun changes throughout the year.
