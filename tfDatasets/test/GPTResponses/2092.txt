In 2012, the Cypriot economy was severely affected by the European sovereign debt crisis. The country's banking sector was particularly hit as it was heavily invested in Greek government bonds, which suffered significant losses. As a result of this, many Cypriot banks faced liquidity problems, and the government had to step in with a bailout package to rescue the banking system. This caused a sharp decline in the Cypriot economy, with GDP falling by around 5.9% in 2012. Additionally, the country's dependence on the tourism industry meant that the economic slowdown in Europe had a direct impact on the Cypriot economy, leading to widespread job losses and economic hardship. The crisis also caused a decline in foreign investment, as investors became wary of the country's financial stability.
