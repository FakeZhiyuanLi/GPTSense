Child creuseurs are children who work in mines to extract minerals and other raw materials. These children are often forced to work long hours in dangerous and hazardous conditions in the mining industry, particularly in countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, where child labor is prevalent. The work of child creuseurs is often characterized by physical labor, heavy lifting, and exposure to toxic chemicals, which can result in serious health problems and social consequences such as child trafficking, school dropout, and poverty.
