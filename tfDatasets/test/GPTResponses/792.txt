The anti-nazi propaganda machine had been running for several years before the signing of the pact. It began in the 1930s when Hitler rose to power in Germany and continued throughout the 1930s as Nazi aggression increased in Europe. The propaganda machine was particularly active in countries threatened by Nazi expansion, such as Britain and France. It was also active in the United States, where many Americans were concerned about the rise of Nazi Germany and the potential threat it posed to American interests. So, it can be said that the anti-nazi propaganda machine ran for about a decade before the pact-signing.
