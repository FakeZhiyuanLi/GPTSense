A pipe is a communication channel or mechanism that allows two processes or programs to communicate with each other by using standard input and output streams. It is a method for passing data between processes in a Unix-like operating system. A pipe connects the output of one command to the input of another command, allowing them to work together seamlessly. The symbol used to represent a pipe is the vertical bar or " | ".
