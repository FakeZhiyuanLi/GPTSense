The decrease in capacitance in ceramic capacitors as they age is primarily due to the migration of charged ions within the ceramic material. This migration occurs as a result of the electric field within the capacitor, which can cause the charged ions to move from one part of the ceramic to another. Over time, this movement can cause physical changes in the ceramic structure, which can ultimately result in a decrease in capacitance. Similarly, exposure to high temperatures, humidity, and other environmental factors can also cause physical changes within the ceramic material, leading to a reduction in capacitance.
