An example of when there exists a potential difference across the conductors is when a battery is connected to a circuit. The battery creates a potential difference between the positive and negative terminals, creating an electric field that pushes electrons through the circuit. This potential difference is what allows electrical energy to flow through the circuit and power devices connected to it.
