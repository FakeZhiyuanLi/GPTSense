There are several texts that mention Avicenna's debates with other scholars, but one example is from the introduction to his book, "The Book of Healing." In this introduction, he describes how he was able to debate with the greatest scholars of his time, including theologians, astronomers, mathematicians, and philosophers. He writes, "I have disputed with men of all faculties and sciences, and they have disputed with me, but I have always been the victor in these debates." This statement is a proof that Avicenna debated philosophy with some of the greatest scholars of his time.
