The Tibetan name for the area depends on which area is being referred to. Tibet is known as བོད་ (Bö in Tibetan), but specific regions within Tibet have their own names, such as ནག་པོ་ (Nagpo) for the Nagchu region, བླ་མ་ (Lama) for the Lhasa region, སྐྱོ་མི་རིགས་དངོས་ (Kyomirik Dzong) for the Shigatse region, etc.
