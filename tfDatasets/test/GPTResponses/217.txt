In his lattice work, von Neumann used the following axioms:1. The lattice is a partially ordered set, meaning that there is a relation of order between its elements.2. The lattice is complete, meaning that for any subset of its elements, there is a greatest lower bound (infimum) and a least upper bound (supremum).3. The lattice is distributive, meaning that for any three elements a, b, and c, (a∧b)∨c = (a∨c)∧(b∨c) and (a∨b)∧c = (a∧c)∨(b∧c).4. The lattice has a least element, denoted by 0, and a greatest element, denoted by 1.5. For any two elements a and b in the lattice, a∨b and a∧b exist.These axioms form the basis for the mathematical theory of lattices, which has applications in various fields including computer science, physics, and economics.
