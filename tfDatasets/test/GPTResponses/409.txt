After the death of Harsha, his empire gradually disintegrated due to several factors such as weak successors, invasions by the Huns, and rebellions by the local chieftains. The Gupta Empire, which had previously been weakened, also took advantage of the situation and regained some of its lost territory. Eventually, the empire fractured into smaller kingdoms, marking the end of the Harsha era.
