One significant alternative to MP3 is FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec), which compresses audio files without any loss of quality. It is a popular format for audiophiles and music producers who require high fidelity audio. Another alternative is AAC (Advanced Audio Coding), which is used by Apple and is known for its better sound quality compared to MP3 at lower bitrates. Lastly, OGG Vorbis is an open-source alternative that provides better compression and higher sound quality than MP3.
