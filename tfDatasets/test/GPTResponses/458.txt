Child labor was prevalent in Australia during the 19th century, particularly in industries such as mining, agriculture, and manufacturing. Young children were often employed in hazardous and physically demanding work, and worked long hours for minimal pay. However, in the early 20th century, reforms were implemented to improve working conditions and protect children's rights, resulting in a significant reduction of child labor in Australia. Today, child labor is illegal and strictly enforced in Australia.
