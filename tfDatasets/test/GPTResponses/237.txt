The uncertainty principle is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics that states that it is not possible to simultaneously determine certain pairs of physical properties, such as the position and momentum of a particle, with absolute precision. The more precise the measurement of one property, the less precise the measurement of the other property becomes. This is not due to any limitations in measurement techniques, but rather arises from the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics. The uncertainty principle is a result of the wave-particle duality of matter, which means that particles can exhibit behaviors of both waves and particles simultaneously, making it impossible to precisely determine their positions and momenta at the same time.
