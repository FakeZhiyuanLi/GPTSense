During the Industrial Revolution, the working child faced several issues such as long working hours, dangerous working conditions, low wages, lack of education, and exploitation by employers. The children were often employed in mills, mines, factories, and other hazardous workplaces which exposed them to various health hazards and injuries. The working conditions were harsh, and they had to work for long hours, often up to 16 hours a day, with little rest or breaks. Moreover, children received lower wages than adults and were often treated poorly by their employers. This led to a widespread movement for child labor laws to improve the living and working conditions of children.
