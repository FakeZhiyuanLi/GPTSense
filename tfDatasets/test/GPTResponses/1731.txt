The primary constraint on the physical growth of an insect is its exoskeleton. The exoskeleton serves as a protective armor for the insect's body, but it also limits the insect's ability to grow. As the insect grows bigger, its exoskeleton must molt or shed, and a new larger exoskeleton emerges. The insect's growth is therefore constrained by the size of its exoskeleton and the molting process.
