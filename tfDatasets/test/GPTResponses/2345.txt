The Chamorros were not brought to Guam, as they are the indigenous people of the island. They have been living on the island of Guam for more than 4,000 years. However, Guam was colonized by the Spanish in 1668, and during this period many Chamorros were forced to convert to Christianity and forced into labor, leading to a significant decline in their population. Additionally, during World War II, many Chamorros were forced into internment camps by the Japanese occupation.
