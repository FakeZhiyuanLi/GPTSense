Professional teams have always dominated the Canadian football championship, known as the Grey Cup. The first Grey Cup game was played in 1909 and has always been contested by amateur and professional teams. However, starting in the 1950s, the rise of professional football in Canada led to an increasing number of professional teams winning the Grey Cup. Currently, all teams in the Canadian Football League (CFL) are professional.
