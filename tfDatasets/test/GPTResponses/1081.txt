As an Arab nationalist, Egyptian leader Gamal Abdel Nasser was vehemently anti-imperialist. He believed that imperialism was exploitative and oppressive, and that it only served the interests of the imperialist powers at the expense of the colonized peoples. Nasser felt that imperialism had been responsible for the poverty and underdevelopment of many African and Asian countries, and he believed that these countries needed to liberate themselves from colonialism and imperialism in order to achieve true independence and self-determination. Nasser was a strong advocate of Pan-Arabism, which aimed to unite all Arab peoples into a single political entity that would be free from foreign domination. He believed that the only way for the Arab world to achieve true independence and development was through a process of modernization that emphasized education, industrialization, and technological advancement.
