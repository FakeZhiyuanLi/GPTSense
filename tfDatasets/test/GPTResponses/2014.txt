According to Greek mythology, Zeus struck down Asclepius with a lightning bolt because Asclepius had the power to bring the dead back to life. This was considered a violation of the natural order and threatened the balance between life and death. Zeus felt that only the gods should have the power to control life and death, not mortals or demigods like Asclepius.
