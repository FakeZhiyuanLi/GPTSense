To reject a cabinet's policy, a vote of no confidence can be initiated by the opposition or members of the governing party. This vote is typically held in the legislature, where lawmakers vote on whether they have confidence in the current government and its policies. If the majority of lawmakers vote against the government, the cabinet must either resign or call for new elections. Additionally, public pressure and protests can also lead to a cabinet rethinking its policies or ultimately resigning.
