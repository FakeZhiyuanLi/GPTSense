The foundation for Federalist Paper No. 39 is the debate over the ratification of the United States Constitution. James Madison and his Federalist colleagues argued in favor of ratification while anticipating objections from anti-Federalists who believed that the new Constitution would centralize too much power in the federal government. The paper aims to address these concerns by exploring the degree to which the Constitution balances power between the federal government and the individual states, and how it satisfies both federal and national principles of government. The foundation of the paper lies in an analysis of the structure and powers of the new government, as well as its relationship to the states, in order to defend the Constitution's proposed design.
