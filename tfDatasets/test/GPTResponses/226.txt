There are several reasons why birds are prone to parasites and pathogens:1. Migration: Birds typically migrate long distances, which increases their exposure to different environments and potentially infectious agents.2. Social behavior: Birds often travel and live in flocks, which can increase their risk of exposure to parasites and diseases.3. Feeding behavior: Birds have different feeding habits, some of which require them to forage on the ground or in water, where they can come into contact with pathogens and parasites.4. Immune system: Birds have a different immune system from mammals, which makes them more susceptible to certain infectious agents.5. Body temperature: Birds have a higher body temperature than mammals, which can create an environment that is optimal for certain parasites to thrive.6. Molecular makeup: Birds have different molecular makeup in their blood than mammals, making them more vulnerable to some infectious agents.
