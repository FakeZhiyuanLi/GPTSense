Transverse crevasses typically form on the upper part of a glacier where the ice is flowing downhill and encounters a steep change in the slope or a sharp bend in the glacier's path. These crevasses are oriented perpendicular to the flow direction and are caused by the differential motion of the ice as it flows under tension across an uneven surface. They can pose a significant hazard for mountaineers and skiers traversing glaciers, as they can be hidden beneath snow or bridge over with snow and collapse unexpectedly.
