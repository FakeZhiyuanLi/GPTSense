The coelomata (body cavity) of leeches are lined by a layer of mesodermal cells called the mesothelium. This layer is composed of flattened cells that form a thin, continuous layer on the inner surface of the coelomic cavity. The mesothelium plays an important role in the maintenance of the coelomic fluid, which is responsible for various physiological processes in the body of the leech.
