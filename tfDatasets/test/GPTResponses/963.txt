Education: Pursuing education and acquiring skills, either through vocational training or college, can help young people improve their prospects for employment and higher income.2. Entrepreneurship: Starting their own business or venture can provide a way out of poverty, especially if they can find a niche market or apply their skills in a unique way.3. Community programs: Participating in community programs that provide mentorship, skills training, and support can help young people build social connections and gain access to resources that can assist them in overcoming poverty.4. Social safety nets: Access to social safety nets, such as food assistance, housing assistance, and healthcare, can help reduce the negative impact of poverty on young people and their families.5. Mentoring: Finding a mentor or positive role model who can guide and support them in pursuing their goals can be a powerful way for young people to break out of poverty.
