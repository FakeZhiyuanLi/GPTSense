The Endangered Species Act (ESA) has had significant impacts on other agencies that were not specifically mentioned in the act. Some of the ways in which the ESA has affected other agencies include:1. The Department of Transportation: The ESA requires federal agencies to consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) or the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) before funding or approving any actions that could harm endangered species or their habitats. As a result, the Department of Transportation has had to ensure that its transportation projects do not harm endangered species.2. The U.S. Forest Service: The ESA requires federal agencies to designate critical habitat for endangered species. The U.S. Forest Service, which manages millions of acres of federal land, has had to identify and protect critical habitat for endangered species that live within the forests.3. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers: Construction activities that could impact endangered species require a consultation with FWS. The Army Corps has had to ensure that any activities it approves, such as the construction of levees or dams, comply with the ESA and do not harm endangered species.4. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA): The ESA requires that pesticides and other chemicals be reviewed to ensure they do not harm endangered species. The EPA has had to consider the potential impacts of chemicals on endangered species when evaluating their safety.Overall, the ESA has impacted many federal agencies that are involved in activities that could potentially harm endangered species. These agencies have had to ensure that they comply with the ESA and take actions to protect endangered species and their habitats.
