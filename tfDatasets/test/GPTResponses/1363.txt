One type of circuit in which voltage and current reversal are affected by damping is a series RLC circuit. In this circuit, when the circuit is first powered on, the current flow will be high and the voltage across the resistor will also be high. As the energy stored in the inductor and capacitor is dissipated through damping, the current flow will decrease and the voltage across the capacitor and inductor will decrease. Eventually, the current flow and voltage across the resistor will reverse direction and begin oscillating back and forth between positive and negative values at a frequency determined by the values of the R, L, and C components in the circuit. This phenomenon is called voltage and current reversal or resonance.
