Theism generally refers to the belief in one or more gods or a supreme being who is the creator and ruler of the universe, and who may be involved in human affairs. It is often contrasted with atheism, which is the lack of belief in a god or gods, and agnosticism, which is the belief that the existence of a god or gods cannot be known or proven. Theism can take many different forms and be expressed in different religious traditions and practices, such as Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, and more.
