The largest city in the Piedmont before European contact is not known with certainty, as Native American settlements were dispersed and did not have fixed boundaries or populations as modern cities do. However, several significant Native American towns and settlements existed in the Piedmont region, including the Cherokee town of Joara in present-day Morganton, North Carolina, and the Catawba town of Yamassee in present-day Rock Hill, South Carolina.
