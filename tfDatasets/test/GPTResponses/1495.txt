One benefit of using surface mount components is that they take up less space on a circuit board, which allows for smaller and more compact electronic devices. They also have faster production times, as they can be assembled using automated pick-and-place machines. Additionally, surface mount components have better high-frequency performance and can handle higher temperatures, making them more reliable and efficient.
