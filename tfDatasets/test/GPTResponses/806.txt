The ancient Greeks believed that democracy was the best principle for governance. They believed in the idea of equality and citizens having a say in decision making. This concept was invented by the Greeks in 5th century BC in Athens, where all citizens were given an equal say and voting rights in government decisions. This form of governance set the foundation for modern democratic societies.
