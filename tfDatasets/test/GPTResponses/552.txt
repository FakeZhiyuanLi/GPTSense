There are several accounts of Jesus' last words in the Bible. The four Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John) all record different versions of what Jesus said before he died on the cross. Additionally, there are other New Testament texts that mention Jesus' last words or events leading up to his death, such as the book of Acts and several letters written by the apostles. Overall, there is no one definitive list of Jesus' last words, as the different accounts emphasize different aspects of his final moments on earth.
