The Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, between states, and with Indian tribes. This includes the power to regulate trade, transportation, and communication across state lines. The Commerce Clause also allows Congress to regulate activities that have a substantial impact on interstate commerce, even if the activities themselves do not cross state lines. Additionally, the Commerce Clause has been interpreted to allow Congress to regulate economic activities that are closely related to interstate commerce.
