The human eye is most sensitive to light with a wavelength of around 555 nanometers, which corresponds to green light. The amount of energy contained in this light depends on the intensity of the light. The unit used to measure the energy of light is the photon, and the energy of a single photon of green light is approximately 2.25 electronvolts (eV). The total energy in a beam of green light is therefore determined by the number of photons present and their intensity.
