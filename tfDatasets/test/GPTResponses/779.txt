There is no record or evidence of any person performing crucifixion experiments in the 20th century. Crucifixion was a form of execution and torture that was widely used by ancient civilizations and has been abolished in modern times due to its inhumane nature. While there have been some attempts to recreate the conditions of crucifixion, such as the famous experiment conducted by French physician Dr. Pierre Barbet in the early 20th century, there have been no known attempts to actually crucify a person as part of a scientific theory testing.
