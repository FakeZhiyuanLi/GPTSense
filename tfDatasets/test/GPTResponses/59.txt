The region has been under the rule of the Tibetan Empire and the Chinese at different periods of history. The Tibetan Empire was established in the 7th century and ruled over a vast region that included parts of modern-day Tibet, China, Nepal, and Bhutan. The empire declined in the 9th century, and the region came under the control of various smaller kingdoms and tribes.In the 13th century, the Mongol Empire conquered Tibet and ruled it for a while. In the 17th century, the Fifth Dalai Lama consolidated his power and established the Ganden Phodrang government in Tibet, which was recognized by the Qing dynasty of China as its feudal territory.In 1950, the People's Republic of China invaded Tibet, and after a prolonged struggle, Tibet was incorporated into China as an autonomous region in 1965. However, the question of Tibet's autonomy and sovereignty remains unresolved and controversial. Some Tibetans still seek independence from China, while others seek greater autonomy and preservation of their cultural and religious identity within the framework of the Chinese state.
