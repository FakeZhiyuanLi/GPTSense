The color green is commonly associated with Islam as it is believed to be the favorite color of Prophet Muhammad. It represents nature, life, and growth, as well as the Islamic faith, purity, and sincerity. In the flags of many Islamic countries, green symbolizes the link between their religious beliefs and their natural landscapes.
