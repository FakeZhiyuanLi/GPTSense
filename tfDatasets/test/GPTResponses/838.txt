Before Planck, it was assumed that the energy of a body could take on any value and could increase or decrease continuously. This was known as the classical view of energy, which assumed that energy was a continuous and infinitely divisible entity. However, Planck's discovery of quantization in 1900 showed that energy could only be exchanged in discrete packets or quanta, challenging this classical view of energy.
