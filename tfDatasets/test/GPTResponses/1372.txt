Most slave and plantation owners were concentrated in the southern part of the United States, specifically in the states that made up the Confederacy during the Civil War: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. These states had a warmer climate that was ideal for growing cash crops like cotton, tobacco, and sugar cane, which required a significant amount of labor. Because of this, the Southern economy relied heavily on slavery and the plantation system.
