It depends on the species of annelid, but many annelid larvae live in the water and are planktonic, meaning they drift with the currents. Some annelid larvae are free-swimming, while others crawl along the ocean floor. Larvae of some annelid species have a pelagic phase, where they drift with the currents, and a benthic phase, where they settle on the ocean floor and metamorphose into adults. During their larval stage, annelids may feed on plankton or small organisms, depending on the species.
