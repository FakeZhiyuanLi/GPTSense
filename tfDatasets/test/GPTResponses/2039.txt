One of the most popular concepts of the pop movement is the celebration of consumer culture and everyday objects, often depicted in bright colors and bold graphics. This was a rejection of traditional fine art and an embrace of popular culture, making art more accessible to everyday people. Pop artists often used iconic images from advertising, comic books, and mass media to critique and challenge social norms and mass consumerism.
