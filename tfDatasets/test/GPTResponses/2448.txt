In a manual water pump, a vacuum is created by the movement of a piston or plunger inside a cylinder. Initially, the piston is at the top and the cylinder is filled with air. When the piston is pulled down, it creates a suction force that pulls water up the pump's pipe and into the cylinder. As the piston moves up again, it compresses the air in the cylinder, creating a vacuum that pulls more water up the pipe and into the cylinder. This process is repeated until the water reaches the pump outlet and is discharged. The vacuum created by the up-and-down motion of the piston allows the pump to draw water from a source below the level of the pump, such as a well or groundwater source.
