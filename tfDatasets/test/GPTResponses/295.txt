One example of the type of translations done in the Islamic Golden Age is the translation of Greek philosophical works such as those of Aristotle and Plato. These translations were crucial in the development of Islamic philosophy as well as medieval European philosophy. Islamic scholars, such as al-Farabi and Ibn Rushd (also known as Averroes), translated and commented on these works, bringing them into the Islamic intellectual tradition and helping to preserve them for future generations.
