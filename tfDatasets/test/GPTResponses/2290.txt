A shuttle astronaut would prevent ebullism (the formation of gas bubbles in bodily fluids) at 2 kPa (kilopascals) with a pressure garment or spacesuit. These suits are designed to maintain a constant pressure around the astronaut's body, preventing the decrease in pressure that would cause ebullism. The pressure garment also helps regulate body temperature and provides oxygen for breathing.
