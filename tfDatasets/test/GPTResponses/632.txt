In some regards, the light quantum, also known as a photon, behaved like a particle rather than an electromagnetic wave. Specifically, it behaved as though it had discrete energy levels and could only be absorbed or emitted in specific quantities. This is the basis of the concept of quantization in quantum mechanics. Additionally, the photon could exhibit wave-particle duality, meaning it could behave as both a wave and a particle depending on the observation or measurement being made.
