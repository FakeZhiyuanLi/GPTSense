A less systematic example could be:"I woke up this morning feeling tired and groggy. I stumbled to the kitchen and made myself a cup of coffee. As I sipped on my coffee, I checked my phone and saw that I had a message from a friend. They wanted to meet up for lunch later in the day. I agreed and started getting ready for the day. I showered and dressed and headed out to run some errands. While I was out, I ran into another friend who I hadn't seen in a while. We caught up briefly and went our separate ways. Later in the day, I met up with my first friend for lunch and we had a great time chatting and catching up. After lunch, I went home and spent the rest of the evening relaxing and watching TV."
