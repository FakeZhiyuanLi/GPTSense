The energy of a photon of light can be calculated using the formula:E = hc/λwhere E is the energy of a photon in joules (J), h is Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 J s), c is the speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 m/s), and λ is the wavelength of the light in meters.Converting the wavelength of green light from nanometers to meters:555 nm = 5.55 x 10^-7 mPlugging in the values:E = (6.626 x 10^-34 J s) x (2.998 x 10^8 m/s) / (5.55 x 10^-7 m)E = 3.569 x 10^-19 JTherefore, a green light with a wavelength of 555 nm contains 3.569 x 10^-19 J of energy per photon.
