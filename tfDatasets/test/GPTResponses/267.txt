From what I understand, the two types of bribery that the international community is trying to get prosecuted as separate are:1. Bribery of foreign public officials: This involves the offering, promising, or giving of any undue advantage to a foreign public official, in exchange for that official performing or refraining from performing an official act. This is covered under the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC), which aims to prevent, detect, and punish corruption-related offenses, including bribery of foreign public officials.2. Private sector bribery: This involves the offering, promising, or giving of any undue advantage to a person in the private sector, in exchange for that person performing or refraining from performing an action related to their business or professional duties. Private sector bribery can have significant negative impacts on the economy, including reducing competition, distorting markets, and undermining public trust.Overall, both types of bribery are viewed as serious offenses and are being targeted by international organizations and governments around the world in an effort to combat corruption and promote transparency and accountability.
