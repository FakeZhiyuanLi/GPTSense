A USB 2.0 hub operates in high speed mode when it is connected to a USB 2.0 port on a host device, such as a computer. High speed mode allows the hub to transfer data at a faster speed of up to 480 Mbps, compared to the slower speed of 12 Mbps in USB 1.1 mode. It is important to note that the devices connected to the hub must also be USB 2.0 compatible to take advantage of the high speed mode.
