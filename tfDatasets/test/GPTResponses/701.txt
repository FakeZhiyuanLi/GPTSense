The leaders of the North Korean government, particularly Kim Il-sung, believed that they needed a supply line from the Soviet Union to sustain another war. This belief was a major factor in Kim Il-sung's decision to launch an invasion of South Korea in 1950. The North Korean military received significant support from the Soviet Union during the conflict, including weapons, ammunition, and other supplies. Without this support, it is unlikely that North Korea would have been able to continue the war for as long as it did.
