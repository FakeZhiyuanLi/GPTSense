Stewart Guthrie believes that people project their human features onto non-human things due to the natural human tendency to anthropomorphize. This means that humans have a tendency to attribute human qualities, emotions, and traits to non-human entities, such as animals, objects, and even natural phenomena. This tendency is believed to stem from the way humans perceive and understand the world around them, which is largely through their own human experiences, emotions, and cultural beliefs. Therefore, when humans encounter something that they cannot fully understand, they may unconsciously project their own human qualities onto it in order to better understand it.
