There is no inherent gender in the original Germanic words for god. In Old Norse, for example, the word for god was "goð" (singular) or "goðin" (plural), which did not have a specific gender associated with it. In Old English, the word was "god" (singular) or "goda" (plural), which also did not have an inherent gender. In general, gods and goddesses were distinguished by their names and attributes rather than by the gender of the words used to refer to them.
