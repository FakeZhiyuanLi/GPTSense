One potential system that could be used for interplanetary travel is a fusion propulsion system. Fusion technology involves combining atomic nuclei to release energy, which can be used to propel a spacecraft. This technology has the potential to provide high thrust and high efficiency, which are necessary for interplanetary travel. Other potential systems include antimatter propulsion, nuclear thermal propulsion, and solar sails.
