The passion of Jesus is typically observed during Holy Week, which takes place in the days leading up to Easter. This includes events such as the Last Supper, the arrest and trial of Jesus, his crucifixion, and his resurrection. The date of Holy Week shifts every year based on the lunar calendar, but it usually falls between late March and late April.
