English Chief Justice Sir Edward Coke famously compared the law to a "lion" in his book "Institutes of the Laws of England" published in 1628. He wrote, "The law is like unto a lion for as a lion may not be turned aside from any right or wrong, so the law doth not vary from right or wrong, but followeth that which is just and right in every case." In essence, Coke viewed the law as impartial, inflexible, and bound to uphold justice and righteousness in all circumstances.
