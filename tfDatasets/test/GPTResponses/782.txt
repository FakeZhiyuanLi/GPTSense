Begging children were often targeted for being sold into slavery in many parts of the world. Historically, they were most commonly sold into slavery in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. However, the practice of child slavery has been found in many regions of the world, including Europe and the Americas. Today, child slavery is illegal in most countries, although it remains a problem in some parts of the world, especially in countries where poverty is widespread and law enforcement is weak.
