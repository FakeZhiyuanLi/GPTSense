The Planck's law formula has two main components in both the numerator and denominator:Numerator:1. Planck's constant (h): This is a physical constant used to relate energy and frequency of photons.2. Speed of light (c): This is a constant that describes the speed at which electromagnetic waves propagate in a vacuum.3. Frequency of radiation (v): This represents the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation being emitted.4. Exponential function (e): This component takes the form of e^(-h*v/kT) where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is temperature.Denominator:1. Pi (π): This is a mathematical constant that represents the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.2. The power of 5 (v^5): This represents the power of the frequency of radiation being emitted.The complete formula for Planck's law is given as:I(λ,T) = (2h*c^2 / λ^5) * 1 / (e^((h*c)/ (λ*k*T))-1)where I(λ,T) is the spectral radiance (energy per unit time per unit area per unit solid angle per unit wavelength) at a specific temperature (T) and wavelength (λ) of radiation.
