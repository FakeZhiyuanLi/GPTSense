?Hinduism has a diverse range of beliefs and practices, and therefore there is no simple answer to this question. Some Hindus believe in one supreme deity, known as Brahman or Ishvara, while others believe in multiple gods and goddesses who represent aspects of the divine. Additionally, some Hindus believe that all gods and goddesses are ultimately expressions of one supreme reality, while others see the many gods and goddesses as separate and distinct entities. Ultimately, whether Hinduism believes in a single god or multiple gods depends on the individual interpretation of the religion's teachings and traditions.
