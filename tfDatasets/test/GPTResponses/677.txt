Neoclassical compositions were written in the 20th century. The style emerged in the 1920s and 1930s, particularly in response to the experimental and avant-garde movements of the early 20th century. Neoclassicism sought to revive classical forms and structures, while incorporating modern harmonic and rhythmic elements. Famous neoclassical composers include Igor Stravinsky, Sergei Prokofiev, and Paul Hindemith.
