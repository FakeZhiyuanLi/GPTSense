Fireworks create green sparks through the use of barium compounds. Barium chloride or barium chlorate is added to the pyrotechnic mixture of the firework, which when ignited, releases green light. This is due to the excitation and subsequent relaxation of electrons within the barium atoms, leading to the emission of green light. The amount and type of barium compound used can affect the intensity and shade of green of the sparks.
