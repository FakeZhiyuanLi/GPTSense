Avicenna's work has been interpreted and adopted by several schools and traditions of thought in Islamic philosophy. These include the Peripatetic School (Mashsha'iyya), the Illuminationist (Ishraghiyya) School, the Transcendent Theosophy (Hikmat al-Muta'aliyya) School, and the Sufi School. Therefore, Avicenna's work can be said to have been split into four different schools of interpretation.
