The basis of Catholic theology is the belief in the Holy Trinity (one God in three persons) and the teachings of Jesus Christ as found in the Bible and developed by the Magisterium (the teaching authority of the Catholic Church). This includes the belief in the sacraments (Baptism, Eucharist, Confession, Confirmation, Marriage, Holy Orders, and Anointing of the Sick) and the importance of living a moral and virtuous life. Catholic theology also includes the belief in the intercession of the saints, the importance of Mary as the mother of Jesus and the role of the Church as the means of salvation for all humanity.
