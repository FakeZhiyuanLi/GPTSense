When a team has not advanced the ball enough to score or likely gain a new set of downs, they typically choose to punt the ball. Punting involves kicking the ball down the field to the other team's side, giving them possession of the ball but also forcing them to start their offensive drive from a disadvantageous position. This is often seen as a safe and strategic move, as it prevents the opposing team from scoring and gives the defense a chance to regroup and potentially make a turnover.
