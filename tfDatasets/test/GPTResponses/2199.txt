The MFP (mean free path) of residual gases shows the average distance a gas molecule can travel before colliding with another gas molecule or surface. This measurement is important in the study of vacuum technology and gas dynamics because it determines how easily gas molecules can move through a vacuum system or interact with surfaces. A shorter MFP indicates a higher gas density, while a longer MFP indicates a lower gas density.
