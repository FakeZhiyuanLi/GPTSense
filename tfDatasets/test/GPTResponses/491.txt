Symphonic instrumentation continued to be faithful to Beethoven's style for several decades after his death in 1827. Many composers in the mid-19th century, such as Brahms and Mendelssohn, were influenced by Beethoven's symphonies and utilized similar orchestration techniques in their own works. However, as the Romantic era progressed, symphonic styles began to change and become more adventurous, incorporating new instruments and sounds. By the late 19th century and early 20th century, composers such as Mahler, Strauss, and Debussy were pushing the boundaries of symphonic instrumentation, exploring new combinations of instruments and expanding the orchestra's capabilities.
