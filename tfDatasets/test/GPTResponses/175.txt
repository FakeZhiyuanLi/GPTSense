It is unclear which specific region is being referred to. However, in Persian history, several rulers and dynasties restored Persian control over various regions at different times. Some notable figures include Cyrus the Great, who founded the Achaemenid Empire and expanded Persian control over much of the Middle East and Central Asia, and Shah Abbas I, who restored Persian control over the Caucasus and Central Asia in the 16th and 17th centuries.
