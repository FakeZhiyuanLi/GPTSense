Railways often use power factor correction techniques to solve the problem of inductive reactance in AC systems. This involves adding capacitive elements to the electrical infrastructure, such as capacitors or electrically-excited synchronous motors, to offset the reactive power generated by inductive loads. The capacitive elements work to improve the power factor of the infrastructure, bringing it closer to unity, which reduces losses, improves energy efficiency and increases the capacity of the system. This is useful as many trains and their associated electrical systems operate at high voltage and require efficient power distribution to ensure reliable and safe operation.
