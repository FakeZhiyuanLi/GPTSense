Canada is an example of a country where prime ministers can be called right honourable solely because of their position. In Canada, prime ministers receive the title of "The Right Honourable" after they leave office as a sign of respect and recognition of their service to the country. However, they also receive the title while in office, as a courtesy and tradition.
