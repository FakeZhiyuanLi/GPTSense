The reversing loop was created to allow trains to change direction without the need for turning the locomotive or changing the position of the carriages. It is a specially designed track layout that allows a train to reverse its direction by going around a loop and returning to its original track. This allows the train to continue in the opposite direction while saving time and reducing the need for manual labor. The reversing loop is typically used in railroad yards, industrial parks, and other locations where trains need to change direction frequently.
