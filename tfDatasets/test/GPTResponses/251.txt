The language processing in humans primarily involves the left hemisphere of the brain, specifically in areas such as Broca's and Wernicke's areas. These areas are responsible for different aspects of language processing such as speech production, speech comprehension, and language expression. Other regions of the brain, such as the frontal and temporal lobes, also play a role in language processing.
