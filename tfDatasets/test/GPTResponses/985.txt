The executive branch of government has prosecutorial discretion. This means that law enforcement officials and prosecutors have the power to decide whether to arrest, charge, and prosecute individuals suspected of committing a crime. They can also decide whether to pursue a case aggressively or to drop charges altogether. This power is typically wielded by the Department of Justice, which is part of the executive branch headed by the President of the United States.
