The primary difference between the physical attributes of the dielectric used in high voltage capacitors and low voltage capacitors is their thickness. High voltage capacitors generally require thicker dielectrics to withstand the higher voltage levels, while low voltage capacitors can use thinner dielectrics. Additionally, high voltage capacitors may use dielectric materials with higher breakdown strengths to prevent breakdown at high voltages. The dielectric constant may also be a consideration, as higher dielectric constants can increase the capacitance of a capacitor.
