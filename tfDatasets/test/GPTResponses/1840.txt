After supporting the initial Iraq authorization in 2002, Kerry voted against several measures related to the Iraq War, including the $87 billion funding bill for military and rebuilding efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2003, and a bill to authorize continued military operations in Iraq in 2007. He also co-sponsored several bills aimed to withdraw troops from Iraq, such as the Iraq War De-Escalation Act of 2007 and the Safe and Responsible Redeployment of United States Combat Forces from Iraq Act of 2007.
