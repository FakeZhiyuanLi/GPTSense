The hardware designed to detect in USB mice and keyboards includes an electrical connector, a microcontroller, a sensor module, and a driver software. The electrical connector is used to connect the device to the USB port of a computer, while the microcontroller is responsible for managing the communication between the device and the computer. The sensor module includes the mechanical, optical, or laser sensors that track the movement of the mouse or the keystrokes of the keyboard. Finally, the driver software is installed on the computer to enable the operating system to recognize and communicate with the device.
