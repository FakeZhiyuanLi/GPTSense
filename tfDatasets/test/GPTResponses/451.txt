Glaciers can cause glacial earthquakes when they move just a few centimeters or a few meters in a short amount of time. However, the magnitude and frequency of glacial earthquakes increase as the size and speed of glacial movement increases. Large glaciers, such as those in Greenland and Antarctica, can cause glacial earthquakes with magnitudes of up to 7.5 on the Richter scale.
