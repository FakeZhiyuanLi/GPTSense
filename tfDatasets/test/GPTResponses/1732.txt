The DIY (Do It Yourself) ethic and independent music labels took a central role for the emerging post-punk music. This allowed for a diverse range of artists to create and distribute their music without the need for major record labels. Post-punk also embraced experimentation and fusion of different genres including punk, funk, reggae, and electronics, leading to the development of new subgenres such as goth, industrial, and new wave. The use of innovative production techniques and instruments, such as synthesizers and drum machines, also played a significant role in shaping the sound of post-punk music.
