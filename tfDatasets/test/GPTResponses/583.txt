The epistles, or letters, of the New Testament do not detail the physical raising of Jesus from the dead. However, many of the epistles make reference to the resurrection and emphasize its importance to the Christian faith. These include 1 Corinthians 15, Colossians 2:12, 1 Peter 1:3, and Romans 6:4. The detailed account of the resurrection can be found in the four Gospels: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
