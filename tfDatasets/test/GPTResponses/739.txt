It is not clear when the decision was made to name medical directories after Avicenna, as this likely happened over a period of time. Avicenna (also known as Ibn Sina) was an influential Persian physician and philosopher who lived from 980 to 1037 CE. His medical works, including the Canon of Medicine, were widely recognized as authoritative texts throughout the Islamic world and beyond. It is possible that medical directories started to be named after him as a way to honor his contributions to medicine and to signify their importance and authority.
