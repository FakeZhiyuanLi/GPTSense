There are several factors that can determine the literary structure a literary author uses for expression of ideas:1. The author's purpose: The author may have a specific purpose or message they want to convey and choose a structure that best suits their intended message.2. Genre: Different genres have their own typical structures. Poets, for example, often use rhythmic structures such as stanzas and rhyme schemes.3. Narrative voice: The narrator's perspective and voice can influence the literary structure used. For example, a first-person narrator might use a conversational structure, while a third-person narrator might adopt a more formal or objective structure.4. Time period and cultural context: The literary structure may be influenced by the time period and cultural context in which the work was created, as certain structures may have been more popular or acceptable in specific eras or cultures.5. Intended audience: The author may choose a structure that appeals to their intended audience. Children's literature, for example, often employs simple and concise structures that are easy for young readers to follow.
