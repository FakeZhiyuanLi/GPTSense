The regulatory regions of a gene can be far removed from the coding region of the gene. These regulatory regions can be located upstream or downstream of the coding region, thousands of base pairs away. They can also be located in introns or intergenic regions, and even on different chromosomes. Despite their distance from the coding region, regulatory regions play a key role in controlling gene expression by interacting with transcription factors, enhancers, and other regulatory elements.
