Insect muscles are able to contract many times per second, depending on the species and the purpose of the movement. For example, the wings of some insects can beat up to several hundred times per second, while the legs of a walking insect may move at a slower pace. The exact number of contractions per second can vary greatly, but insects are known for their high frequency of movement due to their efficient and powerful muscle structure.
