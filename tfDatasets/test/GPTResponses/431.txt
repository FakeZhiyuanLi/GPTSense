The United States and United Kingdom began to develop different versions of cultural studies in the 1960s and 1970s. The Birmingham School in the UK, led by scholars such as Stuart Hall and Richard Hoggart, focused on issues of class, race, and gender in popular culture. Meanwhile, the Cultural Studies program at the University of California, Davis, led by scholars such as Lawrence Grossberg and John Fiske, focused on the study of media and communication in American society. These two approaches influenced each other but developed along different trajectories, resulting in distinct versions of cultural studies.
