The decrease in child labor in the 20th century can be attributed to several factors:1. Legislation: Governments around the world passed laws banning child labor or restricting the minimum age of employment. Labor laws also provided protection for children, such as limiting the number of hours children could work per day.2. Education: The increase in access to education encouraged parents to send their children to school instead of work. Education also helped youngsters develop skills that made them better placed to earn a livelihood.3. Humanitarianism: Social reformers and humanitarian organizations raised awareness about the issue, leading to increased pressure on governments and industries to reform their practices.4. Technological advancements: With the rise of technology, many labor-intensive tasks previously performed by children can now be automated or carried out by machines, reducing the need for child labor.5. International cooperation: International organizations such as the International Labour Organization (ILO) played a significant role in combating child labor by promoting global labor standards, monitoring working conditions, and advocating for legislation and policy changes.These factors combined to significantly reduce child labor in the 20th century. However, child labor persists in some parts of the world, and efforts continue to eliminate this practice worldwide.
