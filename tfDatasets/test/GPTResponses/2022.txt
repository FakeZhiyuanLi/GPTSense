The Arab conquests were not limited to one specific region, but rather spread across the Middle East, North Africa, and parts of Europe and Central Asia. The Arab expansion began in the Arabian Peninsula in the 7th century, and within a century, Muslim armies had conquered territories including Persia, Mesopotamia, Syria, Palestine, Egypt, North Africa, and Spain.
