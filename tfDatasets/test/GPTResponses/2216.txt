Both English and Spanish are spoken in Arizona and New Mexico, but the dominant language varies depending on the region and the population. In Arizona, English is the most commonly spoken language, followed by Spanish, Navajo, and other Indigenous languages. In New Mexico, on the other hand, Spanish is more prevalent, with over 40% of the population speaking it at home. English is still widely spoken in both states, however, and many residents are bilingual or multilingual.
