When the capacitance of a capacitor is altered, an electric current flows through the circuit to maintain the charge on the plates of the capacitor. The direction and magnitude of the current depends on the rate and direction of the change in capacitance. If the capacitance increases, the current flows in one direction, and if the capacitance decreases, the current flows in the opposite direction. This is described by the equation:I = C dV/dtwhere I is the current, C is the capacitance, and dV/dt is the rate of change of voltage across the capacitor.
