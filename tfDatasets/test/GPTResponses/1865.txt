One notable program that gives incentives to private landowners to protect species on their land is the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The CRP provides financial assistance to farmers and ranchers who voluntarily agree to remove environmentally sensitive land from agricultural production and plant species that improve environmental health and quality. This helps protect endangered and threatened species, enhance wildlife habitat, and prevent soil erosion. In addition to financial incentives, landowners who enroll in the CRP may also receive technical and conservation planning assistance.
