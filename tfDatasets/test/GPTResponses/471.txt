Ogives are called wave or band ogives when the frequency of the data is unevenly distributed and there are large gaps between the values. In such cases, the ogives will appear as waves or bands rather than a smooth curve. This is because the frequencies of the data points are concentrated in certain ranges, creating peaks and valleys in the ogive graph.
