The Polish believed that the szlachta, a class of Polish nobility, derived from the name of the legendary Polish hero, Lech, who was said to have been the founder of the Polish nation. The word "szlachta" itself is rooted in the Old Slavic word "slava", which means "glory" or "fame", and is believed to have been used to describe the warrior elite who fought to defend their country and nobility.
