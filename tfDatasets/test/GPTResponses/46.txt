During the Last Glacial Maximum (about 20,000 years ago), large parts of Europe were covered by ice sheets and glaciers. As these glaciers melted, the discharge from them flowed into rivers and lakes or was absorbed by the ground.In northern Europe, the meltwater from the glaciers flowed into the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, which were much larger than they are today due to lower sea levels during the ice age. The meltwater also formed large proglacial lakes, such as Lake Agassiz in North America.In central Europe, the discharge from the glaciers contributed to the formation of the Rhine, Danube, and other major European rivers. The meltwater also created large lakes, such as Lake Geneva and Lake Constance.In southern Europe, the meltwater from glaciers in the Alps formed glacial lakes, such as Lake Como and Lake Garda. Some of the meltwater also contributed to the formation of rivers, such as the Po and the Adige.Overall, the discharge from the glaciers during the Last Glacial Maximum had a significant impact on the hydrology and landscape of Europe.
