Portuguese universities have a long history, going back to the 13th century. The first university in Portugal, the University of Coimbra, was founded in 1290 by King Dinis I, making it one of the oldest universities in Europe. Since then, other universities have been established, including the University of Lisbon (1911), the University of Porto (1911), and the University of Aveiro (1973).
