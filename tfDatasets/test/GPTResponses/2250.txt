is known as "joint reference." This refers to the fact that each term in the definition must be able to refer to the same object or concept. In other words, all the terms being defined must have a shared meaning or point of reference. For example, in the definition "a dog is a four-legged animal that barks," the term "dog" and "animal" must refer to the same thing, and the term "four-legged" and "barks" must also refer to aspects of the same thing â€“ a dog. If any of the terms refer to something different, the definition is not coordinative.
