There were several areas where Indian kings contained the Arabs:1. Gujarat: The Arab invasions into Gujarat were led by Muhammad bin Qasim in the early 8th century. However, the Arab rule was short-lived as the local king, Maitrakas, drove them out after a few years.2. Deccan: The Arab invasions into the Deccan were contained by the Rashtrakuta kings. The Rashtrakutas not only defeated the Arabs but also conquered parts of their territories in the region.3. Sindh: The Arabs conquered Sindh in the early 8th century, but their rule was challenged by the Chalukya and Yadava dynasties. The Chalukyas and Yadavas were able to push the Arabs back to the Arabian sea.4. Rajasthan: The Arabs invaded Rajasthan in the early 8th century, but their conquest was limited to a few areas. The local Rajput kings resisted the Arab invasions, and the Arabs were eventually driven out of the region.Overall, Indian kings were able to contain and resist the Arab invasions, which prevented the Arabs from fully establishing their dominance in the region.
