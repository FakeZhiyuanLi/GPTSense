The Holy Roman Empire, which controlled large parts of Europe from the 9th to the 19th century, was a Christian state. Under this rule, Muslims were often viewed with suspicion and treated as outsiders, particularly during the Crusades, which saw Christian armies invade and conquer Muslim territories in the Middle East. The Crusades were marked by a great deal of violence and bloodshed, and many Muslims were killed or enslaved by Christian soldiers. Muslims living within the Holy Roman Empire itself were often subject to discrimination and persecution, particularly during times of religious conflict. However, it is worth noting that the treatment of Muslims varied depending on the time and place within the empire, and there were also periods of relative tolerance and coexistence.
