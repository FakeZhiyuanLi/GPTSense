The tribes were often ruled over by chiefs or tribal leaders who had a high status and a great deal of influence within the community. In some cases, tribes were also governed by councils made up of members of the tribe who would make decisions together on behalf of the community. These leaders and councils would establish laws, resolve conflicts, and make important decisions regarding the welfare of the tribe.
