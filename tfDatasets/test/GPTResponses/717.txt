Equal temperament enabled hard-to-tune keyboard instruments to play in any key without needing frequent retuning. This is because equal temperament divides the octave into 12 equal semitones, allowing for a consistent and equal distance between each note regardless of the key being played. Before the development of equal temperament, keyboard instruments needed to be tuned to the specific key being played, which was a time-consuming and difficult process. With equal temperament, keyboard instruments could be played in any key without needing to be retuned, making them more versatile and practical for performers.
