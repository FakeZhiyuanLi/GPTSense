There were several reasons why Western powers believed that the Soviet government would not partake in another world war:1. The Soviet Union suffered the most casualties in World War II, with an estimated 27 million dead. This loss was a powerful reminder of the costs of war to the Soviet people and likely made the Soviet leadership hesitant to enter another conflict.2. The Soviet government had a policy of peaceful coexistence with the West after World War II. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin signed the United Nations Charter in 1945 and participated in the Potsdam Conference, which established postwar policies and borders.3. The United States had developed nuclear weapons by the end of World War II, and the Soviet Union did not have the capability to match this development until 1949. This technological gap likely made the Soviet government wary of engaging in a conflict with the Western powers.4. The Soviet Union was focused on rebuilding its own economy and infrastructure after the devastation of World War II. The government prioritized rebuilding efforts over military expansion and aggression.Overall, the Western powers believed that the Soviet government was unlikely to engage in another world war due to the high costs of war, the policy of peaceful coexistence, the technological gap in nuclear weapons development, and a focus on rebuilding efforts over military expansion.
