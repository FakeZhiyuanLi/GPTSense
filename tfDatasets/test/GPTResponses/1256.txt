In a realistic model of a capacitor, electric fields might be found:1. At the edges of the conducting plates: The electric field changes rapidly at the edges of the conductors, leading to a concentration of charge and thus creating an electric field.2. In the conductor material: Although the conductor is assumed to be an equipotential, there may be variations in the electric field due to imperfections in the material or irregularities in the plate's shape.3. In the space around the capacitor: The electric field extends beyond the space between the conductors, causing a slight distortion of electric field lines in the surrounding region.4. On the surface of the dielectric: When a capacitor is charged, it becomes polarized, with charges accumulating on opposite surfaces of the dielectric. This polarization results in an electric field on the surface of the dielectric.
