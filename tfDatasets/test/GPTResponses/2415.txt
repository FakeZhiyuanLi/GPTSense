The issue Spielberg addressed in his movie Munich is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the cycle of violence that perpetuates it. The movie recounts the events of the 1972 Munich Olympics where Israeli athletes were taken hostage and subsequently killed by Palestinian terrorists. It then follows a secret Israeli retaliation mission, highlighting the moral and ethical dilemmas faced by individuals caught up in such conflicts. The movie also addresses the idea of seeking revenge and how it can fuel further violence, ultimately leading to more innocent lives being lost.
