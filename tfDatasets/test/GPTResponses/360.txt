The vertical blanking interval (VBI) in laserdiscs was used for a variety of purposes, including inserting closed captions, teletext information, and other additional data into the video signal. One of the main uses of the VBI was to prevent the Macrovision copy protection signal from being recorded onto a VHS tape when playing a laserdisc through a VCR. This was accomplished by inserting a special signal into the VBI that caused the Macrovision circuitry in the VCR to activate, thus blocking the copy protection signal from being recorded onto the tape.
