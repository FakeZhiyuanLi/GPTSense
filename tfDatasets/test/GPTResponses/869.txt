septae. These septae are thin walls that divide the coelom, or body cavity, into multiple segments. This allows for greater flexibility and mobility in movement, as well as the ability to move individual segments independently of each other. The septae also provide support and protection for internal organs within each segment. This feature is unique to annelids and is an important adaptation for their survival.
