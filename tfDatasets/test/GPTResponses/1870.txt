is known as energy transition, a process by which a country shifts from fossil fuels to clean, sustainable sources of energy. National renewable energy targets can provide a clear goal for policymakers and provide certainty for investors in the renewable energy sector. By setting targets, countries can signal their commitment to climate action, reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels, create jobs, and improve air quality. Targets can also foster innovation in the renewable energy sector by driving research and development, leading to further cost reductions and technological advances. Overall, setting national renewable energy targets can be a vital step towards a more sustainable and resilient energy future.
