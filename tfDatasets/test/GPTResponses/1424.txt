Kabbalah is a Jewish mystical tradition that seeks to explain the nature and purpose of the universe and the human experience. It is based on a set of esoteric teachings and practices that aim to provide spiritual insight and connection to the divine. The term "kabbalah" comes from the Hebrew word for "receiving," and it is often associated with the study of Jewish religious texts, including the Torah, Talmud, and Zohar. Kabbalistic teachings emphasize the interconnectedness of all things and the importance of achieving spiritual harmony and enlightenment through prayer, meditation, and other spiritual practices.
