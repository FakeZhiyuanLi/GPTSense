The Shahi dynasty ruled the Kabul valley and Gandhara from the mid-7th century to the early 11th century. Though there is not enough evidence to pinpoint an exact date, it is believed that the Shahis switched from Buddhism to Hinduism sometime around the 9th century AD. The influence of Hinduism is seen in their art and architecture, which started to show Hindu themes and motifs. However, the exact reason for this switch is not clear as there are different theories and opinions on this topic.
