One system that has nearly equal importance as traditional commercial banking is the investment banking system. Investment banks provide a range of financial services to individuals, corporations, and governments, such as underwriting stock and bond issuances, providing merger and acquisition advisory services, and trading securities. Investment banks play a vital role in facilitating the capital markets and channeling investments into businesses, making them a crucial component of the global financial system.
