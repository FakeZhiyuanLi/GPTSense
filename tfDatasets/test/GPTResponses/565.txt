During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the primary reason for child labor in India was poverty. Poor families often could not afford to send their children to school, so they had no other option but to put them to work to earn a living. Additionally, many industries and businesses exploited children for their cheap labor, as they could pay them much less than adult workers. Children were employed in a range of industries, such as textiles, agriculture, mining, and domestic work.
