Wilhelm Wien discovered the laws of radiation, specifically the distribution of radiation from a black body. He proposed Wien's displacement law, which states that the wavelength of maximum radiation emitted by a black body is inversely proportional to its temperature. This discovery helped lay the foundation of quantum mechanics and the study of atomic physics. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1911 for this work.
