The Brazilian Constitution does not have a supremacy clause that would be of interest to the relation between state legislation and international treaties. However, according to Article 5, ยง 2 of the Brazilian Constitution, "treaties and international agreements duly approved under the terms of this Constitution have the same hierarchical status as laws". This means that international treaties and agreements are equivalent to Federal laws, but do not override state laws and regulations. However, in case of conflict between state laws and international treaties, the latter will prevail.
