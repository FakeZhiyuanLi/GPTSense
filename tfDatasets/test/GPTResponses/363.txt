Avicenna was able to understand the metaphysics of Aristotle through his extensive knowledge and study of philosophy, particularly his fluency in both Greek and Arabic. Avicenna also had access to many writings and commentaries on Aristotle's works, both from his contemporaries and from earlier Islamic philosophers. He was also influenced by the works of earlier Islamic philosophers, such as Al-Farabi and Ibn Rushd, who had also studied and commented on Aristotle's metaphysics. Finally, Avicenna's own innovative and creative thinking allowed him to synthesize and build upon Aristotle's ideas in his own metaphysical system.
