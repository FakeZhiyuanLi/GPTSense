Diffusive ventilation occurs by the movement of air molecules from an area of high concentration to an area of lower concentration. This occurs naturally due to differences in air pressure and temperature, aided by wind and other atmospheric conditions. In buildings, diffusive ventilation can occur through cracks and gaps in walls, ceilings, and floors, as well as through the movement of air between rooms or floors. It is also commonly used in passive cooling strategies, such as natural ventilation and night cooling, to reduce energy consumption and improve indoor air quality.
