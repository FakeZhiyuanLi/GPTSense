Germany and Austria-Hungary were trying to conserve coal by using daylight saving time (DST). During World War I, coal was a critical resource for both countries to power their industries and war efforts. By shifting the clock forward one hour during the summer months, they were able to reduce the amount of artificial light needed in the evening and decrease the amount of coal used for lighting. This allowed more coal to be allocated towards essential industries and the military.
