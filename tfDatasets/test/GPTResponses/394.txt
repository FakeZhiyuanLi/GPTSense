Seracs are large ice pillars or blocks that form in glaciers and icefalls. They are created by the accumulation and compression of snow and ice, and their shapes can vary from tall columns to jagged peaks. Seracs are often unstable and can topple over or collapse without warning, posing a significant hazard to climbers and mountaineers.
