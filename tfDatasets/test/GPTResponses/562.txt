All four Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John) mention the time of crucifixion, but in slightly different ways. Matthew and Mark both state that Jesus was crucified at the third hour (9:00 am) (Matthew 27:45-46, Mark 15:33-34), while Luke simply says that it was around the sixth hour (12:00 noon) (Luke 23:44-45). John states that the trial of Jesus began at the sixth hour and that he was still before Pilate at the ninth hour (John 19:14-16) which was around 3:00 pm.
