The area between the two conductors in a capacitor is referred to as the "dielectric" or "insulating material." It is usually made of materials such as air, paper, plastic, or ceramic, and its purpose is to prevent direct contact between the two conductors while allowing an electric field to be established between them. The type of dielectric material used can affect the capacitance and other electrical properties of the capacitor.
