Enzymes with a zinc atom in the reactive center can be found in various biological systems, such as in the digestive system, immune system, and metabolic pathways. Some examples of enzymes with a zinc atom in the reactive center are:1. Carbonic anhydrase: This enzyme catalyzes the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and a proton. It contains a zinc ion in the active site that is essential for its activity.2. Alcohol dehydrogenase: This enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes or ketones, using NAD+ as a cofactor. The zinc ion in the active site is involved in coordinating the substrate and facilitating the transfer of hydride from the alcohol to NAD+.3. Matrix metalloproteinases: These enzymes are involved in the degradation and remodeling of extracellular matrix components. They contain a zinc ion in the catalytic site that is essential for their proteolytic activity.4. Alkaline phosphatase: This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphate ester bonds at alkaline pH. It contains a zinc atom in the active site that is involved in coordinating the substrate and activating a water molecule for nucleophilic attack.These enzymes can be purified from biological sources, such as tissues or cells, or produced using recombinant DNA technology.
