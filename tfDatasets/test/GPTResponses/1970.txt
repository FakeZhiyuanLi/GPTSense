Digital technology and online commerce are becoming increasingly economic in both developing and developed countries. The widespread use of smartphones, the internet, and digital banking has led to a rise in e-commerce and digital payments, which have revolutionized the way people do business and interact with one another. This has created new opportunities for entrepreneurs, lowered transaction costs, and improved access to financial services, particularly for those who were previously underbanked or excluded from formal financial systems. Additionally, the growing trend towards remote work and virtual collaboration has increased the efficiency of many industries and reduced overhead costs, further driving the adoption of digital technology.
