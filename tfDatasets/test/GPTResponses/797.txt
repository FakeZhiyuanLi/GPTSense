The other Gospels have slightly different variations of Jesus' last words:Matthew 27:46 and 50 - "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" and "It is finished."Mark 15:34 and 37 - "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" and "With a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last."Luke 23:34 - "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing." and "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit."John 19:26-27 - "Woman, here is your son," and to the disciple, "Here is your mother," and "It is finished."
