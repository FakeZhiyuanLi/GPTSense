Most insects have an exoskeleton made of chitin, a tough, protective polysaccharide. The exoskeleton is a complex structure that provides support, protection, and serves as an attachment point for muscles. It is divided into multiple segments and connected by flexible joints, allowing insects to move and perform a wide range of actions. Some insects may also have additional structures on their exoskeleton, such as wings or spines, which help them to fly or defend themselves.
