A fjord is formed when glaciers melt and retreat, and the sea water fills the resulting valleys. The melting glacier carves a U-shaped valley, and as it retreats, the sea level rises and floods the valley, creating a long and narrow inlet with steep sides. The water in a fjord is often very deep, and the steep sides can be as high as mountains, reaching heights of over 1,000 meters (3,300 feet) in some cases. The combination of deep water and steep sides creates a unique ecosystem and a dramatic landscape that is both beautiful and awe-inspiring.
