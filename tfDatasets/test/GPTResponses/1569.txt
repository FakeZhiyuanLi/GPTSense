During World War II, the British people were viewed as resilient and determined, willing to stand up to Adolf Hitler and his Nazi regime. The Blitz, a bombing campaign by the Germans in London and other cities, did not break the spirit of the British people. Instead, it strengthened their resolve to win the war. The image of the British "stiff upper lip" became a symbol of their determination and bravery, and they were seen as an inspiration to other Allied nations. This view of the British people as courageous and indomitable helped to bolster support for the war effort, both at home and abroad.
