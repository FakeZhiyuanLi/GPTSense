If there were an infinite number of primes, the sieve of Eratosthenes would not be valid. This is because the sieve works on the assumption that there is a finite list of primes up to a certain limit, and it sieves out the multiples of those primes to find additional primes. However, if there were an infinite number of primes, the sieve would go on forever and would never be able to determine if any number is prime or not.
