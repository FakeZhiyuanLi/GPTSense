There are several types of losses that occur during conversion and transmission in wires and electronics:1. Resistive losses: When electric current flows through a wire, some of the energy is lost due to the resistance of the wire. This loss is proportional to the resistance of the wire and the amount of current flowing through it.2. Dielectric losses: In electronic circuits, electrical signals are transmitted through cables and wires. These signals are often in the form of electromagnetic waves, which can be absorbed by the insulating material around the wire. This absorption causes energy loss in the form of heat.3. Radiative losses: When electrical signals are transmitted over long distances, they can be lost due to radiation. This loss occurs when the electromagnetic waves spread out and become weaker as they move away from the source.4. Inductive losses: When electrical currents flow through a conductor, they create a magnetic field around the wire. This magnetic field can induce currents in nearby wires, causing energy loss.5. Capacitive losses: In electronic circuits, capacitors store energy in an electric field. However, some of this energy can be lost due to leakage currents, which reduce the amount of energy stored in the capacitor.Overall, these losses can reduce the efficiency and effectiveness of electronic circuits, and can result in increased energy consumption and costs.
