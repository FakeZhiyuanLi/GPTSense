During the period of industrialization in the United States, children were commonly employed in textile mills. They were hired as cheap labor and often worked long hours in dangerous and unhealthy conditions. Some of the tasks assigned to children in textile mills included:1. Bobbin changing: Children had to change bobbins in the spinning machines, which involved crawling under the moving machines and reaching in to remove the empty bobbin and replace it with a full one.2. Cleaning: Children were responsible for cleaning the machines and floors of the mills. This was a dirty and dangerous job as many of the machines had moving parts and sharp edges.3. Spinning: Children were employed to spin the fibers into yarn. This was a difficult and repetitive job that required long hours of standing and using the machines.4. Weaving: Children were also employed in the weaving department of the mills. They were responsible for operating the looms, which required a high level of skill and focus.Overall, child labor in textile mills was an exploitative practice that robbed children of their childhood and endangered their health and well-being. It was only after years of advocacy and legislation that child labor laws were put in place to protect the rights and safety of children in the workplace.
