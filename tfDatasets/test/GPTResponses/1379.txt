Excess electric field present in the dielectric can lead to several effects, including:1. Dielectric breakdown: The electric field can become so high that it breaks down the dielectric material, causing a loss of insulation properties and potentially damaging the device.2. Electrical polarization: The excess electric field can cause the charges in the dielectric to become separated and polarized, which can lead to the creation of an electric dipole moment, affecting the dielectric constant of the material.3. Surface charges: The excess electric field can create surface charges on the dielectric, which can affect the behavior of the material when it is in contact with other materials.4. Interference: The excess electric field can interfere with the electric fields of other nearby devices or circuits, leading to unwanted signals or noise.5. Heating: The excess electric field can generate heat in the dielectric, potentially leading to thermal damage or failure of the device.
