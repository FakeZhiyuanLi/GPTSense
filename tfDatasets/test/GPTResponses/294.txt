The ISO standard does not strictly dictate a specific maximum bit rate for decoders to be able to decode. However, it does provide guidelines for optimal bit rates based on various factors such as the resolution, frame rate, and coding scheme used. Ultimately, it is up to the decoder manufacturer to determine the maximum bit rate their product can support while maintaining high-quality video playback.
