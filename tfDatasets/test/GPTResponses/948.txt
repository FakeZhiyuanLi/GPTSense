tentacles?Some polychaete annelids have "crowns" of tentacles on their heads called chaetae or cirri, which are used for feeding, sensing their environment, and locomotion. These tentacles can be arranged in various patterns or shapes and can come in different lengths and sizes depending on the species. The tentacles are also often covered in cilia, or tiny hair-like projections, which help them capture food particles and move them towards the mouth. Examples of annelids with such crowns include bristle worms and fan worms.
