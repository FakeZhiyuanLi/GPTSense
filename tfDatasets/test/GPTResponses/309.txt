The process of amendment by correction is generally reserved for changes that rectify obvious errors in the text. This process allows for minor changes to be made to correct typographical errors or other mistakes without requiring a formal amendment process. It is typically used to correct spelling or grammatical errors, formatting issues or other minor mistakes that do not significantly affect the meaning or intent of the document. The process of amendment by correction is generally quick and straightforward, as it does not require the same level of debate or deliberation as more significant changes to the text.
