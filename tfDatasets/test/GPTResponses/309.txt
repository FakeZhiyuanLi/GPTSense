Quantum disjunction can be illustrated using the famous Schr√∂dinger's cat thought experiment.In this experiment, a cat is placed in a sealed box with a radioactive substance that has a 50% chance of decaying and releasing a lethal poison that will kill the cat. According to quantum mechanics, until the box is opened and the state of the radioactive substance is observed, the cat is both alive and dead at the same time.Therefore, if we apply quantum disjunction, we can say that the cat is either alive or dead, but we cannot determine which is the case until we observe it. Hence, the state of the cat follows a quantum disjunctive state of "alive or dead." This illustrates how quantum disjunction works and how it can apply to other quantum phenomena.
