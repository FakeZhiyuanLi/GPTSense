The possible strategies in minimax theory include:1. Minimax strategy: This strategy involves choosing the move that minimizes the maximum possible loss.2. Maxmin strategy: This strategy involves choosing the move that maximizes the minimum possible gain.3. Minimax regret strategy: This strategy involves choosing the move that minimizes the maximum regret over all potential moves.4. Dominance strategy: This strategy involves choosing the move that dominates all other moves in terms of payoff.5. Nash equilibrium strategy: This strategy involves choosing the move that results in the greatest payoff given the moves of all other players.6. Alpha-beta pruning strategy: This strategy involves pruning search trees by eliminating branches that are unlikely to lead to a winning outcome.7. Monte Carlo tree search strategy: This strategy involves using Monte Carlo simulations to guide search algorithms towards promising branches.8. Heuristic strategy: This strategy involves using domain-specific knowledge or rules to make informed decisions.
