A critical habitat consideration for plant wildlife would be the availability of suitable soil, moisture levels and sunlight for the species to grow and flourish. Many plant species have specific requirements for their survival including soil pH, nutrient levels, temperature and water availability. Changes in these factors can have significant impacts on the plant's ability to survive and reproduce. Therefore, protecting and preserving habitat that meets these requirements is essential for the long-term survival of these plant species.
