A solar balloon is a type of hot air balloon that uses solar energy to heat the air inside the balloon. It consists of a large, thin, and lightweight plastic or nylon envelope that is filled with air, which is then heated by the sun's rays. As the air inside the balloon heats up, it becomes less dense and rises, lifting the balloon into the air. Solar balloons are typically flown at low altitudes and can be used for various purposes such as aerial photography, scientific research, or recreational activities.
