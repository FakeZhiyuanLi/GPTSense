Outgassing products can ruin a space mission because in the vacuum of space, these products can disperse and contaminate critical areas of the spacecraft, such as the optics or the instruments. The outgassing products can also condense and form a film on the surfaces of these critical components, negatively affecting their performance. This can result in reduced effectiveness of the spacecraft, decreased scientific output, or even catastrophic failure. Furthermore, removing the outgassing products from the spacecraft can be extremely difficult or even impossible, as exposure to vacuum and radiation can harden them into a resilient and stubborn layer. Thus, careful management of materials and their outgassing properties is essential in ensuring the success of a space mission.
