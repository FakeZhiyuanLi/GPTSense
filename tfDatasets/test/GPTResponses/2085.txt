The most deadly military accident that occurred on Cyprus was the crash of a Greek C-130 Hercules military transport plane on August 14, 1974, which resulted in the death of 121 people, including 59 Greek and 12 American servicemen, and 48 civilians. The crash occurred during the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, and the cause of the accident is still disputed, with some suggesting it was shot down by Turkish forces.
