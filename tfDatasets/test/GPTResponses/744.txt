In the traditional manner, a person is attached to the cross by first being bound or nailed to the crossbeam, then raising the crossbeam and securing it to the upright post. The person's feet or legs are also often bound or nailed to a footrest, called a suppedaneum, which is attached to the upright post. The person is then left hanging on the cross until they die of asphyxiation, shock, or other causes.
