Stray earth currents can be kept at manageable levels by using the following measures:1. Grounding: Proper grounding systems can be installed to provide a low resistance path for stray currents to flow back to earth, thereby reducing their intensity.2. Shielding: Conductive shielding can be installed around sensitive electronic equipment to protect them from the electromagnetic interference caused by stray currents.3. Isolation: Transformers and isolation transformers can be used to separate electrical circuits and prevent the flow of stray currents between them.4. Regulation: Voltage regulators can be used to maintain a constant voltage level and prevent excessive current flow.5. Maintenance: Regular maintenance of electrical equipment and grounding systems can help identify and rectify any issues that may cause an increase in stray currents.
