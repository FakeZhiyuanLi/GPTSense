As the temperature of a hot object increases, several changes occur:1. Volume: The volume of the object increases due to thermal expansion.2. Color: The color of the object may change as it gets hotter. For example, iron turns red as it gets hotter.3. Conductivity: The object becomes a better conductor of heat and electricity as it gets hotter.4. Pressure: The pressure inside the object increases due to the increased kinetic energy of the particles.5. Melting and Boiling Point: The melting and boiling point of the object may change as the temperature increases.6. Chemical Properties: The chemical properties of the object may change as the temperature increases, as some chemical reactions may become more or less likely at higher temperatures.
