The rule that predicts a narrow range of energy values at lower temperatures is the Boltzmann distribution law. According to this law, the probability of a given energy level decreases exponentially as the energy level increases. At lower temperatures, most particles are in their lowest energy state, which results in a narrow distribution of energy values. As the temperature increases, more particles are excited to higher energy states, resulting in a broader distribution of energy values.
