The m. tuberculosis bacterium has a thick cell wall that protects it from being affected by toxins. The cell wall is composed of a unique lipid called mycolic acid, which makes it impermeable to many antibiotics, disinfectants, and detergents. This structural feature makes m. tuberculosis highly resistant and allows it to survive in hostile environments such as the lungs, where it must resist the body's immune system and antibiotic therapies.
