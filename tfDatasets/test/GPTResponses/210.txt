The apparitions that reportedly took place in 1917 are known as the apparitions of Our Lady of Fatima. The Virgin Mary is said to have appeared to three shepherd children in Fatima, Portugal, over a period of six months from May to October 1917. The children were Lucia dos Santos and her cousins Francisco and Jacinta Marto. The apparitions were accompanied by various signs and miracles, including the famous "Miracle of the Sun" in which the sun was said to have danced in the sky. The apparitions of Our Lady of Fatima are widely recognized by the Catholic Church and are celebrated annually on May 13th.
