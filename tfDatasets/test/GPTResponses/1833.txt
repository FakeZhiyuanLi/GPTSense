The Taft Vale case was a legal case in the United Kingdom in 1932 that concerned the liability of a trade union for damages incurred during a strike. The case established the principle of "vicarious liability," meaning that a party could be held responsible for the actions of another if they had control over that party. In this case, the trade union was held responsible for the damage caused by the striking workers because they had encouraged the strike and had control over the workers. This ruling had significant implications for trade unions and their ability to strike, as they now faced the risk of being held financially liable for any damages caused during a strike.
