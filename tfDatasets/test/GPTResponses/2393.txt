Aphids have both asexual and sexual reproduction modes. Asexual reproduction involves the production of offspring without the need for fertilization, and it results in offspring that are identical to the parent. Sexual reproduction involves the fertilization of an egg by a sperm and produces offspring with genetic diversity. Aphids can switch between these two modes of reproduction depending on various factors such as environmental conditions, population density, and availability of food resources.
