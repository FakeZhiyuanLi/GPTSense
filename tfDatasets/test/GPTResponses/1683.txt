A common theme in post-punk music was a disillusionment with society and politics, as well as a sense of alienation and frustration. Many post-punk artists also explored themes of existentialism, the human condition, and personal identity. Additionally, there was a focus on experimentation with sound and musical genres, resulting in a diverse array of subgenres within the post-punk genre.
