is known as the "impetus theory" or "theory of impetus."According to this theory, objects in motion have a certain force or "impetus" that keeps them in motion. If there were a perfect vacuum, this impetus would have nothing to act against and would cause objects to keep moving indefinitely, accelerating to infinite speeds.Al-Farabi argued that this was impossible because it violated the laws of physics and common sense. Therefore, he concluded that a perfect vacuum was not possible and that some degree of resistance or friction was always present in the environment.
