Non-conductive materials, such as glass or ceramic, were used as the dielectric material in the first capacitors. The dielectric material is an insulator that separates the two conducting plates of the capacitor, allowing the capacitor to store and release electrical energy. The use of non-conductive materials as the dielectric allowed for capacitors to be made with high capacitance values and low leakage currents. Early capacitors were used in various applications, such as in radio receivers, timing circuits, and voltage regulation circuits.
