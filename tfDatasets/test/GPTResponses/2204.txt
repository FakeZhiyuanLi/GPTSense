A heliometer is an instrument used for measuring the angular separation between two celestial bodies, usually stars. It consists of two identical telescopes mounted side by side, with a movable mirror or prism placed between them. By adjusting the mirror or prism, the observer can precisely bisect the two stars, and measure the angle between them using a micrometer. Heliometers were primarily used in the 19th century for astronomical observations and the determination of stellar parallax.
