During the 19th century, a total of 22 African American congressmen were elected to serve in the United States Congress. However, most of them served during the Reconstruction era after the Civil War, with the last one serving until 1901. The passage of Jim Crow laws and other discriminatory practices in the following decades made it difficult for African Americans to be elected to political office until the Civil Rights Movement in the 20th century.
