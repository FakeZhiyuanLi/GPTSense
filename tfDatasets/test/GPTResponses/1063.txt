Invasive worms can harm a variety of forests, including deciduous and mixed deciduous forests, temperate and tropical hardwood forests, and boreal forests. However, they are particularly harmful to forests with a thick layer of leaf litter, such as oak-hickory forests, as the worms can quickly consume and disrupt this layer, leading to soil erosion and a loss of habitat for other forest organisms. They are also detrimental to forests with high biodiversity, such as old-growth forests, as they can impact the balance of the ecosystem and cause declines in native species.
