Deism believes that God created the universe and set it in motion, but does not intervene in human affairs or the natural order of the world. God's role is therefore limited to that of a creator and does not involve ongoing interaction with the universe. Deists also believe that God's existence can be seen through reason and observation, rather than through religious revelation or scripture.
