The omnipotence paradox is a philosophical problem that challenges the concept of an all-powerful entity or deity. The paradox questions whether such a being can truly have unlimited power. The paradox is often framed as the question: "Can an omnipotent being create a stone so heavy that they cannot lift it?"If the being can create such a stone and lift it, then they are not truly omnipotent since they cannot create something that they cannot lift. If they cannot lift the stone, then they are also not truly omnipotent since they cannot perform the action of lifting the stone. This paradox raises questions about the limitations and boundaries of omnipotence and the concept of ultimate power.
