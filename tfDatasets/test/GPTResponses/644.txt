There are several factors believed to have contributed to the increased temperatures in the Sahara, including:1. Global warming: The Sahara, like many other regions around the world, has experienced a rise in temperature as a result of global warming. The increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, has led to a rise in surface temperatures.2. Land-use changes: The Sahara has undergone significant changes in land use over the past few decades, including deforestation, expansion of agricultural land and urbanization. These changes in land use can cause changes in temperature and humidity, which can further exacerbate the warming effect.3. Natural climate cycles: The Sahara has experienced natural climate cycles in the past, including a prolonged period of wetter conditions around 7,000 years ago when the region was much greener. These cycles can contribute to changes in temperature and rainfall patterns.4. Atmospheric circulation patterns: The Sahara is affected by large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns, such as the Hadley Cell and the North Atlantic Oscillation. Changes in these patterns can lead to changes in temperature and rainfall patterns across the Sahara region.
