The primary strategy for Bomber Command offensives during World War II was strategic bombing. This involved targeting key industrial and military infrastructure of Germany and other Axis powers, with the aim of disrupting their ability to conduct war and damaging their morale. The targets included aircraft factories, railway yards, oil refineries, and armament factories. Bomber Command also conducted area bombing, which involved dropping large quantities of bombs on cities and towns, with the aim of destroying housing and causing civilian casualties. The effectiveness and moral justification of this strategy continue to be debated among historians.
