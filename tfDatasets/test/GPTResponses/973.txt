There are several factors that hinder schooling for child labourers including:1. Poverty: Child labourers often come from poor families who cannot afford to send their children to school.2. Lack of access to education: Many child labourers live in slums or rural areas where there are no schools or schools that are too far away.3. Limited time: Child labourers often work long hours and are unable to attend school regularly or complete their homework.4. Discrimination: Children from marginalized groups such as Dalits or tribals often face discrimination in accessing education.5. Quality of education: Many government schools have poor infrastructure and inadequate teaching staff, which makes it difficult for children to receive quality education.6. Lack of awareness: Parents of child labourers may not understand the importance of education or may not be aware of their children's right to education.
