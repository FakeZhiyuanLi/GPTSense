The decision-making authority ultimately depends on the specific laws and regulations governing the project, as well as the agency or organization responsible for overseeing the impact assessment process. In some cases, it may be a governmental agency, such as the Environmental Protection Agency, that holds final say on whether the project may proceed. In other cases, it may be a regulatory agency responsible for protecting specific species or habitats. Additionally, there may be public input and consultation processes involved where stakeholders can voice their concerns and opinions regarding the projectâ€™s potential impact.
