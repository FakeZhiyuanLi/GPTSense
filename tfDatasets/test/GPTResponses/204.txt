After joining the European Economic Community in the 90s, Portugal began building modern infrastructure such as highways, railways, airports, and bridges. It also implemented economic reforms that opened up its market to foreign investment and liberalized its trade policies. This led to a significant increase in Portugal's economic growth and development, as it became more integrated into the global economy. Additionally, Portugal invested heavily in education and research, which helped to modernize its economy and make it more competitive.
