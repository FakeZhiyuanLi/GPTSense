The process of dielectric absorption in a capacitor depends on the properties of the dielectric material used between the plates, such as the dielectric constant or permittivity, and the thickness of the dielectric layer. It also depends on the quality of the insulating materials used in the capacitor, which can affect leakage currents and the ability of the capacitor to maintain a charged state over time. The temperature, humidity, and other environmental factors can also affect dielectric absorption, as they can influence the properties of the dielectric material and the overall performance of the capacitor.
