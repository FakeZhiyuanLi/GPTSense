Aristotle believed that there could not be a void or empty space. He argued that everything in the universe was made up of matter, and matter could not exist in a vacuum. Therefore, he believed that any space that appears empty was actually filled with either air or aether. This belief was in direct contrast to the atomic theory of his contemporary, Democritus, who argued that there was a void between the atoms.
