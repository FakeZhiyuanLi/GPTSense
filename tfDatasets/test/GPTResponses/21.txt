The conventional method to measure the Rhine is through the use of gauging stations. These stations measure the water level and flow rate of the river and are typically placed at intervals along the river's course. The data collected from these gauging stations can be used to monitor water levels, predict floods, and manage water resources. Additionally, river depth soundings can be taken to measure the depth of the river at specific points.
