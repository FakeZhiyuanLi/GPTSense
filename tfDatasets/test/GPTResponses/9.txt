The Germanic tribes crossed the Rhine to migrate at various times throughout history. The earliest recorded crossing occurred in the 2nd century BCE when the Cimbri and Teutones migrated southward from Jutland, while the last major wave of Germanic migration across the Rhine occurred in the 5th century CE with the invasion of the Western Roman Empire by the Visigoths, Vandals, and other Germanic tribes. However, smaller migrations and raids also occurred in between these time periods.
