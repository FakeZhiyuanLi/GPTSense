The Ireland Act of 1914 was a law passed by the British Parliament which provided for the creation of Home Rule for Ireland. It was eventually suspended due to the outbreak of World War I and replaced by the Government of Ireland Act 1920 which partitioned Ireland into Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland. However, the Ireland Act 1914 had significant political and historical importance as it marked a significant shift in British-Irish relations and paved the way for the eventual establishment of an independent Irish state.
