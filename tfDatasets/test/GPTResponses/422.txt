During migration, several physical and physiological processes are heightened, including:1. Metabolic rate: The metabolic rate of migratory birds increases during migration to meet the energy demands of the journey.2. Heart rate: Birds' heart rates increase during migration to compensate for the increased energy demand.3. Hormones: Migration triggers the release of hormones like adrenaline and corticosterone which stimulate the bird's body.4. Body temperature: During migration, birds maintain a higher body temperature than they normally would to conserve energy.5. Blood flow: Increased blood flow to the muscles and organs helps birds meet the energy needs of migration.6. Visual acuity: Migratory birds often have heightened vision during migration to navigate their way across large distances.7. Immune system: During migration, birds' immune systems are often compromised, leaving them vulnerable to disease and parasites.
