Guam was established as an unincorporated territory by the Organic Act of Guam, which was signed into law by President Harry S. Truman on August 1, 1950. This act transferred authority over Guam from the U.S. Navy to the U.S. Department of the Interior, and provided Guam with a civilian government headed by an elected governor and a legislature. The Organic Act also granted U.S. citizenship to Guamanians and extended certain federal laws and basic rights to the territory.
