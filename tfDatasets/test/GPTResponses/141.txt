Formal colonization of the Congo River delta began in the late 19th century, during the Scramble for Africa. In 1885, King Leopold II of Belgium established the Congo Free State, claiming it as his own personal property. This led to the exploitation and mistreatment of the Congolese people, and the country remained a Belgian colony until 1960.
