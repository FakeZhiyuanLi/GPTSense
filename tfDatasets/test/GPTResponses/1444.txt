People with weakened immune systems such as those with HIV/AIDS are more likely to develop extrapulmonary TB. Additionally, people who have had previous TB infections or those who come from countries with high rates of TB are also at increased risk. Other factors that may increase the risk of extrapulmonary TB include diabetes, substance abuse, and malnutrition.
