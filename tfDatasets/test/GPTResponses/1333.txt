After the collapse of Imperial Tibet, the country was thrown into political and social turmoil. The People's Republic of China took control of Tibet in 1951, and the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibet, fled to India in 1959 following a failed uprising against Chinese rule. The Chinese government implemented communist policies and carried out actions that suppressed Tibetan culture and religion, sparking unrest and resistance from the Tibetan people.Over the years, there have been numerous protests, uprisings, and violent clashes between Tibetan activists and Chinese authorities. The international community has also become involved in advocating for Tibet's autonomy and human rights.Today, Tibet remains a disputed region, with the Chinese government claiming control over it, while the Tibetan government-in-exile continues to push for independence and autonomy. The situation remains tense, with frequent reports of human rights abuses and political oppression in Tibet.
