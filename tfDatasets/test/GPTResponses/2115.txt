Theories of physics, such as the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics, suggest that time and energy can be measured. The theory of relativity proposes that time is not an absolute concept, but instead can vary based on an observer's motion. The theory also suggests that energy and mass are interchangeable, with the famous equation E=mc^2 demonstrating that energy can be quantified. In quantum mechanics, energy is also quantized, meaning it can only exist in specific amounts or packets. These theories have been supported by numerous experiments and observations in the field of physics.
