One consequence of modifying radicals is that it can change the value of the radical. For example, taking the square root of a negative number will result in an imaginary number, and modifying the radical can alter the imaginary part of the number. Additionally, modifying the radical can affect the simplification of expressions involving radicals, making them easier or harder to solve.
