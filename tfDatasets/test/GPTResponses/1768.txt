The post-punk scene in England, particularly in London, incorporated ideas from the theater of cruelty. Bands like Siouxsie and the Banshees, Joy Division, and The Birthday Party used elements of the theater of cruelty in their music, performances, and artwork. The theater of cruelty was a movement originated by French poet and playwright Antonin Artaud, which aimed to create a visceral and intense experience for the audience through the use of shocking and violent imagery.
