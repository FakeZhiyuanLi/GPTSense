One of the most notable individuals who predicted Soviet aggression in the Baltic region was George F. Kennan, an American diplomat and historian. In his famous "Long Telegram" in 1946, he outlined the Soviet Union's aggressive intentions and the need for containment to prevent the spread of communism. He specifically emphasized the vulnerability of the Baltic states and their importance for Soviet expansion.
