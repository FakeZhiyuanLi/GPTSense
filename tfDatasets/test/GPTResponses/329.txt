User protected options on DVDs are settings or features that can only be accessed or changed by the user with appropriate authorization. These options vary depending on the DVD and its content, but they may include parental controls, region codes, language selection, and subtitles. By using user protection, DVD manufacturers aim to provide an extra layer of security and control for the user's viewing experience.
