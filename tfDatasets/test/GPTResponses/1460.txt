One of the justifications for spelling reforms is to make spelling more consistent and easier to learn for non-native speakers and children with dyslexia or other learning difficulties. Another justification is to reflect changes in the pronunciation of words over time, making them more phonetic. Additionally, some argue that spelling reforms would make written communication more efficient, as people could communicate more quickly and accurately without having to consult dictionaries or spell-checkers as often.
