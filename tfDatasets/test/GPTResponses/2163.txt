The 1277 Paris condemnations led to the conclusion that certain Aristotelian philosophical and theological positions were incompatible with Christian doctrine. This led to a reassessment of the role of reason in theology and the need for theological teachings to be based on scripture and the teachings of the Church rather than on philosophy. It also paved the way for the development of scholasticism and the works of theologians such as Thomas Aquinas, who sought to reconcile reason and faith.
