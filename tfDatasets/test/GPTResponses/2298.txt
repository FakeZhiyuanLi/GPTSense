The earliest process used to make zinc was the "distillation" process, which involved heating zinc ore (usually a mixture of zinc sulfide and iron sulfide) in a sealed retort or smelter with charcoal or coke as a reducing agent. This process produced vapors of zinc, which were then collected and condensed to form a solid metal. The distillation process was initially used in the Middle East and later spread to Europe during the medieval period.
