There are several factors that have contributed to the Chamorro people finding it hard to keep their culture that involves their children. These include:1. Colonialism: Guam was colonized by Spain in the 16th century and then later by the United States in the 19th century. These colonizers brought with them their own cultures and imposed them on the Chamorro people, resulting in the decline of indigenous practices.2. Westernization: The influence of Western culture through media, education, and tourism has also played a role in the erosion of Chamorro traditions. Younger generations are exposed to Western values that may conflict with or replace Chamorro values.3. Migration: Many Chamorro people have migrated to the mainland United States for economic and educational opportunities. This has resulted in a diaspora of the Chamorro culture, making it difficult for them to maintain their traditions in a foreign environment.4. Modernization: The rapid pace of modernization and technological advancement has also contributed to the decline of traditional practices among the Chamorro people. Younger generations may be more interested in modern technology and entertainment than in traditional practices.Overall, these factors have made it difficult for the Chamorro people to maintain their cultural practices, including those involving their children. However, efforts are being made to preserve and revitalize Chamorro culture through education, cultural programs, and community involvement.
