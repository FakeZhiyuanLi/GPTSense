In Greek mythology, Marsyas was a satyr who challenged the god Apollo to a musical contest. The contest was judged by the Muses, who declared Apollo the winner. In his anger, Apollo flayed Marsyas alive and hung his skin on a nearby tree. The blood of Marsyas is said to have turned into the river Marsyas.
