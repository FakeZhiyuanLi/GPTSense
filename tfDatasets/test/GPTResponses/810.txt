he considered to be a potential threat from the Soviets. Hitler believed that by signing the non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union, he prevented a two-front war, which had been a significant problem during World War I. Thus, Hitler avoided a war on two fronts, with the potential for the Soviet Union to invade Germany from the east, which would have been catastrophic for Germany. Additionally, the pact gave Hitler more time to prepare for a war with Britain and France, which he thought was inevitable. Overall, the deal with the USSR allowed Hitler to delay a war with the Soviet Union while he conquered other nations in Europe.
