There is no definitive answer to this question, as the number of Soviet troops in Baku during the Soviet era varied depending on the specific time period and the nature of the military operation in question. However, it is known that Soviet troops were stationed in Baku during a number of significant periods in Soviet history, including during World War II, the Azerbaijani independence movement of the late 1980s and early 1990s, and the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.
