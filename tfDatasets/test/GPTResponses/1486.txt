One type of configuration in which a capacitor may have its connecting leads arranged is radial lead configuration, where the leads come out of the bottom of the capacitor and are bent downwards or outwards in a radial pattern. Another type of configuration is axial lead configuration, where the leads come out of the ends of the capacitor and are arranged in a straight line. Surface-mount capacitors also have a different configuration, where they have no leads and are placed directly onto the circuit board. There are other less common configurations as well, such as lug lead configuration, where the leads are attached to lugs on the capacitor body.
