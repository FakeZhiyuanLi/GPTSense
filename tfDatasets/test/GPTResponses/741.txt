To come to thermal equilibrium, the electromagnetic field needs to interact with a thermal reservoir or heat bath, which can exchange energy with the field until their temperatures equalize. The heat bath acts as a source or sink of energy, continually supplying or absorbing energy to maintain a temperature balance. Additionally, the electromagnetic field should be coupled strongly enough to the heat bath so that energy can be exchanged efficiently. The rate of energy exchange is determined by the temperature difference between the field and the heat bath and the coupling strength. Over time, the field will approach a steady-state where its energy distribution matches the thermal distribution of the heat bath, and thermal equilibrium will be achieved.
