Peristalsis is the term used to describe the coordinated muscular contractions of the digestive tract that move food through the digestive system.The process begins when food is swallowed and enters the esophagus. The circular muscles in the wall of the esophagus contract, pushing the bolus of food forward. As the contraction moves downward, it creates a wave-like motion that propels the food towards the stomach.When the food enters the stomach, the stomach muscles contract to break it down into smaller particles. As the food is broken down into a thick liquid called chyme, peristalsis continues, contracting the muscles of the small intestine to push the chyme along its length. Enzymes in the small intestine further break down the chyme into nutrients that can be absorbed by the body.Finally, the remains of the food pass into the large intestine, where water is absorbed and feces are formed. Peristalsis continues here, pushing the feces towards the rectum and anus, where they are eventually expelled.Overall, peristalsis relies on the coordinated contractions of the smooth muscles lining the digestive tract, which work together to move food through the digestive system.
