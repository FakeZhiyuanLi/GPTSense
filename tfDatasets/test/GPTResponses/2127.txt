The indigenous Palermo population, known as the Sicilian Greeks or Byzantines, were generally treated well under Muslim rule in the 9th to 11th centuries. They were allowed to practice their own religion, customs and language, and many held important positions in government and trade. The Muslims also brought new technologies, such as irrigation systems and new crops, which benefited the local population. However, there were occasional conflicts between the two groups, particularly during periods of political instability, and the Sicilian Greeks were sometimes forced to pay tribute or suffer extortion. Overall, the relationship between the two groups was complex and varied throughout the centuries of Muslim rule in Sicily.
