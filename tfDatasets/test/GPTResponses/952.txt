When one light source is more intense than another, it means that it emits more light per unit area or per unit time than the other light source. In other words, the more intense light source produces more brightness or luminosity than the less intense light source. This could be due to various factors such as the amount of energy the light source consumes, the physical properties of the light-emitting materials, or the design of the apparatus that produces the light.
