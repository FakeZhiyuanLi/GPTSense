There were several actions by the Indian kingdoms that gave the European traders the opportunity to acquire lands and influence. These include:1. Weakness of Indian Kingdoms: The Indian kingdoms were weakened by continuous wars, internal conflicts, and the decline of the Mughal Empire, which created opportunities for European traders to exploit the situation by establishing trade relations with the Indian rulers.2. Desire for Indian goods: The Europeans were attracted to the wealth of India, which included spices, textiles, and other luxury items that were in high demand in Europe. This created a demand for goods that could only be acquired through trade relations with Indian kingdoms.3. Establishment of Trading Posts: European traders established trading posts in India which later became centers of political power. This provided an opportunity for the Europeans to acquire lands and influence through trade agreements and political alliances with the Indian rulers.4. Use of Military Power: The Europeans used their superior military power and technology to conquer and establish their control over Indian kingdoms. This allowed them to acquire land and influence over the local population.Overall, the weakness of Indian kingdoms created opportunities for European traders to establish trade relations and acquire lands and influence. The desire for Indian goods, establishment of trading posts, and use of military power were some of the key factors that helped the European traders in this process.
