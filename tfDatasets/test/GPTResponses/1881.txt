There are multiple factors that determine the extent to which renewable energy is incorporated into a country's generation mix, including:1. Government policies and regulations: Governments can incentivize the use of renewable energy through policies such as feed-in tariffs, tax credits, and renewable portfolio standards. The stronger the policies and regulations, the more likely a country will adopt renewable energy sources.2. Cost competitiveness of renewable energy: The cost of renewable energy has been decreasing over the years, making it increasingly competitive with traditional fossil fuel sources. The more cost-competitive renewable energy becomes, the more likely it is that countries will incorporate it into their generation mix.3. Availability and accessibility of renewable energy resources: Countries with abundant renewable energy resources such as wind, solar, hydropower, and geothermal energy are more likely to incorporate these sources into their generation mix.4. Public awareness and support for renewable energy: Increased public awareness of the benefits of renewable energy and support for its use can pressure governments and utilities to incorporate renewable energy into their generation mix.5. Energy security concerns: Countries that rely heavily on imported fossil fuels may seek to diversify their energy mix with renewable energy sources to increase energy security and reduce their dependence on foreign sources.
