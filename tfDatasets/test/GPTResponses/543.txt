The Sahara lacks moisture primarily because of its location, which is in a subtropical high-pressure zone where sinking and dry air masses prevail. This leads to low relative humidity, little cloud formation, and infrequent precipitation. Additionally, the hot temperatures in the desert cause rapid evaporation of any available water sources. The combination of these factors makes it difficult for moisture to accumulate and persist in the Sahara.
