There are several factors that can fight against the rule of law. Some of them are:1. Corruption: When officials involved in the legal system are corrupt or indulge in corrupt practices, it undermines the trust people have in the rule of law.2. Political influence: When political leaders use their influence to influence the decisions of the legal system it undermines the independence of the judiciary and the law enforcement agencies.3. Discrimination: When certain sections of society are treated unfairly or discriminated against in the legal system, it undermines the legitimacy of the rule of law.4. Lack of transparency: When the legal system operates in secret or is not transparent, it undermines public trust in the system.5. Weak institutions: When legal and law enforcement institutions are weak or under-resourced, they may lack the capacity to enforce the law effectively, leading to a breakdown in the rule of law.
