The walls of Neapolis, also known as the walls of Nicosia, were built in the 16th century in Cyprus by the Venetians. They were designed to protect the city from attacks by the Ottomans and other invaders. The walls were highly fortified with bastions, watchtowers, and a moat. They were also heavily armed with artillery cannons. The walls of Neapolis were meant to serve as a defensive barrier, ensuring the safety of the city and its inhabitants during times of war. Today, the walls serve as a historic landmark and are a popular tourist attraction.
