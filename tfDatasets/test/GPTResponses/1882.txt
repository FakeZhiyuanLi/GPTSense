The Electoral College was introduced as a compromise between those who wanted the president elected by popular vote and those who preferred congressional selection. It was included in the U.S. Constitution as a way to balance the interests of both larger and smaller states, with each state receiving a number of electors based on its representation in Congress, with two additional electors for its Senators. The Electoral College was also designed to ensure that the presidency would not become the preserve of the largest states or of particular regions.
