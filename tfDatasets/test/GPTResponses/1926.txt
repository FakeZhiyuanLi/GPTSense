There were several key factors that help to launch synthpop:1) The development of affordable synthesizers and drum machines in the late 1970s and early 1980s allowed artists to create electronic music with ease.2) Popular bands such as Depeche Mode, Kraftwerk, and New Order helped to popularize the sound and style of synthpop.3) The rise of MTV and music videos in the 1980s provided a platform for visual representation and exposure.4) The poppier and more danceable nature of synthpop appealed to younger audiences.5) The crossover between disco and electronic music also helped to bring synthpop to mainstream attention.
