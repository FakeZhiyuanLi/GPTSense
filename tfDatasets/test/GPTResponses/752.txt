Max Planck was studying theoretical physics, specifically the problem of black body radiation, in the last part of the nineteenth century. He was trying to explain the distribution of energy in the spectrum of radiation emitted by a heated object. This led him to develop a new theory of radiation, which later became known as Planck's law. This theory laid the foundation for the development of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory in the twentieth century.
