The assumption that black-body radiation follows Planck's law, which describes the spectral density of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a black body in thermal equilibrium at a given temperature, is what leads to an accurate prediction. This is because Planck's law takes into account the fact that the radiation emitted by a black body at a given temperature is dependent on the frequency of the radiation and the temperature of the body. Planck's law has been experimentally verified and is widely accepted in the scientific community.
