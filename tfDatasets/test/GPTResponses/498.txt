One primary source of orphan protein-coding genes is gene duplication followed by divergence. This occurs when a gene is duplicated, and the additional copy eventually undergoes mutations that alter its sequence and functional properties, leading to the development of a new gene with no clear ancestral homolog. These orphan genes are often involved in novel biological functions and may contribute to evolutionary innovation in organisms.
