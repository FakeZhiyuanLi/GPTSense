The origins of the Berber people are not clear, but it is believed that they are indigenous to North Africa and have lived in the region for thousands of years. Some theories suggest that the Berbers may have descended from an ancient group of peoples known as the Tenehur, who lived in the Sahara region around 10,000 BCE. Others believe that the Berbers may have come from the Middle East or even Europe. Regardless of their origins, the Berbers have had a major impact on North African history and culture for millennia.
