Physical laws that are time-reversal invariant are those that remain unchanged if time is reversed. This means that if you were to run an experiment in reverse time, the results would be the same as running it normally. Examples of physical laws that are time-reversal invariant include conservation of energy, conservation of momentum, and Maxwell's electromagnetic equations. However, some physical laws are not time-reversal invariant, such as the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which states that entropy will always increase over time.
