The elites of the Ottoman Empire found classical Ottoman music, also known as Turkish classical music or Ottoman court music, to be important. This genre of music was primarily performed in the palaces and mansions of the Ottoman elite, and was considered an art form that reflected the sophistication and aesthetic sensibility of the ruling class. Ottoman court music was heavily influenced by Persian and Arabic music, and featured intricate melodies and lyrics that often had religious or philosophical themes. It was performed by highly trained musicians, including the revered Ottoman classical composers, who were considered to be among the most important artists of their time.
