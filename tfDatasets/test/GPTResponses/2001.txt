The United States attempted to make Puerto Rico's language English by implementing policies such as the Foraker Act of 1900, which established English as the primary official language of the island. The law mandated that all government documents and business be conducted in English rather than Spanish. Additionally, in 1902, the Taft Commission was appointed to address the issue of language on the island. The Commission recommended that English be taught to Puerto Rican students, while Spanish was relegated to the status of a secondary language. Finally, in 1917, the Jones Act granted US citizenship to Puerto Ricans, further encouraging the use of English. Despite these efforts, however, Spanish remains the dominant language used in Puerto Rico today.
