Giant axons are specialized nerve fibers that are significantly larger in diameter than regular axons. These axons can be found in certain invertebrates, such as squid or octopus, and some vertebrates, such as certain types of fish. They are typically around 500 times larger in diameter than a human neuron and can reach lengths up to several centimeters long. Their giant size allows for faster transmission of electrical signals, making them an important component of the nervous system in these animals. They also play a role in quick responses to potential threats, such as quick escape or attack behaviors.
