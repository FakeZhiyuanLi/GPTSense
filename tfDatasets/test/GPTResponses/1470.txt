When a lysosome combines with a phagosome, the result is a phagolysosome. This is a membrane-bound organelle containing digestive enzymes from the lysosome and the materials to be digested from the phagosome. The contents are broken down by the acidic environment and the enzymes, allowing for the recycling of molecules and the elimination of foreign substances.
