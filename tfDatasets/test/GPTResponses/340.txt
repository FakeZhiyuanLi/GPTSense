Both DVD and Laserdisc can become unreadable with damage. Laserdiscs are especially vulnerable to damage from scratches and sunlight exposure, which can cause the disc to warp or become discolored. DVD discs can also be scratched or damaged, which can cause skipping or freezing during playback. Additionally, DVD discs can degrade over time due to exposure to light, heat, and humidity, which can cause the disc to become unreadable.
