Jehovah's Witnesses believe that Jesus was not crucified on a cross, but rather on a stake or post. They base their belief primarily on the Greek word "stauros," which they interpret to mean a single upright beam or post, rather than a cross with a horizontal bar. They also point to various historical and archaeological evidence, as well as their own interpretation of biblical scripture, in support of their belief.
