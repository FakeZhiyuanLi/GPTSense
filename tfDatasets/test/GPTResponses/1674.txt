Many of the initial post-punk artists came from a punk rock background, but were also influenced by other genres such as art rock, experimental music, and electronic music. They often rejected the commercialism and conformity of mainstream music and embraced a DIY aesthetic, incorporating unconventional instrumentation and experimental song structures. Many of these artists were also politically and socially engaged, exploring themes of alienation, urban decay, and inequality in their music.
