Most of Ibn Sina's works were written in Arabic, which was the predominant language of intellectual discourse and scholarship throughout the Islamic world during the medieval period. Ibn Sina was a prolific writer who produced over 450 works in various fields, including philosophy, medicine, theology, and astronomy. His works were influential not only in the Islamic world but also in the Western world, where they were translated into Latin and studied extensively during the Renaissance.
