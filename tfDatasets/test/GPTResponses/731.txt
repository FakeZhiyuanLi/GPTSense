The Muslim conquest of North Africa took place between the 7th and 8th centuries. The Arabs conquered Egypt in 641 and then moved westward, with the conquest of Carthage in 698 marking the end of the Byzantine presence in North Africa. The Arab-Muslim presence in the region continued to expand over the following centuries.
