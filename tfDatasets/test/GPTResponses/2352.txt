There is no one answer to this question as it varies depending on the time period in question. During the Soviet era, many Estonians desired to flee to countries such as Sweden, Finland, Germany, and the United States.

However, it is important to note that many Estonians also choose to stay in their home country and work towards making positive changes there.
