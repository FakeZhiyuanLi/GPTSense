The federal program used to list a species is called the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Under this law, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) are responsible for identifying and listing species as endangered or threatened, and for developing and implementing plans to conserve and recover these species. Listing a species under the ESA provides legal protections and regulatory measures to help prevent extinction and promote recovery.
