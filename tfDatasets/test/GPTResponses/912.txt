imperialist and unjust, and that it was being fought for the benefit of the ruling classes. They saw it as a continuation of the same capitalist exploitation and oppression that had been pervasive throughout history. They also argued that the war was not about democracy, freedom or the defense of human rights, but rather about the consolidation of power and the advancement of imperialist interests.These views were shaped by the political and social context of the times, as well as the ideologies of communism and socialism, which emphasized the struggle between the working classes and the ruling elites. Western communists also drew inspiration from the revolutionary movements that swept across Europe after World War I, such as the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, which they saw as a model for their own struggle.Overall, the western communist rhetoric reflected a deep skepticism about the motivations behind the war and a firm commitment to the ideals of social justice, equality, and the emancipation of the working class. While their views were often controversial and hotly debated, they represented a significant challenge to the prevailing orthodoxy of the time and helped to shape the political discourse of the era.
