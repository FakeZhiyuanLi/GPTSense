The rule of law is superior to all individuals and governments, and it applies equally to all people and entities under its jurisdiction. This principle is enshrined in the Constitution's Supremacy Clause, which states that the Constitution, federal laws, and treaties are the supreme law of the land, and state and local laws must comply with them. Thus, no person, including the president or other government officials, is above the law, and everyone must abide by the same legal standards.
