The quantum of action, also known as Planck's constant, yields the minimum amount of energy that can be exchanged between the quantum system and its environment. For certain cases of light or atoms, it determines the discrete energy levels that the system can occupy, as well as the probability of quantum transitions between these levels. It also plays a crucial role in the wave-particle duality of quantum mechanics, where particles can exhibit wave-like behavior and waves can exhibit particle-like behavior.
