Corruption in the government is typically examined by independent oversight bodies or institutions that operate separately from the branches of government. These can include anti-corruption agencies or commissions, independent auditors, or specialized investigative units within the judicial system. Additionally, the legislative branch may conduct investigations and inquiries into allegations of government corruption through its various committees and subcommittees.
