There could be various reasons why some electrifications were removed after a while. Some possible reasons could be:1. Cost: The initial cost of electrification may be high, and ongoing maintenance and repair costs can also be expensive. If the cost of running and maintaining electrification outweighs the benefits or revenue generated, it could lead to its removal.2. Technological advances: As new technologies emerge, they may replace older methods of electrification. An example is the shift from trolleybuses to diesel-powered buses in some cities.3. Changing transportation needs: Over time, transportation needs can change. For instance, some rural areas that used to have electrified train tracks may have seen a decline in population, making it uneconomical to continue operating electrified trains.4. Safety concerns: Electrification poses risks to people and property, especially in the event of severe weather or accidents. If safety concerns increase, removing electrification could be necessary.5. Environmental concerns: While electrification is generally seen as more environmentally friendly than fossil fuel-powered transportation, it still has environmental impacts. For example, generating the electricity needed to power trains can cause pollution. As environmental concerns increase, some electrifications may be removed if they are found to be unsustainable or environmentally harmful.
