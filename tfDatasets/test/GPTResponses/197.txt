The object of study for linguistic anthropology is the relationship between language and culture, and how they are intertwined in shaping individuals and societies. This includes the study of language structures, usage, and evolution within specific cultural and social contexts. Linguistic anthropologists also examine the ways in which language is used to express identity, social status, power dynamics, and interpersonal relationships. Additionally, they may explore language acquisition and development, multilingualism, and the role of language in shaping social institutions, such as law and education.
