The effective capacitance of the capacitor increases when an electric field exists between the sides of the plates as well as within the dielectric. This is because the presence of the electric field within the dielectric increases its polarization, which in turn increases the capacitance of the capacitor. This effect is known as the dielectric constant or relative permittivity of the material, and it is a measure of the ability of a material to store electric charge within an electric field. The higher the dielectric constant of the material, the greater the increase in capacitance.
