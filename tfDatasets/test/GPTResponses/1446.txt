There are several reasons why the method of gradually applying the operating voltage may not be suitable to protect electrolytic capacitors in modern devices:1. Faster charging times: Many modern electronic devices require capacitors to charge quickly to meet the demands of high-speed data transfer and processing. Gradual voltage application may slow down the charging process, reducing device performance.2. Reduced capacitor lifespan: Electrolytic capacitors are designed to operate at a specific voltage range. Gradual voltage application may cause the capacitors to be exposed to a higher or lower voltage than their design specification, leading to a reduced lifespan.3. Risk of catastrophic capacitor failure: Over time, electrolytic capacitors can undergo a process called "dry-out" where the electrolyte inside the capacitor dries out, causing the capacitor to fail catastrophically. Gradual voltage application may not be effective in preventing this failure mode.4. Incompatibility with modern power management ICs: Many modern devices use power management ICs that are specifically designed to manage the voltage applied to various components, including capacitors. Gradual voltage application may not be compatible with these ICs, leading to compatibility issues and reduced device performance.Overall, while gradual voltage application may be suitable for protecting electrolytic capacitors in some applications, it may not be the best approach for modern electronic devices that require fast charging times, high performance, and compatibility with advanced power management ICs.
