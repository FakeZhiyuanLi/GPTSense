There can be various reasons why a person may become separated from their "true self", including:1. Trauma: Experiencing trauma or abuse can cause a person to disconnect from their true self as a coping mechanism to protect themselves from further harm.2. Societal pressures: Societal pressures and cultural expectations can cause a person to conform to societal norms, thereby losing their individuality and unique identity.3. Negative self-talk: Frequent negative self-talk can cause a person to believe they are not good enough, resulting in loss of confidence and self-identity.4. Performance anxiety: Constantly striving for perfection can lead a person to lose sight of their true self by focusing too much on external validation.5. Social media: The pressure to present a perfect image on social media can lead to a person losing touch with their true self and focusing more on projecting a particular image.6. Toxic relationships: Being in toxic relationships can cause a person to lose their self-confidence and individuality by constantly bending to the will of others.7. Life transitions: Major life transitions such as moving, changing jobs, or relationships can cause a person to become disconnected from their true self, as they adjust to new circumstances and situations.
