An issue in Africa with child labour definitions is the lack of a standardized definition across the continent. Each country has its own definition of what constitutes as child labour, leading to inconsistent reporting and monitoring of the issue. Additionally, some African countries have legal loopholes and exemptions that allow for children to work in certain industries, further complicating efforts to combat child labour.
