To say that God is omnipotent means that God is all-powerful and has the ability to do anything that is logically possible. It implies that there are no limits to God's power and that God possesses complete control over every aspect of the universe. In other words, God has the power to create and destroy anything, bring about miracles and perform any task that is not logically impossible.
