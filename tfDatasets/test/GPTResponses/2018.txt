Section 6 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides funding for the conservation of endangered and threatened species. Specifically, it authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to provide grants to states and territories for developing and implementing conservation plans for listed species. The funds can be used for research, habitat restoration, monitoring, education, and other activities that benefit the recovery of imperiled species. Additionally, Section 6 also allows for Cooperative Agreements between the federal government and private landowners to conserve listed species on their lands.
