A broad, modern working definition of a gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the information necessary for the synthesis of a functional RNA or protein molecule, which controls or influences the expression of a specific trait or characteristic in an organism. This definition acknowledges the complexity and diversity of gene function, including regulatory elements, alternative splicing, epigenetic modifications, and non-coding RNA transcripts. Additionally, it recognizes the dynamic nature of genomes and genetic information, which are subject to mutation, recombination, and evolutionary selection.
