Avicenna (Ibn Sina) was imprisoned twice in his life. During his first imprisonment, he wrote his famous philosophical treatise "The Healing" (Al-Shifa), which became an influential work in both Islamic and European philosophy. This work addressed a wide range of topics, including logic, metaphysics, ethics, and natural sciences.During his second imprisonment, Avicenna is believed to have written some of his works related to medicine, including "The Canon of Medicine" (Al-Qanun fi al-Tibb). This was a comprehensive medical encyclopedia that remained a standard reference in European medical education for centuries.It is important to note that there is some lack of clarity around the details of Avicenna's imprisonment, including what he wrote during that time, due to limited historical records.
