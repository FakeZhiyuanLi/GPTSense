The appointments that were the first step in Indian self-rule were the following:1. Indian Councils Act (1861) - This act expanded the council's size and gave them advisory roles.2. Morley-Minto Reforms (1909) - This act allowed Indians to be elected to the legislative councils and granted some administrative functions.3. Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms (1919) - This act provided for the creation of two houses of the legislature and gave Indians greater say in the administration.These appointments were crucial in the process of Indian self-rule and paved the way for India to eventually become independent in 1947.
