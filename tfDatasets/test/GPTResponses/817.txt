Plato purported an ideal or utopian kingdom in his book "The Republic". This kingdom is called the "Kallipolis" or "Beautiful City" and is ruled by philosopher-kings who are trained in both political and philosophical governance. The society is structured into three classes: the rulers, the warriors, and the producers, with each individual doing the job that corresponds to their natural abilities. The goal of this society is to achieve justice, which Plato believed could be found by organizing society according to the principles of reason and virtue.
