Plato compared a government that follows laws to a ship that is guided by a skilled navigator. Just as a skilled navigator navigates a ship through storms and rough waters, a government that follows laws can navigate the challenges of ruling a state while remaining just and fair. In his book "Republic," Plato argues that a just government should be guided by reason and wisdom, and that its rulers should be philosopher-kings who are knowledgeable and ethical.
