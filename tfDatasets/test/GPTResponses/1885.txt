The elimination of lead additives in diesel fuel helped the efficiency of diesel traction to go up. Lead additives were previously used in diesel fuel to increase its lubricity and reduce wear on engine components. However, lead is a highly toxic substance that poses health and environmental risks. As a result, regulations were put in place to eliminate the use of lead additives in diesel fuel, which led to the development of new and more efficient lubricity additives that do not pose the same health and environmental risks. These new additives helped to improve the efficiency of diesel engines, resulting in better fuel economy and reduced emissions.
