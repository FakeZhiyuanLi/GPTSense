These issues are typically legislated on at the federal and state level. In the United States, for example, the Supreme Court has made key rulings on abortion, but individual states also have their own laws regulating access to abortion. Similarly, the federal government plays a role in drug policy through agencies such as the Drug Enforcement Administration, but states also have their own laws regulating how drugs are classified and how they can be used.
