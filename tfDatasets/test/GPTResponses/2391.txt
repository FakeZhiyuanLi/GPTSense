about the race for the presidency in 2000?One concern about the race for the presidency in 2000 was the possibility of a repeat of the controversial election of 1976, which was decided by the Supreme Court. There was also concern about the impact of the third-party candidacy of Ralph Nader, who could potentially siphon votes away from the Democratic candidate and tip the election in favor of George W. Bush. Additionally, there were concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the voting systems and the potential for voter fraud or suppression.
