Any capacitor that has non-linear or frequency-dependent characteristics can cause signal distortion in the downstream tube. Examples of such capacitors include electrolytic capacitors, ceramic capacitors, and film capacitors with poor tolerances or aging characteristics. Additionally, capacitors with high ESR (Equivalent Series Resistance) or ESL (Equivalent Series Inductance) can add unwanted resistance or inductance to the circuit, leading to signal degradation.
