The Guam Organic Act, which was passed in 1950, allowed the population of Guam to become U.S. citizens and granted them certain civil rights and protections. It also established a civilian government and an elected governor for the territory. Additionally, the act provided for the construction of military bases on the island and authorized the establishment of a judicial system and local laws.
