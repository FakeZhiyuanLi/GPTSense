The first standardized MPEG suite was MPEG-1, which was introduced by the Moving Picture Experts Group in 1993. This suite defined a compression format for video and audio data, which allowed for efficient storage and transmission of multimedia content. It was widely used for creating VCDs (Video Compact Discs) and early digital video formats. Later versions of MPEG, such as MPEG-2, MPEG-4, and MPEG-7, built upon the foundation set by MPEG-1 and added new features and improvements.
