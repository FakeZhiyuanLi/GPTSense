Mechanically controlled variable capacitors enable the modification of the capacitance value of a circuit by adjusting the physical position of a capacitorâ€™s plates. This allows for the tuning of resonant circuits, frequency control in oscillators, and adjustment of filter circuits. It is often used in applications such as antenna tuners, RF amplifiers, and frequency synthesizers.
