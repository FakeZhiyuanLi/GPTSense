Deism is a philosophical belief that asserts the existence of a supreme being or creator who does not intervene in the world and is not part of any particular religion. Deists typically reject organized religion and believe that people can come to understand the nature of God and the universe through reason and observation. This belief system became increasingly popular in the 17th and 18th centuries during the Enlightenment period. Famous deists include Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin.
