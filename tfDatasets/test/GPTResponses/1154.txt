Green is often considered a symbol of Ireland and Scotland because of the lush green landscapes found in both countries. Additionally, green is the color of the shamrock, which is a symbol of Ireland, and the thistle, which is a symbol of Scotland. During major events such as St. Patrick's Day and Burns Night, people often wear green clothing or accessories to show their pride in their Irish or Scottish heritage.
