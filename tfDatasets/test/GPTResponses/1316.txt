Another cause of dielectric losses in a capacitor is when the dielectric material undergoes thermal and mechanical stress, leading to partial breakdown of the material and the creation of conducting paths. This can happen when the capacitor operates at high temperatures or is exposed to high mechanical stress, leading to an increase in the loss tangent and a decrease in the quality factor of the capacitor. Ageing of the capacitor due to prolonged use can also result in dielectric loss.
