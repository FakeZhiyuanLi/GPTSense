This is commonly seen in Chinese characters, where the last character is combined with the radical of the first character to form a new character. This process is known as radical-phonetic compound. For example, the character "學" (learn) is formed by combining the radical "子" (child) with the phonetic component "学" (xué, meaning "study"). Many Chinese characters are formed in this way, making it an important aspect of the Chinese writing system.
