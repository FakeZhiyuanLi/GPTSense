The most serious aftereffects of child labour include:1. Physical health problems: Children who are engaged in manual labour are often subjected to physically demanding tasks that can cause long-term health problems such as musculoskeletal disorders and chronic pain.2. Psychological and emotional problems: Child labour can lead to feelings of isolation, anxiety, and depression as children are often working in hazardous or exploitative conditions, leaving them with little time for play, socialization, or education.3. Education deprivation: Children who work are often denied access to education, which limits their opportunities for personal and professional development.4. Impaired social development: Child labour can disrupt the normal socialization process as children are often removed from their families and communities to work in hazardous or distant places.5. Stunted growth: Working children may not receive adequate nutrition or healthcare, leading to stunted growth and developmental delays.
