This exclusion was due to discriminatory laws and practices in the United States, such as racial segregation and Jim Crow laws, which prevented black people from participating fully in the political and legal system. These laws and practices were enforced through various means, such as poll taxes, literacy tests, and other forms of voter suppression, which effectively denied African Americans equal access to public offices and jury service. This, in turn, perpetuated systemic racism and discrimination against black people in American society.
