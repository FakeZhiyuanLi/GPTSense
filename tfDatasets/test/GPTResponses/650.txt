The Planck constant, denoted by the symbol h, is a physical constant that is used to relate the energy carried by a photon to its frequency or wavelength. It is named after German physicist Max Planck, who originally introduced it in 1900 as a fundamental constant of nature in his quantum theory of radiation. The Planck constant is an important concept in quantum mechanics and plays a critical role in many areas of physics, including atomic and molecular physics, solid-state physics, and particle physics. Its value is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 joule-second.
