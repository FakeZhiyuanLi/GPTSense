There are typically three main transfer modes used in data communication:1. Simplex: Data flows in only one direction.2. Half-duplex: Data can flow in both directions, but only in one direction at a time.3. Full-duplex: Data flows in both directions simultaneously.However, some sources may include a fourth transfer mode, called "multi-drop," which allows multiple devices to be connected to a single communication channel. In multi-drop mode, data can be sent and received by multiple devices, but the devices cannot communicate with each other. Instead, all communication must go through a central device, such as a hub or router.
