The Holy Trinity is a core belief in Christianity that describes God as being one God in three persons: God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ), and God the Holy Spirit. This belief is based on the teachings of the Bible and is considered a fundamental doctrine of Christian theology. The Holy Trinity is considered a mystery beyond human understanding and is a central concept in Christian worship, prayer, and confession.
