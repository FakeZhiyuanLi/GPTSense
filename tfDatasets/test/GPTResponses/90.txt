Portugal was associated with the Roman god Jupiter, who was considered the king of the gods and the protector of the Roman state. The name "Portugal" itself is derived from the Roman name for the region, Portus Cale, which means "port of Cale", where Cale was the ancient name for the city of Porto. The Roman presence in Portugal left a significant legacy in the country, including its language, laws, and customs.
