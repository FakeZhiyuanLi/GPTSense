The English settlers received land, crops, and shelter in return for their labor. They also gained economic opportunities and the ability to build new lives in the colonies. Some were promised religious freedom, while others were given the chance to escape poverty and start anew. However, some indentured servants, who worked for several years without pay, were not always fairly compensated for their labor.
