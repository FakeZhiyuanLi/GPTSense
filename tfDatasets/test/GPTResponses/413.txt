Crosstalk occurs when electromagnetic signals interfere with each other, causing unwanted noise or distortion in a communication channel. It can occur in various electronic devices and communication systems, such as cables, wires, printed circuit boards, and antennas. Crosstalk becomes more significant when signals have higher frequencies, longer distances, or greater power levels. It can also happen when multiple signals are transmitted simultaneously in a shared medium, such as in telephone lines, Ethernet cables, or radio frequencies.
