The mesothelium is a tissue layer that lines the body's cavities and organs. It is made up of a single layer of flat cells called mesothelial cells, which secrete a fluid that allows organs to move smoothly against each other. The mesothelium can be found in the lining of the lungs, heart, stomach, intestines, and other organs.
