Since Alhazen (also known as Ibn al-Haytham) lived before the development of the concept of topos in mathematics, it is not possible for him to have rejected any definition of topos. Alhazen was a prominent Arab mathematician, astronomer, and physicist who lived in the 10th and 11th centuries. His work focused on optics, vision, and the principles of light, and he is widely regarded as one of the greatest scientists of the Islamic Golden Age.
