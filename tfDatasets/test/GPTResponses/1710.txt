The Contras were a paramilitary organization who fought against the Sandinista government in Nicaragua during the 1980s. They were supported by the United States government, who saw the Sandinistas as a communist threat to democracy in Central America. The Contras were comprised of former Sandinistas, anti-Sandinista Nicaraguans, and mercenaries, and were notorious for their brutal tactics, including assassinations, bombings, and kidnappings. The Contra war ended in 1990 with the Sandinistas losing power in the Nicaraguan elections.
