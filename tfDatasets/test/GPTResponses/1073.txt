Some polychaetes, such as the fan worm (Sabella spallanzanii), have been causing problems by feeding on planktonic organisms and filtering particles from the water, disrupting local ecosystems and damaging fishing and aquaculture industries. Other polychaetes, such as the tube worm (Hydroides elegans), can damage man-made structures such as boats and piers by attaching themselves to them and forming dense colonies.
