One notable piece of surviving late middle age royal plate is the Royal Gold Cup, which was created in the 14th century and is now part of the collection at the British Museum. The cup is made of gold and decorated with intricate engravings, enamel work, and gemstones. It was likely used as a display of royal wealth and power, and is one of the few surviving examples of medieval goldsmith's work.
