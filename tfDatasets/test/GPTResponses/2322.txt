Different insects demonstrate various types of exchanges, including:1. Mutualism - an exchange between two organisms that benefits both parties. An example of this is a bee and a flower: the bee pollinates the flower and receives nectar in return.2. Parasitism - an exchange between two organisms where one benefits while the other is harmed. An example of this is a mosquito and a human: the mosquito feeds on the human's blood, potentially transmitting diseases, while the human suffers from itchy bites.3. Commensalism - an exchange between two organisms where one benefits and the other is neither benefited nor harmed. An example of this is a spider building a web on a tree: the spider benefits from the shelter provided by the tree, while the tree is unaffected by the spider.4. Competition - an exchange between two or more organisms that strive for resources such as food, water, or shelter. An example of this is ants fighting for access to sugary foods.These are just a few examples, there are many more types of exchanges in the insect world.
