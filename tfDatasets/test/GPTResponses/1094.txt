Approximately 100,000 years ago, the Earth experienced an ice age. During this period, large amounts of water from the oceans were trapped in glaciers and ice caps, causing a significant decrease in sea levels worldwide. It is estimated that sea levels were as much as 120 meters lower than they are today. This was a natural, geological event caused by changes in the Earth's climate and the interaction between the atmosphere, oceans, and ice sheets.
