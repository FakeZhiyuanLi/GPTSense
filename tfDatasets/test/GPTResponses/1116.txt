Red was chosen for traffic lights because the color has a long history of being used to indicate stop or danger. In addition, red is the most visible color in daylight and can be easily identified even from a distance. This makes it an ideal color for use in traffic signals where safety is paramount. Furthermore, the color is universally recognized as a sign of danger, making it easier for people of different cultures and languages to understand and obey traffic signals.
