Indian culture is a diverse and complex blend of several subcultures and traditions that have developed over thousands of years. The blending of different cultures over time has created a unique and rich culture that is distinctly Indian.

This culture reflects the fusion of different beliefs, customs, and practices of diverse communities, religions, and ethnicities living in India. It is a dynamic and evolving culture that has influenced the world in a significant way.
