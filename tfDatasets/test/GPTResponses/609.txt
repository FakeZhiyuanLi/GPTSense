The dominant system of Islamic logic is known as the "Aristotelian" system, which is based on the works of the Greek philosopher Aristotle. This system was introduced to the Islamic world in the 9th century and was further developed and expanded upon by Islamic philosophers such as Al-Farabi, Avicenna, and Averroes. The Aristotelian system of logic became the standard mode of reasoning in Islamic thought and continued to influence philosophy, science, and theology in the Islamic world for centuries.
