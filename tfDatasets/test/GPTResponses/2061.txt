One of the historical disputes about vacuums was whether they truly exist or not. The concept of a vacuum, which refers to a space devoid of matter and gas, was not widely accepted until the 17th century. Earlier philosophers believed that nature abhorred a vacuum and that a completely empty space was impossible. Another dispute was about the efficiency and design of early vacuum devices, including the controversial debate over the superiority of bagged versus bagless vacuum cleaners.
