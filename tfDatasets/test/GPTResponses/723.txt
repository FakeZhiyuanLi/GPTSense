There is no clear answer to why the Garamantes civilization collapsed. However, it is believed to be a combination of factors such as climate change leading to drought, desertification of the Sahara, over-grazing, soil erosion, conflict with neighboring civilizations, and the exhaustion of natural resources. The collapse may also have been accelerated by the invasion of the Arab tribes around the 7th century AD.
