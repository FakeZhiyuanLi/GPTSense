Most actions in the federal government are known as policies or regulations. Policies refer to a set of guidelines, principles, or rules that dictate the course of action to be taken by a particular department or agency. Regulations, on the other hand, are specific rules or requirements that govern how a particular law or policy is implemented in practice. Both policies and regulations are used to ensure the smooth functioning and effective operation of the federal government.
