According to historical records, John von Neumann worked with several other scientists on target selection during his career. Some of the notable individuals who collaborated with von Neumann in the area of target selection include:1. Edward Teller - physicist and mathematician who worked with von Neumann on the development of the hydrogen bomb and the concept of mutual assured destruction.2. General Leslie Groves - military engineer who oversaw the Manhattan Project and worked with von Neumann to develop nuclear weapons.3. Klaus Fuchs - German-born physicist who worked with von Neumann on the development of nuclear weapons and later became a Soviet spy.4. Richard Feynman - physicist and mathematician who collaborated with von Neumann on various projects, including the development of game theory and quantum mechanics.5. Stanislaw Ulam - mathematician who worked with von Neumann on the development of Monte Carlo simulations and the creation of the electronic computer.6. Robert Oppenheimer - physicist and director of the Los Alamos Laboratory, who collaborated with von Neumann on the development of the atomic bomb.7. Enrico Fermi - physicist who worked with von Neumann on the Manhattan Project and the development of nuclear reactors.8. David Bohm - physicist who worked with von Neumann on the foundations of quantum mechanics and the interpretation of wave-particle duality.These individuals helped shape the field of target selection and made significant contributions to science and technology during their lifetimes.
