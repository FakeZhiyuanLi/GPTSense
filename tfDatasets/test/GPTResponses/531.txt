Chatter marks are formed when the surface of a material, such as wood or metal, is unevenly and irregularly cut or shaped by a cutting tool, such as a saw or a lathe. This uneven cutting creates vibrations that cause the tool to bounce or chatter along the surface, leaving behind a series of parallel marks or ridges. Chatter marks can also be caused by improper setting of the cutting tool or by using a dull or damaged tool.
