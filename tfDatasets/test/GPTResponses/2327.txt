Electric and magnetic fields with zero average values but non-zero variances can occur in situations where the fields are fluctuating rapidly, but their average values over time cancel out to zero. This can happen, for example, in systems that exhibit random fluctuations or noise, such as in electronic circuits or in thermal radiation. Another example could be the spontaneous emission of photons by atoms, which have a zero average electric field but non-zero variance due to their random directions and energies.
