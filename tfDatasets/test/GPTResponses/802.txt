Parapodia are paired, fleshy appendages found on the sides of the body of many marine worms, such as polychaetes. They are used for locomotion, respiration, and in some species, feeding. The parapodia are highly flexible and muscular, and can be extended or retracted to generate movement or grip onto surfaces. They also contain bristles or setae, which can be used for anchoring or as a defense mechanism.
