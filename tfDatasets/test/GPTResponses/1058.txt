Most of the current earthworms in glacial areas are non-native species that were introduced by human activities, such as transportation of soil and plants from other regions. Native earthworms were largely wiped out during the last glaciation period in these areas around 10,000 years ago, and it took until the 1600s for non-native earthworms to start being introduced by European settlers.
