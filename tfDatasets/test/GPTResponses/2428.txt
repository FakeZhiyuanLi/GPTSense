Polistes versicolor is a species of paper wasp found in North America. They are characterized by their yellow and black striped body with reddish-brown markings on the wings. They are most commonly found in wooded areas and build their nests in trees or shrubs. These wasps are important for pollination and pest control, but can also sting humans if provoked.
