There are differing accounts regarding the age at which Avicenna (also known as Ibn Sina) had learned the entire Quran. According to some sources, he had memorized the Quran by the age of 10, while others suggest that he had done so by the age of 7. It is worth noting, however, that these accounts are not necessarily verifiable and may be based on legend or anecdote.
