The transition from the coastal plain to the Piedmont region varies depending on the location. Generally, it occurs where the land begins to rise more steeply and the terrain becomes more hilly. In some areas, such as the eastern regions of North Carolina and South Carolina, the transition occurs near the fall line where rivers descend from the Piedmont to the coastal plain. In other areas, such as Virginia, the transition occurs gradually over several miles or even tens of miles. Ultimately, the exact location of the transition depends on a variety of factors, including topography, geology, and climate.
