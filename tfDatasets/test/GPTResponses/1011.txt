During World War II, Adolf Hitler and the German military leadership were planning an invasion of the Soviet Union. The operation was code-named "Operation Barbarossa" and began on June 22, 1941. The invasion was a massive operation involving over three million German troops, and it was the largest military operation ever launched at that time. The goal of the invasion was to defeat the Soviet Union and gain access to its vast resources, particularly oil and food. However, the invasion ultimately failed, and the German army suffered enormous losses in the harsh Russian winter. The Soviet Union ultimately emerged victorious in World War II.
