The mountain that helps enhance the aridity of the desert is called the rain shadow mountain. This mountain range prevents moisture-laden clouds from reaching the other side, where the desert is located, causing the air to become dry and arid. As a result, the desert receives little precipitation and is characterized by a lack of vegetation and extreme temperatures. Examples of rain shadow mountains include the Sierra Nevada in California, the Andes in South America, and the Himalayas in Asia.
