When a USB host is restarted, it will reset all the USB devices that are currently connected to the host. This means that all the USB devices will lose power, and they will be disconnected and then reconnected to the host. The host will then send out a reset signal to all the devices, allowing them to initialize and establish a new connection with the host. This process may take a few moments, depending on the number of USB devices connected to the host and the complexity of their configurations. The host will then detect all the devices that are connected and automatically install any necessary drivers, allowing them to function properly.
