IGRAs are not associated with an increase or decrease in sensitivity when used in combination with skin tests. Instead, they provide a complementary diagnostic tool for the detection of tuberculosis (TB) infection. IGRAs are blood tests that measure interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) release from T-cells in response to TB antigens, while skin tests involve injecting a small amount of a TB antigen under the skin and seeing if there is a reaction. Both tests have their benefits and limitations, and their combination can improve diagnostic accuracy.
