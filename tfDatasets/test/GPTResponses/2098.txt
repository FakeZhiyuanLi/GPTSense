Descartes believed that vacuums, or empty spaces, could not exist in nature. He believed that all space must be occupied by either matter or some kind of substance, as he believed that a vacuum would be a complete absence of any kind of property or characteristic. This belief was rooted in his overall philosophy of substance dualism, which held that there were two kinds of substances in the universe: extended substances (physical matter) and thinking substances (the mind or soul). As such, Descartes believed that any vacant space must be filled with a subtle, imperceptible substance that he called the "ether."
