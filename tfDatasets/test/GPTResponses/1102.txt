People built earth mounds used for religious and ceremonial purposes during various time periods and in different cultures throughout history. Examples include the prehistoric mound builders of North America, who constructed mounds between 3400 BCE and 1300 CE, and the ancient Mesoamerican civilizations of the Maya and Aztec, who built pyramids and other structures for religious rituals between 2000 BCE and 1521 CE. The Neolithic period (around 10,000-2000 BCE) also saw the construction of earthworks, such as the famous stone circle at Stonehenge, which may have had religious or astronomical functions.
