Some of the no-wave groups experimented with sonically by incorporating elements of industrial music, free jazz, and avant-garde classical music into their sound. They also experimented with unconventional instrumentation, such as found objects and homemade instruments, and explored dissonance and noise. Some bands, like Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, even intentionally aimed to create a "painful" listening experience for their audience.
