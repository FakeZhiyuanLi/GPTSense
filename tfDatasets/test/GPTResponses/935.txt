The Renaissance movement marked a change from the medieval period to the modern era. It was characterized by the rebirth of classical learning and a renewed focus on humanism, individualism, and secularism. The Renaissance marked a shift in thinking towards a more scientific and rational approach, a new appreciation of art, and a sense of human potential and creativity. The movement also challenged traditional authority and emphasized the importance of individual achievement and expression. The Renaissance is considered a pivotal period in Western history as it laid the foundation for the Enlightenment and the modern world.
