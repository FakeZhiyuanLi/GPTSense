In Spanish, the auxiliary verb "haber" is no longer used in compound tenses when the main verb is reflexive or pronominal. Instead, the reflexive pronoun is used as the auxiliary. For example, in the present perfect tense, "haber" is typically used as the auxiliary with non-reflexive verbs: "He comido" (I have eaten). However, with reflexive verbs, the reflexive pronoun "me" or "se" serves as the auxiliary, such as "Me he peinado" (I have combed my hair).
