The screening period for an individual's or organization's petition to add a species to the list varies depending on the specific regulations and policies of the country or jurisdiction in question. In some cases, the screening period may be several months or even years, as the petition is reviewed by various stakeholders and experts to determine the species' status and any potential impacts of listing it. However, the specific timeline can depend on a range of factors, including the complexity of the issue, the availability of resources and personnel to conduct the review, and the relevant legal and regulatory frameworks. Ultimately, the goal of the screening process is to ensure that decisions around listing species are based on the best available science and information, and that any potential impacts are carefully considered and managed.
