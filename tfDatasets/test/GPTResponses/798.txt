Burrowing annelids often have flattened and shovel-like parapodia that help them to move through soil or sediment. These parapodia may be lined with stiff bristles or chaetae that aid in the digging process. Some burrowing annelids, such as earthworms, have modified parapodia called clitellum that are involved in reproduction.
