A main area of solar chemical research since the 1970s has been the development of photoelectrochemical systems (PECs). PECs use semiconductors to convert sunlight into chemical energy through the splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen. This technology has the potential to provide a renewable and sustainable source of fuel. Researchers have focused on improving the efficiency and stability of PECs by developing new materials and optimizing device design.
