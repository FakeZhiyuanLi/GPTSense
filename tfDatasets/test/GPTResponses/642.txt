are known as frequency domain representations, which display the frequency components of the signal. This transformation is typically accomplished using a mathematical operation known as the Fourier Transform or a variant of it, which converts signals from their time or space domain representation into a frequency domain representation. This allows for the identification and analysis of specific frequencies or patterns of frequencies present in the signal. The frequency domain representation is often used in signal processing, audio and image analysis, and other related fields.
