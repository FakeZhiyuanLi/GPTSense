After Planck's findings, it was determined that the amount of energy carried by electromagnetic radiation could not take on an arbitrary value but was instead quantized. This meant that energy was only emitted or absorbed in discrete amounts or "quanta," rather than being continuous. This led to the development of quantum mechanics and had profound implications for our understanding of the behavior of matter and energy on a microscopic level.
