Aristotle believed that everything in the universe had a natural place and that any perceived void or gap was a result of something being out of its proper place. He believed that the four traditional elements (earth, air, fire, and water) naturally filled all of space, and that if there appeared to be a void, it was because there was an absence of one of these elements. For example, if there was no air in a certain space, it would create a void, which could only be filled by the presence of air to restore balance to the universe.
