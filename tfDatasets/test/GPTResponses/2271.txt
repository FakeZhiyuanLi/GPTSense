The part of Kerry's Boston speech that made reference to his military experience was when he said, "I'm John Kerry, and I'm reporting for duty." This phrase was also prominently featured on campaign materials, such as bumper stickers and t-shirts. Kerry's military experience, including his service in Vietnam, was a significant part of his campaign platform and was a central theme of his convention speech.
