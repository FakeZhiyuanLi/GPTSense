Muhammad's ancestors were primarily followers of the pagan religion of Arabia, known as polytheism, which involved worship of various idols and gods. However, there were also some who had converted to Judaism or Christianity. It is said that Muhammad's great-grandfather, Abdul-Muttalib, was known for his reverence of the Kaaba, a holy shrine in Mecca, and founded a society to protect pilgrims who came to Mecca to make offerings to the shrine.
