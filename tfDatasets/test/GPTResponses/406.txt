Laserdiscs are susceptible to damages due to their analog encoding. Analog encoding is more susceptible to degradation and interference compared to digital encoding. This is because analog signals are continuous and vary in strength, whereas digital signals are discrete and have defined on/off states. As a result, any minor damage or interference can cause errors in the analog signal, resulting in a loss of picture quality or even complete signal loss.
