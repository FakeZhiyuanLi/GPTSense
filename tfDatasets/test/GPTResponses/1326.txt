Judaism is a monotheistic religion that originated in the Middle East over 3,000 years ago. It is based on the belief in one God who revealed himself to the Israelites through biblical figures such as Abraham, Moses, and David. The holy book of Judaism is the Torah, which contains the teachings and laws given to Moses by God. Jews also follow various rabbinical commentaries and interpretations of the Torah. Judaism encompasses a wide range of beliefs and practices, from Orthodox to Reform, and includes a strong emphasis on traditions and rituals such as circumcision, the Sabbath, and Passover.
