There are two possible effects when the intensity of the light source is increased in the photoelectric effect:1) More electrons are emitted: When the intensity of the light source is increased, the number of photons (particles of light) hitting the metal surface increases. This can cause more electrons to be emitted from the metal surface as the photons transfer energy to the electrons. This means that the photoelectric current (i.e. the flow of electrons) will increase.2) No change in kinetic energy of electrons: The energy of the photons hitting the metal surface depends on their frequency (or wavelength). Increasing the intensity of the light source does not affect the energy of the individual photons, so the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons does not change. However, the number of electrons emitted per unit time (i.e. the photoelectric current) may still increase due to more photons hitting the metal surface.
