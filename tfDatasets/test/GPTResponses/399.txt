The math of artificial viscosity is used in numerical simulations of fluid dynamics to smooth out sharp changes in the fluid flow that would be difficult to capture accurately using traditional numerical methods. It works by adding a "viscosity" term to the equations that models the internal friction of the fluid and causes it to dissipate energy and dampen any instabilities in the flow. This helps to ensure numerical stability and prevent unphysical results from being produced.
