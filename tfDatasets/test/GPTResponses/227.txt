The two components in the Belgian political landscape are the Dutch-speaking Flemish community and the French-speaking Walloon community. These two communities have their own distinct cultural, linguistic, and political identities, and their differences have often resulted in tensions and challenges in the functioning of the federal government of Belgium. The country's complex federal structure accommodates the different needs and aspirations of these two linguistic and cultural communities.
