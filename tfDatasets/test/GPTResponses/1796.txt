The insect that provides a tangible economic benefit via the production of silk is the silkworm, which is actually the caterpillar larvae of the domesticated silk moth, Bombyx mori. The silk produced by silkworms is used to make various textiles, including clothing, home furnishings, and medical products, and is one of the most valuable fibers in the global textile industry.
