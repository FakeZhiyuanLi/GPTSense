Many journalists and political analysts referred to Muammar Gaddafi as a populist during his time as leader of Libya. Some examples include:- Daniel Pipes, a conservative American historian and commentator, wrote in a 2002 article that Gaddafi was a "typical Third World populist" who used anti-Western rhetoric to maintain his power.- Christophe Ayad, a journalist for the French newspaper Lib√©ration, described Gaddafi as a "populist dictator" in a 2010 article that analyzed his regime's use of propaganda and repression to maintain control.- Francesco Cavatorta, a political scientist who specializes in the Middle East and North Africa, wrote in a 2011 article for Al Jazeera that Gaddafi's regime was "fundamentally populist" because it relied on a cult of personality, popular mobilization, and "rhetorical denunciation of supposed internal and external enemies."- Several Libyan opposition figures and activists also referred to Gaddafi as a populist during the 2011 uprising against his regime, criticizing him for using populist rhetoric and promises of wealth redistribution to win support while stifling dissent and maintaining control over the economy.
