During the colonial period, pirates were a major menace to the coastal areas of the Province of Carolina. The most notorious among these were Blackbeard and Stede Bonnet. They would attack merchant ships in the region, causing widespread fear and economic damage. Other criminals, such as smugglers and privateers, also posed a threat to the region. The British government eventually took action, sending naval forces to suppress piracy and bring these men to justice.
