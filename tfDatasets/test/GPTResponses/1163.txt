Gamal Abdel Nasser, the former President of Egypt, had several goals during his leadership, including:1. Unifying and modernizing Egypt: Nasser wanted to create a strong, stable, and independent Egypt that was no longer under the control of foreign powers. He wanted to improve Egypt's infrastructure and modernize the country through large-scale industrial, social, and economic reforms.2. Promoting Arab nationalism: Nasser wanted to unite Arab nations and create a pan-Arab identity. He believed that Arab unity was essential for the region's prosperity and stability.3. Nationalizing the Suez Canal: In 1956, Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal, which was previously owned by British and French shareholders. This move aimed to assert Egypt's sovereignty over its resources.4. Opposing Western imperialism: Nasser was a strong critic of Western imperialism in the Middle East, particularly British and French political and economic dominance. He sought to reduce their influence and establish Egypt as a leader in the region.5. Supporting Palestine: Nasser was a vocal supporter of Palestine's struggle against Israeli occupation. He believed that the Arab world had a duty to support the Palestinian cause and worked to build strong alliances between Arab nations to fight against Israel.
