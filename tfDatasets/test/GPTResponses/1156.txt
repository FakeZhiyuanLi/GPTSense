The primary method for determining the Avogadro constant is through the measurement of the number of atoms in a well-defined mass of a particular substance, and then using that information to calculate the number of atoms per mole (or Avogadro's number). This is typically done using X-ray crystallography, mass spectrometry, or other advanced techniques. One example of such a method is the use of silicon-28 atoms to define a perfect crystal lattice, which can then be used to count the number of atoms accurately.
