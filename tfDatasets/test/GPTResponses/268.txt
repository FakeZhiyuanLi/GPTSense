The Sangam period was a time period in ancient Tamil Nadu, a region in South India, that is believed to have lasted from approximately 300 BCE to 300 CE. It was characterized by the flourishing of Tamil literature, art, trade, and culture. The period was divided into three parts - the Early Sangam period (300 BCE - 200 BCE), Middle Sangam period (200 BCE - 300 CE), and Late Sangam period (300 CE - 600 CE). The extent of the Sangam period was primarily limited to the Tamil region of South India, including modern-day Tamil Nadu, parts of Kerala, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh. However, Tamil traders and merchants also had extensive maritime trade links with other parts of India, as well as Southeast Asia, China, and the Mediterranean.
