Steven Spielberg's movie "Schindler's List" addresses the issue of the Holocaust, specifically the persecution and genocide of Jewish people during World War II. The film is based on the true story of Oskar Schindler, a German businessman who saved the lives of more than 1,100 Jewish people by employing them in his factory and protecting them from the Nazis. Through the story of Schindler and the experiences of the Jewish people he saved, Spielberg aims to raise awareness of the horrors of the Holocaust and promote tolerance and understanding.
