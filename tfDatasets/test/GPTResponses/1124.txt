The World Justice Project (WJP) is an independent, multidisciplinary organization that meets to discuss and determine the countries that are considered to follow the rule of law. The WJP publishes an annual Rule of Law Index that ranks countries based on the strength of their adherence to the rule of law. The ranking is based on surveys of experts and citizens in the countries assessed, as well as data from a variety of sources.
