Anthropology would likely use several criteria to differentiate humans from the animals nearest to them, including:1. Culture: Humans have complex cultural systems that are passed down through generations. This includes language, art, music, religion, and other social practices.2. Tool Use: While other animals also use tools, humans have taken tool use to a higher level, creating complex machines and technologies that greatly enhance their survival.3. Bipedalism: Humans are unique in that they walk on two legs (bipedalism), which has led to significant changes in their anatomy and physiology.4. Large Brain Size: Humans have much larger brains than other animals relative to their body size, which has allowed for higher levels of intelligence and cognitive abilities.5. Communication Abilities: Humans have complex language systems that involve syntax and grammar, allowing for abstract thought and complex communication.6. Self-Awareness: Humans have a level of self-awareness and consciousness that is not present in most other animals.Overall, anthropology would likely look at a combination of these factors to differentiate humans from other animals.
