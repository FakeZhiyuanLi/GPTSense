The poetic tradition had its biggest influence on Ottoman literary movements such as Divan poetry, classical Turkish poetry, and Sufi poetry. These movements were characterized by the use of highly stylized language and literary devices, such as rhyme and meter, to convey themes of love, nature, and spirituality. Many of the greatest Ottoman poets, such as Rumi, Hafez, and Yunus Emre, were deeply influenced by the poetic tradition and used it to create works of lasting beauty and significance.
