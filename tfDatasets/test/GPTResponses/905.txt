There were various individuals and groups who protested the involvement of Britain and France in a war with Germany, particularly during the lead-up to World War II. Some of these included:- The British Union of Fascists, a far-right political party led by Oswald Mosley, which advocated for peace with Germany and opposed British involvement in the war.- The Peace Pledge Union, a pacifist organization that campaigned against war and military intervention, including the planned intervention in Czechoslovakia in 1938.- The Labour Party, which initially opposed direct military intervention in the war and instead called for mediation and negotiation.- The Non-Intervention Committee, a group of British MPs who sought to prevent British intervention in the Spanish Civil War, which was seen as a precursor to the larger conflict in Europe.- Various anti-war groups, such as the No More War Movement and the War Resisters International, who protested against militarism and imperialism in general.
