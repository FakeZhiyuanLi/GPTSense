Nicaraguans came to America for various reasons including better economic opportunities, political instability, natural disasters, and family reunification. Many Nicaraguans also fled their country during the civil wars in the 1970s and 1980s. Additionally, the United States has a history of involvement in Nicaragua, which has led to some Nicaraguans seeking asylum in the U.S. due to political persecution.
