it naturally would do, which is moving with a constant velocity in a straight line. In other words, the laws of motion apply in the same way in all directions within an inertial reference frame. This means that if an observer inside such a frame were to measure the velocity, acceleration, and direction of motion of an object within that frame, their measurements would be consistent regardless of their position or orientation within the frame. In contrast, a non-inertial reference frame is one in which objects do not move in a straight line with a constant velocity, such as an accelerating car or a rotating merry-go-round.
