Cubans have come to the United States for a variety of reasons over the years. One of the most significant waves of Cuban immigration occurred in the wake of the Cuban Revolution of 1959, when many Cubans fled the country to escape political repression and economic hardship under the new regime led by Fidel Castro. In the decades that followed, many Cubans continued to come to the United States seeking greater economic opportunities or to reunite with family members who had previously emigrated. The United States has also periodically granted special asylum status to Cuban refugees, such as during the Mariel boatlift in 1980 and the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966, which allows Cubans who enter the United States illegally to stay and apply for citizenship after a year. Today, many Cubans continue to come to the United States for a variety of reasons, including economic, political, and family reasons.
