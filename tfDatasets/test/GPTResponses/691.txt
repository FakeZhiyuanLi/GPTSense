The legal status of the Szlachta (Polish nobility) was dependent on the sovereignty of the Russian Empire until 1918. During this time, the Szlachta were subject to Russian laws and regulations, and their rights and privileges were determined by the Russian government. However, with the collapse of the Russian Empire in 1918, the Szlachta regained their independence and were able to establish their own legal and political status in an independent Poland.
