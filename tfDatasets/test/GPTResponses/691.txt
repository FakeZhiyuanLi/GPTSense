In the past, children were allowed to do light labour from a very young age. Children as young as five or six years old were often put to work in factories, mines, and other industries. However, child labor laws have been put in place in many countries in recent decades, which prohibit children from working before a certain age and provide greater protection for their rights. The specific age varies by country but is typically around 14-16 years old.
