The traditional radical-based character index is used for looking up or searching for a Chinese character in a dictionary or reference book. It is based on the classification of Chinese characters by their radical, which is the most important component of a character and often indicates the meaning or the category of the character. By using the radical-based index, users can quickly locate the section of the dictionary that contains the characters they are looking for, even if they don't know how to pronounce or write them. The traditional radical-based character index is also useful for learners of Chinese, as it helps them understand the structure and composition of characters and how they are related to each other.
