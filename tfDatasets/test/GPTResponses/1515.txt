The paradox of the stone is a philosophical thought experiment that poses the question of whether an omnipotent being can create a stone that it cannot lift. The paradox seeks to challenge the idea of omnipotence by raising the question of what it means for an all-powerful being to have limitations. If an omnipotent being can create a stone too heavy to lift, then it is not all-powerful since it cannot lift the stone. However, if it cannot create such a stone, it is also not all-powerful since it has a limitation. The paradox thus raises questions about the nature of omnipotence and whether it is logically consistent.
