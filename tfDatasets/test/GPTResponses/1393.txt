USB is not intended for high-speed data transfer over long distances or for power transmission over long distances. It also may not be suitable for transmitting high-resolution video or audio signals. Additionally, USB should not be used as a primary source of power for high-powered devices such as large external hard drives or gaming peripherals, as it may not provide enough power to properly operate these devices.
