Beliefs started to move away from Aristotle's idea of a void in the 17th century with the development of modern natural science and the rise of the mechanical philosophy, which rejected the Aristotelian concept of a void and instead viewed the world as a closed system of interacting particles. This new approach to understanding the natural world was championed by thinkers such as Galileo, Descartes, and Newton, and laid the foundation for the scientific revolution.
