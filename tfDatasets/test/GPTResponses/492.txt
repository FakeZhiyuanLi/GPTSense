Islamic fundraising efforts may focus on the construction of schools, madrasas, and other educational buildings. These institutions aim to provide Islamic education to young Muslims, emphasizing the teachings of the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad. Islamic educational buildings are often designed to include prayer spaces and other features that reflect Islamic architecture and aesthetics, such as domes and intricate geometric patterns. They serve as important community gathering spaces and contribute to the development of future generations of Muslim leaders and scholars.
