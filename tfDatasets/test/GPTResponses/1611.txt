Some lines of the Paris Metro have to operate on a four-rail system to provide power to the trains through a method called third-rail electrification. In a typical three-rail system, the third rail carries the electrical current that powers the trains. However, with a four-rail system, two additional rails are added for safety reasons. One of the additional rails serves as a return path for the electrical current, reducing the risk of electrical shocks to passengers and maintenance workers. The fourth rail acts as a safety rail and is designed to provide an electrical current only when the train requires it. The four-rail system is used on lines 1, 2, 6, and many sections of lines 3 and 4 of the Paris Metro.
