Avicenna considered the ancient Greek philosophers Aristotle and Plato as inspired philosophers. He was greatly influenced by their works and incorporated their ideas into his own philosophical and scientific system. Additionally, Avicenna revered the Islamic philosopher, Al-Farabi, as an inspired philosopher and often referenced his writings in his own works.
