The New Deal programs primarily benefited workers, farmers, and those in need of financial assistance during the Great Depression. The programs provided jobs, unemployment benefits, social security, minimum wage laws, and other forms of relief to those struggling economically. Additionally, many New Deal programs focused on infrastructure and public works projects, which created employment opportunities and boosted local economies. The programs also aimed to regulate and stabilize the financial sector, which benefited middle-class Americans and sought to prevent future economic crises.
