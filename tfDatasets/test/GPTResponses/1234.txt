Forbes called Miami the country's second most miserable city in 2011 due to several factors, including the high cost of living, high levels of crime, and rampant foreclosure rates resulting from the 2008 housing market crash. Additionally, Miami has a high poverty rate and low job growth, making it difficult for people to secure stable employment and afford basic necessities. The city also experiences extreme weather conditions, including hurricanes and heat waves, which can add to the area's overall misery index.
