The most common offshoot of polychaetes that is unsegmented is the clitellata, which includes earthworms, leeches, and other similar organisms. They are characterized by a lack of parapodia (jointed appendages), and their bodies are elongated and cylindrical, with a smooth, segmented appearance. Other less common unsegmented offshoots of polychaetes include clitellate-like annelids and hirudinomorphs, which also lack parapodia but have unique structures and features that distinguish them from other groups.
