taxa?Paraphyletic taxa are groups that include some but not all of the descendants of a common ancestor. Some examples of paraphyletic taxa include:1. Reptiles: historically, reptiles have been defined as a group of animals with scales, cold-blooded metabolism, and the ability to lay eggs on land. However, this definition does not include birds, which are actually descended from reptiles.2. Fish: this term is often used to refer to all aquatic animals with gills and fins. However, this group is paraphyletic because it does not include certain aquatic animals, such as whales or dolphins, which are descended from land mammals.3. Invertebrates: this group includes all animals that do not have a backbone. However, this is a paraphyletic group because it excludes some groups of animals, such as chordates, which include vertebrates.4. Prokaryotes: this group includes all organisms that do not have a cell nucleus. However, this is a paraphyletic group because it does not include eukaryotes, which have a nucleus.
