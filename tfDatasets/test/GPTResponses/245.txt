The German Basic Law, also known as the Constitution of Germany, is the foundational legal document of the Federal Republic of Germany. It was first adopted on May 23, 1949, and has been amended several times since then. The Basic Law outlines the principles and structure of the German government, including the rights and responsibilities of its citizens, the organization of the federal and state governments, and the division of powers between the government branches. It also outlines fundamental principles such as democratic governance, the rule of law, and human rights protections.
