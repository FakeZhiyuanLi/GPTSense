Standardized character forms refer to a set of rules or guidelines for creating and displaying characters in a consistent manner. This is important for communication and readability, particularly in written language. Standardized character forms can include rules for how characters are shaped, sized, spaced, and placed within words and sentences. Examples of standardized character forms include the modern Latin alphabet, Chinese characters, and Arabic script.
