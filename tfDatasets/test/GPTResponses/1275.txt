Logograms are symbols or characters that represent entire words or phrases, as opposed to individual sounds or syllables. Examples of logograms include Chinese characters, airport signs, and trademarks like the Nike "swoosh." They are commonly used in writing systems around the world, and can help simplify writing and communication in some contexts.
