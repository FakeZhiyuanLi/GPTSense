According to Hayek, people are free to do anything that is not explicitly prohibited by the rule of law. The rule of law provides a framework for ensuring that individuals are free to pursue their own interests and aspirations, without infringing on the rights of others. Within this framework, individuals are free to engage in activities that they believe will be beneficial to themselves and others, subject to the constraints imposed by the law. The rule of law also provides protection against arbitrary government interference, thereby ensuring that people can pursue their goals without fear of undue interference or oppression.
