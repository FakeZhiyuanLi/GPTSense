India's railway system is not the fourth largest in the world, it is actually the second largest, after China. India's railway system began in the mid-nineteenth century under British rule, and has continued to expand since then. At present, it has a network of more than 67,000 kilometers of tracks and transports more than 23 million passengers and 3 million tons of freight every day.
