Annelids (segmented worms) reproduce in several ways.1. Sexual reproduction: Most annelids are dioecious (having separate males and females) and reproduce sexually. Sperm and eggs are released into the environment where fertilization occurs. The fertilized eggs develop into a larval stage and then into adult worms.2. Asexual reproduction: Some annelids, such as some species of earthworms, can reproduce asexually by fragmentation. The worm's body breaks into segments, and each segment can regenerate into a new worm.3. Hermaphroditism: Some annelids, such as the earthworm Eisenia fetida, are hermaphroditic, meaning they have both male and female reproductive organs. They mate by exchanging sperm and then fertilize their own eggs to produce offspring.
