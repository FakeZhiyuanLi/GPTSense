The rule of law is important to all parties involved in China's trade deals, including Chinese businesses, foreign businesses, and governments. The rule of law provides stability and predictability in commercial transactions by ensuring that everyone is held accountable for their actions and that contracts are enforced fairly. This is essential for businesses to make sound investment decisions and to maintain trust with their partners. It also ensures that disputes are resolved in a transparent and impartial manner, which promotes confidence in the legal system and facilitates further trade and investment. Additionally, governments rely on the rule of law to protect their citizens' interests in international trade and to ensure that their legal frameworks are respected and upheld.
