The Persian Empire did not control the entire northern Indian subcontinent, but they did have some influence in the region. Persian influence in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent began during the Achaemenid period (500-325 BCE) and continued during the subsequent Persian empires that followed. However, the Persians never had complete control of the region and their influence varied over time. In general, their presence in northern India was sporadic and limited.
