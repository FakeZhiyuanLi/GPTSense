Rajasthan is a largely arid state that is predominantly covered by desert and semi-arid vegetation. Therefore, there is no heavily forested region in Rajasthan. However, there are a few forested areas in Rajasthan, including Mount Abu Wildlife Sanctuary, Ranthambore National Park, Sariska National Park, and Keoladeo Ghana National Park, which are mostly located on the eastern side of the state near the Aravalli Range.
