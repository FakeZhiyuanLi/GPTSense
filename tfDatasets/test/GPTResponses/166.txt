The Greeks primarily built their buildings facing east, towards the rising sun. This orientation was significant in their religious and architectural beliefs.The Chinese, on the other hand, based their orientation of buildings on geomancy, or feng shui. They believed in arranging spaces and buildings to optimize the flow of energy, or qi. Buildings were often oriented towards the south so that they would receive more sunlight and warmth during the winter.
