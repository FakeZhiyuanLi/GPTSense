There is no information available suggesting that a political party was formed from the dissolved Ukrainian Helsinki Union. The Ukrainian Helsinki Union was a human rights organization that operated during Soviet times, and was dissolved in 1992. However, several human rights activists who were affiliated with the organization went on to become involved in Ukrainian politics, including Yulia Tymoshenko, who later became prime minister of Ukraine.
