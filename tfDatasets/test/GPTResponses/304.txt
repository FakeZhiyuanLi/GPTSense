Many rodents live in burrows, tunnels, dens, and nests in various habitats such as forests, grasslands, deserts, and urban areas. Some examples of rodents include mice, rats, squirrels, rabbits, beavers, and chipmunks. They are highly adaptable and can survive in different environments as long as there is enough food, water, and shelter.
