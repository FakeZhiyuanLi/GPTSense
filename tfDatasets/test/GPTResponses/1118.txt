In low-field methods of measuring the gyromagnetic ratio, the conversion factors are typically determined directly from the experimental data obtained at the low magnetic field strengths. These factors may be dependent on the specific instrument used, the sample geometry, and other experimental conditions.In high-field methods of measuring the gyromagnetic ratio, the conversion factors are typically calculated based on theoretical models that take into account the behavior of the particle in a strong magnetic field. These factors are generally believed to be more accurate than those obtained from low-field measurements.Overall, the conversion factors used in high-field methods of measuring the gyromagnetic ratio are generally more reliable and accurate than those used in low-field methods. However, high-field methods may be more technically challenging and require specialized equipment, making them less accessible to some researchers.
