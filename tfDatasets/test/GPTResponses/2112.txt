Kant argued that time and space are not subjective or relative, but are instead necessary and a priori conditions for all human experience. He believed that time and space provide a framework that allows us to organize and understand our experiences of the world around us. According to Kant, without time and space, we would not be able to perceive objects, events, or even ourselves, and thus would not be capable of knowledge. Therefore, time and space allow us to have objective experiences and knowledge of the world.
