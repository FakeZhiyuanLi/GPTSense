One example of an economically competitive technology that may still require deployment support is renewable energy. While the cost of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power has decreased significantly in recent years, there are still upfront costs associated with building and installing the necessary infrastructure to generate and distribute this energy. Additionally, renewable energy may require new or upgraded transmission infrastructure to ensure that the energy reaches its intended customers. Government incentives and supportive policies can help encourage the deployment of renewable energy technologies and make them more economically viable in the long run.
