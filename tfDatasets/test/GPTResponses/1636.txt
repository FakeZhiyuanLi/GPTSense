The Supreme Court cited the intent of Congress in enacting the Endangered Species Act (ESA) as "to halt and reverse the trend toward species extinction, whatever the cost." The Court emphasized that the ESA is a "sweeping piece of legislation" that is designed to protect endangered and threatened species and their habitats from the harmful impacts of human activity. The Court also noted that the ESA recognizes that the "economic and environmental value of species is incalculable" and that the law's main purpose is to ensure their continued survival for the benefit of present and future generations.
