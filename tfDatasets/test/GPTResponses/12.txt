The most elemental way to test the primality of any integer n is to divide it by all possible divisors up to the square root of n. If none of these divisors divide n without remainder, then n is prime. This is also known as trial division. However, for large numbers, this method can be impractical and time-consuming. Other advanced primality tests, such as the Miller-Rabin primality test and the AKS primality test, are more efficient for larger numbers.
