The Rhineland was subject to the Treaty of Versailles on June 28, 1919. Specifically, Article 42 of the treaty established a demilitarized zone in the Rhineland, requiring German troops to withdraw from the region. This provision was intended to prevent Germany from using the Rhineland as a staging ground for future military aggression.
