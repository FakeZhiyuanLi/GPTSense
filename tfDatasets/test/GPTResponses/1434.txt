Panentheism is a belief system that holds that God is both in the world and beyond it. Panentheists believe that God is the ultimate reality, and that the world is a manifestation or expression of God. In panentheism, God is not simply the creator of the world, but is also intimately involved in it, sustaining it and guiding it in some way. Panentheists reject the idea of God as a separate, transcendent entity who is wholly separate from the world. Rather, they view God as a dynamic and evolving presence that permeates all things, while also transcending them.
