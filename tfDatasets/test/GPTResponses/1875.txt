Many presidents have called for constitutional changes throughout history. Some notable examples include:- Franklin D. Roosevelt, who proposed a second Bill of Rights in 1944- Dwight D. Eisenhower, who supported the 25th Amendment to clarify the presidential succession in 1965- Richard Nixon, who supported the Equal Rights Amendment in 1972- Ronald Reagan, who supported a Balanced Budget Amendment in the 1980s- Bill Clinton, who supported campaign finance reform and a Line Item Veto amendment in the 1990sMore recently, there have been calls for constitutional changes related to issues such as immigration, voting rights, and presidential power. However, the process for amending the Constitution is intentionally difficult and requires significant political will and consensus-building.
