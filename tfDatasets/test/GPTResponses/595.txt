Post-glacial rebound is occurring most prominently in Scandinavia (Norway, Sweden, Finland) and in Canada. These regions experienced massive ice sheets during the last ice age, which have since melted and allowed the land to rebound upwards. Other regions, such as parts of the United States and Russia, also experience post-glacial rebound.
