The symbol for regeneration and rebirth in ancient Egypt was green. This was because the color green was associated with the god Osiris, who was considered to be the god of the afterlife and the god of fertility and growth. The Egyptians believed that when someone died, their spirit would be guided by Osiris into the afterlife where they would be reborn. The color green also represented new life, growth, and vegetation, which were all considered to be connected to the idea of rebirth.
