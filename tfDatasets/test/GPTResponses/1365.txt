Assuming you are referring to an I2C device, the device is assigned a unique 7-bit address either by the manufacturer or the user during the design or programming phase. The address is typically set by soldering or configuring jumpers on the device or by writing the address to a predetermined register using programming tools. Once set, the address remains fixed and allows the device to communicate with other devices on the I2C bus.
