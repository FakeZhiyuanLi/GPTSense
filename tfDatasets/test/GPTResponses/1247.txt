The maximum energy of the capacitor is directly proportional to the plate area and the capacitance, which is inversely proportional to the separation distance. Therefore, if the plate area is increased or the separation distance is decreased while keeping the amount of dielectric the same, the capacitance and maximum energy of the capacitor will increase. On the other hand, if the plate area is decreased or the separation distance is increased while keeping the amount of dielectric the same, the capacitance and maximum energy of the capacitor will decrease.
