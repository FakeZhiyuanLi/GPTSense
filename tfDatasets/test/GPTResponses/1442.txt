The required USB icon must be the Universal Serial Bus logo, which is a stylized trident with a circle around it. This logo is used to indicate USB devices and ports that comply with the USB standard. The logo may be printed on devices, cables, and packaging, and may appear in various sizes and colors, but must maintain the basic trident and circle design.
