The event that preceded the decline of the Teutonic Order was the Battle of Grunwald in 1410. In this battle, the Teutonic Order was defeated by an alliance of Polish and Lithuanian forces, which significantly weakened the Order's military and political power in the region. This defeat was followed by a series of internal conflicts and political pressures, leading to further decline and eventual dissolution of the Teutonic Order in the 16th century.
