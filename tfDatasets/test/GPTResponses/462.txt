Ogives, also known as cumulative frequency curves, are graphs that show the cumulative frequency of a dataset. In other words, they display the total number or percentage of observations that are below a certain value or interval. Ogives are often used to analyze data that are grouped into categories, such as age ranges or income brackets. They help illustrate patterns and trends in the data and provide a visual representation of the distribution of the observations.
