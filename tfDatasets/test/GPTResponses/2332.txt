In American football, the placement of the ball when a penalty is declined is determined by the outcome of the previous play that was run before the penalty occurred. If the previous play resulted in a gain in yardage, the ball is placed at the spot where the play ended. If the previous play resulted in a loss of yardage or no gain, the ball is placed at the original line of scrimmage.
