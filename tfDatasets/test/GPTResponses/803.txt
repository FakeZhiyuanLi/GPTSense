There can be several reasons why democratic societies may not always follow the rule of law. Some possible reasons are:1. Corruption: Corruption is a significant problem in many democracies, and it can undermine the rule of law. When officials or politicians are corrupt, they may use their power to bend the law or avoid its consequences.2. Political Influence: Politicians or political parties might try to influence the judiciary or law enforcement agencies to get favorable outcomes in certain cases. It can compromise the independence and impartiality of the judiciary, and the rule of law can be ignored.3. Discrimination: Discrimination against a particular section of society may lead to the violation of the rule of law. Even in democracies, discrimination on the basis of race, religion, sexuality, or gender can occur, which may result in some individuals or groups being treated unfairly under the law.4. Public Opinion: The rule of law depends on the willingness of the public to accept it. If public opinion is against the law or if there is a lack of awareness about it, it can be ignored, which can weaken the rule of law.5. National Security: In the name of national security, some democracies may exercise power over their citizens that may go against the rule of law. This situation can lead to the abuse of human rights and civil liberties.6. Prejudice: Prejudices against some people can lead to the violation of the rule of law. For example, sex workers, people who use drugs, and individuals who engage in criminal activities may be treated as outcasts, and their rights may be denied on this basis.
