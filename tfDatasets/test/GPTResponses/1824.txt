The Ottoman literate was most influenced by the West during the Tanzimat period, which lasted from the 1830s to the 1870s. This was a period of significant reforms in the Ottoman Empire, and the government sought to modernize the country by adopting many Western practices and ideas, including education and literature. Many Ottoman writers and intellectuals were exposed to Western literature and thought during this time, which had a significant impact on their own writing and ideas.
