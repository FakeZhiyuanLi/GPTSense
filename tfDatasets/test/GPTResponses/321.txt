Non-material culture refers to the intangible aspects of a society, such as beliefs, values, norms, attitudes, and behaviors. It includes ideas, symbols, language, customs, and traditions that are shared and transmitted from one generation to another, but cannot be touched, seen or physically manipulated. Non-material culture plays a crucial role in shaping the social reality of a community and influencing the way people think, act, and interact with each other.
