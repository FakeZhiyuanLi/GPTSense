There were multiple factors that eventually resulted in the pioneering of industrial music:1. The availability of electronic and non-musical sounds: Industrial music drew heavily from the sounds of factory machinery, electronic equipment, and other non-musical sources. The increasing availability of electronic devices and the rise of technology made it easier for musicians to experiment with these sounds.2. Innovation and experimentation: Industrial music was a result of experimentation and innovation. Musicians were searching for new ways to create music and challenge the traditional forms of music.3. Punk and post-punk movements: Industrial music was influenced by the punk and post-punk movements of the late 1970s and early 1980s. These movements rejected the mainstream music industry and championed creativity and innovation.4. Socio-political context: Industrial music emerged in the context of the Cold War, which was marked by the threat of nuclear annihilation, political upheaval, and economic uncertainty. Industrial music often reflected the dystopian and bleak outlook of the world.5. DIY ethos: The DIY ethos of the punk and post-punk movements also played a role in the pioneering of industrial music. Many industrial musicians were independent and self-reliant, producing and distributing their own music outside of the mainstream industry.
