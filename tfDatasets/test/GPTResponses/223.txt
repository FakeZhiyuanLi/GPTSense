Before the axiomatization of quantum mechanics, von Neumann had made significant contributions to mathematical physics and the foundations of quantum mechanics. In particular, he developed the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics, giving it a rigorous and axiomatic foundation. He also worked on the theory of operator algebras, which are fundamental to the mathematical description of quantum mechanics. Additionally, von Neumann made contributions to game theory, which has applications in economics, political science, and other fields.
