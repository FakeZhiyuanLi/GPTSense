`House music' was once synonymous with the dance music scene that originated in Chicago in the early 1980s. It was characterized by its repetitive beats, synthesized melodies, and its use of drum machines and other electronic instruments. House music quickly spread across the United States and overseas, giving rise to new sub-genres and styles of dance music. Today, house music remains a popular genre within the electronic dance music community.
