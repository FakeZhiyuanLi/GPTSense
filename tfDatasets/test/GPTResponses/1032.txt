Measurement attempts to trade-offs for quanta take the form of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. This principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle, such as position and momentum or energy and time, can be known. The more precisely one property is measured, the less precisely the other can be measured, and vice versa. This implies that there are inherent trade-offs between the precision of these measurements, which are a consequence of the wave-like nature of particles at the quantum level.
