Edward Carr's view on the pact between Germany and the Soviet Union was that it was primarily a tactical move by the Soviet Union to buy time and strengthen its defenses against an inevitable attack by Germany. The pact provided a temporary peace and non-aggression between the two countries, while also securing Soviet access to resources and technology from Germany. However, Carr believed that this alliance ultimately failed as Germany went on to invade the Soviet Union in 1941, leading to a devastating war that cost millions of lives.
