After the removal of the USSR, Estonia hoped to restore its independence and sovereignty as a nation. It aimed to establish a democratic government, a market economy, and membership in Western organizations such as the European Union and NATO. Additionally, Estonia aimed to improve its relations with its Baltic neighbors, as well as Russia, and to rebuild its cultural heritage and national identity after decades of Soviet influence.
