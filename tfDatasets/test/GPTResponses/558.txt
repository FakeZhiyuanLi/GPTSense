The 2004 Amendment to the Brazilian Constitution, also known as Constitutional Amendment No. 45, states that human rights treaties that are approved by a special process in Congress will have the same hierarchical status as constitutional amendments. This means that they will be recognized as part of the Brazilian Constitution and hold the same weight as any other constitutional provision.
