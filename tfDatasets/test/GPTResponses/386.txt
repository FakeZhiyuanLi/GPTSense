It is important to note that child labor is illegal in most countries, and no reputable school would require or condone child labor.In the past, however, there have been instances where schools and educational institutions in certain parts of the world may have employed children under exploitative conditions. For example, in the early 20th century, some boarding schools in the United States required students to work on farms and perform manual labor as part of their education. Similarly, in some developing countries, children may be forced to work in schools as cleaners or assistants in exchange for education.It is important to note that such practices are unethical and illegal, and efforts should be made to ensure that children receive a proper education without being subjected to labor exploitation.
