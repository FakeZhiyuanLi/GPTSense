This question is a bit vague, but if you are asking about what does not constitute a character in the Chinese family, here are some possible answers:1. Physical objects: While objects such as photos, family heirlooms, and even homes can be important to a Chinese family, they are not considered characters in the sense of being members of the family.2. Animals or pets: Although some families may keep pets, animals are not considered members of the Chinese family, and are generally not afforded the same level of respect and care.3. Plants: While plants may be appreciated and cared for by a family, they are not considered members of the family and do not have the same role or significance.4. Food: While food is a vital part of Chinese culture, it is not considered a member of the family. However, sharing meals and enjoying food together can strengthen family bonds and create a sense of belonging.
