Insects do not have salivary glands in their mouth. Instead, they produce saliva in specialized glands located in their head or thorax. The saliva is then transported to the mouthparts through ducts. The composition of insect saliva can vary depending on the species and the function it serves, but it often contains enzymes and other molecules that help insects digest and manipulate their food.
