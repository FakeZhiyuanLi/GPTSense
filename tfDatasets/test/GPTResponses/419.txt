The crosstalk in audio/video signals occurs when there is interference between the audio and video channels. The CAV (constant angular velocity) format is designed to prevent crosstalk by ensuring that the speed of the disc remains constant, resulting in a consistent signal read rate. This ensures that audio and video signals do not overlap or interfere with each other, preventing crosstalk. Additionally, CAV formatting allows data to be written and read from the disc at different speeds, further reducing the risk of crosstalk.
