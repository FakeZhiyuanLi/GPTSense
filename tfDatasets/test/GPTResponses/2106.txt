Kant described time as a fundamental structure of human experience and the framework within which all events occur. For Kant, time is not something that exists independently of human perception and consciousness, but rather is a necessary condition for our ability to perceive and make sense of the world around us. He also argued that time is continuous and infinite, with no beginning or end, and that it is essential for our ability to reason, remember, and plan.
