The East India Company's handling of trade in Bengal was primarily through the use of force and colonial power. The company established monopolies on certain goods, such as opium and textiles, and used its influence to control the local economy. They also imposed heavy taxes on indigenous merchants, making it difficult for them to compete with the company. Additionally, the company would sometimes resort to violence and intimidation to enforce their trade policies. This behavior eventually led to a number of rebellions and uprisings, most notably the Indian Rebellion of 1857.
