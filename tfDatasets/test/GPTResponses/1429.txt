Plastic capacitors are especially useful for high-frequency or high-voltage circuits. They have low inductance and low dissipation factor, making them ideal for use in radio frequency (RF) applications, including filters, oscillators, and other tuning circuits. Additionally, plastic capacitors have excellent stability over a wide range of temperatures and are highly reliable, making them a popular choice for precision applications such as in medical equipment or aerospace industries.
