Cultural anthropology is the study of human cultures, beliefs, customs, traditions, and practices. It encompasses a wide range of topics, including religion, social organization, language, migration, economics, politics, kinship systems, gender, and ethnicity. Cultural anthropologists use a variety of research methods, such as participant observation, interviews, and surveys, to better understand the cultural practices and values of various societies around the world. The goal of cultural anthropology is to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the diversity of human experience and promote cross-cultural understanding and tolerance.
