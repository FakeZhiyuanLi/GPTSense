There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on how one defines "comparable." However, one possibility is the Irish language, which has a word for "green" (glas) that can also be used to describe a "meadow." In Irish mythology, the Otherworld is often described as a "green meadow," suggesting a connection between the two concepts in the language and culture.
