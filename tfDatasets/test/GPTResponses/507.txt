The traditional formal attire for Somali women is called a dirac, which is a long, flowing dress worn over a full-length slip. The dress is usually made of lightweight fabric and features colorful patterns or embroidery. It is often paired with a headscarf or hijab, which covers the hair and neck. Some women may also wear gold jewelry or other accessories to complement their outfit.
