The German Empire, also known as the Second Reich, was a nation-state that existed from 1871 to 1918, consisting of Germany, its territories, and its colonies. It was established after the German unification of 1871 and led by Wilhelm I, and later his grandson Wilhelm II. The German Empire was characterized by its authoritarian government, heavy militarization, and aggressive foreign policy. It was dissolved after Germany's defeat in World War I, leading to the establishment of the Weimar Republic.
