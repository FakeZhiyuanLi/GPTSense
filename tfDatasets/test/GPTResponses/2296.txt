The human body prevents body rupture at low altitude when bloated by gas bubbles by releasing the excess gas through the lungs or other bodily openings. This process is known as decompression sickness or "the bends." The gas bubbles can become trapped in tissues and cause damage or block blood vessels, leading to serious medical issues. To prevent this, individuals must follow proper decompression procedures, including slow ascent rates and appropriate breathing techniques. Additionally, diving at higher altitudes with lower pressure can increase the risk of decompression sickness, so divers must take extra precautions in these environments.
