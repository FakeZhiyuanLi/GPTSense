The King of Denmark did not sell Estonia to the Teutonic Order. The Danish and the German Orders brought their crusade to Estonia in the 13th century to convert the pagan Estonians to Christianity and establish their dominance over the region. In 1346, the Danish king sold his last holdings in Estonia to the Teutonic Order.
