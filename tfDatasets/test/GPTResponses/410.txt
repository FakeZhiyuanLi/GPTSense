Bergschrunds often resemble deep crevasses or large cracks in the snow or ice, and they can run horizontally or vertically across a glacier or mountain slope. They typically form at the boundary between the moving ice and the stationary terrain below, where the glacier is pulling away from the mountain or rockface. Bergschrunds can be several meters wide and deep enough to be dangerous for climbers or hikers, as they can collapse or create unstable footing.
