Max Planck studied the problem of the spectral distribution of blackbody radiation, originally posed by Gustav Kirchhoff. Kirchhoff had noticed that an opaque object, when heated, will emit light at all wavelengths. He also observed that the distribution of this radiation varies with temperature, and that the radiation becomes more intense as the temperature increases. Planck's work led him to propose the idea of energy quantization, which formed the basis for quantum mechanics.
