As the temperature of a hot object increases, several changes in the light emitted by the object occur:1. Color: The color of the light emitted by the object shifts to shorter wavelengths, which means that it becomes "bluer." As the temperature continues to increase, this shift in color continues until the object emits a blue-white light.2. Brightness: The brightness of the light emitted by the object also increases as temperature increases.3. Spectrum: The spectrum of the light emitted by the object changes. As the temperature increases, the object emits more light at shorter wavelengths. This means that the spectrum shifts towards the ultraviolet part of the spectrum.4. Intensity: The intensity of the light emitted by the object increases significantly as temperature increases.Overall, as the temperature of a hot object increases, the light emitted by the object shifts towards shorter wavelengths, becomes brighter, and emits more light in the UV part of the spectrum.
