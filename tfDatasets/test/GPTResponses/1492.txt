Surface mount packages for capacitors have been in common use since the late 1980s. The development of surface mount technology (SMT) revolutionized electronics manufacturing by allowing for smaller, more compact electronic devices. SMT components, including surface mount capacitors, are able to be placed directly onto the surface of printed circuit boards (PCBs), allowing for greater density and miniaturization of electronic designs. Today, most electronic devices use surface mount components, including capacitors.
