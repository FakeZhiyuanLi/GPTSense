The Satavahanas issued coins embossed with their king's head on one side and different symbols and inscriptions on the other side. These coins were predominantly made of copper and weighed around 5-6 grams. Some of the inscriptions on the coins include the name of the king, their title, and the name of the city where the coin was minted. The Satavahanas were known for their excellent coinage, which was widely used as currency in their empire.
