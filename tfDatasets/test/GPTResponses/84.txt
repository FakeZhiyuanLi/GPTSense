There is no definitive answer to this question as there are several events that could have contributed to a decrease in the extraction of Portugal's natural resources. Some possible factors could include the exhaustion of easily accessible resources, changes in market demand or prices, environmental concerns, or government policies and regulations. It is also possible that a combination of these factors, along with other social, economic or political developments, led to the decline in resource extraction over time.
