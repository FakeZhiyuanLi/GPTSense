Spinoza believed that the world was made up of a single substance which he referred to as Deus sive Natura, meaning God or Nature. According to him, everything in the world, including humans, animals, plants, and even inanimate objects, are all part of this same substance. He saw the universe as a unified and interconnected whole, governed by natural laws and a deterministic system.
