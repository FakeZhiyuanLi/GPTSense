Rapid decompression can cause a significant decrease in air pressure in the lungs, leading to a condition called barotrauma. This can cause the lungs to rapidly expand, potentially causing damage to the delicate lung tissue and potentially leading to pneumothorax (collapsed lung). Additionally, rapid decompression can also cause a decrease in oxygen levels in the bloodstream, leading to hypoxia and possible loss of consciousness.
