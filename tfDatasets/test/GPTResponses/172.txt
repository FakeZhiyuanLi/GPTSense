Ethnoarchaeologists gain a better understanding of the relationship between material culture and human behavior by studying living human groups. By observing how people use, produce, discard, and modify objects in their daily lives, ethnoarchaeologists can infer how prehistoric people may have used similar objects in the past. Additionally, studying living human groups can help ethnoarchaeologists understand the social, economic, and environmental conditions that influence material culture. Finally, by working with living human groups, ethnoarchaeologists can develop hypotheses about the processes that contribute to the formation and transformation of archaeological sites and artifacts.
