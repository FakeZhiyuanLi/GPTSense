One alternative to making carbon-based fuels from the reduction of carbon dioxide is to develop and use renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. These sources of energy do not rely on finite resources and do not produce greenhouse gases, which contribute to climate change. Other alternative fuels include biofuels made from plant-based materials and hydrogen fuel cells. Additionally, improving energy efficiency and reducing overall energy consumption can also reduce the demand for carbon-based fuels.
