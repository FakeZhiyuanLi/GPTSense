The function of the amount of dielectric, the strength of the dielectric, and its permittivity is to determine the capacitance of a capacitor. Capacitance is directly proportional to both the amount and permittivity of the dielectric, and inversely proportional to the distance between the plates, or the strength of the dielectric. Therefore, by changing any of these factors, the capacitance of a capacitor can be altered.
