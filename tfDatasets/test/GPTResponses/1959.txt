No wave had a discordant and abrasive sound before it began to transition to a more dance-oriented sound. It emphasized noise, dissonance, and anti-musicality, often incorporating elements of punk, avant-garde, and experimental music. The music was characterized by unconventional song structures, irregular rhythms, and a rejection of traditional rock instrumentation and techniques. Some notable no wave bands include Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, DNA, and The Contortions.
