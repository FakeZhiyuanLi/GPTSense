is called the "ego" or the "self". This is the core of a person's identity, their sense of self-awareness, and their individuality. The ego is responsible for processing and integrating ongoing experiences, memories, thoughts, and emotions to form a unique understanding of oneself and their place in the world. The theory also suggests that the ego is influenced by social and cultural factors, as well as individual internal conflicts and external stressors.
