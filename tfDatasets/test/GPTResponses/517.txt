As an Islamic philosopher, Avicenna aimed to reconcile Aristotelian philosophy with Islamic theology. He sought to reconcile the rationalist approach of Greek philosophy with the revelation of the Quran by demonstrating that reason and revelation are complementary and not conflicting. He believed that God created the universe in accordance with rational principles and that human reason could uncover these principles through careful observation and deduction. Avicenna also emphasized the importance of ethics and morality in everyday life, arguing that the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom was essential for leading a virtuous and fulfilling life.
