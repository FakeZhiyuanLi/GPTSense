The philosophy in education that was sanctioned by the Chinese court is Confucianism. It was the dominant philosophy during the imperial era, and its influence on Chinese education can still be seen today. Confucianism emphasizes the importance of education, self-cultivation, social responsibility, and respect for authority. The Imperial Examination System, which was used to select government officials, was based on Confucian teachings and values. Confucianism also influenced the content and structure of the Chinese education system, with a focus on memorization and rote learning, as well as the use of classical Chinese literature as a primary text.
