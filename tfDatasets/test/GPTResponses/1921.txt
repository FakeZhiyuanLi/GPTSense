No, safe harbor agreements and ITSPs (Internal Transactional Safe Harbor Programs) are not mutually exclusive. Both these agreements are regulatory mechanisms used by companies to ensure data privacy and security. Safe harbor agreements are used to transfer data from the EU to the US while complying with EU data protection laws, while ITSPs are used to ensure the privacy and security of data transactions within a company. A company may choose to adopt both mechanisms to ensure full compliance with data protection laws.
