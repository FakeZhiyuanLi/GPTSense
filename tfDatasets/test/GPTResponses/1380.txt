The capacitance rating is the most important rating to consider when designing a capacitor. This rating indicates the amount of charge the capacitor can store and is measured in farads (F) or microfarads (Î¼F). Other important ratings include the voltage rating, which indicates the maximum voltage the capacitor can handle without breaking down, and the temperature rating, which indicates the maximum temperature the capacitor can operate at without degrading its performance or lifespan.
