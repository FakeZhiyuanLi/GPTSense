Some scholars propose Thursday as a possible day of the crucifixion because they base their argument on the Gospel of John, which suggests that Jesus was crucified on the day before the Sabbath. According to the Jewish calendar at the time, the Sabbath would have started on Friday evening at sunset. Therefore, if Jesus was crucified on Friday, there would not have been enough time to prepare his body and bury him before the Sabbath. However, if he was crucified on Thursday, there would have been enough time to prepare and bury his body before the Sabbath started. Additionally, some scholars point to ancient Jewish customs and practices that support the idea that the day of the crucifixion may have been Thursday. However, it should be noted that there is no unanimous agreement among scholars on the actual day of the crucifixion, and the debate continues.
