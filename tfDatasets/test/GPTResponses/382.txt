The White Huns, also known as the Hephthalites, were a nomadic people who roamed across Central Asia during the 5th and 6th centuries AD. They are believed to have originated from the area now known as Mongolia and eventually settled in regions such as modern-day Afghanistan, Pakistan, and northern India.
