During the Industrial Revolution, children from rural areas often worked in factories and mines in cities. They were employed in textile mills, coal mines, and other manufacturing industries. Children as young as five or six worked long hours in dangerous conditions, often for low pay. Many were forced to work in unsafe environments and were injured, sickened, or killed as a result. Others were subjected to abuse and mistreatment by their employers. While child labor laws eventually improved working conditions for children, child labor remains a significant problem in many parts of the world today.
