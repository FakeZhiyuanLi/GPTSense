When the current and voltage switch direction, the energy stored in the inductance and capacitance is released, and an oscillatory circuit is formed between them. This circuit is commonly referred to as a resonant circuit or LC circuit. The frequency of oscillation is determined by the product of the inductance and capacitance and is given by the formula f = 1/(2π√LC). The oscillations can persist for a long time in the absence of any damping or resistance in the circuit. This property is used in many practical applications such as radio transmitters, receivers, and filters.
