Franz Boas argued against the notion of biological determinism, which claimed that a person's race determined their intelligence, behavior, and cultural traits. He believed that culture was the main factor that determined human behavior and that cultural traits were learned and could change over time. Boas also criticized the idea of cultural evolution, which suggested that cultures progressed from simple to complex forms, as he believed that all cultures were equally valuable and complex in their own ways.
