A Pirani gauge is sensitive to low pressures and measures pressure based on the thermal conductivity of the gas in the chamber. Specifically, it measures the thermal conductivity of the gas molecules as they collide with a heated filament in the gauge, and this measurement is used to calculate the pressure in the chamber. Pirani gauges are commonly used in vacuum systems to measure pressures in the range of 10^-4 to 10^3 torr.
