Samuel Morse retired mainly due to his advancing age and declining health. He had achieved great success in his career as an inventor and artist, and felt that it was time to step back and enjoy his retirement years. Additionally, Morse was deeply affected by the death of his wife Lucretia in 1854, and this event may have also played a role in his decision to retire.
