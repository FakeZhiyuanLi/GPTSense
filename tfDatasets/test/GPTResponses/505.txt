24p refers to a video format that captures 24 frames per second (fps). This format is often used in film and television production, as it closely matches the frame rate of traditional 35mm film. The "p" in 24p stands for "progressive scan," which means that each frame is captured in its entirety, rather than being split into odd and even lines like in interlaced formats. This results in smoother motion and more cinematic look to the video.
