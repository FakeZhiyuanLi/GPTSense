The United Kingdom has been governed under a constitutional monarchy since the 17th century. The monarch, currently Queen Elizabeth II, is the head of state, but has a largely ceremonial role. The government is led by the Prime Minister, who is appointed by the monarch and is the head of the executive branch. The Parliament, consisting of the House of Commons and the House of Lords, makes the laws of the country. The UK has a system of representative democracy, with citizens electing Members of Parliament to represent their interests in the government. The Scottish Government, Welsh Government, and Northern Ireland Executive have devolved powers from the UK government to govern their respective regions.
