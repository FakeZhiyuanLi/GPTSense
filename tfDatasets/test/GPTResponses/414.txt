1. Nighttime: During the night, the absence of sunlight causes a decrease in temperature.2. Elevation: The higher the elevation, the cooler the temperature because the air is less dense and allows heat to escape more easily.3. Latitude: As you move further away from the equator towards the poles, the temperature decreases due to a decrease in sunlight intensity.4. Cold Fronts: A cold front is a boundary where cold air masses replace warm air masses, causing a decrease in temperature.5. Altitude: Changes in altitude can cause temperature changes because the air pressure and density changes with altitude.6. Season: Temperature decreases in winter because the earth's axis is tilted away from the sun, resulting in less exposure to sunlight.7. Cloud cover: Cloudy days decrease the temperature because clouds block sunlight from reaching the ground.8. Wind: Wind can cause a decrease in temperature because it helps to disperse the heated air and bring cooler air to the surface.
