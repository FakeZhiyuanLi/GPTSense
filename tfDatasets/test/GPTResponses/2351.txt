Nutrition is extremely important for both prenatal and postnatal development. Adequate and balanced nutrition during pregnancy can promote healthy growth and development in the fetus, and can help reduce the risk of birth defects, low birth weight, and other complications. Similarly, proper nutrition during infancy and early childhood is critical for healthy physical and cognitive development, including the development of the brain and nervous system. Breast milk, in particular, is an optimal source of nutrients for newborns and protects against infections and other health problems. Additionally, responsive and nurturing care from parents and caregivers can promote healthy emotional and social development.
