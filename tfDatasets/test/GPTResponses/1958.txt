Centuries, in the context of bicycling, refer to organized bicycle rides that cover 100 miles (160.9 km) in a single day. It is a popular challenge for cyclists and usually involves a well-planned route with support vehicles and rest stops along the way. These rides require a high level of fitness and endurance, but are often seen as a significant accomplishment in cycling culture.
