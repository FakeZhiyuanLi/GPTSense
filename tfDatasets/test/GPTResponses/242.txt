The concept of "superclubs" in the dance music industry can be traced back to the 1980s, with the rise of club culture and the emergence of DJs as stars in their own right. One of the most influential figures in this movement was British DJ Paul Oakenfold, who began organizing large-scale raves and clubs events, including the legendary weekly party held at Ibiza's Amnesia nightclub in the late 1980s. Other early superclubs included Paradise Garage in New York City and Hacienda in Manchester, England.
