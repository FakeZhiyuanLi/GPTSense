In old literary works, darkness over the land is often prompted by natural disasters such as storms, eclipses or earthquakes. It is also associated with supernatural events such as the arrival of ghosts, vampires or other mythological creatures. In addition, darkness is sometimes used as a metaphorical symbol of the moral decay or impending doom.
