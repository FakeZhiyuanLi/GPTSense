A USB (Universal Serial Bus) connection is based on a standard communication protocol for transferring data between devices. It was designed to create a standard interface for connecting peripheral devices to computers and other devices, eliminating the need for multiple and often incompatible connectors. The USB connection provides a fast, reliable, and efficient means of data transfer and power supply between devices. It also supports various data transfer rates, including high-speed data transfer, making it ideal for a wide range of applications.
