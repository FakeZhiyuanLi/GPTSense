Jayapala saw a danger to his dynasty in the rising power of the Ghaznavid Empire under Mahmud Ghazni. Mahmud Ghazni had ambitions to conquer the Indian subcontinent and had already started attacking various kingdoms in the region. Jayapala was aware of the military prowess of the Ghaznavids and the threat they posed to his kingdom. He tried to form alliances with other regional kingdoms to counter the Ghaznavids but was ultimately defeated in battle by Mahmud Ghazni in 1001 AD. This led to the decline of the Shahi dynasty and paved the way for the establishment of the Ghaznavid Empire in the region.
