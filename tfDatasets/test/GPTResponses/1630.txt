The Treaty of Balta Liman was signed between the Ottoman Empire and Great Britain in 1838. It provided several benefits for Ottoman markets, including:1. Free trade: The treaty abolished all customs duties and taxes on British goods entering Ottoman territory. This made British goods cheaper and more accessible to Ottoman consumers, and increased trade between the two nations.2. Consular jurisdiction: The treaty allowed British consuls to have jurisdiction over British subjects living in Ottoman territory. This gave British traders and merchants greater legal protections and security while operating in Ottoman markets.3. Navigation rights: The treaty granted British merchants the right to navigate freely on Ottoman rivers and waterways. This helped British traders reach new markets and expand their operations in Ottoman territory.Overall, the Treaty of Balta Liman helped to strengthen economic ties between the Ottoman Empire and Great Britain, and provided a boost to Ottoman markets by making British goods more readily available and helping to facilitate greater trade.
