Christians believe that physical death is not the end of a person's life, but rather a transition from earthly life to eternal life either with God in heaven or separated from Him in hell, depending on the person's relationship with God. Christians also believe that Jesus conquered death through His resurrection and that believers will also experience resurrection and eternal life.
