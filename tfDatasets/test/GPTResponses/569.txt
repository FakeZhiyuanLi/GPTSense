After being widened by glaciation, glacial valleys have a U-shaped profile, characterized by steep sides and a flat bottom. This shape is due to the erosion of the glaciers, which scrape and drag rocks and sediment along the valley floor and walls, creating a broad, deep, and smooth surface. The valley may also have moraines, or piles of debris, along its sides and at its base, left behind by the melting glaciers.
