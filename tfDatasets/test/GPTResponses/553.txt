Safe working environments legislation for child labourers have been adopted at various times in different countries. In the United States, the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) was passed in 1938, which established minimum age and maximum work hour requirements for child laborers. In the United Kingdom, the Factory Act of 1833 was one of the earliest pieces of legislation to protect child laborers by establishing working hour limits and health and safety standards for factories. Other countries have adopted similar laws at different times, often in response to public outcry over unsafe and exploitative working conditions for children.
