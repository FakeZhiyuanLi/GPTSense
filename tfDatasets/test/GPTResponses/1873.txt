Many of the big players in the post-punk scene began leaning away from the harsh, abrasive sound and political themes of early post-punk and into more accessible, commercial territory as time progressed. Some bands incorporated elements of pop, funk, and dance music into their sound, resulting in more melodic, danceable songs. This movement, known as "new pop" or "new romanticism," included bands like Duran Duran, Spandau Ballet, and Culture Club. Other bands, like Joy Division and Siouxsie and the Banshees, evolved into more atmospheric, darkwave soundscapes. The post-punk scene gave birth to many subgenres, and the sound of post-punk itself continued to influence a wide range of music that followed.
