Social turmoil can be defined as a state of social unrest and disturbance which arises due to various factors such as socio-economic inequality, political instability, religious or cultural differences, etc. Conflict, on the other hand, can be defined as a serious disagreement or dispute between two or more groups or individuals.In many cases, social turmoil can lead to conflict as people who are affected by the social unrest may begin to feel frustrated, angry or threatened. This can lead to a breakdown in communication and an increase in tension between different groups or individuals, which can then escalate into open hostilities and violence.For example, the civil rights movement in the US in the 1960s was a period of significant social turmoil, with African Americans fighting for equal rights and opportunities. This social turmoil led to conflicts between different groups, with violent protests, riots and even wars breaking out.Similarly, the ongoing conflict in Syria is the result of many years of social turmoil, including political instability, corruption, economic hardship and religious differences. These factors have led to conflicts between different religious and ethnic groups, with devastating consequences for the people living in the country.In summary, social turmoil can often lead to conflict as people begin to feel threatened or disenfranchised. The key to preventing conflict is to address the underlying causes of social unrest and to promote dialogue and cooperation between different groups.
