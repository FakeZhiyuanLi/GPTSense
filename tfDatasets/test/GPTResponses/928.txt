The Bengali Renaissance was led by a group of intellectuals and social reformers known as the Bengal Renaissance thinkers. Some of the prominent leaders of this movement were Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, Akshay Kumar Datta, Michael Madhusudan Dutt, and Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, among others. Their ideas and works contributed significantly to the social, cultural, and intellectual awakening in Bengal during the 19th and early 20th centuries.
