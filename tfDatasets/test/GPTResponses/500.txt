According to Avicenna, an external cause could eventually actualize a potentiality. For example, he believed that an external cause (such as a teacher) could help actualize the potential for knowledge in a student. Additionally, he believed that external causes could also actualize physical changes in the natural world, such as the growth of plants or the movement of objects.
