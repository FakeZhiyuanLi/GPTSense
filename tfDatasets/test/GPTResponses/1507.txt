IGRAs (Interferon-Gamma Release Assays) have fewer false positives compared to the Mantoux skin test. IGRAs are more specific and are less likely to cross-react with other infections or vaccinations. Additionally, IGRAs are less affected by a prior BCG vaccination, which can cause false-positive results in Mantoux skin tests.
