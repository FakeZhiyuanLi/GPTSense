Portugal was the first country in the world to decriminalize drug possession and consumption for personal use in 2001. Instead of being charged with criminal offenses, drug users are now given counseling and treatment to overcome their addiction. This approach has been seen as a more effective way of reducing drug use and related harms compared to the traditional punitive approach. The move has attracted international attention, and several countries have since followed Portugal's lead in adopting similar policies.
