A well-defined and robust constitution that outlines the powers and responsibilities of the state government as well as the rights and protections afforded to its citizens.2. A strong tradition of democratic governance and a commitment to the rule of law.3. An independent judiciary that can serve as a check on the legislative and executive branches of government.4. A vibrant civil society that provides an avenue for citizens to participate in the political process and hold their elected officials accountable.5. Adequate levels of funding and resources to support the functions of the state government and ensure its ability to provide essential services to its citizens.6. An engaged and informed citizenry that is invested in the success of their state and willing to work collaboratively with their elected officials to achieve common goals.7.
