is called radiating energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation, such as light. This is because the acceleration of the charge in its circular motion causes it to emit photons, which carry away energy from the charge. As a result, the charge gradually loses kinetic energy and eventually slows down or comes to a halt, unless it is constantly replenished by an outside force. This effect is known as Larmor radiation or synchrotron radiation, and it has important applications in particle accelerators and astrophysics, among other fields.
