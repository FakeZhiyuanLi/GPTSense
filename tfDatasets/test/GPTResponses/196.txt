The axes of cultural and social anthropology are drawn together by their shared focus on understanding human behavior and culture. Both disciplines study human societies and cultures, and aim to describe, interpret, and explain the diversity and similarities of human experience around the world. They also both use similar research methods, such as participant observation, ethnography, and interviews, to gain an in-depth understanding of the communities and cultures they study. Additionally, both fields are interdisciplinary, drawing upon theories and methods from other disciplines such as sociology, psychology, linguistics, and history. Overall, cultural and social anthropology share a holistic approach to understanding the complexities of human life and culture, making them complementary and mutually reinforcing disciplines.
