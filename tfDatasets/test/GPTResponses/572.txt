The southern fringe receives cloudiness and rainfall due to ocean currents and prevailing winds. The warm, humid air over the ocean rises and cools, forming clouds and precipitation. The prevailing winds, which blow from east to west in this region, bring this moisture inland, causing rainfall on the southern fringe. The topography of the land can also play a role, with mountains and hills causing more rain to fall on their windward side. Additionally, seasonal changes in temperature and wind patterns, such as the monsoon season in some areas, can affect the amount and timing of rainfall.
