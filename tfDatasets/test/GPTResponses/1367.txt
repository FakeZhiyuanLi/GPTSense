The enumeration process typically starts by identifying the target system or network that needs to be audited. This involves collecting information about the network topology, IP addressing schemes, and services running on the target system. The initial reconnaissance may involve scanning the network and analyzing the responses to identify open ports, active services, and operating system versions. Once the target environment is identified, enumeration involves gathering more detailed information about the system and its users, such as user account names, group membership, application versions, and system settings. The goal of enumeration is to identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses that can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to the system or network.
