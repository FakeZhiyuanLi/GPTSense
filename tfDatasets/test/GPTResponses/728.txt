Some scholars argue that the "disease" of child labor is the systemic poverty and lack of access to education that forces children to work in dangerous and exploitative conditions. They believe that addressing the root causes of poverty and inequality, such as improving access to education and creating more economic opportunities for families, is the key to eliminating child labor. Additionally, some scholars note that globalization and the demand for cheap labor in industries such as manufacturing and agriculture perpetuate the problem of child labor in developing countries.
