Avicenna believed that the soul is immaterial and without any physical attributes or characteristics. It is not bound by space or time and is not subject to the same laws of nature as the physical body. Therefore, it is without mass, size, shape, and color. It is also without any physical sensations, such as pain or pleasure, as well as any changes or decay that affect the body. According to Avicenna, the soul is the essence of an individual's consciousness and self-awareness, and it is responsible for all of their thoughts, emotions, and volitions.
