One work that is sometimes attributed to Avicenna but is believed to not be his creation is the "Nahj al-Balagha," a collection of sermons, letters, and sayings attributed to Ali ibn Abi Talib, the cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad. Some scholars have suggested that Avicenna may have been involved in editing or organizing the collection, but there is no definitive evidence for this.
