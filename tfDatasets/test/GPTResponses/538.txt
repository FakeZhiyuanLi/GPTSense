The primary source of rain in the Sahara is the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). This is an area near the equator where the northern and southern hemisphere trade winds converge. During the summer months, the ITCZ shifts northward, bringing rainfall to the Sahel region, which is the transitional zone between the Sahara and the tropical savannahs to the south. However, the Sahara receives very little rainfall compared to other regions, and is considered the largest hot desert in the world.
