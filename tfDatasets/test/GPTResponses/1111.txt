The first traffic light was erected on December 9, 1868, outside the British Houses of Parliament in London. However, it was operated manually by a police officer and it did not have the red, amber and green lights we see today. The first electric traffic light with the red, amber and green lights was invented in the United States by a policeman named Lester Wire in 1912, and was first installed in Cleveland, Ohio.
