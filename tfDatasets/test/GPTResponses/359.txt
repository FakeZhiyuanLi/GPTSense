One of the most famous examples of housing built for employees during the 1920s is the planned community of Forest Hills Gardens in Queens, New York. It was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. and built by the Russell Sage Foundation to provide affordable, high-quality housing for middle-class workers employed in nearby Manhattan. The community featured tree-lined streets, parks, and gardens, and was intended to provide a peaceful and healthy alternative to the crowded, polluted conditions of urban tenements.
