The earliest confirmed evidence of the Chinese script is the Oracle Bones, discovered in the late 19th century. These were animal bones and turtle shells that were used for divination during the Shang Dynasty (1600 BCE - 1046 BCE) and had inscriptions on them that were written in early forms of Chinese characters.
