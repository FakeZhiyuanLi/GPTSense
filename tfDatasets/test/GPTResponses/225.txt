?Heartwood and sapwood differ in their chemical composition. Heartwood has undergone a process called heartwood formation, which involves the accumulation of various compounds and extractives that make it more resistant to decay and insect attack. Sapwood, on the other hand, is composed of living cells that transport water and nutrients from the roots to the rest of the tree. As a result, sapwood has a higher moisture content and is more susceptible to decay and insect attack.
