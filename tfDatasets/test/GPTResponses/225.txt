Alexander the Great reached India in 326 BCE. He entered the Indian subcontinent through the Khyber Pass (in present-day Pakistan) and then went on to capture numerous territories, including the region of Punjab in India. However, his conquests were limited, and he was forced to turn back due to his troops' refusal to continue.
