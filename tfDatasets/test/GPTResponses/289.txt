Data is stored on DVDs using a method called optical storage. The data is recorded onto a reflective layer of the disc using a laser. The laser creates tiny pits and lands on the disc which reflect the laser differently. These differences in reflection are read by a laser beam in a DVD player, allowing the data to be read and displayed on screen. DVDs typically hold around 4.7 GB of data, but dual-layer DVDs can hold up to 8.5 GB by having two reflective layers on the disc.
