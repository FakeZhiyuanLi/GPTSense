The Garamantes built a system of underground tunnels called the foggaras to bring water from underground aquifers to their crops. The tunnels were dug into the sides of hills and sloped downwards towards the fields, allowing gravity to bring the water down. The Garamantes also constructed dams and reservoirs to capture and store rainwater for later use.
