After doing farm work for so long, many children continued to work in other industries such as factories, mines, and mills. They were often employed in low-paying and dangerous jobs, working long hours with little or no breaks. Some children also turned to jobs in the service industry, such as being domestic servants, street vendors, or newspaper carriers. Child labor laws have been implemented in many countries to protect children from exploitation and ensure they have access to education and other opportunities.
