The opening of new sea routes during the Ottoman Empire is believed to have been caused by several factors, including advancements in shipbuilding technology, the development of more accurate navigational instruments, and the exploration and expansion of trade networks by Ottoman merchants and traders. Additionally, the Ottoman navy played a significant role in expanding sea routes through its control over key ports and strategic waterways, allowing for safer and more efficient passage for trade vessels.
