Yugoslavia was the only communist country to have an embassy in both the capitalist world and the socialist world. It maintained diplomatic relations with both the Soviet Union and the United States, as well as with other countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. This policy of non-alignment was a key feature of Yugoslav foreign policy during the Cold War, as it enabled the country to pursue an independent path and avoid being drawn into either the Soviet or American blocs. Despite its efforts to remain neutral, however, Yugoslavia was not immune to Cold War tensions and faced many challenges in its relations with other countries.
