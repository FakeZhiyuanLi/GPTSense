The concern with longer range ICBMs with H-bombs is that they provide nations with the ability to strike targets with nuclear weapons from far away, which makes it more difficult for other nations to defend against an attack. This increases the potential for catastrophic consequences in the event of a nuclear conflict, as well as the risk of accidental use or escalation. Additionally, such weapons may trigger an arms race or increase global tensions and instability.
