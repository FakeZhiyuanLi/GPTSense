DNA replication and transcription occur in the 5' â†’ 3' direction because DNA and RNA polymerases can only add new nucleotides to the 3' end of the growing chain. This is because the 3' end of the nucleotide has a hydroxyl (-OH) group that is free to form a phosphodiester bond with the next nucleotide, while the 5' end has a phosphate group that is bonded to the sugar of the previous nucleotide. Therefore, the direction of DNA and RNA synthesis is always from the 5' end to the 3' end.
