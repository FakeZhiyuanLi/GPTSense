St. Augustine was founded in 1565 by Spanish explorer, Pedro Menéndez de Avilés. He established the settlement with the purpose of protecting Spanish interests in the region and converting the local Timucua Native Americans to Christianity. The settlement was built on the site of a former Timucua village and was named after Saint Augustine of Hippo, a well-known Christian theologian. St. Augustine became the first permanent European settlement in what is now the continental United States.
