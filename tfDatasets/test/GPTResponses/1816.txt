These groups were all part of the no wave movement, a subgenre of punk rock that emerged in New York City in the late 1970s. The musicians associated with this scene were known for their experimental and avant-garde approach to music, often incorporating elements of free jazz, funk, and noise into their compositions. Many of them also had strong ties to the downtown art scene and were known for their multimedia performances and collaborations with visual artists.
