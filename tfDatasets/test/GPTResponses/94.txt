The issuance of CDOs (Collateralized Debt Obligations) peaked in 2006 and 2007. During this period, the market for mortgage-backed securities was growing rapidly, and CDOs were seen as a popular way to package and sell these securities to investors. The financial crisis of 2008 led to a decline in the issuance of CDOs, as well as increased scrutiny and regulation on the mortgage market.
