Some music critics and historians trace the period from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s, while others argue that it extended into the 1990s or beyond, depending on the specific bands, genres, and cultural contexts. Some influential figures who have commented or written about the post-punk era include Simon Reynolds, Jon Savage, Greil Marcus, Dave Thompson, and Mark Fisher, among others. Ultimately, the boundaries and meaning of the post-punk era are open to interpretation and debate.
