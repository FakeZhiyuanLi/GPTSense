A binary classification analysis is a type of analysis that fits the either-or nature of uncertainty. This method involves categorizing data into two groups based on a predefined criterion, such as yes or no, true or false, or positive or negative. It is commonly used in decision-making algorithms, machine learning, and predictive analytics. The two-class classification model is straightforward, and the results are easy to interpret, making it a popular choice for many applications.
