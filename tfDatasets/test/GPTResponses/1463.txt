The complex impedance with dielectric is represented mathematically using the following equation:Z = R + jXwhere Z is the complex impedance, R is the resistance, and X is the reactance, both of which are complex quantities. The reactance, X, is affected by the dielectric properties of the material, and is given by:X = 2πfCwhere f is the frequency of the signal and C is the capacitance of the dielectric material. Therefore, the complex impedance with dielectric can be expressed as:Z = R + j(2πfC)This equation shows that the complex impedance with dielectric depends on the frequency of the signal and the capacitance of the dielectric material.
