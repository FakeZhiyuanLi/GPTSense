Public notice of a listing can be given through several methods, including:1. Online Listings - Listings of properties are commonly seen on different online platforms like real estate websites, social media platforms, and others.2. Newspaper Listings - Real estate agencies often advertise the properties they are selling in local newspapers, thus making the public aware of the property’s availability.3. Posters and Flyers - Real estate agents often use printed posters and flyers in public areas such as grocery stores or other commercial spaces to inform the public about property listings.4. Open Houses - Another way to publicize a property for sale is by conducting open houses, which allow potential buyers to visit the property firsthand and gain a better understanding of its features and benefits.5. Yard Signs – Yard signs are often used to publicize the properties for sale to everyone who passes by, thereby raising the level of interest in the property from a large audience.Overall, the different ways public notice can be given about a listing depend on the marketing strategy of the real estate agent or agency.
