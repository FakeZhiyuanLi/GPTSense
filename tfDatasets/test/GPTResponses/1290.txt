sense?The design of USB is asymmetrical in terms of the shape and arrangement of its connectors. USB has a Type-A connector which is larger and rectangular in shape, and a Type-B connector which is smaller and square in shape. Furthermore, USB uses a Type-C connector which is reversible and can be plugged in both ways. This asymmetrical design allows for easy identification of the connector and prevents wrong insertion, resulting in a more efficient and convenient user experience.
