Ice accumulates in a glacier in the accumulation zone, also known as the snowfield or firnfield. This is the area at the top of the glacier where snow accumulates faster than it can melt or sublimate. As more and more snow accumulates, it compresses and converts into dense ice. This is where the glacier begins to form and move downslope under its own weight.
