Edward Carr, a British historian and international relations expert, believed that in a war between Germany and the Soviet Union, other major powers would have likely become involved. He argued that if Germany and the Soviet Union went to war, it would be a global conflict, as the two nations were both major military powers with strong political ideologies that would attract allies and opponents.According to Carr, the most likely allies of Germany would have been Japan and Italy, while the Soviet Union could have counted on the support of the United States and Great Britain. Other countries in Europe and Asia would have likely taken sides or remained neutral, depending on their national interests and regional alliances.Carr also believed that the outcome of such a war would have been difficult to predict, as both Germany and the Soviet Union had significant military and economic assets that could have tipped the balance in their favor. However, he argued that the human costs of such a conflict would have been devastating, with millions of lives lost and profound changes to the global political landscape.
