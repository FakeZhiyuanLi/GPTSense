During the Great Depression, President Franklin D. Roosevelt created a number of programs that helped North Carolina and other states recover from the economic crisis. Some of the programs that benefited North Carolina included:1. Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC): The CCC provided employment to young, unemployed men by hiring them to work on conservation projects, such as planting trees, building trails, and fighting forest fires. Over 73,000 North Carolinians served in CCC camps throughout the state.2. Public Works Administration (PWA): The PWA provided funding for public works projects, such as the construction of roads, bridges, and schools. In North Carolina, the PWA funded the construction of numerous public buildings and infrastructure projects, such as the Blue Ridge Parkway.3. Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA): The AAA provided farmers with subsidies to reduce crop surpluses and stabilize prices. This program helped North Carolina's tobacco farmers recover from the economic downturn.4. Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA): The TVA was established to develop the resources of the Tennessee Valley region, which included parts of western North Carolina. The TVA provided electricity, flood control, and economic development programs that benefited local communities.Overall, these programs provided much-needed relief and employment opportunities to North Carolinians during the Great Depression.
