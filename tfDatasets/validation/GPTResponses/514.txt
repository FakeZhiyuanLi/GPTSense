Elevators built in pairs are commonly referred to as double-decker elevators. They consist of two separate elevators stacked on top of each other and operate independently of each other. One elevator typically serves even-numbered floors, while the other serves odd-numbered floors.Both elevators are equipped with separate sets of doors that open and close simultaneously. When a passenger enters one of the elevators at the lobby level, they select the desired floor and ride to the intermediate landing. At the intermediate landing, passengers can transfer to the other elevator that serves the remaining floors.The operation of double-decker elevators is managed by a complex control system that ensures efficient routing and optimal utilization of each elevator. By dividing the passenger load between two elevators, double-decker elevators can significantly increase the capacity of a building's vertical transportation system.
