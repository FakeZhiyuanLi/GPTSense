The scriptio superior of the Sana'a manuscripts is believed to belong to the early version of the Quranic text, known as the "Uthmanic version," which dates back to the time of the third Caliph, Uthman ibn Affan, in the 7th century. This version is considered the standard and authoritative edition of the Quran that is still used by Muslims today.
