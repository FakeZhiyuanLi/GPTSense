Conquering people often pass down cultural, social, and religious practices to native populations. They may also impose their language, political systems, and economic structures on the conquered people. In some cases, they may introduce new technologies, such as agriculture or medicine, that can improve the native population's standard of living. However, conquering people may also bring disease, violence, and discrimination, causing harm and trauma to the native population. Ultimately, the impact of conquering people on the native population depends on the specific historical context and the actions of both groups.
