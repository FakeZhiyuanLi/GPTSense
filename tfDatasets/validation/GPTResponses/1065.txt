During refining, the impurities and unwanted substances present in crude oil or other raw materials are removed in order to produce a purer and more useful substance. The process involves several steps, including distillation, cracking, hydroprocessing, and others, depending on the type of raw material and the desired end product. The main objectives of refining are to separate the different components of the raw material, remove impurities and contaminants, adjust the properties of the product to meet specific requirements, and increase its value and quality.  Overall, refining is a complex and critical process that plays a vital role in the production of various fuels, chemicals, and other materials that are used in our daily lives.
