ASCII is still commonly used on the World Wide Web, especially in the United States, as it is compatible with most modern systems. However, its use has been largely replaced by Unicode, which supports a wider range of characters and scripts, and is now the most common character encoding on the World Wide Web. The adoption of Unicode as the preferred encoding on the web began in the late 1990s and has since become the dominant standard.
