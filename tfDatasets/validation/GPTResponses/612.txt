Genotype is determined by an individual's DNA, which is inherited from their biological parents. The specific combination of alleles (versions of genes) that an individual inherits from each parent determines their genotype. Alleles can be dominant or recessive, and their expression can impact an individual's phenotype (observable traits). Factors such as genetic recombination during meiosis can also contribute to the variation in genotypes among offspring with the same parents.
