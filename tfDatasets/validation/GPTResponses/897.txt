The two procedures used to design test cases in white-box testing are:1. Control Flow Testing: This technique focuses on testing the flow of control through the software system. The goal is to test every possible path in the program code, ensuring that all conditional and loop statements are executed and tested.2. Data Flow Testing: This technique focuses on testing how data is input, processed, and output by the system. The objective is to identify any flaws or errors in the way data is stored or passed between functions, variables, or modules. This is done by creating test cases that exercise the mechanism through which data flows in the system.
