During the Early Middle Ages (5th-10th centuries), education was mainly the responsibility of the Church. Monks and priests were the primary educators, and education was primarily focused on religious instruction and Latin language. The study of Greek and Roman classics was discouraged, and secular knowledge was not given as much importance. Additionally, education was only available to boys from noble families or those who showed exceptional talent.Only a small percentage of the population was literate, mainly the clergy and the aristocracy. Women were generally excluded from most educational opportunities. The Church played a crucial role in maintaining literacy and knowledge. For instance, they established monastic schools, where they taught not only religion but also basic subjects such as reading, writing, and arithmetic.However, there was a decline in the quality of education during the Early Middle Ages as the Roman Empire collapsed. The economic and political instability created a lack of funding for education, causing educational standards to decline. It wasn't until the High Middle Ages that education began to experience a resurgence in Europe.
