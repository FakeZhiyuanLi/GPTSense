The process in which the rest mass of particles is created from energy of two or more annihilating photons is called pair production.In this process, two high-energy photons, each with energy greater than the rest mass energy of an electron-positron pair (approximately 1.02 MeV), collide with each other. The energy of the two photons is converted into the mass of an electron-positron pair, where the total energy of the pair equals the sum of the energies of the two photons.The electron and positron created in the process have equal and opposite momentum, as required by conservation of momentum. The electron and positron will then travel in opposite directions until they either annihilate with each other, producing two high-energy photons, or interact with other particles in the surrounding medium.
