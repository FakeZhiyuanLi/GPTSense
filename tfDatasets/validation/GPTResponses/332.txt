Telnet defined ASCII as a network virtual terminal (NVT) because it is a standardized character set that can be used to represent characters in a consistent manner across different operating systems and devices. This allows Telnet to create a common interface between different systems, allowing users to communicate and interact with remote systems as if they were working on their local machine. The use of ASCII as the NVT enables Telnet to ensure that the data is transmitted in a manner that is compatible with all devices and operating systems, regardless of any variations in hardware or software.
