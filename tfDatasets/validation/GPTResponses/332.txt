as the current standard of statistical significance (p<0.05) is too lenient and leads to an over-reliance on p-values. This has been attributed to the problem of multiple hypothesis testing and the potential for Type I errors (false positives) when many tests are performed on the same data set.Advocates for a stricter significance threshold argue that a higher level of confidence is required to overcome issues such as publication bias and the file drawer effect (where negative results are not reported or published). They also suggest that a higher threshold would encourage researchers to focus on effect sizes rather than statistical significance.On the other hand, opponents argue that a stricter threshold could make it more difficult to detect smaller but still meaningful effects and could result in an increase in Type II errors (false negatives). They also suggest that a change in the significance threshold would require a fundamental shift in the way statistics are taught and applied in research.Overall, the debate continues, and opinions are divided on whether a ninety or ninety-five percent rule should replace the current standard of statistical significance.
