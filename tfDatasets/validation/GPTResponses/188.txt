as laissez-faire capitalism, is an economic system that emphasizes free markets, individual liberty, and private property. It is based on the belief that government intervention in the economy should be minimal, and that individuals and businesses should be free to pursue their own economic interests without interference from the state. Economic liberalism is often associated with classical economists such as Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill, and has been a central tenet of capitalist theory and practice since the late 18th century.
