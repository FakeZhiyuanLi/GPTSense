The Ottoman Empire brought about a significant uptick in the classes of Greek society. During the Ottoman period in Greece (1458-1821), the Greeks found themselves in a position to prosper economically, culturally, and politically. Trade flourished as a result of the Ottoman's establishment of secure trade routes, which allowed Greek merchants to transport their goods and services safely. This resulted in the growth of the merchant class, which in turn stimulated art, literature, and education. Furthermore, the Ottoman Empire's position benefited Greece as a whole by providing Greeks with a stable political environment, where people could engage in productive activities without fear of war or invasion. Lastly, the Ottomans also gave the Greeks a degree of self-determination, as they were allowed to govern their territories relatively autonomously, creating a sense of pride and independence. All these factors contributed to an uplift in the classes of Greek society in the Ottoman period.
