Mapping clusters can help disentangle ancestry by grouping individuals with similar genetic variations together. By doing so, it becomes easier to identify ancestral relationships between individuals and to differentiate between individuals with similar phenotypes or physical characteristics. This is particularly useful in populations with complex genetic backgrounds, such as those with diverse ancestries, as mapping clusters can help isolate unique genetic variations that are associated with specific ancestral populations. Additionally, identifying genetic clusters can help researchers trace the migration patterns of populations and gain a deeper understanding of the evolutionary history of a given population.
