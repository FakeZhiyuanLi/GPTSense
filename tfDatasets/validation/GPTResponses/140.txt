In the 19th century, composers and musicians were largely dependent on the patronage of wealthy individuals, aristocrats, or the Church for their livelihoods. However, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many composers and musicians began to construct lives independent of patronage through the creation of concert series, music schools, publishing ventures, and self-promotion through press and media. They also established a market for sheet music, recordings, and performance fees, which provided an alternative source of income. This newfound independence allowed some composers and musicians to experiment with new and avant-garde musical styles, without fear of losing the support of their patrons.
