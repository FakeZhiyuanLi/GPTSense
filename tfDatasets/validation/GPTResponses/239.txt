Mill differentiated between sensations of the body and the mind. He believed that bodily sensations were physical and could be easily observed and measured, while mental sensations were subjective and could only be experienced by the individual. Mill also distinguished between primary and secondary qualities of objects. Primary qualities, such as size and shape, were inherent properties of objects that could be accurately measured and perceived, while secondary qualities, such as color and taste, were subjective and depended on the observer's experience and interpretation.
