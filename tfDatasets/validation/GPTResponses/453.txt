found at a lower frequency or perhaps not present at all. This could be cultural practices, genetic traits, or certain species of plants and animals. For example, drinking wine is a common cultural practice in Europe, but may not be as prevalent in other regions. Similarly, certain genetic mutations or variations may be more common in European populations, whereas they may be absent or less frequent in other parts of the world due to genetic diversity. In terms of plants and animals, species that are native to Europe may not be found in other parts of the world or may be found only in limited numbers.
