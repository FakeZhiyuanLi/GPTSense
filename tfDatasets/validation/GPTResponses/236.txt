A notable hoard was found near the former lands of the Byzantine Empire in Syria. The hoard, known as the Hama hoard, was discovered near Hama in western Syria in 1998. It contained over 1,300 Byzantine gold, silver, and copper coins dating from the 5th to the 7th century CE, as well as several pieces of jewelry. The hoard is believed to have been buried by its owner during the Arab-Byzantine wars of the 7th century CE.
