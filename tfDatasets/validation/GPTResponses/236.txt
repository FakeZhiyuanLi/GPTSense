Mill believed that knowledge comes from experience and observation. He argued that our ideas and concepts are derived from our sensory experiences, and that knowledge is not innate but is rather acquired through our interaction with the outside world. Mill's philosophy is known as empiricism, which holds that knowledge is based on empirical evidence and not on intuition or abstract reasoning.
