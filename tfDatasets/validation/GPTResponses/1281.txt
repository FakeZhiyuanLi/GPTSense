Various religious groups have historically gone to Islamic courts for a range of legal disputes, including Christians, Jews, Zoroastrians, Hindus, and Buddhists. In areas where Islamic law was the dominant legal system, non-Muslims would typically have their own religious courts that operated in parallel to the Islamic courts but were authorized by the Islamic authorities. In some cases, non-Muslim litigants might choose to go to Islamic courts if they felt the legal outcome there would be more favorable than in their own religious courts or in secular courts.
