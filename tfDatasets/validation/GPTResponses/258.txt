Wittgenstein stated that logic is not a theory but a way of verifying or checking the correctness of a statement. Logical truths are not derived from experience but are fundamental and necessary. He also argued that language games and forms of life determine the meaning of words and sentences, rather than their underlying logical structure. Finally, Wittgenstein held that some apparent contradictions arise from misunderstandings of language and can be resolved by clarifying the meaning of the terms involved.
