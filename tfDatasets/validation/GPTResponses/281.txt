Peirce strongly advocated for the use of deductive reasoning over inductive reasoning. He argued that deductive reasoning produces certain conclusions from premises that are logically valid, while inductive reasoning only produces probable conclusions that can be revised or refuted with new evidence. Peirce believed that only deductive reasoning allows for the establishment of true certainty and the progress of natural science. He also criticized the overreliance on induction in philosophy, which he believed led to speculative metaphysical theories that lack logical rigor.
