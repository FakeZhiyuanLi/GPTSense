The practice of denying children with disabilities access to public schools was widespread in the United States until the passing of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act (EAHCA) in 1975. Prior to this, many school districts would refuse to admit children with disabilities, arguing that they could not meet their educational needs or that they would be disruptive to the classroom. This denial of educational access was based on societal views of disability at the time, which included ideas such as the medical model of disability, which viewed people with disabilities as being abnormal or broken and in need of fixing.
