There are many philosophers who have argued for human incompleteness, but one of the most notable is Friedrich Nietzsche. Nietzsche argued that humans are inherently incomplete because we are constantly striving for something more, something beyond ourselves. He believed that this striving, which he called the "will to power," is what makes us unique as human beings.Other philosophers who have argued for human incompleteness include Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Emmanuel Levinas. These philosophers have all emphasized the idea that humans are never fully complete or self-sufficient, but rather are always in a state of becoming. They have also stressed the importance of our relationship with others and with the world around us in shaping our understanding of ourselves and our place in the world.
