If taken for an extended period of time, 100-300mg of zinc daily can lead to a copper deficiency. This is because high levels of zinc can interfere with the absorption of copper in the body. Symptoms of copper deficiency can include anemia, fatigue, weakness, and neurological symptoms. Therefore, it is important to take zinc supplements only as recommended by a healthcare provider and to make sure to get enough copper through diet or additional supplementation if necessary.
