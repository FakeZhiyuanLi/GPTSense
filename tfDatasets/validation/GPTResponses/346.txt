Plants communicate with each other through chemical signals by releasing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into the air. When a plant is under attack by insects or other herbivores, it may release VOCs that nearby plants can detect. These VOCs can include molecules such as methyl salicylate, which can act as a signal to activate the defense systems of nearby plants.When plants receive these signals, they may respond in several ways. For example, they may produce their own VOCs to deter herbivores or even produce compounds that are toxic to these pests. They may also produce more structural defenses such as thorns or tougher leaves.Overall, this communication system allows plants to defend themselves against predators as a group, increasing their chances of survival.
