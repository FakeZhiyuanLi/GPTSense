The philosophy that was influential in the medieval church and was opposed to Christian idealism was Aristotelianism. Aristotle's emphasis on the physical world and his rejection of Plato's dualism led to a more rationalistic and naturalistic approach to theology, which challenged the Christian emphasis on the spiritual and supernatural aspects of reality. This philosophical position was embraced by some theologians and caused controversy within the church, with some fearing it would undermine the foundations of Christian doctrine.
