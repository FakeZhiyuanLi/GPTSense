Sewall Wright developed the concept of genetic drift as a way of measuring the role of chance in evolution. This idea is based on the fact that small populations are more likely to experience random fluctuations in gene frequencies due to chance events, such as the death of individuals, than large populations. Wright reasoned that it was important to consider this factor in evolution because it could lead to the fixation of alleles that are not necessarily beneficial or adaptive, but simply lucky enough to survive the stochasticity of the environment.
