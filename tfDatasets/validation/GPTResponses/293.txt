This belief, known as scientific racism, was taught and propagated by many scientists and intellectuals during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Some notable individuals who supported this idea include Charles Darwin, Francis Galton, and Arthur de Gobineau. Many Western societies, including the United States, also institutionalized this belief, leading to racist policies and practices such as eugenics and segregation. However, scientific discoveries and advancements in genetics and anthropology have shown that race is a social construct and not biologically determined, and the concept of scientific racism is now widely discredited.
