is called a traction system. This involves a motor operating a pulley system that is attached to steel cables that move the elevator car up and down. Some older elevators may also use a hydraulic system, which involves a motor pumping hydraulic fluid into a cylinder to lift the elevator car. However, modern elevators often use a gearless motor system which is more efficient and allows for smoother, faster rides.
