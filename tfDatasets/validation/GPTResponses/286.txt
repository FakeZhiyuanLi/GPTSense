Hume's view on inductive reasoning was that it was based on experience and observation, and therefore could not provide absolute certainty. He believed that inductive reasoning could only lead to probable conclusions, not necessary truths.On the other hand, Hume saw deductive reasoning as based on logic and reason, and therefore able to provide necessary truths. However, he argued that deductive reasoning is limited by the premises of the argument, and therefore can only be as certain as the premises themselves.Overall, Hume was skeptical of the ability of both inductive and deductive reasoning to provide absolute certainty, and instead advocated for a more nuanced and probabilistic approach to knowledge.
