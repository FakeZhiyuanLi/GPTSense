There are many places that are traditionally geographically isolated, including:1. Islands: islands are surrounded by water and can be difficult to access, making them a natural barrier to travel and communication.2. Mountain ranges: Mountain ranges such as the Andes or the Himalayas can be difficult to cross and can create physical barriers between communities.3. Deserts: Deserts such as the Sahara or the Gobi can be inhospitable and difficult to navigate, making travel and communication difficult.4. Polar regions: The Arctic and Antarctic regions are isolated due to their extreme climate and lack of infrastructure.5. Rainforests: Rainforests such as the Amazon can be difficult to traverse, with thick vegetation and a lack of roads or other infrastructure.6. Remote rural regions: There are many rural regions across the world that are isolated due to a lack of transportation infrastructure or access to technology.7. Volcanic islands: Volcanic islands can be difficult to access due to their rugged terrain, and they may also be prone to eruptions, making them less habitable.
