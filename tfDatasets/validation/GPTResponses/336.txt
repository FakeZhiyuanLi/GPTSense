Computers using operating systems may use different line endings depending on the operating system.Windows-based operating systems (such as Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, and 10) use the carriage return and line feed (CRLF) sequence "\r\n" as their line ending.Unix-based operating systems (such as Linux and macOS) use the line feed (LF) character "\n" as their line ending.Older Macintosh systems (prior to Mac OS X) used the carriage return (CR) character "\r" as their line ending.Some text editors and programming tools allow users to choose the line ending they want to use, while others may automatically convert line endings to a specific format based on the operating system they are running on.
