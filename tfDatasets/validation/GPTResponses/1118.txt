One major problem with Paris being disconnected from its suburbs was increasing social and economic inequality between different areas. The suburbs, known as the banlieues, were often home to lower-income and multicultural populations, while Paris proper was wealthier and predominantly white. The lack of efficient transportation and infrastructure between the two areas made it difficult for those in the suburbs to access job opportunities and resources in the city, leading to a cycle of poverty and unemployment. Additionally, the disconnect contributed to feelings of alienation and marginalization among these populations, leading to social unrest and tensions.
