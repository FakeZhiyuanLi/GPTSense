Charged ions can be used to produce various properties in glass, such as color, opacity, transparency, and conductivity. For example, adding silver ions to glass can create a mirror-like effect, while adding copper ions can create a blue-green coloration. Likewise, introducing cerium ions can increase the glass's UV-blocking abilities, while doping the glass with neodymium ions can create a slight pink hue.
