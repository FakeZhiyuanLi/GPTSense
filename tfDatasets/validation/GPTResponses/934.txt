This phenomenon is called mass-energy equivalence or simply mass-energy conversion. It is described by Einstein's famous equation E = mcÂ², which shows that mass and energy are simply different forms of the same physical quantity. Therefore, when the rest mass of individual particles is destroyed, their mass-energy is converted into other forms of energy, such as kinetic energy, potential energy, or radiation, but the total mass-energy of the system remains constant.
