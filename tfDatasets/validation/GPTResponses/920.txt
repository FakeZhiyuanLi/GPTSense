Grey-box testing involves a combination of black-box testing and white-box testing. This means that the tester has limited knowledge of the internal workings of the software or system being tested, but has access to some information such as code or architecture diagrams. The goal of grey-box testing is to assess both the functionality and internal structure of the software or system being tested, while also considering the possible failures or security issues that may occur. This type of testing is often used in integration testing, regression testing, and acceptance testing.
