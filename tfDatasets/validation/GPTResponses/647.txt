During ancient times, if a commoner concubine had a son, the child would be considered illegitimate and not entitled to inherit his fatherâ€™s titles or property. However, the child could still be acknowledged as the father's progeny and regarded as his personal property. The child of a concubine was expected to live a life of servitude to the family and could never hold official positions in government or become a candidate for a royal marriage. In the case of inheritance or becoming a successor, it would depend on the father's decision or the laws of the land.
