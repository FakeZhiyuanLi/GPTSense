Luoyang, an ancient city located in central China, has experienced several devastations throughout its history. The most significant destruction of the city occurred during the Tang dynasty in 907 AD when the city was sacked by rebel forces. The rebels, led by the warlord Zhu Quanzhong, attacked the city and burnt down buildings, temples, and palaces. The destruction of the city led to the collapse of the Tang dynasty's central power, and Luoyang never regained its former glory.Additionally, during World War II, the Japanese bombing of Luoyang caused significant destruction to the city's infrastructure and historical monuments.
