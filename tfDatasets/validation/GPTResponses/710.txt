One particularly African-American experience that is specific to the United States is the history of slavery and forced migration from Africa. The transatlantic slave trade forcibly brought millions of Africans to the United States, where they were subjected to inhumane treatment, including forced labor, physical abuse, and separation from their families. Despite the abolition of slavery, systemic racism and discrimination continued to impact the lives of African-Americans, from Jim Crow laws to police brutality and mass incarceration. The struggle for civil rights and social justice has been a central part of the African-American experience in the United States, and continues to shape the country's history and culture.
