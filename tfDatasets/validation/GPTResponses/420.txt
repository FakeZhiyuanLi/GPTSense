Various types of people hide their emotions, including introverted individuals who prefer to keep their feelings to themselves, people who have been conditioned to suppress their emotions due to societal expectations or cultural norms, and individuals who have experienced trauma or negative past experiences that have led them to become guarded. Some people may also hide their emotions due to fear of vulnerability or rejection, a desire to maintain control over their feelings, or simply out of habit or personality traits.
