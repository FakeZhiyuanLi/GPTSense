Schopenhauer attributes the ideal to the intuitive and creative nature of the human mind. He believed that the ideal is not a mere product of reason or intellect, but rather stems from the deep, underlying impulses of the individual. The ideal, for Schopenhauer, is therefore an expression of the will, which is the fundamental force that drives all human behavior and motivation.
