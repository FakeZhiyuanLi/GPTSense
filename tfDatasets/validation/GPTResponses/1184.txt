The benefit of installing glass with the thick side at the bottom is that it provides greater stability and strength to the glass. This is because glass is stronger in compression than in tension. When the thick side is at the bottom, it can withstand the weight and pressure of the rest of the glass, which makes it less likely to break or shatter under stress. Additionally, when the thick side is at the bottom, it creates a smoother surface for objects to rest on, reducing the risk of damage or breakage.
