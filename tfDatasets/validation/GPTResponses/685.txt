The scientific community largely rejects the idea that there are biologically distinct races. The consensus among scientists is that race is a social construct, rather than a biological one. Research has shown that genetic differences between individuals within a racial group can be greater than between individuals of different racial groups. Therefore, attempts to classify people into discrete racial categories based on physical characteristics are arbitrary and not based on any scientific evidence.
