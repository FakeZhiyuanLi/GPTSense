Public schools started to become more and more developed in the 19th century, with the introduction of compulsory education laws in many countries such as the United States and Europe. This period saw the establishment of public school systems, improvements in educational infrastructure, and the development of standardized curriculums. The late 20th century and early 21st century also saw further developments in public education with a greater focus on technology integration, diversity, and personalized learning.
