Race can serve as a significant factor when studying social inequality because it is a socially constructed category that has historically been used to categorize and maintain power structures within societies. Race affects access to resources, opportunities, and social status, as well as the likelihood of experiencing discrimination, prejudice, and marginalization. For example, people of color are often disproportionately affected by poverty, unemployment, inadequate housing, lack of access to healthcare and education, and criminal justice system biases. By studying the role of race in shaping social inequality, researchers and activists can work to address systemic issues and create more equitable societies.
