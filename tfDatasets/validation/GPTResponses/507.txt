The establishment of a western-style army in Japan is attributed to the Meiji Emperor and his government in the late 19th century. The Meiji Restoration period began in 1868 and marked the end of the feudal system and the beginning of modernization efforts in Japan. The Meiji government recognized the importance of creating a strong, centralized military force based on western models to defend the country against foreign aggression and to establish Japan as a modern nation in the international community. To achieve this, the government introduced a set of military reforms, including conscription, the adoption of European military tactics and organization, and the establishment of military academies to train officers. The new military was known as the Imperial Japanese Army and became a key instrument of Japan's imperial ambitions in Asia in the early 20th century.
