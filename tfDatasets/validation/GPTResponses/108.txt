One of the commonly used zinc compounds in manufacturing rubber is zinc oxide (ZnO). It acts as an activator and accelerator in the vulcanization process and helps to improve the mechanical properties and durability of rubber products. Zinc stearate, zinc dithiocarbamate, zinc diethyldithiocarbamate, and zinc mercaptobenzothiazole are also used as zinc-containing additives in rubber manufacturing.
