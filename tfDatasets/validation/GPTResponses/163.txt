Bees, wasps, butterflies, and ants are all important pollinators that visit flowers to collect nectar and/or pollen. While collecting nectar and pollen, these insects transfer the pollen from the flowerâ€™s male reproductive part (anther) to the female reproductive part (stigma), allowing the plant to produce seeds and fruit. This process is essential for the reproduction and survival of many plant species, and it also benefits the insects by providing them with food. Bees and butterflies are known to be among the most important and effective pollinators.
