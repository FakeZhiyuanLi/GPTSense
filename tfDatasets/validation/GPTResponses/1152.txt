Alkaline ions in glass can harm the following:1. Chemical durability: The high concentration of alkaline ions can result in a corrosive reaction that reduces the chemical durability of the glass.2. Optical quality: The presence of alkaline ions can cause distortion, haze, or discoloration of the glass, which can reduce the optical quality of the glass.3. Thermal shock resistance: Alkaline ions can reduce the thermal shock resistance of glass, making it more susceptible to cracking or breaking under extreme temperature changes.4. Surface roughness: High levels of alkaline ions can increase surface roughness and reduce the smoothness of the glass surface, which can affect its performance and application.5. Biocompatibility: If the glass is used for medical or biological applications, the presence of alkaline ions can reduce its biocompatibility, making it less suitable for implantation or use in direct contact with living tissue.
