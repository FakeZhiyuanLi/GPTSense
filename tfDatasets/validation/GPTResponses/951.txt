The expected end result of eliminating construction errors is to increase the quality and safety of the building or structure being constructed. By identifying and correcting errors in the construction process, the final product will be more structurally sound, durable, and efficient. This can result in lower maintenance costs, increased longevity, and safer use for the occupants.
