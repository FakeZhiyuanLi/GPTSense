Window glass is typically made of soda-lime glass, which is a type of glass that is made from a mixture of sand, soda ash, and limestone. This is the most common type of glass used for windows due to its durability, affordability, and ease of production. Other types of glass may also be used for specific purposes, such as tempered glass for safety or low-E glass for energy efficiency.
