Grey-box testing is a variation of black-box testing where the tester has partial knowledge of the internal workings of the system being tested. This allows the tester to have a deeper understanding and insight into the system, which can lead to more effective testing. However, the tester still does not have full knowledge of the system, and tests from an external perspective like in black-box testing.
