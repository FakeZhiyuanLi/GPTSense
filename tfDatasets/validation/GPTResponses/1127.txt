Louis Comfort Tiffany, known for his Tiffany lamps, was a famous lampmaker who used glass in his creations. He pioneered a technique called the "copper foil method," which involved wrapping pieces of stained glass in copper foil and soldering them together to create intricate and colorful lampshades. His unique designs and use of glass resulted in highly sought-after lamps that remain popular today.
