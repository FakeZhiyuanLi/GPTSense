Operational acceptance testing is limited to testing whether a system or application is fit for use and meets specific operational requirements. It focuses on verifying that the system operates as intended, is reliable, and can be managed and maintained by the end-users or operators. It is conducted to ensure that the system meets the operational goals of the organization and is compatible with the existing infrastructure, resources, and processes. This type of testing is limited to the practical aspects of system usage and does not include testing for functional or performance-related issues.
