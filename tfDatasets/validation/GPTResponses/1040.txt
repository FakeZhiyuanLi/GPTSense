There is no specific part of the Quran that describes God's use of intermediaries between Himself and His prophets. The Quran emphasizes the direct relationship between God and the prophets, and emphasizes the importance of monotheism (tawheed), which rejects the idea of intermediaries between God and His creation.However, there are some verses that describe angels and messengers (such as Jibril/Gabriel) being sent by God to deliver messages or guidance to the prophets, but these beings are not considered to be intermediaries in the same sense as in other religious beliefs.Overall, the Quran emphasizes the concept of tawheed and the direct relationship between God and His creation.
