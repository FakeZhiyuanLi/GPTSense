Menzies' "forgotten people" radio talks are often compared to Franklin D. Roosevelt's "fireside chats" in the United States. Both were radio broadcasts where political leaders spoke directly to their citizens in an intimate and conversational style. However, while Roosevelt's chats were primarily designed to reassure and inspire the American public during times of crisis, Menzies' talks were focused on advocating for a specific political platform and mobilizing support for his political party.
