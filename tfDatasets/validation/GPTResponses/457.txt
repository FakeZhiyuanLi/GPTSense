Elevators were first used in the construction of multi-story buildings in the mid-19th century for the industrial industry, specifically for the transportation of heavy materials and equipment between different levels of a building. However, it was soon adapted for passenger use, and the first passenger elevator was installed in a five-story department store in New York City in 1857.
