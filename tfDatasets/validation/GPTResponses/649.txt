The Eastern Roman Empire came to be known as the Imperium Graecorum because of its heavy influence from and adoption of Greek culture, language, and traditions. Greek was the primary language spoken in the east and Greek philosophy, literature, and art were highly valued and celebrated. Even the Byzantine Emperors identified themselves as "Basileus ton Ellinon," which translates to "Emperor of the Greeks." Additionally, when the Western Roman Empire fell, the Eastern Empire continued to thrive and maintain its cultural identity, further solidifying its association with Greek culture.
