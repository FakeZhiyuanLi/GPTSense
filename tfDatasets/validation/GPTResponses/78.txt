A central part of the science of anthropology is the study of human culture, including how culture is created, transmitted, and transformed over time. Anthropologists also study the biological and social aspects of human evolution, as well as the ways in which culture shapes and is shaped by social, economic, political, and environmental factors. Other key areas of focus in anthropology include language, religion, kinship systems, social organization, and symbolic systems. Ultimately, the goal of anthropology is to provide a deep and nuanced understanding of human behavior, beliefs, and practices, in order to shed light on the fundamental nature of humanity as a species.
