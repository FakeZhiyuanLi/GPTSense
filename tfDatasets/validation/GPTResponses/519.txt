One possible design that allows wider entryways within limited space is a sliding or pocket door. These types of doors do not swing open and take up less space when opened, allowing for a wider entryway. Another option could be a pivot door, which rotates on a central hinge and can also provide a wide opening while taking up less space in the room. Additionally, using glass or transparent materials for doors or walls can give the illusion of more space and make the entryway appear wider than it actually is.
