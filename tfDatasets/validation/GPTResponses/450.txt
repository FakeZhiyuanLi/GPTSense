In Hegel's thought, both subject and object possess an inner reality that is dialectically interrelated and mutually constitutive. This inner reality is the notion of Geist or Spirit, which is a dynamic and evolving process of self-realization and self-consciousness. Geist manifests itself through the historical development of human culture, institutions, and individual consciousness. The subject-object dialectic is seen as a crucial aspect of Geist's self-realization and is manifested through the process of mutual recognition, where subject and object recognize each other as mutually dependent and interconnected aspects of a unified reality. Thus, both subject and object possess an inner reality that forms an integral part of the larger process of Geist's self-realization.
