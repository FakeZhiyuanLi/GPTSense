In the past, many disabled people were denied access to education and were often institutionalized or kept at home without any learning opportunities. It was common for schools and universities to refuse admission to students with disabilities. Even if they were allowed to enroll, they were often segregated and educated separately from non-disabled students. Special schools were established for people with disabilities, but these schools often provided a limited curriculum and few opportunities for integration into mainstream society. Additionally, access to support services, such as sign language interpreters or special equipment, was scarce.
