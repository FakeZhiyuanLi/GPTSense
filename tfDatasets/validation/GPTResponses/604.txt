Many countries have a history of biologizing race to some extent, but one of the most infamous examples is Nazi Germany, which used pseudo-scientific theories of racial superiority and inferiority to justify genocide against non-Aryan groups. Other examples include the United States, which for centuries used race-based slavery and segregation, as well as scientific racism, to justify the oppression of Black people and other minority groups, and South Africa, which implemented a system of apartheid that classified people into racial categories and gave preferential treatment to those classified as white.
