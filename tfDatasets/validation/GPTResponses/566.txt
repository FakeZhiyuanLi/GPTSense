As a result, neoclassical art was characterized by its balance, symmetry, and accuracy of form.On the other hand, baroque art was characterized by a sense of movement and dramatic emotion. Baroque artists sought to create works that were awe-inspiring, and they did this by using intense colors, exaggerated forms, and dramatic lighting. Baroque art was often grand and ornate, and it sought to overwhelm the viewer with its beauty and power.
