Muhammad experienced a physical symptom called "sweating profusely" when he received his first revelation in the Cave of Hira. This physical symptom was reported by several of his companions who were present with him at the time. Additionally, he experienced trembling, heart palpitations, and a feeling of being crushed under a heavy weight. These physical symptoms are often referred to as the "first inspiration" or "first manifestation" of the prophetic experience.
