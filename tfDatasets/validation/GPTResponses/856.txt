The primary issue with running software testing is that it can be time-consuming and costly. Testing requires a significant amount of resources, including time, staff, and equipment, which can make it difficult to scale for large projects. Additionally, testing can be complex and requires a great deal of expertise to ensure accurate and reliable results. Furthermore, even with thorough testing, it is still possible for defects and issues to arise, which can result in additional delays and costs to fix.
