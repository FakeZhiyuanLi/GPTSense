The driving force behind plate tectonics is convection currents in the mantle, caused by the heat generated within the Earth's core. These currents move the plates and cause them to collide, dive beneath one another, or move apart.Orogenesis, or the formation of mountains, is primarily caused by the collision of two tectonic plates. When two plates collide, one may be forced down and under the other in a process called subduction. This can cause molten rock to rise up and form volcanoes, or it can create pressure that can push the land up and eventually form mountains.Therefore, plate tectonics is the primary driver of orogenesis, as the collision of tectonic plates is necessary for the formation of mountains.
