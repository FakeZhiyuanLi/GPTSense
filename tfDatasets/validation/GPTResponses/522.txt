Han ships were able to be sailed in various areas, including:1. Coastal waters: The stern rudder allowed Han ships to navigate the shallow waters along the coastline, making it easier for them to dock and trade with coastal communities.2. Estuaries and rivers: The ability to maneuver using the stern rudder meant that Han ships could navigate the narrow and winding channels of rivers and estuaries, making it easier for them to transport goods and people inland.3. Open seas: The stern rudder gave Han ships greater stability and control, allowing them to navigate the often treacherous open seas with greater ease and safety.4. Port cities: The improved maneuverability of Han ships made it easier for them to navigate busy port cities and dock at crowded harbors, improving the efficiency of trade and commerce.
