The energy operator in quantum mechanics is denoted by the symbol H and is defined as:H = -((h^2/2m) * d^2/dx^2) + V(x)where h is Planck's constant, m is the mass of the particle, and V(x) is the potential energy function.The energy operator acts on the wave function of the particle or system and gives the total energy of the particle or system as an eigenvalue of the operator.In other words, the energy operator equates the full energy of a particle or system by acting on the wave function and returning a corresponding eigenvalue representing the particle or system's energy.
