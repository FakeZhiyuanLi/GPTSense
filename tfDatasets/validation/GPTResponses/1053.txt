The main current that affects Paris' weather is the North Atlantic Drift (also called the Gulf Stream), which brings warm waters and mild temperatures to the region. In addition, the prevailing westerly winds from the Atlantic Ocean can also influence the weather patterns in Paris. The city's inland location and continental climate also play a role in shaping its weather, with hot summers and cold winters.
