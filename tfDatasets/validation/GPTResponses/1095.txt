Before World War II, the population of East Prussia was predominantly ethnic German. In the 1939 census, approximately 2.5 million people were living in East Prussia, of whom around 2.4 million were ethnic Germans. This means that approximately 96% of the population in East Prussia were Germans at the time. However, after the war many Germans were expelled from the region and it is now predominantly populated by ethnic Poles and Russians.
