One type of poetry that had much influence in the Han dynasty was shi poetry, which was characterized by its use of five-character and seven-character lines and its focus on expressing detailed descriptions of natural scenes and human emotions. This type of poetry was often written by court officials and scholars and valued for its ability to convey complex ideas and emotions in a concise and elegant manner.
