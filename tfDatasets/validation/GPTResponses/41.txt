The Solvay process produces sodium carbonate (also known as soda ash) and calcium chloride from sodium chloride (common salt) and limestone. Sodium carbonate is used to make glass, paper, detergents, and other industrial products, while calcium chloride is used in road construction, de-icing, and as a food preservative.
