Christian idealism was often rooted in the philosophy of neo-Platonism, which was a blend of Platonism and Eastern philosophical ideas, including ideas from the Egyptian and Persian religions. This philosophy emphasized the existence of a higher reality beyond the physical world and sought to understand the relationship between this higher reality and earthly existence. Christian idealists often adopted these philosophical ideas to argue that God was the ultimate reality and that human existence was ultimately shaped and defined by this divine reality. They believed that the purpose of human life was to strive towards a greater understanding of God, and that this pursuit was the ultimate form of human fulfillment.
