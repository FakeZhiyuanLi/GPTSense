Sunlight is converted into electricity through a process called photovoltaic (PV) conversion, which involves the use of solar cells. Solar cells are made of semiconductor materials, typically silicon, which can absorb photons of sunlight and convert them into electrons. When sunlight hit the solar cell, the energy from the photons knocks electrons within the semiconductor material loose, allowing them to flow freely. This movement of electrons creates an electric current, which can be captured and used to power electrical devices. Solar panels containing multiple solar cells are connected in series to increase voltage and/or in parallel to increase current, which can be used to power homes, businesses, and even entire cities.
