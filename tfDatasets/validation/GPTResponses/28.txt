The development of a stateless society has been a topic of discussion for hundreds of years. However, modern theories and movements advocating for a stateless society began to emerge in the mid-to-late 19th century with the rise of anarchism as a political philosophy. Anarchist thinkers such as Mikhail Bakunin and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon proposed abolishing the state and replacing it with voluntary associations and decentralized forms of governance. In recent years, the concept of a stateless society has gained further attention with the growth of technology and decentralized systems, as well as various social and political movements advocating for greater autonomy and self-determination.
