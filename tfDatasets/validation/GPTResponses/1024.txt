The goal of unit testing is to verify and validate that individual units of code, such as functions, methods, and classes, function correctly and meet certain requirements and specifications. This is typically achieved by writing automated tests that exercise these units of code and compare their actual behavior and output to expected behavior and output. The ultimate goal is to improve software quality and reduce the likelihood of bugs and defects that could negatively impact the functionality and reliability of the software. Additionally, unit testing facilitates easier debugging and maintenance of the codebase by identifying issues early on in the development process.
