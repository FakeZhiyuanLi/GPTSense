One problem that arises for fast and large capacity elevators is the issue of safety. As elevators become faster and are able to carry more people, the risk of accidents and malfunctions also increases. Additionally, the higher speeds and weight capacities may require more complex and expensive equipment, maintenance, and regulatory procedures. Such elevators may also consume more energy and require larger and more expensive buildings to accommodate them, which may not be feasible or desirable in all contexts. Finally, fast and large capacity elevators may also cause discomfort or anxiety for some passengers, particularly those with motion sickness, claustrophobia, vertigo, or other conditions.
