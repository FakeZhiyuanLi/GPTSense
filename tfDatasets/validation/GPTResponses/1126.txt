The Polish government never officially took over the administration in East Prussia. After World War II, East Prussia was divided between the Soviet Union and Poland, with the border being determined by the Potsdam Conference in 1945. The Soviet Union administered the northern part of East Prussia, including the city of KÃ¶nigsberg (now Kaliningrad), and Poland administered the southern part. However, this was not considered an official takeover of the administration by Poland.
