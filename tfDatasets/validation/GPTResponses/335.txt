One notable subjective idealist is George Berkeley, an 18th-century philosopher who proposed that the only things that truly exist are the ideas in our minds and the minds themselves. He famously argued that objects only exist when we perceive them, and that without a perceiver, they have no existence. This philosophy is known as subjective idealism or immaterialism.
