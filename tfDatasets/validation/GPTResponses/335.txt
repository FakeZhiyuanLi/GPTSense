It is difficult to determine which specific road or schnellweg you are referring to without additional context or location information. However, generally speaking, highways or expressways (such as a schnellweg) and related roads often form a network or grid-like structure, often with interchanges or intersections connecting them. This can vary depending on the location and design of the roadways.
