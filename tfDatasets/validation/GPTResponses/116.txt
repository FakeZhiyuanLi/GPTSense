The Stoic view is a philosophical perspective, founded by the ancient Greek philosopher Zeno of Citium, which emphasizes the importance of virtue, reason, and self-control. Stoics believe that individuals should strive to live in accordance with nature and accept whatever happens to them as part of the grand scheme of things. They emphasize the importance of developing inner strength and resilience, and that happiness is achieved by cultivating a sense of inner peace and contentment, rather than by seeking external pleasures or material possessions. The Stoic view also emphasizes the importance of living in harmony with others and taking responsibility for one's actions.
