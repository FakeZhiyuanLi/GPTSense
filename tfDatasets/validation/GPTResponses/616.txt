Most elevators built before 1939 were powered by steam or hydraulic systems. The steam-powered elevators used a boiler to create steam, which was then used to power the elevator's hydraulic pump. Hydraulic elevators used a piston to lift the car, which was powered by an electric motor or an oil-fueled hydraulic pump. Both systems required a machine room to house the machinery used to power the elevator.
