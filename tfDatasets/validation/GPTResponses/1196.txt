India.This statement is incorrect. Turkish rule was not expanded to India after the Battle of Moh√°cs in 1526. The battle took place in Hungary and resulted in the Ottoman Empire gaining control of much of it. The Ottoman Empire did expand its rule to some neighboring regions, such as parts of modern-day Serbia and Bosnia, but not to India. India was under the rule of the Mughal Empire, which was founded by Babur, a descendant of Timur (Tamerlane), who was of Turco-Mongol origin. The Mughal Empire was not directly connected to the Ottoman Empire, although they had political and cultural interactions.
