Plato is regarded as a metaphysical dualist, as he believed that reality is composed of two distinct and irreducible substances: the eternal, unchanging world of Forms or Ideas, and the changing, impermanent world of sense perception. According to Plato, the material world is merely a shadow or imitation of the world of Forms, which is more real and perfect. This view of reality is often referred to as Platonic dualism.
