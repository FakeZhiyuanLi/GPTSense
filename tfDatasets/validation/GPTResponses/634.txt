Secondary education typically consists of grades 9-12 in high schools or secondary schools. It is a stage of education that follows primary education and prepares students for higher education or employment. Some of the subjects that are covered in secondary education include English, mathematics, science, social studies, foreign languages, and physical education. In addition to academic subjects, secondary education also includes a range of extracurricular activities, including sports, clubs, and organizations that help students develop social skills and talents beyond the classroom.
