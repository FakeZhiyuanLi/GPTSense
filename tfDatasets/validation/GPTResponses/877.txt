The attribute of a substance in the context of chemistry as a consequence of its atomic, molecular or aggregate structure is its chemical and physical properties. Chemical properties include its reactivity, chemical composition, and ability to undergo chemical reactions. Physical properties include its melting point, boiling point, density, color, and texture. The structure of a substance also plays a significant role in determining its properties, as the arrangement of atoms, molecules, or aggregates can affect its stability, solubility, hardness, and conductivity.
