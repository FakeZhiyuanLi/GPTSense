There isn't a single event or circumstance that led to the alliance between France and the Ottoman Empire. Throughout history, the two powers had periods of cooperation and conflict. However, some notable moments of collaboration include the Franco-Ottoman alliance of 1536, which aimed to limit the power of the Habsburg Empire in Europe, and Napoleon's invasion of Egypt in 1798, which established a temporary French presence in the Ottoman Empire. Ultimately, the two powers united against their common enemies, which sometimes included other European nations, as well as various non-European powers.
