The Orthodox Church was allowed to keep its autonomy and self-governance, as well as its properties and wealth. In addition, the Ottoman Empire recognized the Ecumenical Patriarch as the spiritual leader of all Orthodox Christians, which gave the Church considerable influence and power. However, the Church was also required to pay taxes to the Ottoman authorities and comply with their laws and regulations.
