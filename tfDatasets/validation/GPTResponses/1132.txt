There is no consensus among scholars about who made this claim, as it is a controversial topic. Some scholars believe that early Christian and Jewish communities in Arabia may have been exposed to the teachings of the Quran before its formal codification, and that they may have had some influence on its development. However, others point out that there is little concrete evidence to support these claims, and that they may be based more on speculation than on historical fact. Ultimately, the question of whether Christians and Jews had heard and discussed the Quran before its standardized Arabic form remains a matter of debate among scholars.
