A naginata is a Japanese weapon that is similar to a long polearm or halberd. It consists of a wooden shaft with a curved blade, typically around 30cm in length, attached to the end. The naginata was traditionally used by women in feudal Japan as a self-defense weapon, and later became popular among samurai warriors during battle. Its design allowed for effective long-distance attacks and provided a measure of safety from an opponent's sword. Today, naginata is still practiced as a martial art in Japan.
