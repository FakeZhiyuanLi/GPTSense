There have been many financial crises throughout history, but two recent ones that are often referred to are:1) The Global Financial Crisis of 2008 - this was brought on by a housing market collapse in the United States and had wide-reaching global impacts.2) The European Debt Crisis of 2010-2012 - this was a result of a number of factors including excessive government spending, banking system failures, and high levels of sovereign debt in certain eurozone countries.
