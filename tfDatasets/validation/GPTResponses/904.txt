An example of a solar-mediated weather event is a solar storm or coronal mass ejection (CME) causing geomagnetic storms. These storms occur when the Earth's magnetic field interacts with charged particles from the Sun's corona. Solar flares can also cause changes in the Earth's ionosphere, affecting communication and navigation systems. Additionally, changes in solar radiation can affect the Earth's climate over the long term.
