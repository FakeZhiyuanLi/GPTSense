It is difficult to give a specific number for the amount of human genetic diversity in a single African population, as genetic diversity can vary depending on factors such as geography, migration patterns, and historical events. However, it is widely accepted that African populations have the highest genetic diversity of any human populations, due in part to their status as the oldest and most genetically diverse continent. This diversity is also compounded by the fact that many African populations have historically been isolated from one another, leading to distinct genetic lineages and variations. Overall, African populations are estimated to have around 18-27% more genetic variation than populations in other parts of the world.
