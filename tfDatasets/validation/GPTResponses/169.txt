John Locke's concept of "tabula rasa" means that the mind is a blank slate at birth and all knowledge and ideas are acquired through sensory experiences. According to this concept, the mind does not have innate ideas, but rather ideas are gained from the external world through the senses. This means that the mind is shaped by experiences and observations, rather than being predetermined by nature. Therefore, a person's beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors are influenced by their environment and experiences.
