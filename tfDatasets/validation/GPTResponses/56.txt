The energy stored by pumped-storage hydroelectricity is recovered by releasing the stored water from the upper reservoir and allowing it to flow through a turbine, which generates electricity. This process is the same as a traditional hydroelectric power plant, except that the water is initially pumped uphill during times of low demand and excess energy, and then released downhill during peak demand periods when energy is needed. This helps balance the grid and ensure a constant supply of electricity. Once the water has passed through the turbine, it is captured in the lower reservoir and can be pumped uphill again to repeat the cycle.
