James' pragmatism and radical empiricism were intertwined in his epistemological views. Pragmatism emphasized the practical consequences of beliefs and ideas, while radical empiricism stressed the importance of sensory experience as the only source of knowledge. James believed that these two ideas were complementary and that they could work together to create a more thorough understanding of reality. For James, truth was verified through experience, and that experience should be applied in practical ways to improve the world. His combination of these two theories helped shape his approach to psychology and philosophy, emphasizing the importance of both logical analysis and experiential evidence.
