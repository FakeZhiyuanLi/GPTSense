Ren√© Descartes was a French philosopher and mathematician who is widely regarded as the founder of modern philosophy. He is often referred to as a rationalist philosopher because he believed that knowledge could be gained through reason and logical deduction rather than solely through experience. His philosophical works, such as Meditations on First Philosophy, were influential in the development of epistemology and metaphysics. Descartes' famous statement "I think, therefore I am" is an illustration of his philosophical method of doubt and his emphasis on the mind as the source of certain knowledge.
