Pearson did not make any specific claim about what science classifies. It is important to note that Pearson is a publishing and education company that provides educational materials and resources, including science textbooks and curriculum, but does not develop or dictate the scientific classification system. Scientific classification systems are developed by the scientific community based on empirical evidence and are subject to change as new discoveries are made.
