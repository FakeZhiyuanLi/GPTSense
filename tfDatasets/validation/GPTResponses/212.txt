Individuals who are infected with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) and have a weakened immune system or symptoms of AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) may receive retroviral coverage. Retroviral therapy involves taking antiretroviral drugs to suppress the virus and prevent it from replicating, which can help improve immune function and reduce the risk of developing opportunistic infections. Retroviral coverage may be provided by health insurance plans, government programs, or other sources of funding for HIV/AIDS treatment.
