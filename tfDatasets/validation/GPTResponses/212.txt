David Hume argued that causation cannot be rationally justified. He claimed that our belief in causation is based on subjective experience rather than any logical necessity or empirical evidence. According to Hume, we observe regularities or patterns in the world and assume that one event causes another, but we cannot prove that causation actually exists. Hume believed that we must accept causation as a matter of habit or custom rather than rational justification.
