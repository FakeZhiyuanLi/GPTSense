are called "combination" or "dual" elevators. These elevators typically have a larger interior than standard passenger elevators, and may have additional safety features such as reinforced walls, and sturdy doors and gates to protect both passengers and cargo. They may also have separate controls for selecting different levels of access or stopping at designated floors for either freight or passengers.
