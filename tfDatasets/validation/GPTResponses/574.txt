It may reduce the risk of one rope breaking or becoming significantly weaker than the others, which could cause an imbalance and potentially lead to a collapse or failure of the system. It also ensures that the load is distributed evenly among the ropes, reducing the wear and tear on individual ropes and prolonging their lifespan. Overall, maintaining equal tension in the ropes helps to ensure the safety and efficiency of the system.
