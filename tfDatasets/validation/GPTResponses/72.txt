Evolutionary anthropology concerns itself with the biological and cultural evolution of all humans, past and present. This includes not only modern humans, but also extinct human ancestors such as Homo erectus, Homo neanderthalensis, and Homo habilis. Evolutionary anthropology also considers the diversity of cultural practices and beliefs among contemporary human societies.
