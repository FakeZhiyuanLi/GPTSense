Development testing is used during the software development process to ensure that the software meets the specified requirements, functions properly, and is free from defects or errors. It is done throughout the development cycle, from the initial design phase to the final release. Development testing helps to identify and fix issues early in the development process, which saves time, reduces costs, and improves overall quality. It is essential to use development testing in agile software development environments, where software is developed iteratively and delivered frequently.
