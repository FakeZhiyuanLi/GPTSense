The brain is surrounded by the meninges, which are a system of three membranes that separate and protect the brain and spinal cord from the skull and vertebrae. The three layers of the meninges are called the dura mater, arachnoid mater, and pia mater. The meninges also protect the cerebrospinal fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord.
