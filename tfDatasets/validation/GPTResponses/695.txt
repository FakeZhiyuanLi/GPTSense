Informal learning can be defined by several individuals or organizations. However, the most widely accepted definition is provided by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which defines informal learning as "any learning that is not organized or structured in terms of objectives, time, duration, or content and typically involves learning from experience, interacting with others, and unstructured and self-directed learning activities." Other experts in the field of education also provide their own definitions of informal learning, including Jay Cross, Jane Hart, and Harold Jarche, to name a few.
