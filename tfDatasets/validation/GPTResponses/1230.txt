The Treaty of Karlowitz (also known as Treaty of Karlovci) was signed on January 26, 1699. It ended the Austro-Turkish War of 1683-1697 and marked the first significant defeat of the Ottoman Empire in almost two hundred years. The treaty resulted in territorial losses for the Ottoman Empire in eastern Europe and granted more autonomy to the Romanian principalities.
