people eat and their health. Changes in access to food can lead to food insecurity, malnutrition, and health problems. For example, if a community experiences climate change that disrupts local agriculture, people may have less access to fresh produce and more reliance on processed foods, which can lead to higher rates of obesity, diabetes, and other health issues. Additionally, changes in food availability can also have social and economic consequences, such as higher food prices and unequal distribution of resources, which can further exacerbate disparities in health outcomes.
