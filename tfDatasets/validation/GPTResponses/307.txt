In medieval times, a commandery was typically overseen by a commander. This individual was a member of a military order or a religious order and was responsible for managing the affairs of the commandery, including its finances, logistics, and defense. The commander was often a highly respected and skilled leader who had proven themselves in battle or in the service of their religious order. They were also responsible for enforcing the rules and regulations of the order and maintaining discipline among its members.
