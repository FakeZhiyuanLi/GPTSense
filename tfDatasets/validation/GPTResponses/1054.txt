It is difficult to determine specifically what was lost in Prussia's history during the plague as historical records were often destroyed or lost during the chaos and devastation of the outbreak. However, it is likely that significant cultural, economic, and social changes occurred in Prussia as a result of the plague, including population losses, changes in trade and commerce, and shifts in political and social structures. Additionally, knowledge and understanding of the outbreak itself may have been lost or distorted over time.
