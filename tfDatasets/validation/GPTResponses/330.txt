to be considered a distinct population. Specifically, the 75% rule states that if at least 75% of individuals in a population can be distinguished from individuals in other populations based on a set of traits or genetic markers, then that population can be considered a distinct population. This helps to identify and study population structure and genetic diversity within a species, which can be important for conservation efforts and understanding evolutionary processes.
