Fallibilism is the philosophical belief that humans can never know anything with absolute certainty, and that all knowledge is subject to doubt and error. According to fallibilism, even the most well-established scientific theories or beliefs may be proven wrong or revised in the future based on new evidence or discovery. It encourages ongoing inquiry, skepticism, and critical thinking in pursuit of knowledge.
