Allopatric populations are separated by physical barriers like mountains, rivers, seas or other geographical factors that prevent the free flow of gene between the two populations. Other factors that can cause geographic isolation and separation between allopatric populations include climate changes or natural disasters that produce new islands or disrupt land masses. Over time, the two populations can evolve in different ways as they experience different selective pressures, genetic drift, mutation and gene flow. This process can eventually cause the two populations to become so genetically different that they can no longer interbreed and produce viable offspring.
