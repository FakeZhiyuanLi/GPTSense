Some examples of elevators that occasionally do not use a traditional elevator shaft, machine room, or hoistway are:- Pneumatic elevators: these use air pressure to move the elevator car up and down within a self-supporting tube.- Cable-free elevators: these use magnetic levitation technology to lift and lower the elevator car without traditional cables.- Inclined elevators: these are elevators that travel along a sloped track, often used in hilly or mountainous areas.- Portable elevators: these are temporary elevators that can be assembled and disassembled quickly and easily, often used in construction sites or events.
