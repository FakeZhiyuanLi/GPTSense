In the case of a chemical explosion, the potential energy stored in the chemical bonds is transformed into kinetic energy and thermal energy in a very short time. As the chemical reaction occurs, the molecules of the explosive material rapidly break apart, releasing a large amount of energy in the form of heat and expanding gases. This sudden release of energy creates a shock wave that results in the rapid displacement of air molecules, which generates kinetic energy. The thermal energy produced by the explosion contributes to the high temperatures generated by the reaction, which can cause fires and burn injuries.
