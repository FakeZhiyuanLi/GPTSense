Commercial elevators typically use sliding or swinging doors, similar to the doors in a typical building. These doors are typically made of metal or glass, and are designed to withstand heavy traffic and frequent use. Some commercial elevators may also use automatic doors, which open and close automatically when the elevator reaches a particular floor.
