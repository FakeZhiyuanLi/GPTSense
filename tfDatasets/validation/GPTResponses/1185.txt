The size and extent of their territory or empire was often used as a criteria to judge a great power's status in early times. The larger the territory and more extensive the empire, the more powerful and influential the nation was considered to be. This was especially true during the age of colonialism and imperialism when European powers were competing to acquire colonies and expand their empires.
