Anyone can become an autodidact at any time. There is no specific age or requirement to become an autodidact. Anyone can choose to take the initiative to learn new skills and acquire knowledge on their own without formal instruction. However, becoming an autodidact requires discipline, self-motivation, and a willingness to put in the time and effort necessary to learn and grow independently.
