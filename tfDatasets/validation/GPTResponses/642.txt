The Byzantine Empire was founded in 324 AD by the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great. The empire was strongly influenced by Greek culture from the beginning, but it was not until the reign of Emperor Justinian I (527-565 AD) that the Byzantine Empire fully embraced Greek culture and language. Justinian codified Roman law, sponsored Greek scholarship, and rebuilt the city of Constantinople in the Greek imperial style. From that point on, the Byzantine Empire was seen as a continuation of the Greek civilization that had preceded it.
