The Yuan dynasty (1271-1368) attempted to invade Japan twice, in 1274 and 1281. The first invasion involved a force of approximately 15,000-40,000 troops, while the second invasion involved a much larger force of over 100,000 troops. However, both invasions were ultimately unsuccessful due to a combination of bad weather, strategic defeats, and the samurai warriors' resistance.
