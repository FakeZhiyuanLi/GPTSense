Planting windbreaks, such as trees or shrubs, around the perimeter of the crop field can help insulate the crops from strong winds. In addition, using sturdy supports, such as stakes or trellises, can also help crops withstand wind. Proper irrigation and soil management can also help crops root more deeply and become more resilient to wind damage.
