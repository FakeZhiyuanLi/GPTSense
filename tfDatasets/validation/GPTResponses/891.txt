Here are some commonly used techniques during dynamic testing:1. Unit testing: It involves testing individual units or modules of software to ensure that they function as intended.2. Integration testing: It verifies that software modules work together correctly to achieve the expected results.3. System testing: It involves testing the entire software system as a whole.4. Regression testing: It retests changes made to software to ensure that existing functionality still works as expected.5. Acceptance testing: It verifies that the software meets the customer’s requirements and is ready for deployment.6. Performance testing: It involves testing the software’s ability to perform under a specific workload or usage scenario.7. Usability testing: It checks whether the software is easy to use and intuitive for end-users.8. Security testing: It evaluates the software’s ability to resist unauthorized access, attacks, and other security threats.
