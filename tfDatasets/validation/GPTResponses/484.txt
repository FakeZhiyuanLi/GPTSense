The traction of a vehicle is controlled by a combination of factors including the type and quality of the tires, the weight distribution of the vehicle, the driving conditions such as road surface and weather, and the control systems such as stability control and traction control. These factors all work together to regulate the amount of power that is applied to the tires in order to provide the necessary traction for safe and effective driving.
