Forensic anthropologists draw on various morphological features to identify human remains, including:1. Skull and facial features, such as the shape and size of the cranium, maxilla, mandible, and teeth.2. Postcranial features, including the shape, size, and configuration of long bones, vertebrae, and ribs.3. The presence or absence of specific anatomical structures, such as carpal and tarsal bones, sesamoid bones, and accessory ossicles.4. The degree of fusion of skeletal elements, such as the ossification of cranial sutures and the fusion of epiphyses with long bones.5. The possible presence of pathological features, such as fractures, lesions, arthritis, or congenital abnormalities.6. The characteristics of soft tissue, such as skin, hair, and soft tissue wounds, that may aid in facial reconstruction and identification.Overall, forensic anthropologists rely on a detailed analysis of multiple morphological features to establish the identity, age, sex, race, stature, and potential cause of death of a deceased individual.
