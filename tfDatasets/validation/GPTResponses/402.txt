A parity bit is a single bit that is appended to a data character to allow for error checking. It is used to detect whether the transmission of data was successful or whether any bit of the transmitted data was changed or lost during transmission. The parity bit is calculated by counting the number of 1-bits in the data character and adding a 0 or 1 bit to make the total number of 1-bits even or odd. This technique is known as an even or odd parity check. The use of modern communication systems and advancements in digital electronics made it possible to implement this technique to detect errors in data transmission.
