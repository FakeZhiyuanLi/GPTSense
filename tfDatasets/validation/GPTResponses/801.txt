Douglas J. Futuyma, a biologist and evolutionary theorist, considered the concept of race as not only being socially dysfunctional but also biologically meaningless. He argued that the genetic differences between individuals of different races are very small compared to the genetic differences within each race, and that the concept of race has been used historically to justify discrimination, oppression, and genocide. Futuyma suggested that instead of focusing on race, we should acknowledge and celebrate the diversity and complexity of human genetic and cultural variation.
