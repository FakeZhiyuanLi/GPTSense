Stage lifts can be powered by various mechanisms such as hydraulic, electric, or pneumatic systems. Hydraulic lifts use pressurized fluid to lift and lower the stage. Electric lifts use motors to power the lift mechanism, and pneumatic lifts use compressed air to power the lift. The power source typically depends on the size and weight of the stage and the specific requirements of the venue.
