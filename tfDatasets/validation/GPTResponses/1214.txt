In 1488, the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias discovered a sea route around the southern tip of Africa, known as the Cape of Good Hope. This discovery opened up new opportunities for trade with India and other parts of Asia, and paved the way for future exploration and colonization by European powers in Africa.
