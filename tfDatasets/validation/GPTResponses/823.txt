Nuclear potential energy can be transformed into other forms of energy through various processes such as nuclear fission, nuclear fusion, radioactive decay, and nuclear isomerism. These processes involve breaking apart or combining atomic nuclei, which releases energy in the form of heat, light, and kinetic energy. This energy can then be converted into other forms such as electrical energy, mechanical energy, or chemical energy, depending on the method of conversion.
