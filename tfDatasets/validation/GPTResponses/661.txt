The new library that illustrates the traditional style of neoclassicism is the Jefferson Building of the Library of Congress in Washington D.C. It was designed by architect John L. Smithmeyer and completed in 1897. The building features a grand entrance with a massive pediment supported by columns, as well as ornate decorations and sculptures throughout the interior. Its design is meant to evoke the grandeur and symmetry of ancient Greek and Roman architecture, which was a hallmark of neoclassical style.
