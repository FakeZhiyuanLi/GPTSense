Our current idea of race came about during the process of European exploration and colonization of other parts of the world, particularly during the 15th and 16th centuries. European settlers encountered people who looked different and had different cultures, religions, and customs. They used physical characteristics such as skin color, hair texture, facial features, and body shape to categorize and define human differences. These categories were based on the assumption that certain physical traits corresponded to certain psychological, intellectual, and moral characteristics, leading to the development of racist ideologies that justified the exploitation and subjugation of non-white peoples. The concept of race was then institutionalized through slavery, colonialism, and scientific racism, and continues to shape social attitudes and political policies to this day.
