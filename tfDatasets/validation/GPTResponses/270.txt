There isn't a single person who can be said to have abandoned phenomenalism since it is a philosophical movement that has evolved over time and has been criticized and rejected by various thinkers. However, some notable philosophers who have criticized or abandoned phenomenalism include Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein, W.V. Quine, and Willard Van Orman Quine. Russell moved away from his earlier views on phenomenalism, arguing that sense data cannot be the ultimate ground of all knowledge. Wittgenstein's later philosophy also rejected phenomenalism, and he criticized the idea that language and experience could be reduced to a private, subjective realm. Quine and Van Orman Quine were also influential critics of phenomenalism, arguing that the positivist approach to meaning and knowledge was fundamentally flawed.  So, there are several philosophers who have abandoned and criticized phenomenalism over time.
