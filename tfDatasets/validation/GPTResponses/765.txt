Educational psychology is concerned with the study of learning and development, including the various factors that influence them. Educational psychologists employ theories and methods from psychology to understand how individuals acquire knowledge, skills, and attitudes, and how the learning process can be optimized. They may explore issues such as cognition, motivation, memory, and socialization, and consider how these factors relate to academic achievement and other outcomes. Educational psychology may also involve the development and implementation of interventions and tools designed to support learning and growth in educational settings.
