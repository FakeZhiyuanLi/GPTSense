a single region?A regional power restricted to a single region would have limited influence and impact outside of that region. Its scope would primarily be focused on the internal affairs of the region - such as economic development, governance, security, and social welfare. The power may have some minor influence in neighboring regions, but its ability to project its power internationally would be limited. The success of the regional power would depend on its ability to effectively manage and utilize the resources within its region and to maintain stable relationships with neighboring regions and countries.
