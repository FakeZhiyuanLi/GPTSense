One objective of Turkey after its expansion into the Balkans was to establish control over the region and integrate it into the Ottoman Empire. This included subduing rebellious groups and converting them to Islam, imposing Turkish culture and language, and extracting resources and taxes from the conquered territories. Additionally, the Ottoman Empire sought to extend its influence and power in Europe, and the Balkans were seen as a strategic gateway to the continent.
