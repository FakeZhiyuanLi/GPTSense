The scientist who shared Leibniz's view that thermal energy consisted of random motion of the constituent parts of matter was Rudolf Clausius. He developed the kinetic theory of gases, which explained the physical properties of gases in terms of the motion of their constituent particles. His work helped to establish the fundamental principles of thermodynamics, and he is often referred to as the father of thermodynamics.
