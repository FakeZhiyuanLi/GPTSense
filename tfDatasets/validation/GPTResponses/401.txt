The Heiji Rebellion (or Heiji no Ran) was a civil war that took place in Japan in 1160. The rebellion was fought between two clans, the Taira (also known as the Heike) and the Minamoto (also known as Genji). The Taira were the ruling clan at the time, and the Minamoto were a powerful and influential clan who were seeking to overthrow them.
