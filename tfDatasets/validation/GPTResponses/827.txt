The official dialect of Greeks is Standard Modern Greek or Dimotiki. It was established as the official standard in the 1970s in Greece. However, it is missing some features that were present in earlier forms of Greek, such as the Katharevousa dialect. Dimotiki is a simplified version of Greek, lacking some of the complexities of earlier dialects. It is also missing a lot of the archaic vocabulary and forms of early Greek. Additionally, Dimotiki has some differences in pronunciation and grammar compared to other forms of Greek, which can make it difficult for speakers of other dialects to understand.
