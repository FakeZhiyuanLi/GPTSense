Samurais sometimes had strong personal beliefs and values that conflicted with the orders of their daimyo. In some cases, samurais put their own values above their loyalty to their daimyo and chose to disobey their orders, often resulting in severe consequences. Additionally, power struggles and political tensions within the daimyo's court could also cause samurais to prioritize their own interests over their loyalty to their daimyo. Lastly, some samurais were motivated by a sense of honor and duty to protect the people they were sworn to serve, even if it meant going against their daimyo's wishes.
