One way to implement destination control is to use an elevator control system that allows passengers to input their desired floor before they enter the elevator. This information is then used to direct the passenger to the appropriate elevator car, which will only stop at floors requested by passengers within the same group. This reduces waiting and travel times, increases efficiency, and ensures a smoother and more pleasant passenger experience. Another way to implement destination control is to install access control systems that require passengers to use an access card before accessing each elevator, so that the system can track their desired floor and manage elevator usage.
