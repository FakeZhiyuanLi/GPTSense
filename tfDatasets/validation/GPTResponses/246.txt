There is no precise answer to this question, as "Suez Syndrome" may refer to different things in different contexts. However, the term is likely derived from the Suez Crisis of 1956, which saw British, French, and Israeli forces invade Egypt in an attempt to regain control of the Suez Canal. The crisis was a turning point in British and French imperial power, and led to a sense of national embarrassment and betrayal among some citizens in those countries. As such, "Suez Syndrome" may refer to a tendency to overestimate one's national power or influence, and a reluctance to engage in international conflicts or interventions as a result of perceived past failures.
