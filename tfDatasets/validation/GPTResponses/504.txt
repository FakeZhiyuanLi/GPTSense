According to Hegel, if something transcends time, it also transcends space and the limitations of physical existence. In his philosophical system, the Absolute Spirit is the ultimate reality and source of all being, which exists beyond the material world and is not subject to the limitations of time or space. Therefore, anything that transcends time is seen as a manifestation of the Absolute, and thus is not bound by the finite limitations of the physical world.
