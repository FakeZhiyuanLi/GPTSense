The first act to break through in the UK not from Liverpool or managed by Brian Epstein was The Rolling Stones. They emerged in 1962, the same year as The Beatles, and quickly gained a following with their bluesy rock and roll sound. Their debut single, "Come On", reached number 21 on the UK singles chart and was followed by a string of hits including "Satisfaction" and "Paint It Black". The Rolling Stones went on to become one of the most successful bands in music history, with a career spanning over five decades.
