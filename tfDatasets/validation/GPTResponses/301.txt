The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), adopted in 2007, recognizes the rights of indigenous peoples to their traditional lands, territories, and resources. It calls for states to ensure that indigenous peoples can exercise their rights to own, develop, and control their lands and resources, and to consult and cooperate with indigenous peoples in matters that affect their lands and resources.
