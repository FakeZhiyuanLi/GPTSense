A shifted code is a code where each symbol is shifted by a certain amount (usually a fixed number) from its original position in the alphabet. The difference between a shifted code and the original code is that the symbols are rearranged in a different order, resulting in a different set of characters. For example, a Caesar cipher is a famous example of a shifted code where each letter is shifted by three positions in the alphabet. In the original code, A corresponds to 1, B corresponds to 2, and so on. In the shifted code, A now corresponds to D, B corresponds to E, and so on.
