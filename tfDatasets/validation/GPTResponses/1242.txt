This included operas, operettas, and popular songs that were influenced by the trends of the time, such as Romanticism and Impressionism. The music was often light and cheerful, with catchy melodies and witty lyrics. Some of the most famous composers of the Belle Époque era include Jacques Offenbach, Charles Gounod, and Jules Massenet.
