The merging of superstitious beliefs and scientific ones regarding group differences produced various negative consequences, such as the perpetuation of stereotypes, discrimination, and prejudice against certain groups. The notion of scientific racism, for instance, was used to justify social hierarchies based on alleged biological, cultural, or psychological differences between races. This led to the mistreatment, exploitation, and marginalization of minority groups, as well as the repression of dissenting views or evidence that contradicted these beliefs. Moreover, by ignoring or neglecting the social, historical, and political factors that contribute to group differences, these approaches reinforced the idea of fixed and immutable categories of identity, instead of acknowledging the fluid and complex nature of human diversity.
