The official dialect of worship for the traditional sect of church worshipers in Greece is called Κοινὴ Εκκλησιαστικὴ ᾿Ελληνική (Koine Ecclesiastike Elliniki), also known as Byzantine Greek. This dialect has been in use since the Byzantine era and is still used in Greek Orthodox Church services to this day. It is known for its rich liturgical language, which includes a range of hymns, prayers, and other religious texts.
