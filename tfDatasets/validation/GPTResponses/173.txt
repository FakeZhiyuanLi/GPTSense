There are different historical accounts of how Liang Ji died, but most sources agree that he was executed for conspiracy and treason against the Han dynasty in 186 CE.According to the Records of the Three Kingdoms, Liang Ji was accused by his political rival, Han Sui, of collaborating with the Xiongnu tribes in northern China to overthrow the Han court. Han Sui's accusation of treason was supported by other officials and generals who were also dissatisfied with Liang Ji's abuse of power and corruption.Emperor Ling of Han ordered an investigation into the allegations and found enough evidence to convict Liang Ji. He was stripped of his rank and titles and sentenced to execution by dismemberment.Some sources suggest that Liang Ji attempted to commit suicide by drinking poison before his sentence was carried out, but others claim that he was dragged out of his cell and executed in public, while his family members were also punished. The exact details of Liang Ji's death remain unclear, but his downfall serves as a cautionary tale of the consequences of abusing political power and engaging in treasonous activities.
