One notable realistic personal theist is Alvin Plantinga, an American philosopher and professor emeritus at the University of Notre Dame. He is known for his contributions to the philosophy of religion, particularly his defense of theism against naturalistic objections. He argues that belief in God can be rational and justified, and that naturalism fails to account for certain aspects of human experience, such as consciousness and moral values. Plantinga is also known for his work on epistemology, particularly his formulation of a theory of knowledge called "properly basic beliefs."
