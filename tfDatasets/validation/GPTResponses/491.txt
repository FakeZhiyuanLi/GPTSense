The first elevator shaft was likely built before the first elevator. Elevator shafts were commonly built in taller buildings for use with manual pulley systems or hydraulic lifts before the invention of electric elevators in the late 19th century. The first known reference to an elevator shaft dates back to the Roman Empire, suggesting that elevators were likely in use in some form for centuries before the first modern elevator was invented.
