In ancient Greek society, the wealthy class was composed of aristocrats, landowners, and merchants. The aristocracy, who were the descendants of the ancient ruling families, held the most wealth and power. They owned vast amounts of land, controlled resources, and were in charge of most of the government positions. The merchants and landowners, who were involved in trade and commerce, also held significant wealth and were influential members of society.
