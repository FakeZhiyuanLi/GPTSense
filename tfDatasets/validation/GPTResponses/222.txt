For some people, religion or belief systems were considered to be more important than serving the local government. They believed that their faith and values should guide their actions and decisions, even if it meant going against government policies or laws. Some examples of this can be seen in religious communities that prioritize their own religious laws over those of the government, such as the Amish or some conservative Muslim groups. Additionally, some individuals prioritize personal or family interests over serving the government, such as business owners or those caring for sick or elderly loved ones.
