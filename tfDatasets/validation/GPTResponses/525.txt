Elevator doors protect riders from falling or accidentally stepping into the open elevator shaft. They also prevent objects or people from entering the elevator car or shaft when it is in motion or not at the designated floor. Additionally, elevator doors provide a barrier between the riders and any potential hazards or dangers outside of the elevator car, such as fire or smoke.
