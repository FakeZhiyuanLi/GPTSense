There are several concerns that arise when a lifting cylinder leaks fluid into the ground:1) Environmental damage: The leaked hydraulic fluid can contaminate the soil, water sources, and can have adverse effects on the plant and aquatic life.2) Legal issues: If the lift is in public areas, leaking hydraulic fluid can lead to legal issues as it can be considered a violation of environmental regulations.3) Safety hazards: The leaked fluid can create slippery surfaces, which can cause accidents.4) Cost implications: Hydraulic fluid is expensive, and continuous leakage can lead to added maintenance costs.5) Negative impact on the equipment: Continuous fluid leakage from the lifting cylinder can negatively affect the performance of the equipment and lead to expensive repairs.6) Reputation: Repeated leakage incidents can harm the company's reputation, and loss of client's trust.
