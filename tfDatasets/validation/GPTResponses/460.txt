By the mid 18th century, neoclassical architecture was influenced by the enlightenment movement and its ideas of reason, logic, and rationality. This led to a greater emphasis on symmetry and proportion in the design of buildings. Additionally, the discovery of ancient ruins such as Pompeii and Herculaneum sparked a renewed interest in classical architecture and resulted in the incorporation of elements such as columns, pediments, and friezes into neoclassical designs. The growing popularity of landscape design also influenced neoclassical architecture, with buildings being designed to complement their surroundings and create a harmonious relationship between the built environment and nature. Finally, the rise of industrialization led to new building materials and techniques which allowed for larger, more ambitious structures to be constructed, resulting in the development of grand monuments and public buildings.
