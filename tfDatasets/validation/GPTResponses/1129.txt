The group of Quran copyists known as the "Mashhadi-Husseini" produced some of the most in-demand manuscripts. They were active in the 18th and 19th centuries in what is now Iran and Iraq, and their copies were known for their exceptional calligraphy and decoration. Many of their manuscripts are considered masterpieces of Islamic art and are highly valued by collectors and museums around the world.
