A compensation system that uses chains is typically guided by job hierarchy, where each job role is assigned a specific grade or level based on factors such as skill level, experience, and job responsibilities. The chain is guided by a predetermined pay scale that reflects these different job levels, with higher-level jobs generally earning more money than lower-level ones. The compensation system may also take into account factors such as performance, market rates, and cost of living adjustments. Ultimately, the goal is to create a fair and equitable system that rewards employees appropriately for their contributions to the organization.
