European art music, also known as classical music, is primarily composed using traditional Western music notation and generally adheres to a set of rules and structures such as tonality, harmony, and form. It is often performed by trained musicians using instruments such as the piano, violin, or symphony orchestra.In contrast, non-European music includes music from other cultural traditions such as Indian classical music, African drumming, and Middle Eastern music. These forms of music are based on cultural and regional traditions and may not use Western notation or adhere to European classical music structure.Popular music, on the other hand, is generally created for mass consumption and is aimed at a broad audience. It includes genres such as rock, pop, hip hop, and country music, and often incorporates elements of other musical styles. Popular music is often associated with commercial success and often features more relatable lyrics than classical music.Overall, the major differences between these types of music lie in their cultural traditions, styles, instruments, and structures used in their composition and performance.
