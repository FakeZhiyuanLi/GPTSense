There are several chromosome sequences that are used to study ancient human migration paths, including mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and the Y chromosome. MtDNA is passed down only maternally, so it can reveal information about the maternal lineage of a population. The Y chromosome, on the other hand, is only passed down paternally and can reveal information about the paternal lineage of a population. Both of these sequences can be used to study ancient human migration patterns and genetic diversity.
