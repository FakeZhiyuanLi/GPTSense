It is difficult to give an exact number as it varies depending on the time period and what is considered a "great power," but there have been significant military conflicts between great powers throughout history. For example, in the 20th century alone, there were two world wars and the Cold War period which spanned several decades. Thus, it is safe to say that there have been several years where one great power fought against another on an annual basis.
