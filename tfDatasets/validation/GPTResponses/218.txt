Racial social constructs develop within historical, cultural, and societal contexts. They are shaped by cultural beliefs, political events, social interactions, and economic structures. For example, the racial social constructs of Black Americans in the United States were shaped by the history of slavery and segregation, Jim Crow laws, the Civil Rights Movement, and continuing systemic racism today. Similarly, the racial social constructs of Indigenous peoples in various countries may be influenced by colonialism, land theft, and cultural erasure. The context in which racial social constructs develop is complex and multifaceted, and can vary significantly across different cultures and historical periods.
