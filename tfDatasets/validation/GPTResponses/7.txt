In parliamentary procedures, debates are generally initiated by the chairperson or presiding officer who opens the floor for discussion. However, in legislative bodies, debates could also be initiated by members who introduce a bill or resolution for consideration. Additionally, in some forums, designated spokespersons or representatives of different groups or parties may also be given the opportunity to open debates.
