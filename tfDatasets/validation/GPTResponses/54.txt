Cultural anthropology originated as a sub-focus group within the discipline of anthropology. It first emerged as a separate field from physical anthropology in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Cultural anthropology focuses on the study of human societies, cultures, beliefs, and practices, and how they differ and evolve over time.
