One way that vegetarians and vegans obtain zinc is by consuming plant-based sources of zinc, such as legumes (e.g. lentils, chickpeas), nuts and seeds (e.g. pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds), whole grains (e.g. quinoa, brown rice) and some vegetables (e.g. spinach, kale). They can also take zinc supplements if needed.
