Pseudoproblems are issues or questions that are phrased in a way that appears to be significant, but are actually based on inaccurate assumptions or lack empirical evidence to support their claims. These problems may seem important at first glance, but upon further examination, they are found to be either meaningless, irrelevant or outright false. Such problems often arise in fields like philosophy or metaphysics, where abstract and complex concepts are discussed. It can lead to a waste of time and resources, making it difficult to focus on real problems and solutions that matter.
