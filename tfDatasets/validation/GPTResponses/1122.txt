The children who were left behind in East Prussia after it was occupied by the Russians were referred to as "Wolfskinder" or "wolf children". These were children who had lost their parents or had been separated from them during the chaos of war and were forced to fend for themselves in harsh conditions. They became known as "wolf children" because of their feral way of surviving in the wild, scavenging for food and seeking shelter wherever they could find it. Many of these children were eventually rescued and resettled in other parts of Germany or adopted by families in other countries.
