When using ancestry to make inferences about individual phenotypes, it is important to use caution and not make assumptions based solely on genetic ancestry. Other factors, such as environmental influences and personal health history, can also play a significant role in determining an individual's phenotype. It is important to consult with a medical professional or genetic counselor before making any significant assessments or decisions based on ancestry data.
