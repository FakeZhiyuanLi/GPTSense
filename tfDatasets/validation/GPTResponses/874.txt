It is difficult to determine a specific time period as the concept of ethnicity and self-identification has evolved over time. However, scholars suggest that it began to gain prominence in the late 19th and early 20th century as a response to colonialism and nationalism. With the rise of nation-states and the desire to preserve distinct cultural and linguistic traditions, people began to assert their ethnic identities more strongly. In addition, migration and urbanization led to greater exposure to different cultures and ideas, prompting individuals to identify with their ancestral roots.
