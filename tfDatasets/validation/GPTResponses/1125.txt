Some types of solar power systems use glass, including traditional photovoltaic solar panels and concentrating solar power (CSP) systems. Glass is used as a protective cover for the solar cells or mirrors in these systems, and it allows sunlight to pass through while protecting the sensitive electronic components from damage. Glass is also used in some wind turbine blades to increase their aerodynamic efficiency.
