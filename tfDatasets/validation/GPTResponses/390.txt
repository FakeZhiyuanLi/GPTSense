The event that ended the age of the dinosaur by causing a 75% extinction is believed to be a massive asteroid impact, which occurred approximately 66 million years ago. This catastrophic event led to significant climatic changes, including widespread wildfires, acid rain, and a sudden drop in global temperatures, which ultimately led to the extinction of many species, including dinosaurs. This event is commonly known as the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event.
