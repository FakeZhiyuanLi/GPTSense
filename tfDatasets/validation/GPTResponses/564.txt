The two bodies of water believed to be central to the establishment of the Greek society are the Aegean Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. These bodies of water provided essential resources for trade and transportation, as well as serving as important cultural and religious touchstones for the Greeks. Additionally, they helped shape Greek mythology and provided inspiration for many of the great works of Greek literature, art, and philosophy.
