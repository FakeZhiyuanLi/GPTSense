human diversity and evolution?Some authors argue that anthropology developed as the study of human diversity and evolution because early anthropologists were interested in understanding the differences between societies and cultures around the world, as well as tracing the historical development of human societies from their origins to the present day. The study of human evolution was also central to early anthropology, as researchers sought to understand the biological and cultural factors that shaped the development of early human societies. Over time, anthropology has expanded to include a wide range of topics and approaches, but the focus on human diversity and evolution remains a core aspect of the field.
