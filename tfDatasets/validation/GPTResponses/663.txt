The conditions that African slaves in Brazil lived in were extremely harsh and inhumane. Slaves were forcibly taken from their homes and transported to Brazil, where they were sold as property and forced to work on plantations or in households. They were subjected to long hours of backbreaking labour, with little to no rest or time off.Slaves were often housed in small, overcrowded huts that lacked proper ventilation or sanitation, resulting in high levels of disease and illness. Food and clothing were often inadequate, and slaves were frequently punished for any perceived misbehavior, including physical abuse and torture.Slaves were also subjected to rigid social hierarchies, with lighter-skinned slaves given more privileges and opportunities, while darker-skinned slaves were treated harshly and subjected to stricter rules and punishments. Slavery was abolished in Brazil in 1888, but the legacy of slavery and racial inequality continues to affect Brazilian society today.
