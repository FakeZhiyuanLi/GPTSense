J.M.E. McTaggart, a British metaphysician, believed that space and time are not genuinely real but are mere appearances or illusions generated by human minds. He argued that time is a subjective and non-spatial aspect of our experience, and that space is also an appearance generated by our minds in order to make sense of the world. According to McTaggart, reality is composed of a timeless and spaceless "Absolute", which is beyond our human understanding and perception.
