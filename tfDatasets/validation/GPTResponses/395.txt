As an anthropologist, C. Loring Brace observed that variations in physical traits (such as height, skin color, and hair type) among human populations are largely due to geographic and environmental factors, rather than genetic differences between races. He argued that race is a socially constructed concept and that genetic diversity within races is greater than that between races. Brace also emphasized the importance of cultural practices and social structures in shaping human biology and evolution.
