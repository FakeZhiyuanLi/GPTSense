1. Agile software development: This methodology emphasizes adaptation to changing requirements and delivering working software in short iterations. Test-driven development is a key part of this approach, with tests being written before the code is developed to ensure that the code meets the desired functionality and quality standards.2. Extreme programming (XP): This is another agile methodology that places a strong emphasis on testing. In XP, tests are written before the code is developed, and the code is then developed incrementally to meet the requirements specified by the tests. This approach helps to ensure that the code is of high quality and meets the desired functionality.
