Devout Muslims believe that the overlap of events and characters in the Bible and Quran is because both texts come from the same source, that being God. Muslims believe that the Quran is the final and complete revelation from God, while the Bible was revealed to the prophets before the coming of Prophet Muhammad. Muslims also believe that the Quran is a correction of some of the errors that have crept into earlier scriptures, and therefore, many of the same stories and characters are present in both texts. However, Muslims believe that the Quran provides a more accurate and complete account of those stories and characters than the Bible.
