Big windows of stained glass became less common during the Renaissance period, around the 16th century. This was because artists and architects of the Renaissance favored a more classical style, which emphasized balance, harmony, and simplicity. Additionally, the rise of Protestantism led to a decrease in the use of stained glass in churches, since it was associated with Catholicism, and many Protestant churches favored a simpler style of decoration. The popularity of stained glass made a comeback during the Gothic Revival in the 19th century.
