The conservation of energy is a mathematical consequence of the translational symmetry of time because of Noether's theorem. According to this theorem, for every continuous symmetry of a physical system, there exists a corresponding conservation law. In the case of time translation symmetry, which means that the laws of physics remain the same at all times, the corresponding conservation law is the conservation of energy. This means that the total energy of a closed system remains constant over time. The mathematical derivation of this conservation law using Noether's theorem demonstrates that it is a consequence of the symmetry of time translation.
