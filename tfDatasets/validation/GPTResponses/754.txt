The most common types of passenger elevators installed in structures of up to eight floors are hydraulic elevators and machine room-less elevators (MRLs). Hydraulic elevators use a hydraulic system to lift the elevator car while MRLs utilize a compact traction machine located on top of the elevator shaft. Both types of elevators are reliable, efficient, and cost-effective solutions for low-rise buildings. Some buildings may also have gearless elevators, which offer smoother rides and greater energy efficiency, but they tend to be more expensive than hydraulic and MRL elevators.
