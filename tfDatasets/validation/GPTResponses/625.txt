With the secession away from smaller communities in the Greek world, urban living became of great importance. Cities emerged as centers of trade, commerce, and culture. People flocked to these urban centers for better economic opportunities and to participate in the social and political life of the city. This gave rise to a new class of people, the urban elite, who held power and influence in the city's affairs. Urban living also led to the development of civic institutions such as marketplaces, gyms, and theaters, which played an important role in shaping the cultural identity of the city. The city also provided a sense of security to its inhabitants, as it offered protection from outside threats and provided a community-based system of justice. Overall, urban living became a defining feature of Greek society and culture.
