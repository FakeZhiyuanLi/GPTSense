The risk of overemphasizing genetic contributions to health issues is that it can lead to overlooking and neglecting the role of environmental factors in the development of health conditions. Environmental factors include factors such as diet, lifestyle, cultural practices, and other social determinants of health. Focusing only on genetics might lead to fatalistic attitudes towards health and neglect of potentially modifiable environmental factors that could prevent or mitigate health conditions. Additionally, overemphasizing genetic contributions could lead to stigmatization of individuals based on their genetic makeup, which can result in discrimination and social injustices.
