The Russian Empire gradually expanded into Central Asia from the early 18th century, with the conquests of Siberia and Kazakhstan, and completed its takeover by the end of the 19th century with the annexation of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. The process of colonization and incorporation of these territories was known as the Great Game.
