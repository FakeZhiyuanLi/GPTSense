The conclusion of the Great War (World War I) was marked by the signing of the Treaty of Versailles on June 28, 1919, between the Allied powers and Germany. The signing took place in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles Palace near Paris, France. This treaty ended the state of war between the Allied powers and Germany, and began the process of post-war reconstruction and rebuilding. The treaty assigned responsibility for the war to Germany and its allies, and imposed reparations, territorial concessions, and disarmament on the defeated nations.
