The Greek language includes various accents, diacritical marks, and punctuation marks that are not constants. These symbols are used to indicate stress, intonation, and pronunciation of Greek words, which can affect the meaning and interpretation of sentences. For instance, the acute accent (´) is used to indicate the stressed syllable in a word, while the diaeresis (¨) is used to separate two consecutive vowels that form a diphthong. The Greek language also employs a range of punctuation marks, including the comma, semicolon, period, question mark, and exclamation mark, to signal the end of a sentence or phrases, the separation of clauses or items in a list, or the expression of emphasis, doubt, or surprise.
