During this era, astronomers believed that the Earth was the center of the universe, also known as the geocentric model. This theory was widely accepted in ancient and medieval times and was proposed by the Greek philosopher Aristotle and later supported by the astronomer Ptolemy. It was believed that all the planets, the sun, and the stars orbited around the Earth.
