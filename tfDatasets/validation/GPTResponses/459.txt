In the philosophical context of Hegelianism, an "object" refers to any external entity or thing that exists independently of the subjective consciousness. Hegel believed that objects are not separate from the subject or the human mind but are actively constructed through the process of human consciousness. For Hegel, an object is any entity that can be perceived, understood, and eventually assimilated into the collective understanding of the human community. Objects are the tangible and intangible entities that exist in the world and can be studied and analyzed through philosophical inquiry.
