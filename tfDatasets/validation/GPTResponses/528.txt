Samurai were warriors and did not typically engage in writing. However, during the Edo period in Japan, some samurai wrote poetry, literary works, and other forms of literature for personal or cultural purposes. They often wrote on themes of valor, honor, ethics, and loyalty, reflecting the values of the samurai class. Some famous samurai writers include Miyamoto Musashi, Yamaoka Tesshu, and Matsuo Basho.
