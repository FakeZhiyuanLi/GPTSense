An excess of 500 ppm of zinc in soil can interfere with the uptake of other essential nutrients such as copper and iron by plants. It can also lead to zinc toxicity in plants and impact their growth and development. Zinc toxicity can cause chlorosis, stunted growth, and reduction in yields. Additionally, zinc can leach into the groundwater and cause contamination if the soil is not managed properly.
