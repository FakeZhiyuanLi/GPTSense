Sir William Chambers is considered one of the most important architects who typifies the first style of neoclassical architecture in England. He is best known for his designs of Somerset House, which was built between 1775 and 1780, and the pagoda at Kew Gardens. Chambers was heavily influenced by the works of Italian architect Andrea Palladio and his neoclassical designs were characterized by simplicity, symmetry, and clean lines.
