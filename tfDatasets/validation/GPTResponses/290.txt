The scientific method's rationality depends on the use of objective and empirical evidence. It relies on the systematic observation, measurement, and analysis of data to draw conclusions about the natural world. Additionally, it depends on the principles of logical reasoning, which help to eliminate biases and errors in interpreting data. Finally, the scientific method depends on transparency and reproducibility of results, allowing other researchers to verify the validity of findings.
