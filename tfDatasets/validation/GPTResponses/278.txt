Men's rhythmic gymnastics developed from traditional gymnastics and dance. It has its roots in various cultures such as Indian dance, Chinese martial arts, Japanese karate, and even ballet. In the 1960s and 1970s, male gymnasts began to participate in rhythmic gymnastics competitions, and the sport gained popularity in countries such as Russia and Japan. In the United States, men's rhythmic gymnastics is still a relatively new sport and is not as widely practiced as it is in other countries.
