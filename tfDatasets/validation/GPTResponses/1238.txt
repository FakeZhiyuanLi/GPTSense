The use of economic sanctions as a tool for resolving international disputes is no longer as effective among peer powers. With globalization, individual countries have become more interconnected, and many countries now have more diverse sources of trade and investment, making them more resilient to the impact of sanctions. Additionally, peer powers may be less likely to bow to economic pressure, seeing it as a challenge to their sovereignty or strategic interests. As a result, alternative tools such as diplomatic dialogue and strategic partnerships become more important in resolving disputes between peer powers.
