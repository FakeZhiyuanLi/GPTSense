In some cases, they were even prohibited from learning to read and write.3.

Their social status was tied to their occupation and they were considered to be of lower rank than the ruling class.4. Minorities: In many societies, ethnic and religious minorities were discriminated against and excluded from participation in scholarly pursuits. They were often viewed as outsiders and were not granted the same privileges and opportunities as the majority population.5.
