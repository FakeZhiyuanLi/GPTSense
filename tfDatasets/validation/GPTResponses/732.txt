Views on race can be influenced by a range of factors, including historical, cultural, and socio-economic factors. For example:1. Historical factors: Racism and prejudice have been actively propagated over centuries through colonization, slavery, imperialism, and apartheid systems. This has led to the development of stereotypes and negative attitudes towards certain racial and ethnic groups.2. Cultural factors: Views on race are often shaped by cultural norms and practices. This includes media representation, cultural traditions, and family values. For example, people may develop negative views about certain races due to negative stereotyping in the media or social media.3. Socio-economic factors: Economic disparities and social status can also influence views on race. Factors such as income, education, and employment opportunities can impact people's perceptions of different racial groups. For example, people from a higher socio-economic background may hold more positive views on diversity and inclusivity while people from a lower socio-economic background may be more resistant to accepting people from different races or cultures in their community.In addition, individual experiences with people of other races can also shape one's views on race. People who have had positive experiences with people from other races may hold more positive views on diversity and inclusion, while those who have had negative experiences may hold more negative views.
