Hume believed that an argument is circular when the conclusion is already implied by one of the premises, without providing any additional evidence or justification. In other words, the argument assumes what it is trying to prove, and uses that assumption as evidence to support the conclusion. Hume believed that circular arguments were fundamentally flawed and could not provide reliable knowledge or understanding.
