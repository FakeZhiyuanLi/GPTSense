Mechanical potential energy is the energy stored in an object due to its position or state. It is the energy that an object possesses due to its height, shape, elasticity, or other mechanical characteristics. The potential energy of an object can be converted into kinetic energy, which is the energy an object possesses when it is in motion. Examples of mechanical potential energy include a stretched spring, a raised weight or object, or a compressed gas.
