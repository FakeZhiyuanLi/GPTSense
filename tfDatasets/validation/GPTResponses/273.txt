It depends on the specific high yield strain in question. Some high yield strains may have developed resistance to certain pests or diseases, while others may have been bred to tolerate specific environmental conditions, such as drought or high temperatures. Still, other high yield strains may have been genetically modified to resist herbicides or pesticides.
