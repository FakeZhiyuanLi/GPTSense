In ancient times, tombs were often decorated with paintings, carvings, and sculptures depicting scenes from the deceased person's life, as well as religious or mythological scenes. Common themes included offerings to gods, funerary processions, and symbols of the afterlife. Egyptian tombs, for example, were adorned with hieroglyphics, images of gods and goddesses, and depictions of the pharaohs and their accomplishments. Greek and Roman tombs often featured sculptures and reliefs of the deceased, along with representations of their daily life and occupations.
