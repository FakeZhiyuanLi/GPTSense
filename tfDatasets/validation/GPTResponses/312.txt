genetic data used in conservation genetics?Waples and Gaggiotti identify two broad types of genetic data used in conservation genetics, namely:1. Neutral genetic markers: These are genetic markers that do not directly affect the fitness of the organism and are thus considered to be selectively neutral. Examples of neutral genetic markers include microsatellites, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Neutral genetic markers are useful for estimating population genetic parameters, such as genetic diversity, population structure, and gene flow.2. Functional genetic markers: These are genetic markers that directly affect the fitness of the organism, such as genes involved in immune function, disease resistance, and reproduction. Functional genetic markers are often used to infer adaptive genetic variation and to identify genes and pathways that may be important for conservation management. However, functional genetic markers are typically more difficult and expensive to collect and analyze than neutral genetic markers.
