ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) correspondence allows digital devices to exchange and interpret alphanumeric characters, punctuation marks, and special symbols. This means that computers, smartphones, and other digital devices can communicate with each other and interpret the texts and commands entered by users consistently. Without ASCII correspondence, digital devices would not be able to understand and interpret text-based information, resulting in communication breakdowns and errors.
