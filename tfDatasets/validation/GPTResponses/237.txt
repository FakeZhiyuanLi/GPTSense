historically?Most Jews historically lived in urban settlements near trade routes or ports, where they could engage in commerce and maintain their religious and cultural traditions. These urban settlements included cities such as Jerusalem, Rome, Cairo, Baghdad, and Constantinople. In some cases, Jews also lived in smaller towns or rural areas, but urban areas were the most common.
