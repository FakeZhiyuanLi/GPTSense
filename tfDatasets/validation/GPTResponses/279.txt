According to the ideology of race, races were considered to be biologically determined and immutable categories of human beings with distinct physical, mental, and cultural attributes. This ideology asserts that certain races are inherently superior or inferior to others, and that these differences are based on inherited characteristics such as skin color, facial features, intelligence, and disposition. This belief was used to justify discriminatory treatment and oppression of certain racial groups, as well as to promote the idea of racial segregation and the superiority of one race over others.
