The Ottoman Empire had a complex legal system that included multiple courts. At the top of the system was the Sharia court, which had jurisdiction over religious matters and was headed by a judge known as the qadi al-qudat. Other courts included the military courts, the civil courts, and the commercial courts. There were also various regional courts and appeals courts throughout the empire. The precise number and structure of Ottoman courts varied over time and depending on the region, but the empire's legal system was generally considered to be one of the most advanced in the world during its heyday.
