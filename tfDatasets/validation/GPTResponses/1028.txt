The Jews were confined in various ghettos throughout Europe prior to being transported to Auschwitz. Some of the largest ghettos included the Warsaw Ghetto in Poland, the Lodz Ghetto in Poland, the Krakow Ghetto in Poland, and the Vilna Ghetto in Lithuania. Other ghettos were also established in countries such as Hungary, Slovakia, and Romania. These ghettos were often overcrowded, unsanitary, and lacked basic amenities such as food and medical care. The conditions in these ghettos were often inhumane, and many Jews died from illness, starvation or harsh living conditions.
