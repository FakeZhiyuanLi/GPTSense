The rapid development of explanations of chemical processes by Clausius, Gibbs, and Nernst was aided by several factors, including:1. The advancement of experimental techniques: The development of better laboratory equipment and methods allowed scientists to conduct more precise experiments that provided new insights into chemical processes.2. The rise of thermodynamics: The emergence of thermodynamics as a field of study provided a theoretical framework for understanding the behavior of matter and energy in chemical systems. This allowed for a more systematic approach to explaining chemical processes.3. Collaborative efforts: The exchange of ideas and collaboration among scientists across different fields such as physics, chemistry, and mathematics helped fuel progress in understanding chemical processes.4. Increased funding: The availability of funding from governments, private foundations, and industry allowed researchers to carry out more ambitious and extensive research projects.5. Access to information: The development of scientific journals and other means of communication made it easier for scientists to share their findings and build upon each other's work.
