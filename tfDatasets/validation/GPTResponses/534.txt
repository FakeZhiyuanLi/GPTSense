AC motors were used because they were more efficient, reliable and cost-effective than DC motors. AC motors run on alternating current, which is supplied by the power grid, and they do not require the use of a commutator, which can wear out and require maintenance. They also have a more simple and rugged construction, and can operate at a wider range of speeds. This made them ideal for a range of applications, from powering home appliances to running industrial machinery and power generation.
