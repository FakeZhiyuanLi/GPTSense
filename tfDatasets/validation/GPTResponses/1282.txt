The Ottoman court system was reformed based on the European model, particularly the French legal system. This was known as the Tanzimat Reforms, which began in the mid-19th century and aimed to modernize the Ottoman Empire and create a more equitable and efficient legal system. The reforms included the introduction of a new civil and criminal code, the establishment of secular courts, and the creation of a more centralized judicial system.
