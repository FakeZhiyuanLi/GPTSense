This can result in the formation of a tropical cyclone or hurricane. The sudden release of thermal energy from the warm ocean water can cause the air above it to rise rapidly, leading to the formation of clouds and a low-pressure system. As the storm intensifies, it can produce strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges, causing extensive damage to coastal areas.
