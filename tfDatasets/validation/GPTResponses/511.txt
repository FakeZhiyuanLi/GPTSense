In 1873, the samurai class was abolished in Japan as part of the Meiji Restoration. They were no longer allowed to carry swords or wear their distinctive hairstyles and clothing. Many samurai struggled to find new roles within society, and some became disgruntled and joined rebellions against the new government. Others adapted to new careers and helped modernize Japan through their knowledge and skills.
