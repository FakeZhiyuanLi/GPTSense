Energy and weight are two different quantities and are not directly related. Energy is a measure of the ability to do work while weight is a measure of the gravitational force acting on an object due to its mass.However, according to the concept of mass-energy equivalence in physics, energy can be converted into mass and vice versa. This is described by Einstein's famous equation E=mcÂ² where E is energy, m is mass, and c is the speed of light.So, in situations where energy is converted into mass, it can give rise to weight. For example, when a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, their combined energy is converted into new particles which have mass and therefore weight. Another example is the process of nuclear fusion, where the conversion of mass into energy releases a tremendous amount of energy but at the same time reduces the overall mass of the participating particles, causing a slight decrease in weight.
