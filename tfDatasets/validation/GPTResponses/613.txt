After the fall of Rome, literature in Europe experienced a decline. The Roman literary traditions were abandoned, and the focus instead shifted towards religious texts and the preservation of biblical manuscripts. Latin, which was the language of the Roman Empire, became less common and regional languages began to emerge. The most significant literary works of this era were religious texts such as the Bible, the works of Church Fathers, and devotional literature. The medieval period, which followed the fall of Rome, eventually saw the emergence of new literary genres such as epic poetry, romance and chivalric literature, and philosophical and scientific writings. These new genres were influenced by Christian theology and the vernacular languages spoken across Europe.
