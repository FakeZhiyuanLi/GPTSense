The original Constitution of the United States did not explicitly identify its society members. However, it established the qualifications for members of the House of Representatives, Senate, and President, which were based on citizenship and age requirements. The Constitution also recognized the authority of the states to regulate citizenship and residency within their borders. Additionally, the Constitution included the Three-Fifths Compromise, which counted enslaved individuals as three-fifths of a person for the purposes of determining a state's representation in Congress. Overall, the Constitution's identification of society members was based on citizenship, residency, and the recognition of different categories of individuals such as slaves.
