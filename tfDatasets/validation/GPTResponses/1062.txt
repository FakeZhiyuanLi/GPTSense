Yes, Paris does occasionally see snowfall, but it is rare and never lasts very long. The winter months, especially January and February, are when the city is most likely to have snowflakes, but it is usually just a light dusting. The last significant snowfall seen in Paris was in 2018, when the city was blanketed with several inches of snow.
