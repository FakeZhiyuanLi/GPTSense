Solar power is a renewable energy source that converts sunlight into electricity. Solar panels, made up of photovoltaic cells, capture the energy emitted by the sun and convert it into electrical energy that can be used to power homes or businesses. Solar power is a clean and sustainable energy source, as it produces no greenhouse gas emissions and has very low maintenance costs.
