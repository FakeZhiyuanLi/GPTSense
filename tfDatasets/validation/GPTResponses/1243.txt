The last crisis during the Cold War to escalate world powers was the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, which led to increased tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union, culminating in the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991. The invasion sparked a global response and a boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow by several countries including the United States. The United States also responded by funding and arming the Afghan Mujahideen rebels in their fight against Soviet forces, leading to a protracted and bloody conflict.
