This is called scalability testing. It involves testing the software's performance when the workload or user base increases. The aim is to evaluate whether the software can handle the increased load smoothly without compromising on its functionality or performance. This type of testing is essential for systems that are expected to grow rapidly or those that need to support a large number of users or data.
