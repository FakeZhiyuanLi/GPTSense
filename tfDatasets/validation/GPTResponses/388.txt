In feudal Japan, the emperor was technically granted the right to appoint shugo, or provincial military governors. However, by the Kamakura period, the shogun had assumed much of the emperor's power and had the de facto authority to appoint and remove shugo. The shogun delegated some of this authority to prominent daimyo, or feudal lords, who were allowed to appoint shugo within their own territories.
