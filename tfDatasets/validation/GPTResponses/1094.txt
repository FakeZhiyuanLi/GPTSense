Ceramic glass, sometimes known as vitroceramic or glass-ceramic, is a glass-like material made with a method related to glazing. It is produced by melting specific types of glass and then cooling them rapidly to produce a solid glass material. The material is then reheated to a temperature just below the melting point of the original glass, which causes it to crystallize and transform into a ceramic. Ceramic glass is often used in cookware and oven-safe dishes due to its heat resistance and durability.
