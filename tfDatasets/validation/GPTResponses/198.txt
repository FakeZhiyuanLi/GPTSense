reason?Hume believed that our beliefs cannot be established solely by reason because our ideas and beliefs are derived from our experiences and observations. According to Hume, reason is incapable of providing us with any knowledge or ideas that are not based on our sensory experiences. He argued that all our beliefs are based on our impressions, and our reason can only analyze and organize these impressions, but it cannot create new ones. Hume claimed that our minds are not passive observers and, instead, we actively construct our beliefs from our experiences. Therefore, our beliefs are contingent on our experiences, and reason alone cannot provide us with any certain or absolute knowledge.
