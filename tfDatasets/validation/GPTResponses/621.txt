The influence of archaeologist and art historian Johann Joachim Winckelmann brought about the Greek Revival in France. His writings on ancient Greek art and architecture were widely read in France in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and his ideas inspired a renewed interest in classical antiquity. This led to the adoption of Greek styles in art, architecture, and design, which became a dominant trend in France during the early 19th century.
