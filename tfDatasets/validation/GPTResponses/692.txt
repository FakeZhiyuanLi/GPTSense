One of the main purposes for indigenous education is to preserve and promote the cultural heritage, language, and traditional knowledge of indigenous communities. This includes teaching the history, beliefs, values, and practices of indigenous peoples to younger generations, as well as empowering them to become leaders and stewards of their cultures and communities. Indigenous education also aims to address the historical and ongoing injustices and inequalities experienced by indigenous peoples and provide them with access to relevant and equitable education and opportunities.
