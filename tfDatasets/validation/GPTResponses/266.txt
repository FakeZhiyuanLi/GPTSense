In the past, women commonly had less access to education, job opportunities, and political power than men. They also had fewer legal rights and social protections, such as the right to own property or to vote. Additionally, women commonly had less access to healthcare and were more likely to experience healthcare discrimination. In some cultures, women were also expected to adhere to strict gender roles and norms, limiting their autonomy and freedom.
