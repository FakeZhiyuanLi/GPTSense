Objective social constructions refer to physical or concrete phenomena that are collectively agreed upon by a society or culture but are not inherently natural or biological. Examples of objective social constructions include currency, laws, schools, and buildings. These constructions exist and function within a society, but they are not natural creations and require societal agreement and maintenance to function effectively. They are often created as solutions to social problems or needs and are shaped by cultural values and beliefs.
