Japanese warriors came to literary maturity during the Muromachi period (1336-1573), which is also known as the "Ashikaga period." During this time, samurai warriors played an important role in Japanese society and cultural life, which led to the development of various literary works focusing on samurai culture, ethics, and philosophy. The most famous literary works of this period include "The Tale of the Heike," "The Tales of the Bamboo Cutter," and "The Pillow Book."
