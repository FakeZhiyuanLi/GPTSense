Views on race are highly dependent on various factors such as a person's upbringing, education, cultural background, personal experiences, media exposure, and societal influences.For instance, if a person grows up in a community where people from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds live harmoniously, they are likely to develop positive views of other races. On the other hand, if a person lives in a community where one race dominates and minorities are discriminated against, they may have negative views of other races.Education also plays a crucial role in shaping one's views on race. Educating oneself on different cultures, histories, and experiences helps to promote understanding and empathy towards people from other races.The media also plays a significant role in shaping attitudes towards race. The images and stories presented in the media can influence how people perceive different racial groups. Unfortunately, media often perpetuates negative stereotypes of certain races, which can lead to prejudice and bias.Therefore, an individual's views on race are heavily influenced by various environmental and societal factors. It is important to recognize these factors and work towards creating an inclusive society where all races are respected and valued.
