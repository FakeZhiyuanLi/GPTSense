The second law of thermodynamics states that energy tends to become more evenly spread out across the universe over time. This is because all systems tend towards a state of maximum entropy, where energy is evenly distributed and unavailable to do work. Therefore, any energy transfer or transformation will inevitably result in some amount of energy being lost as heat, leading to a more uniform distribution of energy.
