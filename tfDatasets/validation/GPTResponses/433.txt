The type of object that is the only evidence of Han's wooden constructions are model structures or miniatures. These models were made to convey the design and structure of large wooden buildings, such as the imperial palace or temples, and were used to facilitate communication among architects, builders, and government officials. They were often made with intricate details and were crafted using the same materials and techniques as the larger buildings. These models provide valuable insight into the ingenuity and technological prowess of the Han dynasty in building large, complex wooden structures.
