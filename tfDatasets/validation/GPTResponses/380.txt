diseases and pests. Zinc is a micronutrient that plays a crucial role in plant growth and development, including photosynthesis, enzyme activation, and hormone synthesis. Zinc-deficient plants have weakened immune systems and are more vulnerable to infections caused by bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Additionally, zinc deficiency can affect the taste and nutritional value of crops, reducing their market value and quality. Therefore, it is essential to maintain proper zinc levels in soil through fertilization or other practices to prevent plant diseases and ensure healthy crop production.
