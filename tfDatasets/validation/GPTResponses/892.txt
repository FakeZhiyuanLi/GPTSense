One of the most commonly cited examples of institutional racism in law enforcement is the disproportionate targeting and profiling of people of color, particularly black and Latino individuals, for traffic stops and searches. Studies have shown that these groups are more likely to be pulled over and searched, even when there is no evidence of wrongdoing, leading to feelings of harassment and discrimination. Additionally, the higher rates of incarceration among people of color are also seen as a symptom of institutional racism within the criminal justice system.
