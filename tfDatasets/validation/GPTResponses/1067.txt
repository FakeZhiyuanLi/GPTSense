The Quran is self-referential in almost all of its suras. However, some scholars argue that Surah Al-Baqarah (The Cow) contains more self-references than any other sura in the Quran. This surah also contains many stories about previous prophets and their followers, making it a valuable source of information and guidance for Muslims. Other suras that contain significant self-referential content include Surah Al-Imran (The Family of Imran) and Surah Al-Ma'ida (The Table Spread).
