The US Navy did not invade Japan. Instead, the US dropped two atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, leading to Japan's surrender and the end of World War II. The decision to drop the bombs was made by President Harry S. Truman, with military leaders such as General Leslie Groves and Admiral William Leahy playing key roles in the planning and execution of the attacks.
