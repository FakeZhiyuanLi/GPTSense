Australia experienced long-term economic growth during the period from the early 1990s to the early 2000s, commonly known as the "Australian Economic Miracle." This period saw significant economic reforms, such as the dismantling of protectionist trade policies and the implementation of a flexible exchange rate regime, that helped to boost economic growth and productivity. As a result, Australia achieved an average annual real GDP growth rate of 3.3% between 1992 and 2007, as well as low inflation and unemployment rates.
