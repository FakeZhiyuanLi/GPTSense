Indigenous education can be implemented in both formal and non-formal education systems.1. Formal education system: Indigenous education can be integrated into the formal education system through the development of curriculum and educational materials that incorporate Indigenous knowledge and perspectives. This can take place in schools and educational institutions, where teachers and educators can work alongside Indigenous communities to develop culturally-appropriate and relevant educational programs.2. Non-formal education system: Indigenous education can also be delivered through non-formal educational settings, such as community-based programs, cultural centers, and language schools. These programs can be designed to meet the specific needs of Indigenous communities, and can be delivered through traditional methods such as storytelling, language immersion, and cultural ceremonies. Non-formal education can also provide opportunities for intergenerational learning, where elders can share their knowledge and experience with younger generations.
