The addition of certain metallic oxides to the glass can make it colorful. The type and amount of oxide added will determine the color of the glass. For example, cobalt oxide will make the glass blue, while gold oxide will produce a ruby red color. Iron oxide can create green, amber, or brown glass, and manganese oxide can create purple glass.
