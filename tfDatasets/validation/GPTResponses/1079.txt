The first known glasses were produced in ancient Egypt around 4,000 years ago. These early glasses were made of a type of volcanic glass called obsidian and were used for jewelry and decorative purposes. The ancient Romans also produced glass, and their glass objects have been found throughout Europe and the Middle East. The production of glass became more widespread during the Middle Ages, and by the 16th century, glassmaking had become a major industry in Europe. Today, there are many different types of glass, including soda-lime glass, borosilicate glass, tempered glass, and laminated glass, among others.
