The number of common ancestors that a clade has depends on the specific clade and the evolutionary history of the group. In general, a clade includes all the species descended from a particular common ancestor. The number of common ancestors within a clade can therefore vary widely depending on the size and complexity of the group, as well as the level of phylogenetic resolution used to define it. Some small clades may have only a single common ancestor, while larger or more diverse clades may have multiple common ancestors at different points in their evolutionary history.
