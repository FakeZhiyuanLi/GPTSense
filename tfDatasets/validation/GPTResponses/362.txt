Macintosh used graphics, but it also introduced a graphical user interface (GUI) with its original operating system, called System 1. The GUI allowed users to interact with icons, windows, and menus using a mouse, instead of typing commands like in earlier computer systems. This made Macintosh much more user-friendly, and it paved the way for modern graphical interfaces used today.
