The order in which the suras (chapters) are arranged in the Quran is believed by Muslims to be divinely inspired and was determined by the Prophet Muhammad himself under the guidance of Allah. According to Islamic tradition, the Quran was revealed to Muhammad by the angel Gabriel over a period of 23 years in a series of verses and chapters. The order and arrangement of the suras was determined by the Prophet under divine guidance based on several factors, including the context of the revelations, the theme of the suras, and the length and style of the verses. The suras are arranged from longest to shortest, except for the opening sura, which is placed at the beginning as a preface. The overall structure of the Quran is considered to be highly organized and coherent, reflecting the wisdom and guidance of Allah.
