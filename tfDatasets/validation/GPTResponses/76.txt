Luis de Camões, the renowned Portuguese poet, was influenced by various literary traditions and movements, including the Renaissance and Humanism. However, his main influence was the epic narrative tradition of ancient Greece and Rome, particularly the works of Homer and Virgil. Camões' writing style and epic poems, including "The Lusiads," were heavily inspired by these classical models, and he often used similar themes, motifs, and structures in his own work. Additionally, Camões was inspired by his own life experiences, including his time as a soldier in the Portuguese army and his travels throughout the Portuguese Empire.
