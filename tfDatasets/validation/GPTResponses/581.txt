Hydraulic elevators are best suited for low-rise buildings because they can only travel up to six floors. They are ideal for buildings with a maximum height of 60 feet. They are commonly used in hotels, malls, hospitals, and low-rise residential buildings. Hydraulic elevators are also suitable for buildings where space is limited and where there is no machine room.
