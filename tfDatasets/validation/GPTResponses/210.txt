The Ötztal Alps and Zillertal Alps are separated by the Inn Valley, a narrow valley that cuts between the two mountain ranges. The Inn River flows through this valley, with the Ötztal Alps to the south, and the Zillertal Alps to the north. The two mountain ranges are also separated by their distinct geological features and differing elevations. The Ötztal Alps are known for their glaciers, high peaks, and rugged terrain, while the Zillertal Alps are characterized by their rolling hills, lush valleys, and pastoral landscapes.
