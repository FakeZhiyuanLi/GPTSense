The economic event that influenced the 1931 election was the Great Depression, which began in 1929 and lasted throughout the 1930s. The Depression led to high rates of unemployment, poverty, and social unrest, which resulted in a shift in public opinion towards more conservative economic policies. The Conservative Party, led by Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald, won the election on a platform of austerity measures and spending cuts to address the economic crisis. This policy shift was highly controversial and led to the formation of a new political party, the National Government, which included politicians from both the Conservative and Labour parties. The National Government went on to implement a range of economic policies that had a significant impact on the country for decades to come.
