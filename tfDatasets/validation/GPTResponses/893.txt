The recommended daily calorie intake for an adult varies depending on factors such as age, sex, height, weight, activity level and overall health. The average daily calorie intake for a sedentary adult is 2000-2500 calories, while an active adult may require up to 3000-3500 calories per day. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider or registered dietitian to determine the appropriate calorie intake for an individual based on their specific needs and goals.
