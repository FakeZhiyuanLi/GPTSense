Lead glass is approximately 10-15% less viscous than soda-lime glass. This means that lead glass flows more easily and is easier to shape and mold during the glassblowing process. It also means that lead glass has a higher refractive index, which gives it a more brilliant and sparkling appearance than soda-lime glass.
