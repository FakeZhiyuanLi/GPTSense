Fst is a statistical measure used to quantify the degree of genetic differentiation between populations of a species. It can be used to assess the genetic diversity within a population and the degree of genetic similarity among different populations. High Fst values indicate significant genetic differentiation between populations, while low Fst values indicate a high degree of genetic similarity.
