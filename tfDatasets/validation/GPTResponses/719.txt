Hydraulic elevators rely on a fluid-filled piston to lift and lower the car, while electric elevators use a motor and cable systems. The standard emergency system in buildings usually provides only limited power and is not designed to operate hydraulic systems. Thus, hydraulic elevators require specialized backup systems, such as a generator, to ensure they can still function in the event of a power outage or emergency. Additionally, hydraulic elevators may pose a safety risk if they are not properly maintained, and their emergency systems are not reliable, which is why specialized systems are required for their safe operation.
