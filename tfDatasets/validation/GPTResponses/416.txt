People have reported zinc intoxication due to excessive consumption of zinc supplements or ingestion of zinc-containing substances, such as lozenges, nasal sprays, or ointments. Consumption of zinc in excessive amounts can lead to symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, headaches, fatigue, and fever. Long-term excessive intake of zinc can cause copper deficiency, anemia, weakening of the immune system, and neurological disorders. Additionally, zinc toxicity can be harmful during pregnancy as it can affect fetal development. Therefore, it is recommended to take zinc supplements only under medical supervision and to avoid ingesting zinc-containing substances beyond the recommended doses.
