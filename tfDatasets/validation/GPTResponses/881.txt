The probability of a molecule having energy greater than or equal to e at temperature t can be calculated using the Boltzmann distribution formula:P(E >= e) = e^(-E/kT)where P is the probability, E is the energy of the molecule, k is the Boltzmann constant (1.38×10^-23 J/K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin.For example, if we have a molecule with energy E = 1.5 × 10^-20 J at a temperature of T = 300 K, the probability of it having energy greater than or equal to e = 1 × 10^-20 J is:P(E >= 1 × 10^-20 J) = e^(-1.5×10^-20 / (1.38×10^-23 × 300))= e^(-3.22×10^19)= 0.0 (approximately)Therefore, the probability is very low, practically zero, for the molecule to have energy greater than or equal to e at the given temperature.
