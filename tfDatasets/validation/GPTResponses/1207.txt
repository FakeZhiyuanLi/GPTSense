It is difficult to pinpoint the exact date when Lord Castlereagh first used the term "great powers," as it is a concept that emerged over time in response to shifting political alliances and international relations. However, Castlereagh played a pivotal role in the Congress of Vienna in 1815, which aimed to establish a new balance of power in Europe after the Napoleonic Wars. In this context, the term "great powers" was used to refer to the major European nations that wielded significant geopolitical influence, such as Britain, France, Russia, Austria, and Prussia. Castlereagh's diplomatic efforts at the Congress of Vienna helped to solidify the emergence of the great powers as a key concept in modern international relations.
