Special education in the early years of schooling in the US usually applies to students with disabilities or developmental delays who require individualized instruction and support to meet academic, social and emotional goals. Some examples of early childhood special education programs include early intervention programs for infants and toddlers with disabilities, preschool special education programs for children ages 3 to 5 who may have developmental delays or disabilities, and kindergarten through 2nd grade special education programs for children with significant learning disabilities or other disabilities. These programs may include accommodations, modifications, and specialized instruction tailored to meet the individual needs of each student.
