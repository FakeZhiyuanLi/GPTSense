The space-and-time dependence of a slowly changing wave function of quantum systems is described by the Schrödinger equation, which is a partial differential equation that relates the evolution of the wave function to the Hamiltonian operator of the system. Specifically, the equation is:iħ∂ψ/∂t = Hψwhere ħ is the reduced Planck constant, ψ is the wave function, t is time, and H is the Hamiltonian operator. The equation shows that the time derivative of the wave function is proportional to the Hamiltonian acting on the wave function. This means that the wave function evolves in time as determined by the Hamiltonian, and the spatial dependence of the wave function is also related to the Hamiltonian through the spatial derivative term in the equation. For slowly changing systems, the time dependence of the wave function can be approximated by considering the system to be in a stationary state with a time-independent wave function.
