Plants are known to use a form of communication called "chemical signaling." They release chemicals known as pheromones or volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can be detected by other plants nearby. These chemicals can signal to other plants to prepare for environmental stresses, defend against herbivores or pathogens, or even call for pollinators. Plants may also use chemical signaling to compete with other plant species for resources such as water, nutrients, and sunlight.
