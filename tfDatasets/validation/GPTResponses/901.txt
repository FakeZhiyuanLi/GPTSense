Solar radiation and the uneven heating of the Earth's surface are the primary drivers of many weather phenomena, including winds, temperature gradients, and the formation and movement of fronts and storms. The Earth's rotation also plays a role in weather patterns, creating global wind patterns, creating high and low pressure systems, and influencing the direction of storms. Other factors that can affect weather include air pressure, humidity, atmospheric composition, ocean currents, and the topography of the Earth's surface.
