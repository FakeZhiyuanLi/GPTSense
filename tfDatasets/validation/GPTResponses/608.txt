Racial identity in Brazil was not governed by the concept of simple ancestry or skin color alone. Instead, it was based on a complex system that took into account multiple factors including ancestry, skin color, facial features, cultural practices, and social status. This concept is known as "racial fluidity" which allows individuals to shift their racial identity based on certain circumstances or social context. As a result, Brazil's racial categories are not fixed and can vary depending on the individualâ€™s personal experiences and social interactions.
