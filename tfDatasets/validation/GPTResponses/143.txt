Leonardo da Vinci advised that if your experience contradicts authority, then you should rely on your own experiences and observations. He believed that reliance on authority alone without question or independent observation was foolish and limited one's ability to learn and discover new things. He also believed that one should always remain open-minded and willing to question even the most established beliefs in order to expand their knowledge and understanding.
