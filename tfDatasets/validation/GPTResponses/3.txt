Maududi exerted the most impact in the field of Islamic revivalism and political ideology, particularly in South Asia. He founded the Jamaat-e-Islami organization, which later became a significant political party in Pakistan and Bangladesh. His writings and speeches on Islamic principles, political governance, and social issues shaped the ideology of the Islamic revivalist movement in South Asia and beyond. Maududi's ideas also influenced other Islamic political movements globally, including Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood and Iran's Islamic Revolution.
