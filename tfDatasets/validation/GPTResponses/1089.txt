There is no naturally occurring glass in nature. Glass is a man-made material that is created by heating a combination of materials, such as silica, soda ash, and limestone, to very high temperatures until they melt and then cooling them rapidly to form a non-crystalline solid. However, natural materials such as volcanic lava, obsidian, and fulgurites (glass formed by lightning strikes on sand or soil) have properties similar to glass and are sometimes referred to as “natural glass”.
