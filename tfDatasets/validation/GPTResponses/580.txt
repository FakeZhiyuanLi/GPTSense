Various ideologies and beliefs have been used to justify discrimination, apartheid, slavery, and genocide throughout history. In WWII, the following were used:1. Racism: The belief that some races are inferior to others has led to discrimination and atrocities against non-dominant groups. For example, Nazis believed that German people were superior to other races and sought to eliminate supposed inferior races, such as Jews and Roma, through the Holocaust.2. Nationalism: Extreme nationalism often leads to exclusionary practices towards minority groups. In WWII, Japanese nationalism resulted in the internment of Japanese Americans in the US and acts of aggression against other Asian countries.3. Colonialism: Imperial powers often used the notion of their superiority to justify enslaving and exploiting colonized peoples. Colonialism led to the transatlantic slave trade, which enslaved millions of Africans.4. Religious beliefs: Discrimination and violence against minority groups have also been justified through religious doctrines. For instance, the caste system in India is based on Hindu religious beliefs, which has resulted in discrimination and violence towards lower castes.5. Eugenics: This was a movement that sought to improve the human race through selective breeding, which led to forced sterilization and euthanasia of people deemed "undesirable" in Nazi Germany.
