The practice of racial segregation and discrimination was combined with the field of eugenics regarding the distinctness of social groups. Eugenicists believed that certain races and social groups were genetically superior or inferior to others, and advocated for policies to promote the reproduction of those deemed superior and restrict or prevent the reproduction of those deemed inferior. This led to widespread discrimination against marginalized and minority communities, including forced sterilization, institutionalization, and racial segregation.
