Bonilla-Silva contends that racism is about maintaining white dominance and power in society, more than anything else. In his book "Racism Without Racists", he argues that racism is a "smokescreen" used to justify the preservation of white privilege and the exclusion of other racial groups from the benefits of society. He suggests that racism is not simply a matter of individual prejudice, but is a deeply ingrained and systemic feature of society that operates through institutions such as education, housing, and employment. Bonilla-Silva argues that in order to address racism, we must recognize and challenge these structural inequalities and work towards creating a more equitable society.
