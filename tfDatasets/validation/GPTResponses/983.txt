The domination of the French monarchy and its administrative language helped create the Parisian dialect. During the Middle Ages, Paris became the political and cultural center of France. The French royal court and government were located in Paris, and the French language was standardized under the rule of King Louis XIII, who declared French as the official language of the court in the 17th century.As the capital city, Paris attracted people from all over France, who brought with them their local dialects, which blended with the Parisian dialect. The language spoken in Paris gained prestige and became the standard for French language, literature, and culture. The French Academy, founded in 1635, was responsible for standardizing the language and establishing rules for grammar, spelling, and pronunciation.In addition, the printing press played a crucial role in spreading the Parisian dialect throughout France. Books printed in Paris were widely distributed, and people began to emulate the way the Parisians spoke, leading to the spread of the dialect beyond the capital.Overall, the political, cultural, and linguistic dominance of Paris and the French monarchy contributed to the creation and spread of the Parisian dialect.
