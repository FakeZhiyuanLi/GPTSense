The word "liberal" comes from the Latin word "liberalis," which means "of or relating to freedom." In the late Middle Ages, it was used to describe individuals who were liberal arts scholars and were free to pursue knowledge and learning without constraint. Later, it came to be associated with political philosophy that emphasized individual liberty and equality, and the term "liberalism" emerged in the 19th century to describe this philosophy.
