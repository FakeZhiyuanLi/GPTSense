One thought was to use a variety of clustering algorithms and compare their results, as different algorithms may identify different patterns in the data. Additionally, varying the input parameters for each algorithm could help uncover unique patterns. Another idea was to segment the data into subsets based on certain characteristics or variables, and then apply clustering algorithms to each subset separately to identify more specific and unique cluster patterns.
