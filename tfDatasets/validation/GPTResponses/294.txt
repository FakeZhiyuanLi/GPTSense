There is no specific literal work that followers of Laozi (also known as Taoism) are expected to chant. However, there are several important scriptures and texts in Taoism that are considered to be holy and are studied and revered by followers. These include the Tao Te Ching (also known as the Dao De Jing), the Zhuangzi (also known as the Chuang Tzu), and the Liezi (also known as the Lieh Tzu). These texts offer insights into the Taoist philosophy and practices, such as the idea of the Tao, the balance of yin and yang, Wu Wei (non-action), and the cultivation of Qi (life force). While chanting may be a part of Taoist practices, it is not necessarily a requirement or expectation for all followers.
