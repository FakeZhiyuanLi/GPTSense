Many former colonies' citizens began immigrating into Britain after World War II, particularly from the late 1940s to the 1960s. The majority of these immigrants came from Caribbean countries and India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. They were invited to migrate to Britain to help rebuild the country after the war and fill labor shortages in various industries.
