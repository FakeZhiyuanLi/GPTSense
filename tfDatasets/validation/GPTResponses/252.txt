Many of the ideas associated with the term "race" arose during the 18th and 19th centuries with the emergence of scientific racism and the classification of human populations based on physical and cultural characteristics. This period saw the rise of racial hierarchies and the belief in the inherent inferiority of certain groups based on perceived race. However, it is important to note that ideas about race have existed throughout history, and the concept of race itself is a social construct that has evolved over time.
