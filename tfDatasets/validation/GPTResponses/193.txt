species?Many genetic systems are conserved among different species, particularly among closely related species. For example, the genetic code is nearly universal, meaning that the same codons code for the same amino acids in almost all organisms. Similarly, many genes involved in basic cellular processes such as DNA replication, transcription, and translation are shared among species. This conservation of genetic systems is evidence of the common ancestry of all living organisms.
