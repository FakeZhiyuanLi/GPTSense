Samurai wives were responsible for teaching their children, especially their sons, important virtues such as loyalty, honor, and self-discipline, as well as basic skills such as reading, writing, and arithmetic. They were also expected to teach their daughters how to run a household, cook, clean, and raise a family. In some cases, samurai wives were also trained in martial arts, so they could defend themselves and their families if necessary.
