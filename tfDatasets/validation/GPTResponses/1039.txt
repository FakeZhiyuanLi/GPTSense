East Prussia and West Prussia were never merged into a single entity called Prussia. The historical region of Prussia already existed prior to the acquisition of East Prussia and West Prussia by the Kingdom of Prussia in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The merger of these territories helped to expand the borders of Prussia, but they remained distinct entities within the larger kingdom.
