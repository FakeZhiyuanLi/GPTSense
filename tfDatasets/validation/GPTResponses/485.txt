Bushido was a code of conduct for samurai warriors in feudal Japan, but it was not formalized by any one person. Instead, it was a set of traditions and beliefs that evolved over time, influenced by Confucianism, Zen Buddhism, and Shinto philosophy. Some influential figures in the development of Bushido include Yamaga Soko and Tsunetomo Yamamoto, who wrote treatises on the samurai way of life. However, it was not until the late 19th and early 20th centuries, during the Meiji period, that Bushido was popularized and formalized as a national code of conduct, with the help of writers such as Nitobe Inazo.
