Passenger elevators are available in various capacities ranging from 450kg (6 passengers) to 2720kg (40 passengers) or more. The most common sizes are 630kg (8 passengers), 800kg (10 passengers), 1000kg (13 passengers), and 1350kg (18 passengers). The capacity of the elevator is determined by the size of the car, the load-bearing capacity of the elevator system, and the maximum weight capacity of the building's structure.
