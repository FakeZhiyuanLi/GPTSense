Despite the lower design costs, safety mechanisms are still essential to ensure the safety of individuals and the environment. Some of the safety mechanisms that are required despite lower design costs include:1. Risk assessments: Conducting risk assessments helps designers to identify potential hazards associated with their designs and develop appropriate safety measures to mitigate those risks.2. Quality control: Implementing quality control measures during the design process ensures that the final products meet safety standards and regulations.3. Testing and certification: Products must undergo rigorous testing and certification by recognized safety bodies to ensure their safety and compliance with safety regulations.4. Warning labels: Safety warning labels help to alert people to potential hazards associated with products, materials or equipment.5. Maintenance and repair: Maintenance and repair are crucial to ensuring that equipment and systems remain in good working order and are safe to use.6. Emergency response plans: Developing emergency response plans helps to mitigate the consequences of accidents or emergencies that may occur during the use or maintenance of equipment.7. Training: It is essential to provide adequate training to operators, technicians and workers who may be exposed to potential hazards during the use of products or equipment to help them operate safely.
