A diet that is deficient in zinc or is high in phytates (compounds that bind to zinc and prevent its absorption) may require more than 15mg of zinc daily. Vegetarians and vegans may also require higher amounts of zinc as plant sources of zinc are less bioavailable than animal sources. Pregnant and lactating women may require more zinc to support fetal and infant growth and development. People with certain medical conditions, such as sickle cell disease or Crohn's disease, may also require higher amounts of zinc.
