During the Jurassic period, several species spread towards the poles. Some of these species include:- Marine reptiles such as ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs- Dinosaurs such as stegosaurs, sauropods, and ornithopods- Plants such as conifers, ferns, and cycads.These species were able to thrive in the cooler climates near the poles due to adaptations such as thick fur or feathers, efficient vascular systems, and specialized teeth and jaw structures.
