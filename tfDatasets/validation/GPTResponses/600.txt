During World War II, the Japanese were often regarded as being braver than the Germans by Allied soldiers and officials. This perception was partly due to Japan's cultural emphasis on honor and self-sacrifice, as well as the infamous kamikaze attacks by Japanese pilots. However, it should be noted that bravery is a subjective and culturally-relative concept, and any comparisons between nations should be taken with caution.
