The Ottoman Sultan had control over the clergy in the Ottoman Empire. This system was known as the millet system, where religious communities were allowed to govern themselves, but ultimately were under the control of the Ottoman Sultan. Each religious community was headed by a religious leader, who was given authority by the Sultan to oversee the community's religious affairs.
