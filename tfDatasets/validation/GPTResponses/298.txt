It is difficult to give an exact number as there were so many bands active in the Liverpool area during the 1960s, but some estimates put the number at well over 2,000. The Beatles, of course, were the most famous band to emerge from the Liverpool music scene, but there were many other talented groups such as The Merseybeats, The Searchers, The Swinging Blue Jeans, Gerry and The Pacemakers, and many more. It was a vibrant and exciting time for music in Liverpool and many of these bands went on to achieve success both in the UK and internationally.
