The gridlock between Whitlam and Fraser was resolved through the Governor-General, Sir John Kerr. On November 11, 1975, Kerr dismissed Whitlam as the Prime Minister and appointed Fraser as the caretaker Prime Minister. This controversial move was made due to the ongoing deadlock in the Parliament, with the Opposition blocking the supply bills to the Government. The dismissal of Whitlam led to widespread protests and a constitutional crisis, but ultimately the new election was called, which Fraser won in a landslide victory.
