The Prince Electors were able to proclaim themselves King of Prussia in 1701 because the Holy Roman Emperor granted the Margrave of Brandenburg-Prussia the right to upgrade his title to King in exchange for his support in the War of the Spanish Succession. The Margrave, Frederick III, became King Frederick I of Prussia and his dynasty would go on to rule Prussia and later Germany for centuries.
