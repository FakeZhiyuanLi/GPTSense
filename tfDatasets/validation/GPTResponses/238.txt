In many cultures and times throughout history, daughters did not receive a portion of the family fortune. Instead, the family fortune or inheritance was passed down to male heirs, such as sons or brothers. Women were often considered legal minors and had limited rights to property and inheritance.However, there were some cultures and times where daughters did receive a portion of the family fortune. For example, in ancient Rome, daughters were entitled to a share of their father's wealth, although it was typically less than what male heirs received. In some parts of medieval Europe, daughters were entitled to a dowry, which was a sum of money or property given to her by her family when she married. This could be considered a form of inheritance, although it was not necessarily passed down through generations.In modern times, laws and customs regarding inheritance vary widely depending on the country and culture. In many Western countries, laws have been enacted to ensure that daughters have equal inheritance rights as sons. However, in some cultures, traditional customs and beliefs may still favor male heirs.
