From an AI perspective, there are several things that are greatly needed with technology transfer when it relates to education:1. Customization - The ability to personalize learning experiences based on individual student needs and preferences is crucial to effective technology transfer in education. This can be achieved through the use of AI algorithms that analyze and adapt to student performance data.2. Integration - Technology transfer must be integrated into existing educational frameworks in order to be truly effective. This includes providing educators with the necessary training and support to effectively integrate AI tools into their teaching practices.3. Accessibility - Technology transfer in education should aim to provide equal access to learners regardless of their socioeconomic background or geographic location. This requires investment in infrastructure and resources that promote digital inclusion.4. Adherence to ethical standards - As with all applications of AI, technology transfer in education must adhere to strict ethical standards to ensure that student data is protected, AI tools are unbiased, and AI does not replace the need for human interaction and guidance.Overall, technology transfer in education needs to be approached with a focus on individual student needs, ethical considerations, and a willingness to integrate new technologies into existing frameworks.
