Human group variation is similar to variation observed in other social primates such as chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas. These species also exhibit differences between individuals and groups in behavior, communication, social structure, and physical traits. Other animals, such as birds and fish, also exhibit group variation in behavior and physical characteristics.
