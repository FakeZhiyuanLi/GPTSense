Neoclassic design attempted to simplify the ornate and intricate styles of the Rococo and Baroque periods, instead favoring clean lines, symmetry, and classical motifs inspired by ancient Greek and Roman art and architecture. This led to a revival of classical forms such as columns, arches, and domes, as well as a focus on fine craftsmanship and the use of high-quality materials. Neoclassicism also emphasized the use of muted colors and natural motifs, in contrast to the flamboyant colors and ornamental flourishes of previous styles.
