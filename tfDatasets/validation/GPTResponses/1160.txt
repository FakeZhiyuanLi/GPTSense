Glass is annealed to relieve residual stress and strengthen it. When molten glass is cooled quickly, it creates residual stress due to the uneven contraction of the surfaces. This stress can cause the glass to crack, break or shatter when exposed to small impacts, pressure or uneven temperature changes. To eliminate this internal stress, glass is gradually cooled down through annealing, a process when it is heated to a specific temperature and then maintained at that temperature for a certain period of time before it is slowly cooled down. This process enables the different layers of the glass to contract uniformly, avoiding the creation of extra stress points. By reducing internal stresses, annealing strengthens the glass and enhances its resilience to breakage.
