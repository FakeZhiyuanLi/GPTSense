There are several reasons for crushing glass and melting it again:1. Recyclability: Crushed glass can easily be recycled since it can be melted and molded into new products.2. Efficient storage and transportation: Crushed glass takes up less space compared to whole glass and is easier to transport.3. Cost-effective: It is cheaper to recycle glass than to produce new glass from raw materials.4. Quality control: By melting crushed glass, impurities and contaminants can be removed, ensuring the production of high-quality glass products.5. Environmental impact: Recycling glass decreases the amount of waste that ends up in landfills, reducing the environmental impact on the planet.
