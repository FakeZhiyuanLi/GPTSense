The first three methods mentioned in black-box testing are:1. Equivalence partitioning: This method involves dividing the input data into classes or partitions that have similar properties or behavior. Each partition is tested with a representative set of inputs to ensure that the behavior is consistent and correct.2. Boundary value analysis: This method tests the input and output values at the boundaries of the input domain. It helps to identify any errors or bugs that may occur at the boundary values.3. Decision table testing: This method involves creating a table that lists all possible combinations of inputs and expected outputs. It helps to ensure that all possible scenarios are covered and tested.
