In physics, glass is defined as a non-crystalline solid material that is neither a liquid nor a gas. It is formed by cooling a molten material at a rate that does not allow its atoms to form an ordered crystalline structure. Because of its amorphous structure, glass lacks a long-range periodic arrangement of atoms, giving it unique properties such as high transparency, hardness, brittleness, and a low coefficient of thermal expansion. Glass is widely used in various applications such as windows, lenses, containers, and optical fibers.
