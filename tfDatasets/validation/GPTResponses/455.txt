There are several materials that can be used as a support structure in incense burners:1. Ceramic: Ceramic is a popular choice because it is heat-resistant and can be molded into various shapes and sizes.2. Metal: Metal supports, such as those made from brass or copper, can be durable and long-lasting. They are also able to conduct heat well, making them ideal for burning incense.3. Glass: Glass supports are great for holding incense sticks or cones. They are transparent, making them appealing to the eye, and can help to prevent ash from falling onto surfaces.4. Wood: Wooden supports are perfect for natural-themed incense burners. They can be carved into different shapes and sizes, and are a great complement to earthy scents.5. Stone: Stone supports, such as those made from granite or marble, can be heavy and sturdy. They are perfect for heavier incense burners that need to be balanced, and can also provide a natural look.
