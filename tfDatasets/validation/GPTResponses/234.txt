John Stuart Mill argued that matter is composed of atoms that are in a state of constant motion and interaction with other atoms, leading to the observable properties of matter. He believed that matter was not infinitely divisible and that there was a limit to the smallest particles that make up matter. Mill also recognized that matter interacts with energy, and that the two cannot be fully distinguished from each other.
