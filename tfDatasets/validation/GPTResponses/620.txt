One way to create a hierarchy of categories that are not isolated from each other is to use a nested structure. This means that one category contains subcategories, which can then contain further subcategories. For example, a hierarchical structure for a bookstore could look like this:- Fiction- Romance- Historical Romance- Contemporary Romance- Paranormal Romance- Mystery- Cozy Mystery- Detective Fiction- Non-Fiction- History- Ancient History- Modern History- Science- Biology- Physics- ChemistryIn this structure, each category and subcategory is related to others and creates a hierarchy based on the level of specificity. For example, Romance is a subset of Fiction, and Historical Romance is a subset of Romance. This approach allows for efficient navigation and searching within a larger database or inventory.
