The other versions of ASCII are not true ASCII because they are extensions of the original ASCII character set, and they include additional characters that are not part of the original ASCII set. These extensions were added to support a wider range of languages and characters. Some examples of extended ASCII character sets include ISO 8859 and Windows-1252. However, these extensions are not standardized across all systems, which can cause compatibility issues.
