The first known use of the word "samurai" was in the 8th century in Japan, but it was not used in its current meaning as a warrior class until the 12th century. The word's original meaning was "to serve" or "to attend," referring to the servants of the aristocratic class. It later evolved to refer to the warriors who served the emperor and feudal lords.
