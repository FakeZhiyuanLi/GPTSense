The evolution and diversification of dinosaurs during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods produced further adaptations, such as the development of feathers in some species, the evolution of advanced chewing mechanisms in herbivorous dinosaurs, and the development of more efficient respiratory systems in birds. Additionally, the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea during this time led to the emergence of new ecological niches and the radiation of terrestrial and marine organisms.
