The basic civil planning system for streets rooted in neoclassicism is the grid pattern. In this system, the streets are laid out in a rectangular grid pattern with straight, parallel streets intersecting perpendicular ones. This system is based on the idea of order and symmetry, which are fundamental principles of neoclassical architecture and urban planning. The grid pattern has been used in many cities around the world, including Washington DC, New York City, and Paris.
