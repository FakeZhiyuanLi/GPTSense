The classification of mountains and subregions can be difficult due to various factors such as:1. Geographical Diversity: The earth's landscape is very diverse, and mountains can differ in their formation, elevation, and geological structure. This makes it challenging to classify them based on one criterion.2. Different Criteria: There are various criteria for classifying a mountain, such as height, prominence, massif, or type of rock. Different classifications can result in mountains belonging to different categories, making it confusing and challenging to determine their status.3. Political Boundaries: Mountains and regions can be divided by political boundaries, making it challenging to determine which region they belong to. For example, the Himalayan Mountains stretch across several countries, and different regions within each country may classify them differently.4. Human Influence: Human activities such as tourism, construction, or mining can alter a mountain's environment, making it challenging to classify it alongside other natural landmarks.5. Lack of clarity: There are no hard and fast rules for classification, which can lead to variations in classification across different sources. This can make it difficult to reach a consensus on a mountain's standing.
