I'm not sure exactly what you are referring to, but it is possible that you are asking about the Bohai Sea, which is to the south of the Shandong Peninsula in China. The Bohai Sea is an inland sea that is connected to the Yellow Sea to the east, and empties out through the Bohai Strait to the north. It is an important body of water for shipping and fishing.
