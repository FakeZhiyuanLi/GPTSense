Idealism was popular among some twentieth century scientists, particularly physicists and mathematicians such as Werner Heisenberg, Niels Bohr, and Kurt GÃ¶del. They believed that there was a fundamental unity to the universe and that our perception of it was limited by our subjective interpretation of reality. They also saw the role of the observer as crucial to the process of scientific inquiry and believed that consciousness was a fundamental aspect of the universe. However, it should be noted that idealism was not a universally embraced perspective among scientists of the twentieth century.
