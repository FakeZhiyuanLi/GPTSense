1. Black-box testing: This approach involves testing the software without knowledge of its internal workings. Testers focus on the functionality and output of the software, comparing expected results to actual results.2. White-box testing: In contrast to black-box testing, this approach involves testing the software with knowledge of its internal workings. Testers focus on the code and design of the software, looking for potential errors or inefficiencies.3. Automated testing: This approach involves using software tools to run pre-scripted test cases on the software. This approach can save time and effort compared to manual testing, especially for large or complex programs.
