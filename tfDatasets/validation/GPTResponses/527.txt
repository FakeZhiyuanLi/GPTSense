A flat-bottomed ship design typically refers to a barge or a flat-bottomed boat, which is characterized by its flat, rectangular hull with no keel. These types of vessels are often used for carrying cargo or transporting large volumes of materials on rivers, canals, and other shallow bodies of water where deeper-draft vessels cannot navigate. Some of the common types of flat-bottomed boats and barges include deck barges, push boats, towboats, and riverboats.
