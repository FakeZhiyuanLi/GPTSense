Sadat had a complicated relationship with Israel. Initially, he was an enemy of Israel and was even involved in the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. However, as president of Egypt, he sought peace with Israel and in 1978 signed the historic Camp David Accords with Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin, which led to a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. This move earned him both admiration and animosity within the Arab world. Unfortunately, Sadat's peacemaking efforts also led to his assassination in 1981 by Islamic extremists who saw his peace treaty with Israel as a betrayal of the Arab cause.
