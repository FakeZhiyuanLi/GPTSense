Socioeconomic factors and enduring views on race have led to systemic inequalities and discrimination for certain racial groups. These inequalities and discrimination can manifest in many ways, including limited educational and employment opportunities, lower income and wealth accumulation, health disparities, and unequal treatment by law enforcement and criminal justice systems. These factors can also contribute to ongoing racial tensions and a lack of social cohesion.
