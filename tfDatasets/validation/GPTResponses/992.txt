In quantum mechanics, the quantity which is canonical conjugate to time is energy. This means that if we have a particle with a well-defined energy, its position in time becomes uncertain and vice versa. This is described by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which states that the product of the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time is always greater than or equal to a certain minimum value. Therefore, in quantum mechanics, a particle cannot have a precisely defined energy and a precisely defined time simultaneously.
