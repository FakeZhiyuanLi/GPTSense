One of the major environmental consequences that affected the Australian economy by 1983 was the degradation of land and soil. Soil degradation, which includes soil erosion, salinization, and other forms of land degradation, resulted in decreased agricultural productivity and loss of biodiversity, which negatively affected the economy. This was mainly due to the unsustainable land use practices that were prevalent in the country, such as overgrazing, deforestation, and inappropriate crop cultivation. The loss of soil fertility led to reduced crop yields and crop failures, which, in turn, led to reduced income for farmers and decreased exports for the country. The degradation of land and soil also had adverse environmental impacts, such as increased greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution, and loss of habitat for wildlife.
