Animal communication is defined as the exchange of information between animals through the use of signals such as vocalizations, body language, pheromones, and chemical signals. It encompasses various forms of communication including social, reproductive, and defensive behaviors, and is critical for survival, reproduction, and cohesion within animal groups. Animal communication occurs within and across species and can vary greatly between different types of animals, from simple organisms such as bacteria to complex animals such as mammals and birds.
