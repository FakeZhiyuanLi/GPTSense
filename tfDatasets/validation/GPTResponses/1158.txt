The Ottoman Empire had control over various types of states, including vassal states which were nominally independent but paid tribute and provided military support autonomous provinces which had some degree of self-rule but were still under Ottoman control and governorates which were directly administered by Ottoman officials. Additionally, the Ottoman Empire had suzerainty over other territories, such as Yemen and the Persian Gulf coast.
