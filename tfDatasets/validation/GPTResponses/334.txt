There were several historical figures and governments that released new lighter coinage that caused significant amounts of inflation due to the decrease in weight. One notable example is Henry VIII of England, who issued a new debased silver coin called the "testoon" or "groat" in 1544. The weight was reduced from 60 grains to 45 grains, and the coin was soon devalued even further to 30 grains. This led to significant inflation and economic turmoil in England during the mid-16th century. Another example is Emperor Diocletian of Rome, who introduced the "edict on maximum prices" in 301 AD, which attempted to control inflation by fixing prices and manipulating the silver content of coins. However, the resulting debasement and decrease in weight of Roman coins caused even greater inflation and economic instability.
