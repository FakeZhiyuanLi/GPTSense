he called "human genetic diversity." He argued that the concept of race was a socially constructed one and did not accurately represent biological variation within and between populations. Instead, he suggested that genetic differences were better understood in terms of individual and population variation, rather than through the lens of race or skin color. Lewontin's work challenged previous assumptions about race and genetics, highlighting the need for more nuanced and scientifically accurate discussions of both topics.
