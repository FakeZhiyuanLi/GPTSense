The area that was part of Brigantes tribal area varied over time, as the Brigantes were a powerful and widespread tribe in ancient Britain. Generally speaking, their territory extended across much of what is now northern England, from the Humber estuary in the south to the Scottish borders in the north. They likely gained dominance over this area in the late Iron Age, around 100-50 BCE, and remained a significant force until the Roman conquest of Britain in the 1st century CE. However, specific dates for when particular areas were part of Brigantes territory are not always clear, as the tribe's influence and boundaries likely shifted over time.
