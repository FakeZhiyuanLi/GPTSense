The Battle of Badr is thought to have helped Muslims learn to write. During that battle, many prisoners were taken and the Muslims realized that they needed to keep careful track of who was being held captive and for what reason. As a result, they began to write down the names of prisoners and other important information. This marked the beginning of the development of the Arabic script, which would eventually become the basis for the written language of Islam.
