Two languages that have the possibility for significant mutual intelligibility are Spanish and Portuguese. Both languages belong to the Romance language family and share a similar vocabulary and grammar structure. Speakers of one language can often understand a significant amount of the other language, especially if they have some knowledge of the other language or are exposed to it frequently.
