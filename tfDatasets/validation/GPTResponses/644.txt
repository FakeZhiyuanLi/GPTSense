Secondary education was introduced in the United States to provide students with additional education beyond elementary school to prepare them for higher education or vocational training. The 19th century saw a shift in the type of work available to Americans, from agricultural to industrial, which increased the demand for specialized knowledge and technical training. As a result, public high schools were established to provide students with the necessary knowledge and skills to pursue higher education and succeed in the workplace. Additionally, secondary education was seen as a way to decrease child labor and increase the literacy rates of young people.
