The justification for the subordination of certain groups, such as indigenous people or people of color, was often tied to the belief in the superiority of certain racial, ethnic, or cultural groups. Categorizing human groups allowed for the hierarchical ranking of different groups based on perceived differences. This ranking was used to justify discrimination, colonization, and even enslavement of certain groups by those who deemed themselves superior. Categorizing groups also allowed for the creation of stereotypes and negative biases which perpetuated these inequalities.
