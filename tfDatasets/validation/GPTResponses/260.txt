A gymnast's difficulty score is based on the difficulty and execution of their routine. Factors that are taken into consideration include the number and difficulty of skills performed, the execution and precision of those skills, and the artistry and presentation of the routine. The judges will also consider any deductions for mistakes or errors made during the performance. The difficulty score is added to the execution score to give the total score for the routine.
