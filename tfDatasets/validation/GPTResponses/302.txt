A lot of modern anthropologists in the West came to view racial designation as a social construct rather than a biological reality. They argued that racial categories are not based on inherent genetic differences but rather are created and maintained by social and cultural practices. They also pointed out that race is not a fixed and immutable characteristic but is rather fluid and subject to change over time and across different contexts. This view has been supported by scientific research, which has shown that there is far more genetic variation within racial categories than between them.
