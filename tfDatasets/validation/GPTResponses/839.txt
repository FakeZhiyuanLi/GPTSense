Testing software cannot fully and completely establish the absence of defects or errors in a software system. While testing is important in identifying potential issues within a program, it cannot guarantee that all possible errors have been found or that there are no undiscovered defects in the software. Additionally, testing cannot ensure that a software system will perform as expected in all possible scenarios or under all possible conditions. Other factors, such as user behavior, environmental factors, and hardware limitations can play a role in how a software system performs.
