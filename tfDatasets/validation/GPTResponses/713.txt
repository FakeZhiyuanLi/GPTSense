In case of an emergency such as a power outage, hydraulic elevators have a series of safety mechanisms to ensure the safety of the passengers. These mechanisms include hydraulic buffers, which are essentially large shock absorbers that will safely stop the elevator car from falling too quickly.Another safety feature is the emergency brake system that can stop the elevator in the event of a malfunction. The elevator may also have an emergency lowering system that allows the car to be manually lowered to the nearest floor using a hand crank or other manual mechanism.Additionally, most hydraulic elevators are equipped with emergency communication systems such as intercoms or phones, that allow passengers to communicate with building security or emergency services if necessary.
