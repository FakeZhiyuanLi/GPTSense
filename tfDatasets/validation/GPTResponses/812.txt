The total energy of a system can be calculated by summing up the potential energy and the kinetic energy of all the objects in the system. The formula to calculate the total energy is:Total energy = potential energy + kinetic energyPotential energy = mgh (mass x gravity x height)Kinetic energy = 1/2mv^2 (1/2 x mass x velocity squared)Where:m = mass of the objectg = acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s^2)h = height of the object above its reference levelv = velocity of the objectOnce you have calculated the potential and kinetic energy of all the objects, add them together to get the total energy of the system. Note that this calculation assumes that there are no external forces acting on the system that would cause it to lose or gain energy.
