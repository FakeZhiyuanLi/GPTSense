Haecceity (pronounced hek-see-it-ee) is a philosophical concept that refers to the unique and irreducible qualities that define an individual or object. It is often described as the “thisness” or the “whatness” of something – the qualities that make it distinct and separate from everything else in the world. Haecceity is a key idea in the philosophy of John Duns Scotus, who believed that each individual object or person has a unique and essential nature that cannot be fully captured by any general category or concept.
