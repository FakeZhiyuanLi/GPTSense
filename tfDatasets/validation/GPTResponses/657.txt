The development and design of Chelsea Barracks has stirred controversy for multiple parties, including architects Richard Rogers and Prince Charles. In 2009, Prince Charles wrote a letter to the Qatari royal family, who owned the site, criticizing the modernist designs proposed by Richard Rogers and calling for a more traditional design. This led to Rogers being fired from the project and a redesign by a different architectural firm. The controversy also sparked debate over the role of architecture in preserving traditional styles and the influence of royal intervention in urban planning.
