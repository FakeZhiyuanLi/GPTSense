Maximilian's death resulted in the collapse of the Second Mexican Empire and the end of French intervention in Mexico. Mexican forces, led by President Benito Ju√°rez, were able to defeat the remaining French troops and restore the Mexican Republic. Maximilian's death also had international implications, as it brought a new level of tension between Mexico and European powers, particularly France.
