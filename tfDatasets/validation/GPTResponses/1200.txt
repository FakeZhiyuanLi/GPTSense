Paris helped develop the Romantic style of art with painters like Théodore Géricault. This style emphasized emotion, imagination, and individualism, as well as a fascination with nature and the supernatural. Géricault's most famous work, "The Raft of the Medusa," is an example of Romantic art that depicts a dark and intense subject matter with vivid brushstrokes and dramatic lighting.
