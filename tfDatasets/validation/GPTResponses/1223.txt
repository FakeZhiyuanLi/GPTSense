The United States was initially excluded from the League of Nations Council because its President, Woodrow Wilson, was unable to convince the U.S. Senate to ratify the Treaty of Versailles, which included the formation of the League of Nations. The Senate was concerned about the loss of national sovereignty and refused to approve the treaty, preventing the United States from joining the league as a founding member.
