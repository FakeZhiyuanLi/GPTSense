This practice is not common in modern times and is frowned upon in many cultures. In the past, inheritance practices varied depending on cultural and social norms. In some cultures, the eldest son was entitled to inherit the entire family fortune, while in others, the inheritance was divided equally among all children. It is not accurate to say that any one family member commonly sent an adult married offspring away with their portion of the family's fortune.
