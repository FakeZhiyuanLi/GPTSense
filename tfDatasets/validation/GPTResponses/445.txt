One thing that strongly differentiates the French from some other populations across Europe is their language. French is a Romance language and is only spoken in France and in some former French colonies. The French culture, cuisine, arts, and traditions are also unique and distinguishable from other European cultures. Additionally, the French have a reputation for being more formal and reserved in social interactions compared to other cultures.
