The notable idealist who was responsible for a "world ground" theory was German philosopher, Immanuel Kant. In his book "Critique of Pure Reason," Kant argues that there must be a fundamental and universal principle that grounds all knowledge and experience, which he called the "transcendental unity of apperception" or the "world ground." According to Kant, this principle is necessary to explain how we are able to have objective knowledge of the world around us.
