Jews and Christians were offered protection in the form of assistance such as laws and regulations that guaranteed their safety and rights, the establishment of ghettos for Jews to live in, the creation of Jewish councils to govern their communities, and the provision of humanitarian aid and support from religious organizations and individuals. However, it is important to note that these measures were often inadequate and insufficient in protecting Jews and Christians from persecution and violence during periods of religious conflict and turmoil.
