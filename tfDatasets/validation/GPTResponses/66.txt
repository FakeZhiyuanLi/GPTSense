A stereotype of traditional anthropologists is that they are predominantly white, male, and Euro-American, who conduct research on primitive or exotic cultures in distant places. They are often portrayed as detached observers, who study cultures and societies with an outsider perspective and attempt to categorize and classify them based on Western concepts and values. They are also sometimes criticized for presenting an overly simplistic or static view of other cultures and failing to consider the complexities and diversity within those societies.
