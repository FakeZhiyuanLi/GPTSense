There have been several causes of mass parrot poisonings attributed to zinc, including:1. Zinc-coated cages: Many parrot cages are made with zinc-coated wire, which can be harmful if the parrot chews on the wire or ingests small flakes of zinc that come off the wire. Over time, the buildup of zinc in the parrotâ€™s system can lead to poisoning.2. Zinc-containing toys: Some toys made for parrots contain small amounts of zinc, which can be toxic if the parrot chews on the toy and swallows small pieces of the metal.3. Zinc-containing food and water bowls: Parrots that eat and drink from zinc-containing bowls can absorb small amounts of the metal over time, leading to toxicity.4. Improper diet: Parrots that are fed a diet that is deficient in certain vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients may be more susceptible to zinc toxicity. Zinc is an important mineral that is needed in small amounts, but excessive amounts can be harmful.5. Environmental contamination: Parrots can be exposed to zinc through environmental contamination, such as inhaling zinc dust or fumes from industrial sources, which can cause acute or chronic poisoning.
