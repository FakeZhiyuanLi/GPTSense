The odometer cart was used to measure the distance covered by a vehicle such as a horse carriage or a car. By keeping track of the distance traveled, the odometer helped the driver or owner estimate how much fuel would be required for the journey and how much wear and tear the vehicle had undergone. It also allowed for more accurate taxation of vehicles based on the distance they traveled.
