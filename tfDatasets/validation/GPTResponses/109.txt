Neither Aristotle nor Plato believed that the senses were less important. Instead, they both acknowledged the importance of the senses in their philosophical theories. Plato believed that the true reality lies beyond what can be perceived by the senses, but he also acknowledged that the senses can provide us with knowledge of the physical world. Aristotle believed that the senses were necessary for obtaining knowledge of the world around us and for scientific inquiry.
