The time evolution of the wave function is defined in terms of the energy operator as a time derivative. This is known as the time-dependent Schrödinger equation:iħ∂/∂t|ψ⟩=H|ψ⟩where i is the imaginary unit, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, t is time, |ψ⟩ is the state of the system, and H is the Hamiltonian operator representing the total energy of the system. This equation describes the dynamics of a quantum system and allows us to calculate the probability of measuring a certain outcome of a measurement.
