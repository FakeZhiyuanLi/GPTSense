The concept of the introduction of laws of radiant energy was developed by Max Planck in 1900. He proposed that electromagnetic radiation is emitted and absorbed in discrete packets of energy, called quanta or photons. This revolutionary idea laid the foundation of modern quantum mechanics and has had a significant impact on our understanding of the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic level.
