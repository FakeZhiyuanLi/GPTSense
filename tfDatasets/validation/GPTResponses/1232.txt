After the Cold War, several European powers focused on rebuilding their economies. These included Germany, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom. These countries invested heavily in infrastructure, technology, and education to improve their economies and compete globally. They also formed economic unions, such as the European Union, to encourage trade and cooperation among member states. These efforts ultimately led to a period of economic growth and prosperity throughout Europe.
