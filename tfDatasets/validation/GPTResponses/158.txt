the neocortex or cortex, which is the outer layer of the brain that is responsible for complex cognitive processes such as perception, thought, and language. The neocortex is much larger and more complex in mammals, particularly primates, compared to other vertebrates. This allows mammals to have higher cognitive abilities and adapt to a wider range of environments.
