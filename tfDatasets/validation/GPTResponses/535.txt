Hippocrates, the ancient Greek physician, believed that the same natural forces that governed the universe also influenced the human body. He believed that illness resulted from an imbalance in these natural forces and that a physician's role was to help restore this balance through treatments such as diet, exercise, and herbs. This ideology became known as the theory of the Four Humors, which identified four bodily fluids (blood, yellow bile, black bile, and phlegm) that needed to be in balance for good health.
