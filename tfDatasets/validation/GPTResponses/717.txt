Private schooling can typically be the most expensive type of schooling. Private schools often have higher tuition fees than public schools, and also may require additional costs for uniforms, textbooks, and other materials. Boarding schools, which provide residential accommodations for students, can be even more expensive. Additionally, private schools may offer additional programs or services that come with extra fees, such as specialized courses, tutoring, or extracurricular activities.
