The superior colliculus is related to the visual control of vertebrates. It plays a major role in directing eye movements towards visual targets and in coordinating visual responses with other sensory modalities, such as auditory and somatosensory inputs. It also contributes to the detection and orientation of visual stimuli in the environment, and is involved in attentional and orienting reflexes.
