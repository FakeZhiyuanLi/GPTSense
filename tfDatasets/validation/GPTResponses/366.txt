The boundary for the Triassic is set by the end-Permian mass extinction event, which occurred approximately 252 million years ago and wiped out approximately 90% of all marine and terrestrial species. This event marked the end of the Paleozoic Era and the beginning of the Mesozoic Era, which includes the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous periods.
