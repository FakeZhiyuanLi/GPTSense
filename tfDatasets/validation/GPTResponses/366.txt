Samurai were traditionally affiliated with the ruling class in feudal Japan, known as the daimyo. They were also closely associated with the military and were primarily responsible for protecting their lord's land and property, as well as fighting in battles and wars. Samurai were also deeply connected to the code of honor and values known as bushido, which emphasized loyalty, courage, and self-discipline. Additionally, many samurai were also involved in other aspects of Japanese society, such as art, literature, and philosophy.
