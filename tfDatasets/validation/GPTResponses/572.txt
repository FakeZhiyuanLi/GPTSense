Neoclassicism in art typically involved an emphasis on clarity, simplicity, and order. As such, individual features were often portrayed in a more idealized and stylized manner, with an emphasis on geometric shapes and symmetry. The use of chiaroscuro (the treatment of light and shade) was also important in neoclassical art, as it helped to create an illusion of depth and solidity in the portrayal of individual features. Emphasis was also placed on the use of straight lines rather than curves, further contributing to the flattened and stylized appearance of neoclassical art.
