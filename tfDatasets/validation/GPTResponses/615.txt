The court in France was styled for more modern design after 1771 by Marie Antoinette, the Queen of France. She was a patron of the arts and embraced the Rococo style in interior design and fashion. She promoted a more relaxed and informal atmosphere in the court, which was reflected in the design of the interiors, furniture, and clothing. She commissioned the construction of several new buildings, including the Petit Trianon, which was designed in the neo-classical style. Her influence on the court in France paved the way for the more progressive and artistic styles that would emerge in the 19th century.
