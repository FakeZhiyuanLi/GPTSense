One textbook that rejected race as a valid concept in anthropology since 1932 is "Anthropology: An Introduction to the Study of Man and Civilization" by Ralph Linton. Another textbook is "The Races of Mankind" by Ruth Benedict and Gene Weltfish, published in 1943. Both of these textbooks argued that race is a socially constructed concept with no basis in biology.
