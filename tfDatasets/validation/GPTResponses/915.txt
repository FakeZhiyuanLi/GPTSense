One advantage of using the black-box method is that it allows for a more objective and unbiased approach to testing, as the tester does not have access to the internal workings of the system. This can help to surface bugs and issues that might be missed with a more traditional testing approach. Additionally, because the tester is not directly involved with the development process, they can provide valuable feedback from a user perspective, which can lead to a more user-friendly and effective end product.
