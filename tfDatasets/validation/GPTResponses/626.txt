The French architect who designed important neoclassical structures in the 1760s was Jacques-Germain Soufflot. He is best known for his design of the Panthéon in Paris, which was completed in 1790, and which became a model for neoclassical architecture throughout Europe. Soufflot also designed the Church of Sainte-Geneviève in Paris, which was later renamed the Panthéon.
