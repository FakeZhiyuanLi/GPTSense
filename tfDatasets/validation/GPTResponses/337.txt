The tone or delivery of the message can alter the intended meaning. For example, if a message is meant to be sarcastic or humorous, but the tone is flat or serious, it may be taken at face value and not understood as intended. Similarly, if the message is delivered in a patronizing or condescending manner, it may come across as insincere or offensive. Cultural differences and language barriers can also alter the intended meaning of a message.
