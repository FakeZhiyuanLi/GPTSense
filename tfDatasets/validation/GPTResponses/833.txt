Proponents of the use of racial categories in biomedicine believe that it makes it possible to identify genetic and physiological differences among different racial groups that can have important implications for medical treatment and care. They argue that by studying racial differences in disease susceptibility, drug response, and other medical outcomes, researchers can develop more tailored and effective treatments that take into account the unique needs and characteristics of different populations. They also maintain that categorizing patients according to race can help to reduce health disparities and increase access to care for marginalized and underrepresented communities. Finally, proponents of racial categories in biomedicine argue that these categories serve as a useful and necessary tool for medical research, allowing researchers to accurately describe and compare different populations in order to better understand the complex interplay between genetics, biology, and disease.
