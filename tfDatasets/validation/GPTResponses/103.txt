Plato's Phaedo and Apology both contain ideas about the mind.In Phaedo, Plato presents his concept of the soul or mind as being separate from the physical body. He argues that the soul or mind is immortal and continues to exist even after death. According to him, the mind or soul is superior to the body and is the cause of knowledge or wisdom. Plato believed that the mind must be trained to understand the true reality that exists beyond the physical world.In Apology, Plato presents Socrates arguing that the mind is the source of knowledge and wisdom. Socrates believed that true knowledge and wisdom could not be obtained through physical sensations and experiences. Instead, knowledge could only be obtained through the use of reason and rational thought.Overall, Plato's ideas about the mind in Phaedo and Apology emphasized the importance of the mind in gaining knowledge and wisdom, and the immortality of the mind beyond the physical body.
