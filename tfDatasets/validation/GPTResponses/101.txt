The sovereignty of the szlachta in Poland ended with the adoption of the Constitution of May 3, 1791, which introduced a more centralized and modern government structure. This was followed by the partitions of Poland by neighboring powers in the late 18th century, which ultimately led to the dissolution of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the loss of independence for Poland.
