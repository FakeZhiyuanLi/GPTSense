Alloys are used to make stamping dies because they have better properties than pure metals. Alloys are a combination of two or more metals, and they can be engineered to have specific properties that make them ideal for use in stamping dies.Some of the properties that make alloys better for stamping dies include:1. Hardness - Alloys can be made harder than pure metals, which helps them withstand the pressure and wear of stamping.2. Wear resistance - Alloys can be engineered to be more resistant to wear than pure metals, which helps them last longer.3. Thermal conductivity - Alloys can be designed to have better thermal conductivity than pure metals, which helps them dissipate heat during the stamping process.4. Corrosion resistance - Alloys can be made more resistant to corrosion than pure metals, which helps them last longer and maintain their shape and function.Overall, alloys are the preferred material for stamping dies because they have better properties than pure metals and can withstand the demands of the stamping process.
