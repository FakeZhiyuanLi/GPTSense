There are several arguments about high rates in education, including:1. Economic burden on students and families: High rates in education create economic burden on students and their families, especially those who come from low-income backgrounds. These students may end up taking out large student loans to pay for their education, which could result in long-term debt.2. Inequality: High rates in education contribute to inequality in society, as they limit access to education for students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. This perpetuates the cycle of poverty and limits social mobility.3. Market-driven approach: High rates in education reflect a market-driven approach to education that prioritizes profit over education. This approach may lead to universities and colleges focusing on attracting more students and raising fees, rather than providing high-quality education.4. Unreasonable expectation of return on investment: High rates in education reflect an expectation of a significant return on investment, both for students and educational institutions. This expectation may not be realistic, especially given the current job market and economic conditions.5. Impact on student well-being: High rates in education can have a negative impact on the well-being of students, particularly those who are struggling financially. These students may experience stress, anxiety, and depression, which can affect their academic progress and future prospects.
