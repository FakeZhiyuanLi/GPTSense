The Paris Urban Area was not created by one specific person or organization, but rather through a process of urbanization and expansion over many centuries. Paris has been a major city since the Roman era, and has grown and evolved over time through various political, social, and economic changes. The modern Paris Urban Area is the result of years of urbanization and development, and includes not only the city of Paris itself, but also the surrounding suburbs and towns that have grown and merged with the city over time.
