Samurai did not start schools, but they did attend and support various schools of martial arts, literature, poetry, and calligraphy that were established during the feudal era in Japan. These schools, known as "ryu" or "koryu," were often affiliated with specific samurai clans and taught various skills that were considered necessary for a samurai's education and training. Some famous samurai schools include the Tenshin Shoden Katori Shinto-ryu, the Yagyū Shinkage-ryū, and the Musō Jikiden Eishin-ryū.
