Plotinus was a Neoplatonic philosopher who believed in the existence of a transcendent reality that was beyond the physical world. He believed that the universe was structured in a hierarchy of being, with the ultimate reality being the One or the Good. Plotinus emphasized the importance of contemplation and inner spiritual development as a means of attaining knowledge of this transcendent reality. He was deeply influenced by Plato and Aristotle, as well as earlier Neoplatonic thinkers such as Porphyry and Numenius.
