It is a character encoding system that assigns unique numerical codes to represent letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and other characters used in digital communication. The ASCII code includes 128 standard characters, each represented by a 7-bit binary number. ASCII is widely used in computers, telecommunications, and other electronic devices to represent and transmit text data.
