Insectivorous insects are generally beneficial to humans. They help control the populations of other insects that may pose a threat to crop or garden plants, homes, or human health. Examples of beneficial insectivorous insects include ladybugs, lacewings, and praying mantises. However, some insectivorous insects, such as mosquitoes, can transmit diseases to humans, making them harmful. Overall, the benefits of insectivorous insects outweigh the risks they pose to humans.
