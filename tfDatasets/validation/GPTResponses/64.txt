people eat, how they procure, prepare and consume food, and how this affects their health and wellbeing. They examine the cultural, social, and historical factors that shape food practices and the beliefs and values that influence food choices. Nutritional anthropologists also study the impact of colonialism, globalization, and other political and economic forces on the food systems of different communities. They explore how food consumption patterns change over time and in response to changing economic, social, and environmental conditions. Overall, their work sheds light on the complex relationships between food, culture, and society.
