Older notions of race were primarily used to justify colonialism, slavery, and discrimination against non-white individuals. These notions were based on the idea that different races had inherent qualities that made them superior or inferior to others.In the 18th and 19th centuries, European colonial powers used the concept of race to justify the subjugation of indigenous peoples and the exploitation of resources in their colonies. The notion of white superiority was also used to justify the transatlantic slave trade, which saw millions of Africans forcibly transported to the Americas to work as slaves.In the United States, race was used to justify segregation and discriminatory policies against African Americans during the Jim Crow era. This included denying them access to education, housing, and voting rights based solely on the color of their skin.Overall, older notions of race were used to oppress and discriminate against non-white individuals, and these harmful beliefs have had lasting effects on society.
