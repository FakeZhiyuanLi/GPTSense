During the reign of Wang Mang, the use of the wuzhu coin was interrupted due to the introduction of a new currency system. Wang Mang introduced a new series of coins known as the Daqian currency, which replaced the wuzhu coin. The Daqian currency consisted of bronze coins that were larger in size and had a higher value than the wuzhu coin. This new currency system led to confusion and uncertainty among the people, and it was not widely accepted, which ultimately contributed to the downfall of Wang Mang's regime.
