In feudal Japan, the samurai placed great importance on continuing their family line and the absence of a son was considered a serious matter. Some options for a samurai who could not divorce their wife included:1. Taking a concubine: Samurais were allowed to have concubines who could provide them with a son to carry on the family name. However, the offspring of a concubine did not have the same social status as that of a legitimate child.2. Remarry: If divorce was not possible, a samurai could choose to take another wife who could bear him a son.3. Adopting a son: Samurais could adopt a boy and make him their heir, raising him as their own son. The adopted son would then take on the samurai's family name and carry on the family line.4. Accepting a daughter as the heir: In some cases, a samurai could choose to accept his daughter as the heir and train her in martial arts and other skills that were traditionally reserved for men.5. Resigning from his position: In extreme cases, a samurai who was unable to produce a son could choose to resign from his position and end his family line. This was considered an honorable option.
