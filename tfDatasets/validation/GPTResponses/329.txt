Realists have a worldview that contrasts with that of idealists in the ordinary sense of the word. Realists believe that the world is objectively real and can be studied through systematic observation and analysis. They focus on practical and tangible solutions to real-world problems, rather than abstract ideals or theories. In contrast, idealists believe that the world is shaped by our ideas and beliefs, and that subjective experience is more important than objective reality. They prioritize abstract ideals and principles, often at the expense of practical considerations.
