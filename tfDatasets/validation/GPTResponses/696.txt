Informal learning occurs outside the traditional classroom or formal training setting. It can take place in various locations such as at home, in the workplace, while socializing with friends, while traveling, or through online resources such as blogs, tutorials, and videos. It can also occur during everyday experiences and activities such as hobbies, reading books, watching TV, or exploring new places.
