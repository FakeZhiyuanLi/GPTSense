The counterpart to NATO is the Warsaw Pact. The Warsaw Pact was a military alliance formed in 1955 by the Soviet Union and its satellite states in Eastern Europe. Its purpose was to counter the influence of NATO and provide mutual defense among the communist countries of Europe. The Warsaw Pact was dissolved in 1991, following the collapse of the Soviet Union.
