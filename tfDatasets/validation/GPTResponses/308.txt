Most definitions of population rely on the concept of a group of individuals of the same species living in a particular geographic area at a given time. The definition may also take into account factors such as age distribution, genetic diversity, and reproductive ability of the members of the population. Additionally, some definitions may consider the relationship between the population and its environment and ecology.
