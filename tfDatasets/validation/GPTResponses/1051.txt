There is no historical event or record of one-third of East Prussia's population being wiped out during the early 1700s. East Prussia did suffer significant losses during the Great Northern War (1700-1721), which was a conflict between Russia, Denmark-Norway, and Sweden. However, the population loss was not as high as one-third. Other factors that affected the population of East Prussia during the time included famines, epidemics, and emigration.
