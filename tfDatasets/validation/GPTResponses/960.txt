Operational acceptance focuses on ensuring that a system or application can be supported and maintained effectively in a live environment. It involves testing the system's compliance with operational requirements such as performance, reliability, security, compatibility, and scalability. Its main focus is to ensure that the system meets the operational needs of the business and is manageable by the operational team. Operational acceptance testing is typically performed by the IT operations team, and the results are used to determine whether a system is ready for deployment or release to production.
