Quality control processes: These are the processes used to verify that the delivered software conforms to the required quality standards and meets the customer's expectations.4. Quality metrics: These are the measurements used to evaluate the effectiveness of software quality processes and the quality of the software product.5. Quality audit: This is a systematic examination of the software development process and product to ensure that the quality standards are being followed.6. Software testing: This process involves the verification and validation of software to ensure that it works as intended and meets the specified requirements.7.
