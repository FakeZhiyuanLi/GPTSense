The practice of racial profiling has been ruled to be unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court, which has held that it violates the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, as well as the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court has also found that racial profiling violates federal law, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Fair Housing Act of 1968, as well as state laws that prohibit discrimination. Additionally, international human rights bodies, such as the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, have criticized the use of racial profiling and called on governments to take measures to eliminate it.
