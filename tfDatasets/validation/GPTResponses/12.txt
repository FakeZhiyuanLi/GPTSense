Iqbal's Allahabad Address, which he delivered in 1930, inspired several political and social movements in India. The address offered a new vision of Muslim identity and highlighted the importance of political representation for Muslims in an independent India. The speech was a call for Muslim unity and emphasized the need for Muslims to have their own separate state within India. This speech inspired the idea of the creation of Pakistan, which eventually became a reality in 1947. The address also inspired the Khilafat movement, which aimed to restore the Caliphate, and the Indian National Congress, which saw the importance of religious representation in a secular, democratic society.
