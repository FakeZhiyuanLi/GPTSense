The Greeks in Homer's poems were at odds with the Trojans. The conflict between Greeks and Trojans is the central theme of Homer's epic poem, the Iliad. The war between the two sides, known as the Trojan War, was sparked by the abduction of Helen, the wife of Spartan king Menelaus, by Trojan prince Paris. The Greeks, led by Agamemnon, launched a full-scale attack on Troy to retrieve Helen and avenge her kidnapping.
