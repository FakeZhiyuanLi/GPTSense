?It is difficult to give a specific answer without more context, as etchings and engravings were produced in many different countries around 1800. However, some of the major centers of printmaking during this time period included France (especially Paris), England (especially London), Germany (particularly in Augsburg, Nuremberg and Frankfurt), and the Low Countries (Netherlands and Belgium). Additionally, artists from other countries, such as Italy and Spain, also produced important prints during this time.
