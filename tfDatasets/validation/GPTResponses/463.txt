the State?Henry George Tucker, an American anarchist and individualist philosopher, argued that Hegel's philosophy involved the worship of the State. He believed that Hegel's ideas placed a high value on the supremacy of the State and subordinated individual freedom to the authority of the State. Tucker was critical of this perspective, as he believed that individual liberty should be the highest value for society.
