In the Ottoman Empire, many young boys were often apprenticed to learn a trade or took up jobs such as farming, herding animals, or working in workshops, as well as studying religious and cultural subjects with an imam. Some boys also served as pages in the palace or as soldiers in the Janissary corps.
