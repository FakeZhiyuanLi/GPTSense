One of the most elevated values among the Grecian society was excellence in all aspects of life, including philosophy, sports, art, and military prowess. This concept was known as "arete", which emphasized the pursuit of excellence, virtue, and moral uprightness. The Greeks believed that achieving excellence in one's life was the ultimate goal, and this required a combination of physical, mental, and moral strength.
