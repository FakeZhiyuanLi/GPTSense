The differences among human groups became a focus of science in the 19th century, particularly with the development of anthropology as a discipline. There was a growing interest in studying human variation and cultural differences, which led to the development of theories such as social Darwinism and scientific racism. However, these approaches have since been widely discredited and rejected in modern scientific discourse, which emphasizes the importance of acknowledging and celebrating human diversity without reinforcing harmful stereotypes or biases.
