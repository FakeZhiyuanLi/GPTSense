In early Islamic history, copies of the Quran were typically kept in mosques, which served as community centers for Muslims. Those who could not afford their own copy of the Quran could go to the mosque to read or hear the Quran being recited. Mosques also served as centers for Islamic education and scholarship, and many Muslims would come to learn about the Quran and other religious texts from scholars and teachers who were based in the mosque. Over time, copies of the Quran were also distributed to households and individuals, and became a fixture in many Muslim homes.
