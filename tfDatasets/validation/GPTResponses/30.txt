Portugal engaged in two major conflicts during the 20th century:1. Portuguese Colonial War (1961-1974): a conflict fought between Portugal and the nationalist movements in its African colonies of Angola, Guinea-Bissau, and Mozambique. The war was marked by guerrilla warfare, massacres, and ethnic conflicts.2. World War II (1939-1945): Portugal was officially neutral during the second world war. However, in 1943, Portugal signed agreements allowing the Allied Powers to use its air and naval bases in the Azores. Portugal also provided crucial intelligence to the Allies, including information about German U-boats.
