Blind auditions are expected to eliminate gender or racial prejudice. In blind auditions, the judges or evaluators do not know the identity, gender, or race of the performers. They only judge the performance based on its quality and merit. This method ensures fair and unbiased evaluation and eliminates any kind of discrimination based on gender or race.
