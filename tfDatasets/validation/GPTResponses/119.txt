The zinc-zinc oxide cycle is a thermodynamic cycle that involves the conversion of zinc metal and zinc oxide. It is a chemical process in which zinc oxide is electrolyzed to yield zinc metal and oxygen gas. The zinc metal can then be used to reduce water to hydrogen gas, and the zinc oxide can be regenerated by reacting it with the hydrogen gas. This cycle is often used in solar power plants to store energy in the form of hydrogen, which can then be used to generate electricity. It is essentially a chemical reaction that allows the capture and storage of solar energy.
