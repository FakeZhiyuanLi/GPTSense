There is no definitive answer to this question, as Spielberg has not publicly stated which video game he played first. However, it is widely known that he is a fan of video games and has been involved in the production of several video game adaptations of his films, including "Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings" and "Minority Report: Everybody Runs." Some sources speculate that his first video game experience may have been with classic arcade games such as "Pac-Man" or "Space Invaders," which were popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s when Spielberg was first gaining prominence as a filmmaker.
