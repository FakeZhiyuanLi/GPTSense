The scientific doctrine that caused some physicists to embrace idealism is the uncertainty principle, which is a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics. The uncertainty principle states that the more precisely the position of a particle is known, the less precisely its momentum can be known, and vice versa. This principle implies that it is impossible to know the precise state of a quantum particle until it is observed, and therefore reality is constructed through observation. This idea, combined with other aspects of quantum physics, led some physicists to believe in the idea of an observer-dependent reality, suggesting that the physical world is ultimately a creation of our minds. This view is known as quantum idealism or quantum subjectivism.
