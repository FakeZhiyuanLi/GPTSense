defines biological variability within the human species.Livingston believed that races are biologically distinct and can be differentiated based on physical and behavioral traits. He argued that these differences are genetically based and can be used to define and classify human populations.Dobzhansky, on the other hand, believed that race is a social construct and does not accurately reflect the biological variability within the human species. He argued that genetic differences between populations are not fixed and constant, but rather complex and continuous. He believed that humans are too genetically similar to be classified into distinct racial groups.Overall, while Livingston and Dobzhansky may have disagreed on the validity of the race concept, both recognized the importance of understanding human biological variability and the complex factors that contribute to it.
