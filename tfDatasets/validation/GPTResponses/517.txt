The inspirations for the new phase of neoclassicism were centered in Europe, particularly in France and Italy, during the second half of the 18th century and the first half of the 19th century. This movement was a reaction to the excesses of the Baroque and Rococo styles, and it aimed to revive the classical principles of beauty, order, and harmony in art and architecture. The neoclassical style emphasized clean lines, symmetry, proportion, and the use of classical motifs, such as columns, pediments, and friezes. The neoclassical movement also drew inspiration from the archaeological discoveries of ancient Greece and Rome, as well as the writings of classical authors, such as Homer, Virgil, and Horace.
