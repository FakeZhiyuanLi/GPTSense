The Ottoman Empire emerged from the tribal confederation of Turkic-speaking people who migrated from Central Asia to Asia Minor during the 11th century. They were initially a small state centered in Western Anatolia, which gradually expanded through conquest and diplomacy until it became a powerful empire that spanned three continents. The Ottoman dynasty was founded in 1299 by Osman I and lasted until the dissolution of the empire in 1922.
