It is estimated that approximately 75% of terrestrial species, including dinosaurs, became extinct during the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction event, which occurred about 66 million years ago. The exact number of species that went extinct during this event is difficult to determine due to incomplete fossil records, but it is estimated to be in the tens of thousands.
