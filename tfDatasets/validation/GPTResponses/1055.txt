The property of thorium oxide that has caused it to no longer be used in eyeglasses is its radioactivity. Thorium oxide is a radioactive material that can emit harmful radiation over time. This property makes it hazardous for use in eyeglasses, as it can pose a risk to the eyes and skin of the wearer. Nowadays, thorium oxide has been replaced by other non-radioactive materials, such as glass, plastic, and polycarbonate, for the production of eyeglasses.
