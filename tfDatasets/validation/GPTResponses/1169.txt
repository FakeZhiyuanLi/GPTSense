Weakness of the Ottoman military and economy: The Ottoman Empire was facing military and economic challenges due to their inability to modernize and keep up with advancements in Europe. This led to a decline in their military power and a struggling economy.2. Nationalism and Ethnic conflict: Ethnic tensions and nationalistic movements within the empire increased, creating unrest and instability. Some groups saw the empire as an oppressor and sought to break free and establish their own independent states.3. Loss of territory: The Ottoman Empire had been losing territory over a period of time. This meant the loss of people, resources, and revenue which put a strain on the empire.4. Political instability: The Ottomans faced internal conflicts and power struggles within the government that weakened the empire and led to poor governance.5. Western imperialism: In the 19th century, European powers began to expand their empires and influence into the Ottoman territories. This put pressure on the Ottomans to modernize and adapt, but they were unable to do so, ultimately leading to their decline.
