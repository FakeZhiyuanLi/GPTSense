The term "energy" was first introduced in 1807 by the Scottish physicist Thomas Young, who used it in his lectures at the Royal Institution in London. However, it was the German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz who popularized the term in the 1840s, as part of his research on the conservation of energy.
