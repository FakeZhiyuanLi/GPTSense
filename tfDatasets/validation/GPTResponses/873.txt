There are several possible answers to this question, as the influence of Greek descent in Japan could refer to different historical periods and cultural domains. Here are two examples:- In the 19th century, when Japan was opening to the world after centuries of isolation, many European intellectuals and scholars came to the country to teach Western sciences, arts, and ideas. Among them were several Greeks who became prominent figures in academia and diplomacy. For instance, Ioannis Theodoridis (1824-1905) was a Greek linguist and educator who helped establish the first modern university in Japan, the Imperial University of Tokyo, and designed the curriculum for its Department of Foreign Languages. Another Greek national, Georgios Pachymērēs (1830-1884), was a consul of Greece in Nagasaki and Tokyo, who is credited with introducing Greek literature and philosophy to Japanese intellectuals and translating Japanese works into Greek. Their influence helped Europeanize and internationalize Japanese culture, while also fostering exchanges between Greek and Japanese intellectuals.- In the artistic domain, the influence of Greek mythology and techniques can be seen in various forms of Japanese art, such as sculpture, painting, and pottery. One famous example is the Jōmon Dogū figurines, which were created around 1000 BC and show humanoid figures with exaggerated features, such as bulging eyes, elongated limbs, and animalistic masks. Some scholars have suggested that these figurines may have been inspired by the Greek concept of kouros (naked male youth) and kore (clothed female youth), which were popular in ancient Greek art. Another example is the use of the raku firing technique in Japanese ceramics, which was introduced in the 16th century by a Korean potter named Yi Sam-pyeong (Japanese: Chōjiro). Yi is said to have studied in China and to have been influenced by the Zen philosophy and the tea ceremony. However, some sources suggest that he also learned about raku from a Chinese merchant who had traveled to Greece and knew about the terra sigillata (sealed earth) pottery of the Hellenistic era. Raku pottery, with its earthy and irregular forms, has become one of Japan's most distinctive art forms, and its name can be traced back to the Chinese word for "enjoyment" (lè), as well as to the Japanese pronunciation of the word "Greece" (gurīsu).
