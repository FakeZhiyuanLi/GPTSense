There is no specific book that directly inspired the renovation of Notre Dame Cathedral. However, various books on the history, architecture, and art of the cathedral have been used as references and sources of inspiration by architects and designers involved in the restoration project. One of the most notable books is "Notre-Dame de Paris: The Cathedral of Notre-Dame" by Michael Camille and Malcolm Miller, which provides an in-depth exploration of the cathedral's history, art, and architecture.
