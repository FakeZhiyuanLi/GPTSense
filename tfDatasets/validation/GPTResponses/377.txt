The Enneads, a collection of writings by the philosopher Plotinus, believed that the concept of beauty might not have existence outside of the soul. According to Plotinus, beauty is a subjective experience that arises from the interaction between the soul and the object being observed. Therefore, it is possible that the concept of beauty only exists within the realm of the individual human soul and cannot be objectively defined or measured.
