Jidaigeki is a genre of Japanese film, television, and theater that focuses on historical dramas set in Japan's Edo period (1603-1868) or earlier. Jidaigeki translates to "period drama," and typically depicts samurai, geisha, ninjas, and other characters from Japan's feudal era. Jidaigeki films and television shows often include stylized fight scenes, elaborate costumes, and historical settings, and often explore themes of honor, loyalty, and duty. Some popular examples of Jidaigeki include the television series "Zatoichi" and films such as "Ran" and "Seven Samurai."
