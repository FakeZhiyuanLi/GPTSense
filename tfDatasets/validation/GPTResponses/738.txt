Some studies use the word race in the sense of categorizing people based on physical characteristics such as skin color, eye shape, and hair texture. This is often used to describe different groups of people based on their ancestry, cultural practices, and geographic origins. In some cases, race is also used in a more political or social sense to describe groups of people who share a common culture or experience discrimination based on their skin color or ethnicity. However, many scholars argue that race is a socially constructed concept and not a biological one, and thus it should be used with caution.
