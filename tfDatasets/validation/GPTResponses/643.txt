Secondary education emerged in the United States in the mid to late 19th century, when the country was experiencing a major shift from an agricultural to an industrial economy. This shift created a need for more skilled workers, and secondary education was seen as a way to provide the necessary training and preparation for students who would go on to work in skilled trades or attend college. The first public high school in the United States was established in Boston in 1821, and by the turn of the 20th century, secondary education had become a crucial part of the country's education system.
