Interest in solar water heating decreased in the 1980s primarily due to the decline in oil prices. With the availability of cheaper fossil fuels, people were less likely to invest in alternative energy sources like solar. The Reagan administration also cut funding for renewable energy research and development, which further reduced interest in solar water heating. Additionally, there were technical and logistical issues related to solar water heating systems, such as efficiency and maintenance concerns, which also contributed to the decline in interest.
