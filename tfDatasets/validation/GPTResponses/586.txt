There are several types of consciousness-related concepts that are similar to consciousness but not identical, including:- Self-awareness: the ability to recognize and reflect upon one's own thoughts, emotions, and experiences.- Sentience: the capacity to perceive and feel sensations, such as pain, pleasure, and hunger.- Mindfulness: the ability to be aware and present in the moment, without judgment or distraction.- Awareness: the state of being conscious of something, such as an external stimulus or an internal thought.- Wakefulness: the state of being alert and responsive to one's environment.
