The gene distribution that decreases as you move away from the equator in either direction is the gene for skin pigmentation. The closer you are to the equator, the more intense the sunlight, which results in darker skin pigmentation to protect against UV radiation. As you move further away from the equator, the sunlight intensity decreases, so there is less need for darker pigmentation. As a result, the gene for lighter skin pigmentation becomes more prevalent.
