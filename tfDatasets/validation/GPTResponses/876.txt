Tennessee politics became more competitive again in the middle of the 20th century due to a combination of factors.Firstly, the rise of the Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s and 1960s challenged the dominant Democratic Party's stance on racial segregation, leading to the formation of the Republican Party as an alternative option for conservative and segregationist voters.Secondly, the decline of the Democratic Party's political machine in Tennessee, which had controlled state politics for decades, opened up the electoral arena to more competition from third-party candidates and independents.Thirdly, the increasing urbanization and demographic changes in Tennessee, particularly in Nashville and Memphis, brought in new voting blocs such as African Americans and progressive white voters, who challenged the traditional power structure of the conservative Democratic Party.Together, these factors created a more diverse and competitive political landscape in Tennessee that allowed for multiple parties and candidates to compete for power and influence in state government.
