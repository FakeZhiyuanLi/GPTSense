Star Wars: A New Hope is often compared to the Japanese movie "The Hidden Fortress" (隠し砦の三悪人), directed by Akira Kurosawa. It is said that director George Lucas was inspired by the film's use of a lowly servant to act as a guide, the story's focus on the struggles of common people, and the use of sweeping action scenes.
