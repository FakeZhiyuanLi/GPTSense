Glass ceramics have a lot of similarities with traditional ceramics, including the use of high temperatures to shape and mold the material to desired shapes and forms. They can also be similar to glass in terms of their transparency and heat resistance. Additionally, glass ceramics can be made from similar raw materials as traditional ceramics, including clays, silicates, and other minerals.
