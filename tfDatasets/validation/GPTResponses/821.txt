The main function of direction lanterns is to provide directional guidance or signal to ships and marine vessels traveling in water bodies. These lanterns help in guiding boats, ships, and other vessels to avoid collisions and to navigate through narrow channels or treacherous waters. Direction lanterns can also indicate the presence of hazards such as rocks, shoals, or cliffs, and help boaters steer clear of them to prevent accidents.
