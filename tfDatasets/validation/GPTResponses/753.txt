The term "samurai" originally referred to a class of military nobility in Japan. These individuals were skilled in martial arts, particularly swordsmanship, and served as retainers and warriors for feudal lords. The literal translation of "samurai" is "those who serve" or "ones who serve in close attendance to nobility."
