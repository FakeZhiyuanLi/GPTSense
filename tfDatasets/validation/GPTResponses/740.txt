In the 7th century, the Japanese wore various types of armor depending on their social status and military role. The most common type of armor was the lamellar armor or kozane, which consisted of small rectangular plates tied together with silk or leather cords. Some high-ranking warriors also wore solid plate armor known as tanko. Both types of armor were usually made of leather, iron or bronze. The armor was often decorated with intricate designs and symbols and worn with a helmet, mask and other protective gear such as arm and leg guards.
