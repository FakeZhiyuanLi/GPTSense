Unalloyed zinc is not commonly used in construction applications because it is relatively soft and weak. It is also susceptible to corrosion when exposed to moisture or harsh environments. Instead, zinc is often combined with other metals to form alloys that have improved strength, durability, and corrosion resistance. These alloys are used in a variety of construction applications, such as roofing, cladding, and structural components. Some common zinc alloys used in construction include zinc-aluminum, zinc-copper, and zinc-nickel.
