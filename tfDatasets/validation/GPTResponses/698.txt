Informal learning can take place anywhere and at any time. It can occur during conversations with friends or colleagues, while completing a project, through observation and imitation, trial and error, or while browsing the internet. Common examples of informal learning settings include homes, workplaces, communities, libraries, museums, and online platforms.
