Finding a difference in disease prevalence between two socially defined groups does not necessarily imply that the cause of the disease is related to social factors. It could be due to genetic factors, environmental factors, or a combination of both. Additionally, correlation does not always imply causation, so even if there is a strong association between social factors and disease prevalence, it does not necessarily mean that one factor causes the other. Further research is needed to determine the causal relationship.
