Some software converts ASCII characters to their corresponding binary values in order to process and manipulate them in digital systems. Other software may use ASCII characters as a reference or input for specific operations, such as text editing or file formatting. Some software may also interpret ASCII characters differently depending on the encoding used, such as UTF-8 or ISO-8859.
