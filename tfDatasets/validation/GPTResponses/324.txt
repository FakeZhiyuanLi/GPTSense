Phenomenology is a philosophy that was influenced by the German idealistic tradition. It was founded by Edmund Husserl, who was a student of Franz Brentano, a philosopher in the tradition of German Idealism. Phenomenology aims to describe and analyze subjective experiences and consciousness without making any assumptions about the nature of reality. It was later developed by philosophers such as Martin Heidegger and Maurice Merleau-Ponty.
