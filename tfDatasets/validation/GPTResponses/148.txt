The support of linguistic institutions, academic communities, language experts, publishers, and governments can result in a dialect being standardized. These groups typically have a vested interest in setting standards for a language in order to promote its use and facilitate communication. Standardization may involve creating a standardized written form, creating a standard set of grammatical rules and vocabulary, and establishing guidelines for pronunciation and pronunciation variation. Over time, these standards may become widely accepted and adopted, leading to further standardization of the dialect.
