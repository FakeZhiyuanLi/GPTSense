Portugal did not fall into any taifa, as taifas were small independent Muslim states that emerged in the Iberian Peninsula after the collapse of the Caliphate of Cordoba in the 11th century. Portugal, as we know it today, did not exist until the 12th century, when it emerged as an independent kingdom under King Afonso Henriques after a successful rebellion against the Kingdom of Leon. However, during the period of Muslim rule in the Iberian Peninsula, which lasted from 711 to 1492, the territory that is now Portugal was part of the Umayyad Emirate of Cordoba and later the Almoravid and Almohad Empires.
