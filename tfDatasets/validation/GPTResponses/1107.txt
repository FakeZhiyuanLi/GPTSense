Homeless shelters may receive funding from a variety of sources, including government grants, private donations, fundraising events, and corporate sponsorships. Some shelters may also be operated by non-profit organizations that receive funding from a combination of these sources. Additionally, some cities and municipalities may allocate funds specifically for homeless services and shelters.
