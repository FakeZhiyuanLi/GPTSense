Ecological niches. These niches include specific habitats, resources, and interactions with other species that more complex organisms can exploit due to their advanced adaptations and abilities. For example, larger animals may be able to access higher levels of vegetation or hunt larger prey than smaller organisms, and organisms with specialized digestive systems can harness energy from particular types of food sources. Such adaptations allow complex organisms to fulfill unique roles in their ecosystems and coexist with other species.
