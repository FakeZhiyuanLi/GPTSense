The Lagrangian formalism is generally more convenient for non-conservative systems. This is because the Lagrangian takes into account all the forces acting on a system, even if they are not conservative. The Lagrangian includes the dissipative forces that cause energy to be lost from the system, such as friction or air resistance.On the other hand, the Hamiltonian formalism is based on the concept of energy conservation, which assumes that the system is conservative. It only works for systems in which the total energy is conserved, and it does not take into account dissipative forces.Therefore, for non-conservative systems, the Lagrangian formalism is preferred as it provides a more complete description of the system's behavior.
