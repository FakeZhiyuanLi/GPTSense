Lieberman and Jackson suggest that authors of some studies use the term race in various ways, including:1. As a biological category: Some authors use race to refer to genetic differences between populations of humans.2. As a social construct: Others use race to describe a socially constructed category that is based on perceived physical differences and cultural factors.3. As a proxy for other factors: Some authors use race as a proxy for other factors, such as socioeconomic status or access to healthcare, which may be more directly related to health outcomes.4. As a source of health disparities: Finally, some authors use race to describe the role that racial discrimination and structural inequalities play in creating health disparities across populations.
