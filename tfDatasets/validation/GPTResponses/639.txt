Infrastructure or amenities may be generally unable to support variations in the number of people for a particular destination. For example, a small town with limited parking space and small roads may struggle to accommodate a sudden influx of tourists during peak season. Similarly, a small restaurant with a limited number of seats may struggle to serve a large group of people at once.
