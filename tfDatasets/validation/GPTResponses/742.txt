The discrepancy between developed and less developed countries refers to the unequal distribution of economic, social, and political resources between countries. Developed countries have higher levels of economic growth, advanced technologies, higher education levels, better healthcare infrastructure, political stability, and stronger market economies. On the other hand, less developed countries face several challenges such as high poverty rates, low academic achievements, weak healthcare systems, political instability, low economic growth, and poor infrastructure. The disparities between developed and less developed countries have been attributed to historical, cultural, and economic factors as well as unequal opportunities and policies.
