The existence of three million non-European people in France has forced issues of immigration, integration, and diversity onto the French policy agenda. The French government has had to grapple with questions about how to integrate immigrants into French society, and how to address tensions and discrimination that arise from cultural differences. There has also been debate about the impact of immigration on the French economy, job market, and social services. Additionally, there have been concerns about the rise of far-right movements in France, which have exploited anti-immigrant sentiments and called for stricter immigration policies. Overall, the presence of a large and diverse immigrant population has forced France to confront difficult questions about multiculturalism, identity, and inclusion in the 21st century.
