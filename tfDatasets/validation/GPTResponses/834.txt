Testing cannot completely find all possible defects in software. Some defects may be hard to detect, require specific conditions to occur, or may not be testable at all. Additionally, testing cannot guarantee that a software system is completely bug-free, as there may be rare and unusual scenarios or combinations of actions that were not anticipated during testing. Moreover, testing cannot ensure that the software meets all customer needs and requirements since some customers might have unique needs or preferences that differ from the majority of users.
