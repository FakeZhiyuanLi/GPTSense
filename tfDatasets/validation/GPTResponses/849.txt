The first step that may lead to a software failure is inadequate or incomplete requirements gathering and analysis. This can result in incomplete or incorrect specifications, which may lead to design and implementation errors. Additionally, poor communication and collaboration among team members, unclear project goals and timelines, and poor testing and verification processes can also contribute to software failures.
