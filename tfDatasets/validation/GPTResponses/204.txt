Hume argued that we cannot know the future by inductive reasoning. He claimed that just because something has happened in the past does not necessarily mean that it will happen in the future. This is known as the problem of induction. According to Hume, our belief in causation is based on habit and custom rather than on any rational justification. Therefore, we cannot know for certain that our predictions about the future will be accurate.
