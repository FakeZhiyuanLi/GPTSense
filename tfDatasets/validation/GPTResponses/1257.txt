The revolution that sparked the end of the Ottoman Empire was called the Young Turk Revolution of 1908. The movement was led by a group of Ottoman intellectuals and military officers who aimed to modernize the empire and promote Turkish nationalism. They overthrew Sultan Abdulhamid II and established a constitutional monarchy. However, this revolution was just one of the factors that led to the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, as it was also weakened by economic decline, territorial losses, and defeat in World War I.
