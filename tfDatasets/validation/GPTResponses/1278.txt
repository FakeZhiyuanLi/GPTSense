The laws of the court system are based upon the Constitution of the United States of America, federal and state statutes, and judicial precedents established by previous court decisions. The court system operates on the principle of due process, which guarantees the rights of the accused and the opportunity for a fair trial. The court system also relies on the principle of stare decisis, which means that previous court decisions should be respected and followed unless there is a compelling reason to depart from them. The laws of the court system seek to uphold justice, protect individual rights, and maintain the rule of law.
