Passenger elevator capacities are typically dictated by a combination of factors, including the size and layout of the building or facility, the expected number of occupants, and local safety codes and regulations. Elevator manufacturers and installers will take into account the intended usage of the elevator, such as whether it will primarily serve residential or commercial purposes, as well as any special needs or accommodations that may be required, such as wheelchair accessibility or large equipment transport. Factors such as the speed and load-bearing capacity of the elevator will also be considered when determining the appropriate passenger capacity. Ultimately, the goal is to ensure that the elevator is safe, efficient, and able to meet the needs of its intended users.
