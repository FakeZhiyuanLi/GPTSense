The process that ultimately uses gravitational potential energy in the creation of heavy elements is known as stellar nucleosynthesis. In this process, stars fuse lighter elements together under immense pressure and temperature, releasing energy and forming heavier elements. As the star's fuel is exhausted, it undergoes a series of fusion reactions that eventually produce elements up to iron. However, elements beyond iron are created through a different process known as supernova nucleosynthesis, which occurs during the explosive death of a massive star. During a supernova, the gravitational potential energy released is so intense that it triggers the fusion of heavy elements up to uranium and beyond. These newly created elements are scattered throughout the universe, and some of them eventually become incorporated into the solar system and the Earth.
