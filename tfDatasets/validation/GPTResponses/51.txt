The subdivision of anthropology that seeks to understand the process of human communications is known as linguistic anthropology. This field studies the ways in which language is used by people in different cultures, as well as how language shapes and is shaped by social and cultural systems. Linguistic anthropologists also explore the relationship between language and thought, and how language is used to create and maintain social relationships, power dynamics, and identity.
