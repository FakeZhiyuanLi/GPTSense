At the end of the movie "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Jones confronts the villainous Walter Donovan and the treacherous Elsa Schneider in the Temple of the Holy Grail. Elsa attempts to grab the cup but falls into a chasm, while Donovan drinks from a cup he believes to be the Holy Grail and ages rapidly, decaying into dust. Jones chooses the correct cup, and its healing powers allow him to save his dying father. Jones and his father then ride off into the sunset, while Jones muses that there are some things that are more important than treasure.
