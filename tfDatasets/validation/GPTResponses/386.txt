ESC generally means "Escape" for graphical user interfaces and windowing systems. It is used to cancel a currently running operation or to exit a current menu or pop-up window. It is often mapped to a physical key on the keyboard, such as the Esc key located at the top left corner of most keyboards. The ESC key has become a standard convention across many operating systems and software applications.
