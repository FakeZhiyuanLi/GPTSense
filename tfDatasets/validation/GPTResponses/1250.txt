European capital in the Ottoman Empire resulted in increased economic and political influence for European powers in the region. These European powers, particularly Great Britain and France, invested heavily in Ottoman infrastructure, such as railways, telegraphs, and ports, and gained control over strategic commercial areas such as the Suez Canal. However, this also led to increased exploitation of Ottoman resources and a loss of sovereignty for the Ottoman Empire. European capital also brought about modernization and Westernization in certain aspects of Ottoman society, but also contributed to the decline of traditional industries and social structures.
