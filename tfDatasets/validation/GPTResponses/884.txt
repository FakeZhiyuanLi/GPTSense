Music - the study of music theory, composition, and performance6. Athletics - physical training and competition in sports such as wrestling, boxing, and track and field.The Romans also added some of their own educational practices, such as military training and legal studies, which became important areas of study for young Roman men.

Overall, the Roman education system was deeply influenced by the Greek model but adapted to suit the needs of Roman society.
