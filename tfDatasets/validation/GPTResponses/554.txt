The two seas that have been most central to Greek history are the Aegean Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. The Aegean Sea, located between Greece and Turkey, played a significant role in the development of ancient Greek civilization through trade, colonization, and the emergence of the powerful city-states. The Mediterranean Sea, on the other hand, was also of great importance as it allowed for the expansion of Greek influence and the establishment of colonies throughout the Mediterranean basin, as well as the spread of Greek culture and ideas. Additionally, the Mediterranean provided a vital route for commerce and trade, making it a critical economic resource for ancient Greek states.
