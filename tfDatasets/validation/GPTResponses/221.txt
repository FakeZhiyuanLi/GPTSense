It is difficult to determine an exact percentage of Italians who spoke standard Italian when Italy was first unified in 1861. At that time, Italy had several regional dialects and languages, such as Tuscan, Venetian, Neapolitan, and Sicilian. Standard Italian, based on the Florentine dialect, was predominantly spoken by the educated and upper classes. It took several decades for standard Italian to become more widely established as the national language of Italy.
