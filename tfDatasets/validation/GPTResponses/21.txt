Subject committees can be established at any time or stage of an organization's operation, depending on their specific needs and objectives. Some organizations establish subject committees during their initial planning stages, while others may create them later as part of their growth and expansion plans. Additionally, subject committees may also be formed periodically to address specific issues or challenges that arise within an organization. Ultimately, the timing and establishment of subject committees will depend on the organization's specific priorities and needs.
