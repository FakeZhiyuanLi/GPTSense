The Romioi (which means "Romans" in Greek) consider the Byzantine Empire to be their birthright. They view themselves as the cultural and ethnic descendants of the Byzantine Greeks, who inhabited the Byzantine Empire from the 4th century CE until its fall in the 15th century. The Romioi also draw influences from ancient Greek culture and from the Orthodox Christian faith.
