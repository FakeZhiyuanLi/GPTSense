Many programmers keep their computers on 24/7, as it can take a significant amount of time to launch all the necessary tools and setup required to work, and leaving the computer on allows them to quickly jump back into work. Additionally, some tasks, such as compiling code, can take a long time, so programmers may leave their computers running overnight to complete these tasks. Some also prefer to leave their computers on for maintenance tasks such as automatic updates and virus scans.
