There is no direct "zinc equivalent" of the Grignard reaction. The Grignard reaction involves the reaction of an organic halide with magnesium in the presence of an ether, followed by the addition of the resulting Grignard reagent to a carbonyl compound. Zinc is not typically used in this reaction. However, zinc can be used in certain other reactions as a reducing agent, such as in the reduction of ketones and aldehydes to alcohols using zinc and hydrochloric acid.
