According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 295,000 women died during and following pregnancy and childbirth in 2017. However, the vast majority of these deaths were preventable and were due to complications such as severe bleeding, infections, high blood pressure during pregnancy, and unsafe abortions. The risks of maternal mortality vary by region, with the highest rates occurring in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. It is important to prioritize access to quality healthcare, especially for pregnant women and new mothers, to prevent unnecessary deaths.
