Political economy in anthropology applies historical materialism to understand the relationship between economic structures, social relations, and political power in human societies. Historical materialism is a theoretical framework that views social and economic development as being determined by the material conditions of a given society, including its modes of production, distribution, and exchange of goods and services. In this approach, political economy in anthropology seeks to examine the ways in which economic and political institutions interact in shaping human behavior, and how these institutions have evolved historically over time.Anthropologists who apply historical materialism to political economy often focus on analyzing the ways in which economic structures and processes shape social relations of power and inequality. They may study the role of capitalist economies in shaping global relations of power, for example, or they may examine how subsistence economies function within local communities. They may also analyze the ways in which economic institutions influence cultural practices and beliefs, such as the role of gift-giving in traditional societies. Overall, the application of historical materialism to political economy helps anthropologists better understand the complex relationships between economic, social, and political systems in different societies.
