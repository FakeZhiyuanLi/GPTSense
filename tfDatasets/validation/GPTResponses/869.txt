Software developers often run automated tests to keep testing to a minimum. This allows them to quickly and easily test key functionalities and catch any glitches or errors before releasing the software to the public. By doing so, they can ensure that the software is as error-free as possible without the need for extensive manual testing. Additionally, developers may use a variety of techniques, such as agile development, to prioritize testing and ensure that the most important features are thoroughly tested before release.
