Samurai began to become less warrior-like during the Edo period in Japan, which lasted from 1603 to 1868. During this time, Japan was mostly at peace, and samurai began to focus more on intellectual pursuits and cultural activities rather than combat. Additionally, the government implemented strict social codes and regulations that limited the samurai's ability to engage in violence, further leading to their transformation from warriors to bureaucrats and administrators.
