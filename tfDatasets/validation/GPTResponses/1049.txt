During the Middle Ages, the Prussian lands were under the jurisdiction of various Baltic tribes such as the Prussians, Yotvingians, and Sudovians. However, in the late 13th century, the Teutonic Order conquered the Prussian lands and established a state known as the State of the Teutonic Order or the Teutonic Knights. The territory was divided into several different administrative units, including the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Kingdom of Poland, and the duchies of Pomerania and Prussia. Eventually, the Prussian state became a kingdom in 1701, and it was ruled by the Hohenzollern dynasty until its dissolution after World War II.
