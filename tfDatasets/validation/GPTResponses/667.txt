Samurai wives spent most of their time on household management and raising children. They were responsible for household chores such as cooking, cleaning, and caring for the family's clothes. They also provided emotional and psychological support to their husbands, as well as fulfilling social obligations such as hosting guests and arranging marriages for their children. Additionally, some samurai wives also received education and training in martial arts and strategy so they could support their husbands during times of war.
