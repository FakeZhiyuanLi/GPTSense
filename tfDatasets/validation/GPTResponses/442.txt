The concept of the sublime is linked to Boullee's ideas. Edmund Burke's essay "Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful" was published in 1757 and explored the emotional and psychological effects of nature and art on the human mind. Boullee's architecture, particularly his designs for funerary monuments and cenotaphs, were intended to evoke feelings of awe and grandeur in the viewer, similar to the effects of the sublime. Boullee believed that architecture could communicate ideals and emotions beyond the physical structure, and his work often utilized monumental size and scale to achieve this effect.
