The effects of human-animal interactions on both humans and animals are a major focus of anthrozoological research. This includes the social, psychological, physiological, and overall well-being effects of these relationships. Studies may also examine the implications of animal-assisted interventions, the role of animals in human society, and the ethical considerations of human-animal interactions.
