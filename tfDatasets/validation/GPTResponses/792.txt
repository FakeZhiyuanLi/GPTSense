The period from the 5th century BCE to the 3rd century BCE, known as the Classical period, marked the expansion of Greek thinking and expression. During this time, Greek philosophers, writers, and artists made significant contributions to fields such as philosophy, literature, theatre, art, and architecture. This was also the time when Athens emerged as a cultural and intellectual center, producing some of the greatest minds in history, including Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Sophocles, Euripides, and Aristophanes. The Classical period is considered a Golden Age of Greek culture and has had a lasting impact on the modern world.
