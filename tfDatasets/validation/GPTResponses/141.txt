Tribology is the field of study that deals with the study of how materials, including alloys containing zinc, wear out. It involves the study of friction, lubrication, and wear in various mechanical systems, including metals, ceramics, polymers, and composites. Researchers in tribology use a variety of experimental techniques and analytical tools to investigate the performance of materials and coatings under different operating conditions, such as temperature, load, and velocity. This helps in understanding the mechanisms of wear and developing new materials with improved wear resistance.
