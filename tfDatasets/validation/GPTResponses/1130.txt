The quartiers sensibles (sensitive neighborhoods) refers to areas in France that are considered to be socially and economically disadvantaged. There is no set definition of what constitutes a quartier sensible, but typically they are characterized by high levels of poverty, unemployment, crime, and social exclusion.While there are many neighborhoods throughout France that could be considered quartiers sensibles, two that are often cited as being among the most problematic are:1. Seine-Saint-Denis: This department (or region) just north of Paris is home to several quartiers sensibles, including the infamous banlieue of Saint-Denis. The area has long been plagued by poverty, crime, and a lack of opportunities for its residents.2. Marseille: The port city of Marseille in southern France is another area with a high concentration of quartiers sensibles. These neighborhoods are often marked by gang violence, drug trafficking, and social unrest. The city has struggled to address the issues facing these areas, which some argue stem from a long history of neglect and marginalization.
