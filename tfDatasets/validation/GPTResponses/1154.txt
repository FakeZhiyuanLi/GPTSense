Conquests by Sultan Selim I (also known as Selim the Grim) began the transformation of the Ottoman sultanate into an empire. He conquered the Safavid Empire (modern-day Iran) and extended Ottoman rule into the Arabian Peninsula, Egypt, and North Africa. Selim also assumed the title of Caliph, making himself the religious leader of Sunni Islam and elevating the status of the Ottoman Empire to that of an Islamic empire.
