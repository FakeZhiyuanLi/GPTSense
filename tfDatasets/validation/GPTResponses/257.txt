Many individuals have speculated about the observable differences among different groups of humans, including historians, philosophers, anthropologists, and psychologists. However, some of the most controversial and widely criticized speculations have come from pseudo-scientific theories such as eugenics and scientific racism, which claimed that certain races or groups of humans were biologically inferior to others. It is important to note that such claims have been thoroughly debunked and discredited by modern science, which has shown that there is no biological basis for race and that humans are fundamentally more similar than different at the genetic level.
