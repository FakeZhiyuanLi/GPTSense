The early Greek states were characterized by a period of political decentralization, where numerous city-states emerged and developed their own unique dialects and cultures. This development occurred over a prolonged period, spanning several centuries, which makes it challenging to give credit for the language and cultural differences among the Greek states. Additionally, the Greek language evolved continuously, with various dialects emerging and also some language changes being influenced by external factors such as invasions and contacts with other cultures. This evolution created further differences among the various Greek states, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact origins of the Greek language and culture.
