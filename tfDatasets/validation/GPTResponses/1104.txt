Tajwid describes rules for the proper pronunciation and articulation of Quranic verses without any grammatical or linguistic errors. This includes rules for correct pronunciation of each letter, the proper elongation or shortening of syllables, proper stopping and pausing, and correct emphasis on individual words and letters. Tajwid is essential for the correct recitation of the Quran and is considered to be a cornerstone of Islamic learning.
