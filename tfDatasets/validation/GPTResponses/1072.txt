After World War II, a series of agreements were reached between the Allied Powers and the Soviet Union that effectively separated East Prussia from Germany. Part of the agreement was the redrawing of the eastern German border and the inclusion of East Prussia into the Soviet Union under the name Kaliningrad Oblast. The German population of East Prussia was expelled, and the territory was resettled with Soviet citizens. The separation of East Prussia from Germany was a significant result of the Potsdam Conference in 1945.
