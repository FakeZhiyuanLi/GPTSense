According to Shia Muslims, the only one who can fully know the Quranic interpretation is the Imam, who is appointed by Allah to guide and lead the Muslim community. They believe that only the Imams have the knowledge and authority to interpret the Quran accurately and provide guidance to the ummah (Muslim community).
