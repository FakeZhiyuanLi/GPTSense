After the freedom was won by the Greeks, it was Solon who was of importance in forming the rules. Solon was a wise statesman and poet who was appointed as the archon of Athens in 594 BCE. He introduced a set of reforms that helped to establish democracy in Athens. Solon's reforms focused on reducing the power of the aristocracy, promoting justice and equality, and establishing a fair legal system. He also laid the foundation for Athenian democracy by establishing the Council of Four Hundred, which was composed of representatives from all classes of citizens.
