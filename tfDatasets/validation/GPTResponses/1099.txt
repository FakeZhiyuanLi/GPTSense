The discipline that concerns the way the Quran is correctly recited is called "Tajweed." Tajweed is the set of rules and guidelines that govern the proper pronunciation and intonation of the Quranic text. It aims to preserve the integrity and authenticity of the Quranic recitation by ensuring that every letter and sound is pronounced accurately and with the correct rhythm and melody. Tajweed is considered an essential skill for Muslims who want to recite the Quran with excellence and devotion.
