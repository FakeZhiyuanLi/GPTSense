Combinatorial testing, also known as pairwise or orthogonal testing, consists of selecting a small subset of test cases from a large number of possible combinations of variables or inputs. This is done by systematically combining values of variables or inputs in pairs, and testing all possible combinations of those pairs to identify any faults or defects. Combinatorial testing is based on the principle that a majority of faults in a system can be identified by testing a relatively small number of combinations of inputs or variables. It reduces the number of test cases required to achieve high test coverage, thus saving time and resources while improving the overall effectiveness of testing.
