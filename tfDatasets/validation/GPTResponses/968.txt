The most common interpretation of the word "ummi" as applied to Muhammad in the Quran is that he was an unlettered or illiterate person who did not receive formal education. This is based on the Quranic verse (7:158) which describes him as "the Messenger of Allah and the Seal of the Prophets and Allah has full knowledge of all things. He it is who has sent among the unlettered ones a Messenger of their own."
