The introduction of Chinese arts and culture to Japan is believed to have been brought by Korean monks who traveled to Japan in the 6th century, along with the spread of Buddhism. However, it is also commonly believed that envoys from China's Tang Dynasty played a significant role in introducing Chinese culture to Japan during the Nara Period (710-794) and the Heian Period (794-1185).
