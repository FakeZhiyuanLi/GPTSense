There is no definitive answer to this question, as measuring the speed of a criminal justice system can be complex and subjective. However, some sources indicate that Italy had one of the slowest criminal justice systems in Western Europe in 2005. According to a report by the European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice, in 2004 the average time taken for a criminal case to reach a final judgment in Italy was 958 days, compared to an average of 174 days in France and 414 days in the UK. Italy has since implemented various reforms aimed at speeding up the judicial process, but it still has some of the longest waiting times for criminal trials in Europe.
