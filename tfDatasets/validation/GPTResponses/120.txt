An instrument commonly used to examine the microstructure of the brain is a microscope. There are several types of microscopes that can be used for this purpose including electron microscopes, light microscopes, and confocal microscopes. These instruments allow researchers to visualize and analyze the cellular and molecular components of the brain at a very high resolution, providing insight into the structure and function of neural circuits and networks.
