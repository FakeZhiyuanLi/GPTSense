Aetius was a Roman general and statesman who served as the commander-in-chief of the Roman army during the late 4th and early 5th centuries AD. He played a significant role in the defense of the Western Roman Empire against invading barbarian forces, and is regarded as one of the last great Roman generals. Aetius served as a consul, a magister militum (master of soldiers), and a patrician during his career. He was also a skilled diplomat, and negotiated alliances with various barbarian tribes in order to protect the Roman Empire from invasion. However, his political rivals eventually conspired against him, and he was assassinated in 454 AD.
