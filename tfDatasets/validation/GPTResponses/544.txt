There is no single or definitive answer to this question as there were many different types of meditation practices that were used by samurai during different times in history or by different individuals. Some of the more prominent types include Zazen or sitting meditation, which involves focusing on the breath and emptying the mind, and Kinhin or walking meditation, which involves maintaining mindfulness and awareness while walking in a slow, deliberate manner. Other practices may have included visualization, chanting, or the use of martial arts as a form of meditation. Ultimately, the specific type of meditation practiced by samurai would have varied depending on individual beliefs, preferences, and training.
