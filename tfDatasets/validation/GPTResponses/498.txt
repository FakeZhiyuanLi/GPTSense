Non-African groups of human population may only drive from a subset/sample of the African population that migrated out of Africa and spread across the rest of the world. These early migrants are believed to have left Africa around 60,000 years ago and carried with them a subset of genetic diversity present in the African population they left behind. This subset of genetic diversity has been used to infer the origin of non-African populations and their evolutionary history.
