Before the discovery and use of anesthesia, patients undergoing surgery would not typically receive any form of pain relief. They were either restrained or given a strong alcoholic beverage to numb them, and the surgery was performed as quickly as possible.However, as surgery became more complex and longer in duration, doctors began to experiment with different methods of pain relief. As early as the 16th century, opium and other narcotics such as ether were used to dull the senses during surgical procedures.In the mid-19th century, the use of ether and chloroform became more widespread and were hailed as revolutionary discoveries in the field of surgery. These substances were administered through inhalation, and patients were rendered unconscious for the duration of the procedure.Today, a variety of anesthetics are used depending on the type of surgery and the patient's medical history. These can range from local anesthetics that numb a specific area to general anesthesia that puts the patient completely to sleep.
