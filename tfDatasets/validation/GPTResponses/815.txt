In the past, race has sometimes been used in clinical settings to diagnose and treat certain medical conditions. For example, sickle cell anemia is more commonly found in people of African descent, and thalassemia is more frequently diagnosed in people of Mediterranean or Southeast Asian ancestry. However, this practice has increasingly been criticized as it can lead to racial stereotyping and overlooking important genetic and environmental factors that affect health outcomes. Healthcare providers are encouraged to take a more individualized and holistic approach when diagnosing and treating patients, rather than relying solely on race as a factor.
