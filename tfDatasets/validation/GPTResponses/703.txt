During the Tokugawa period in Japan (1603-1868), several factors were added to the criteria for marriage. These included:1. Socioeconomic status: Marriage became increasingly subject to considerations of social class and wealth. Restrictions were placed on who could marry based on their family background and occupation, and higher-ranking samurai were expected to marry someone of equal or higher status.2. Age: There were specific age limits for marriage, with men allowed to marry at the age of 25 and women at 20. Marrying outside of these ages without permission could result in punishment.3. Family compatibility: Marriages were often arranged by families, and many considerations were made to ensure that the two families were compatible. This included factors such as reputation, social status, and compatibility of personalities.4. Fertility: With the importance of producing heirs, fertility became an important consideration in marriage. Women who were known to be infertile were often avoided as potential brides.5. Loyalty to the clan: Marriages were also used as a way to strengthen alliances between clans, and loyalty to one's clan was an important consideration in choosing a spouse.Overall, the Tokugawa period saw a greater emphasis on social and political considerations in marriage, rather than simply personal attraction or compatibility.
