During the Han dynasty (206 BCE to 220 CE), there is no record of the government providing housing to landless indebted peasants. However, the Han government did implement various policies to address the issues faced by landless peasants, such as offering them food aid, reducing their taxes, and providing them with opportunities to work on communal lands. The government also encouraged the cultivation of new lands and organized large-scale irrigation projects to improve agricultural yields.
