Elevators may be routed one-by-one for a few reasons:1. Efficiency: By routing elevators one-by-one, the elevator system can distribute passenger traffic more evenly and efficiently. This helps to optimize the use of elevators and reduce wait times for passengers.2. Safety: Routing elevators one-by-one can also be safer, as it reduces the risk of overcrowding and helps to ensure that elevators are not overloaded beyond their capacity.3. Control: By routing elevators one-by-one, building operators can have greater control over the elevator system. They can monitor and manage elevator traffic to prevent backups and delays, and can even prioritize certain elevators for specific groups of passengers or during certain times of the day.Overall, routing elevators one-by-one can help to improve the overall performance and safety of the elevator system while providing a better experience for passengers.
