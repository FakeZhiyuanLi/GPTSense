Darwin arrived at his conclusions through observation, experimentation, and analysis. He spent several years on the HMS Beagle, a ship that explored the world, making observations about the plants and animals he encountered. He also read extensively about the work of other naturalists, such as Charles Lyell and Thomas Malthus.Through these observations, he began to formulate his theory of natural selection. According to this theory, species evolve over time through the gradual accumulation of small changes that are advantageous for survival in a particular environment. These changes are passed down from generation to generation, leading to the development of new species.Darwin's theory of natural selection was based on a vast amount of data and evidence that he collected over many years. He published his findings in his book "On the Origin of Species" in 1859. His ideas were controversial at the time, but they revolutionized the field of biology and continue to be influential today.
