Low-speed elevators, which are widely used in residential buildings, hospitals, and small commercial buildings. These elevators are designed to travel at slower speeds, usually under 200 feet per minute, and have a lower capacity of up to 10 people or 1,000â€“2,000 lbs. They are often hydraulic or geared traction elevators, rather than the high-speed gearless traction elevators commonly found in skyscrapers.
