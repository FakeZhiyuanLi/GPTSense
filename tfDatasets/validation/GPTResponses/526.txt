is called "family resemblance," meaning that members of the category share common features but not necessarily all of them. For example, the category of "fruit" may include apples, bananas, and strawberries, even though they have different shapes and colors, because they all share the feature of being edible and containing seeds.Risch believes that recognizing the structure of imperfect categories can help us better understand how language and thoughts are organized in our minds, and how we perceive and interpret the world around us. It also allows for more flexibility and creativity in our thinking, as we can make connections and see relationships between seemingly unrelated ideas.
