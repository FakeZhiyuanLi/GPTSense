Emperor Huan alienated the bureaucracy during the Yellow Turban Rebellion crisis, which occurred in China during the late Han dynasty (184-205 CE). The Yellow Turban Rebellion was a peasant revolt against the government due to frustration with taxes and corruption. Emperor Huan's mishandling of the crisis and reliance on eunuchs to maintain power led to a breakdown in trust between the emperor and the bureaucracy.
