Schopenhauer believed that we were restricted to the limits of our own individual consciousness and perception, and that we could never truly know or understand the objective reality outside of ourselves. He believed that the world we experience is simply a representation or manifestation of our own subjective will and desires. As such, our understanding of truth and reality is limited by our own subjective perspective.
