Obsidian was used to make tools and weapons such as arrowheads, knives, scrapers, and spearheads in prehistoric times. The sharp edges of obsidian make it ideal for cutting and piercing, and its durability made it a valuable resource for early human communities. Obsidian was also used in rituals and as a trade item.
