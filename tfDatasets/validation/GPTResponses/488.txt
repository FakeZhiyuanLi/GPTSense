The rediscovery of ancient Greek and Roman art and architecture inspired the interior design of neoclassicism. The excavations at Pompeii and Herculaneum in the mid-18th century revealed a wealth of classical art and design that influenced neoclassical interiors. The excavations also led to the rediscovery of the ruins of the ancient Greek city of Athens and the Acropolis. The grandeur and order of classical architecture inspired neoclassical interiors, which often featured columns, pediments, and other architectural details replicated from ancient Greek and Roman buildings. Additionally, the rise of the Enlightenment in Europe led to a renewed interest in classical ideals such as balance, symmetry, and order, which influenced neoclassical interior design.
