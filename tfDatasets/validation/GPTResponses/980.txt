scientists call "dark energy." This dark energy is a type of energy that is believed to be driving the accelerating expansion of the universe. It is known as "dark" because it cannot be directly observed or detected through any known means, but its effects are thought to be pervasive throughout the universe. Dark energy is currently thought to make up about 68% of the total energy content of the universe.
