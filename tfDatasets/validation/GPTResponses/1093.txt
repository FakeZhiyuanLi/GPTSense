Those who did not comply with the Nazi's demands were often punished severely, either through torture, imprisonment, or death. The punishment would vary depending on the severity of the offense and the individual's circumstances. For example, Jews and other minority groups were often sent to concentration camps where they faced extreme persecution and sometimes death. Those who resisted Nazi occupation or participated in resistance movements were executed or sent to concentration camps. In short, the consequences for non-compliance with the Nazis were dire and often fatal.
