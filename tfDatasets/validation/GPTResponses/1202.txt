There were several factors that caused inflation in the Ottoman Empire, including:1. Wars and military campaigns: The Ottoman Empire was constantly involved in wars and military campaigns, which drained its financial resources and led to increased borrowing and taxation. This led to an increase in the money supply, which in turn led to inflation.2. Debasement of the currency: The Ottoman government debased its currency by reducing the amount of precious metal in its coins, and printing more paper money without sufficient backing in precious metal. This led to a decline in the value of the currency, and higher prices for goods and services.3. Population growth: The Ottoman Empire experienced a significant population growth during this period, which led to increased demand for goods and services, and a natural increase in prices.4. Trade imbalances: The Ottoman Empire had a trade deficit with Europe, meaning it imported more goods than it exported. This resulted in a drain on its precious metal reserves, and an increase in the money supply, which fueled inflation.5. Corruption and mismanagement: The Ottoman government was plagued by corruption and mismanagement, which resulted in inefficiencies, waste, and a misallocation of resources. This further exacerbated the inflation problem.
