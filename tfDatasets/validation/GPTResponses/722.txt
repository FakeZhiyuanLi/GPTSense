The permission that allowed trade between Japan and Indo-China was the Japan-Indo-China Treaty of 1940. This treaty allowed Japan to gain access to the natural resources of Indo-China, such as rubber, tin, and oil. In return, Japan promised to assist Indo-China in its defense against foreign aggression. However, this treaty eventually led to the Japanese occupation of Indo-China during World War II.
