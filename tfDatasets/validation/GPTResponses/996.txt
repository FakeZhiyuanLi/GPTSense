The method used to test software under a specific load is known as load testing. It involves simulating real-world user traffic and interactions to the software application or system to evaluate its performance and measure its response time, throughput, and resource utilization under different levels of load. The load testing can be done using various tools and techniques such as performance testing tools, cloud-based load testing services, and manual testing with actual user load. The objective of load testing is to ensure that the software application or system can handle the anticipated user load and meet the performance requirements of the intended users.
