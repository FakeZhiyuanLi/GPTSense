The original affluent society refers to prehistoric and pre-agricultural societies that lived in relative abundance and had a high quality of life despite having few material possessions. These societies were often characterized by a high level of social equality, a strong sense of community, and a close relationship with their natural environment. Some examples of such societies are the !Kung and the Hadza people of Africa, the San people of Southern Africa, and the Inuit people of the Arctic.
