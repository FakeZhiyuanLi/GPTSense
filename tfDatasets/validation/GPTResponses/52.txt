Applied anthropology initiates practical and real-world action to solve problems and address social, cultural, economic, or environmental issues. This may involve conducting research, implementing policies or programs, offering consultation to stakeholders, advocating for change, or engaging in community development, among other actions. The aim is to use anthropological knowledge and methods to make positive impacts in diverse contexts and settings.
