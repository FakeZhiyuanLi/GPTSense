Hume believed that our beliefs are based on our experiences and perceptions, and are therefore subjective and influenced by cultural and historical context. He argued that we cannot have certain knowledge of anything beyond our immediate experiences, and that our beliefs are constantly subject to revision based on new evidence and reason. Additionally, Hume believed that human nature leads us to make certain assumptions and generalizations that underpin our beliefs, but cautioned against relying too heavily on these without questioning their validity.
