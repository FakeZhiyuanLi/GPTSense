Kierkegaard argued that reality can not be a system for everyone, but rather for the individual. He believed that each individual experiences reality subjectively and that there can be no objective system that can capture the complexity and uniqueness of human existence. Therefore, he argued that the individual must make meaning of their existence through their own subjective experiences and personal decisions.
