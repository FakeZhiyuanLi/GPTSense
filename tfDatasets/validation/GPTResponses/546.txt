It is difficult to give an exact number as it depends on the level of dissimilarity being measured and the specific populations being studied. In general, a larger number of genetic markers will provide more comprehensive information and increase the accuracy of the analysis. Many studies use hundreds or even thousands of markers to capture the full genetic diversity of populations.
