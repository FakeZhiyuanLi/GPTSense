Archaeology is considered a branch of anthropology in most academic institutions and universities around the world. In the United States, for instance, archaeology is often taught as a subfield of cultural anthropology, along with linguistic anthropology and social anthropology. In some places, archaeology is considered a separate discipline from anthropology, but it is still closely related and often collaborates with other social sciences such as history, geography, and sociology.
