Political instability often results in a decrease in economic activity, as businesses and investors become hesitant to invest or operate in a country with uncertain political conditions. This can lead to a decline in foreign investment, a decrease in GDP growth, and potentially a rise in inflation and unemployment. In extreme cases, prolonged political instability can lead to economic collapse and widespread poverty.
