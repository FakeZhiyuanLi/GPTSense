Elisha Otis is credited with increasing the safety and speed of electric elevators. In 1853, he invented the safety brake for elevators, which prevented them from falling if the hoisting cable broke. He also improved the speed and reliability of elevators by designing a steam engine-powered elevator in 1857, which was later adapted to be powered by electricity. This innovation revolutionized the elevator industry and made it possible for taller buildings to be constructed with more efficient vertical transportation.
