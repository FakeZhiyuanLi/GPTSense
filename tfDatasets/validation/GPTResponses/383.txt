Without DNA analysis, the diverse group of East Indians, North Africans, and Europeans would likely have been grouped based on physical appearance, cultural and/or linguistic similarities, and/or geographic proximity. They may have been divided into different ethnic or racial categories based on superficial characteristics such as skin color, facial features, and hair texture. However, these categories can be highly problematic and overly simplistic, as they often ignore the complex history of human migration, cultural exchange, and intermixing.
