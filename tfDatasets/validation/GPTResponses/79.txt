The Astur-Leonese language was gradually replaced by Spanish, also known as Castilian, starting from the 16th century. The process of language shift was accelerated by political, economic, and social factors, including the centralization of power, the growth of urbanization, and the spread of education. Today, Astur-Leonese continues to be spoken primarily in rural areas of Asturias and Leon, but it is considered a endangered language with a small number of speakers.
