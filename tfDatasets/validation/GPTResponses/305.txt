Instrumentalism was a modification of pragmatism, which focused on the practical consequences of ideas and theories rather than their absolute truth or meaning. Instrumentalism, however, emphasized that scientific theories and ideas are not fixed, objective, or absolute, but are rather tools or instruments used to solve particular problems or meet specific needs. In this way, instrumentalism diverged from earlier philosophical frameworks that considered scientific theories to be representations of objective reality.
