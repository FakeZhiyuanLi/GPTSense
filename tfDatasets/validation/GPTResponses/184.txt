Proteins that recognize base DNA during replication and transcription include:1. DNA polymerase - this enzyme recognizes the complementary base pairing between the template strand and the newly synthesized strand during replication and adds nucleotides to the growing DNA chain.2. RNA polymerase - this enzyme recognizes the promoter region of the DNA template strand during transcription and adds nucleotides to the growing RNA chain.3. Transcription factors - proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences called enhancers and promoters to regulate gene expression during transcription.4. Helicases - enzymes that unwind and separate the double-stranded DNA during replication and transcription, exposing the bases to other proteins for recognition.5. Single-strand binding proteins - these proteins bind to single-stranded DNA during replication and transcription, preventing the strands from reannealing and allowing other proteins to recognize the bases.
