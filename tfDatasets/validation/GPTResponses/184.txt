Dialects are less common in highly standardized environments, such as in formal speech, written communication, and mass media like television and radio broadcasting. These environments often promote the use of a standard variety or prestige dialect, leading to the suppression or homogenization of regional or non-standard language features. Additionally, dialects are less common in highly mobile and diverse societies where people interact with speakers from different regions and backgrounds, as they often adopt a more neutral and widely understandable form of language to facilitate communication.
