Dynamic testing can occur during the development, testing, and maintenance phases of the software development life cycle (SDLC). It can also be conducted during the user acceptance testing (UAT) phase, where end-users test the software in a real-world setting. Additionally, dynamic testing can be performed during system integration testing, performance testing, and regression testing to ensure that new changes do not negatively affect existing functionalities.
