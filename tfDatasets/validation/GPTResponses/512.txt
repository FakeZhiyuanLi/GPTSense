Leibniz believed that the universe is fundamentally composed of indivisible, non-physical units of energy called "monads." According to him, every monad is self-contained and self-sufficient, and they interact with each other through a pre-established harmony, which is pre-determined by a divine plan. Monads have different levels of consciousness depending on their complexity, and humans are supposed to have the most complex monads, which allows them to have a sense of self-awareness and rationality. Therefore, Leibniz viewed the universe as a vast network of interconnected and animated monads, all striving towards the highest form of perfection.
