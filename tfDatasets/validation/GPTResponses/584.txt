Some people believe that race is a social construct corresponding to cultural and societal norms, rather than a biological or genetic reality. This perspective suggests that race is a categorization system created by humans to group individuals based on physical appearance or ancestry, and that these categories are not reflective of actual genetic differences. Proponents of this view argue that historical and cultural contexts have influenced the construction of racial categorizations and that there is no innate or inherent connection between race and biological traits.
