Freight elevators are designed and built specifically to carry heavy loads, and thus are better suited for carrying freight. These elevators are typically larger than standard passenger elevators, have higher weight capacities, and may have features such as reinforced floors, larger doors, and more robust controls to ensure safe and efficient transportation of goods. Additionally, freight elevators may also be equipped with specialized equipment for loading and unloading heavy or bulky items, such as power gates or ramps.
