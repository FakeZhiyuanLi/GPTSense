Without pollination, many plant species would not be able to reproduce and would eventually die off. This would have a ripple effect throughout the entire ecosystem, as plants provide food and habitat for countless animals. Additionally, many commercially important crops, such as almonds, apples, and chocolate, require pollination by bees and other insects to produce fruit, so the agricultural industry could be severely impacted. The loss of pollinators would also impact the overall diversity of plant species and could lead to a reduction in available food sources for humans and animals alike.
