The earliest versions of the Quran were standardized under the supervision of Caliph Uthman ibn Affan. He ordered to compile a standard version of the Quranic text and distribute copies to different parts of the Muslim empire to replace all the variant versions of the text that had emerged out of different regions. This process took place around 650 CE, nearly 20 years after the death of Prophet Muhammad.
