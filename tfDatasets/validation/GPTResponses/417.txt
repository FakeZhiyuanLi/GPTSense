During the samurai-controlled government in Japan, the emperor remained as the figurehead or ceremonial head of state. However, he had no real political power or control over the government. The samurai class, represented by the shogun or military leader, held the real power and made all the important decisions. The emperor was seen as a symbol of tradition and culture, and as such, he had a role in endorsing the shogun's rule and legitimizing the government's authority. The samurai leaders would seek the support and recognition of the emperor to maintain social stability and continuity. The emperor's role was mostly ceremonial, and he had little influence on the samurai's governance.
