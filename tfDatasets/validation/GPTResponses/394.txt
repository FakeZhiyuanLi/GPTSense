There are many people who have spoken about the warning signs of idealism, including political scientists, philosophers, and social commentators. Some notable figures who have discussed this topic are:1. Irving Kristol - an American political scientist who wrote extensively on the dangers of idealism in politics. He argued that overly idealistic politicians often fail to take into account the messy realities of human nature and historical context, leading to disastrous outcomes.2. Isaiah Berlin - a British philosopher who warned of the dangers of utopian thinking and the idea that there is a single perfect solution to complex social problems. He argued that such thinking often leads to authoritarianism and violence.3. Christopher Lasch - an American sociologist and cultural commentator who critiqued the idealism of the 1960s counterculture movement. He argued that their rejection of traditional values and institutions led to a breakdown in social cohesion and contributed to the rise of narcissism and individualism.4. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn - a Russian writer and dissident who warned of the dangers of ideological fanaticism and the willingness of idealists to sacrifice human lives for their cause. He famously wrote that "the line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either - but right through every human heart."These are just a few examples of the many thinkers who have spoken about the dangers of idealism. Ultimately, they all warn against the same thing - the dangers of an overly simplistic, dogmatic worldview that fails to take into account the complexities of human nature and social reality.
