Most African descent in Brazil came from the transatlantic slave trade, which saw millions of enslaved Africans brought to Brazil and other parts of the Americas between the 16th and 19th centuries. Brazil imported the largest number of enslaved Africans of any country in the Americas, with an estimated 4 million people brought to Brazil over the course of the trade. The vast majority of enslaved Africans brought to Brazil were from West and Central Africa, including regions such as Angola, the Gold Coast, and the Kingdom of Kongo.
