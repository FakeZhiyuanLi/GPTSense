Glass typically does not dissolve in water, as glass is a non-reactive substance. However, certain types of glass or glass containing certain components, such as alkalis, may react with water to form hydroxides which can cause the glass to dissolve. Additionally, glass can be weakened or corroded by acidic or basic solutions, which may lead to dissolution in water over time.
