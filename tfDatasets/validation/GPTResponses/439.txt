The primary component of a palace hall during the Han dynasty was the throne, which was typically placed on a raised platform and adorned with elaborate decorations and symbols of imperial power. Other important features included elaborate murals and carvings depicting scenes from imperial history, as well as opulent furnishings, such as silk drapes and gold-trimmed chairs, which were used to create a sense of grandeur and luxury. Additionally, palace halls often had a central courtyard or garden, which was designed to provide a peaceful and tranquil retreat for the emperor and his court.
