Glass technically never stops moving like a liquid, but at room temperature, it moves at an incredibly slow pace, making it appear solid. This phenomenon is known as an amorphous solid or a supercooled liquid. However, at extremely high temperatures, glasses can turn into a liquid and flow like any other liquid, which is why glassblowers can mold and shape hot glass.
