The era that kicked off the end of the Ottoman Empire was the late 19th and early 20th century, specifically around the time of World War I. The Ottoman Empire began to decline due to internal conflicts, economic issues, and nationalist movements within the empire. Additionally, outside powers such as Russia, Britain, and France began to exert their influence in the empire, leading to its eventual collapse. The Treaty of Sevres in 1920 marked the official end of the Ottoman Empire, and its territories were divided among various European powers.
