In the Treatise of the Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art, positive numbers were portrayed as rods or counting rods. These were physical objects, such as little sticks or bamboo slivers, that could be used to represent numbers in a visual way. The rods were arranged into patterns or configurations to perform calculations and solve problems. This system was one of the earliest forms of decimal notation and was widely used in ancient China.
