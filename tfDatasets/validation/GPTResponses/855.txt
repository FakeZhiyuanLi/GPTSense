The Renaissance period in Europe was full of an appreciation for earlier cultures, particularly the ancient Greek and Roman cultures. During this time, there was a renewed interest in art, literature, philosophy, and science, as well as a desire to learn from and emulate the achievements of the classical world. This led to a flourishing of humanist ideas, which celebrated the inherent dignity and potential of human beings, and led to many innovations and advancements in various fields of study.
