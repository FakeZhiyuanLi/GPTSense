Hegel defined himself as an absolute idealist. He believed that the ultimate reality is the Absolute Spirit, which is the sum total of all consciousness and rationality. For Hegel, the material world, including human beings and their societies, is a manifestation of the Absolute Spirit. This implies that the material world and its functions can be understood through reasoning and that history is driven by the development of rational thought. Hegel's absolute idealism became a crucial influence on nineteenth-century debates on the nature of human experience and its processes, particularly in Germany.
