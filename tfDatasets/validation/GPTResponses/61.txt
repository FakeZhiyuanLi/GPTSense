The Anthropological Society of London, founded in 1863, followed a path of exploration that focused on the study of the cultures and societies of non-European people. The society was interested in collecting and analyzing data on race, religion, customs, traditions, and material culture of different societies. They also explored the impact of colonialism and imperialism on these societies, and how they were affected by contact with European culture. Anthropologists associated with the society also undertook expeditions to various parts of the world to study different cultures, and to collect and preserve artifacts for the society's collection. Overall, the society contributed significantly to the development of modern anthropology as a field of study.
