During the Han Dynasty in China, the typical family was considered to be patriarchal, with the father or eldest male member of the family holding the highest authority and responsibility for the family's welfare. Women and children were subordinate to the male head of the family and were expected to obey his orders and respect his authority. The family was also expected to maintain Confucian values, with an emphasis on filial piety and respect for elders. Marriage was arranged by parents and divorce was uncommon. Sons were preferred over daughters and were responsible for carrying on the family line and providing for their parents in old age.
