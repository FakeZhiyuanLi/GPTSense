The monarch butterfly uses a chemical defense called cardenolides. These are toxic compounds found in the milkweed plant that the monarch caterpillar feeds on. The caterpillar stores these chemicals in its body, making it unpalatable to predators. When the caterpillar metamorphoses into a butterfly, it retains this chemical protection, which helps protect it from predators throughout its adult life.
