During the Gilded Age, which occurred in the late 19th century, wealthy industrialists amassed enormous fortunes through industries such as iron and steel, oil, and railroads. These individuals, known as robber barons, were able to rival the government's treasury in funds, often exerting powerful influence on politics and economic policy. Some of the most prominent examples of wealthy industrialists during this era include Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller, and Cornelius Vanderbilt.
