The two additions to Paris' administrative limits since 1860 are:1) The annexation of the Bois de Boulogne in 1929. This large park on the western edge of Paris was previously outside the city limits.2) The creation of the commune of La DÃ©fense in 1959. This business district located in the western suburbs of Paris was administratively separated from the neighboring municipalities to form a new entity.
