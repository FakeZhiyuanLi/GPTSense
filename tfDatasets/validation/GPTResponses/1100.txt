There are several chemical compounds that can make glass nearly black:1. Iron Oxide (FeO/Fe2O3): The addition of iron oxide can produce a dark brown or black color in glass.2. Cobalt Oxide (CoO): Cobalt oxide can produce a deep blue-black color in glass.3. Manganese Dioxide (MnO2): Manganese dioxide can produce a very dark brown or black color in glass.4. Copper Oxide (CuO): Copper oxide can produce a deep green-black color in glass.5. Nickel Oxide (NiO): Nickel oxide can produce a dark grey or black color in glass.6. Chromium Oxide (Cr2O3): Chromium oxide can produce a dark green-black color in glass.
