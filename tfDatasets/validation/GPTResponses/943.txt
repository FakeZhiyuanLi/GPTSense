The SWEBOK Guide (2014) defines four main levels of software testing, which are:1. Unit testing: Testing individual units or components of the software to ensure they function correctly in isolation.2. Integration testing: Testing the integration of different units or components of the software to ensure they work together seamlessly.3. System testing: Testing the complete system or software product to ensure it meets the specified requirements and performs all its intended functions.4. Acceptance testing: Testing the software from the end user's perspective to ensure it meets their needs and expectations.The SWEBOK guide emphasizes that testing at each level must be thorough, rigorous, and systematic, and that each level of testing must build upon and integrate with the previous level(s) to ensure the quality and reliability of the software product.
