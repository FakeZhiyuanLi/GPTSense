It is difficult to estimate the exact cost increase if a problem is found after software release, as it depends on a variety of factors such as the severity of the problem and the time required to fix it. However, it can be significantly more expensive to fix a problem after release as it may require recall of already shipped products, addressing customer complaints, and potential damage to the brand reputation. In some cases, it may even result in legal liabilities and settlements. Therefore, it is crucial to identify and address issues during software development and testing to minimize such costs.
