Idealist philosophies posit that reality is constructed in our minds and is not independent of our perception. The world we see around us, according to idealism, is a creation of our thoughts, ideas, and subjective experiences. This philosophy asserts that the external world exists only insofar as we are aware of it, and that our understanding of reality is shaped by our perceptions and interpretations of the world. Therefore, idealists believe that knowledge is not derived solely from sensory experiences, but rather from the active construction of ideas and perceptions within our minds.
