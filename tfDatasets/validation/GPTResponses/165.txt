No one specifically forced Empress Dowager Deng's clan members to kill themselves. However, during the Cultural Revolution in China (1966-1976), many members of Deng's family were persecuted and subjected to severe torture and humiliation by Red Guards and other radical groups. Some family members chose to take their own lives rather than endure further suffering. It is unknown exactly how many members of Deng's family died as a result of the Cultural Revolution.
