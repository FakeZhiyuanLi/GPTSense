Neoclassical architecture shared similarities and vocabulary with classical architecture and the Renaissance style. It drew heavily from the classical orders, such as Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian, and incorporated symmetrical design, columns, pediments, and domes. Neoclassical architecture also incorporated elements of Baroque architecture, such as grandeur, drama, and ornate decoration.
