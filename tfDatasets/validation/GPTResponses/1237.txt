The culmination of the Russo-Turkish War granted autonomy to the citizens of Ottoman-controlled provinces in Moldavia, including the right to self-government, freedom of worship, and the ability to elect their own representatives to local councils. This was granted through the Treaty of Berlin in 1878, which was signed following the conclusion of the war.
