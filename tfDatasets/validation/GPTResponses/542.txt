The winning design for the public competition that began the dominance of Greek-style architecture was the famous Parthenon temple in Athens, Greece. The architects behind the Parthenon were Ictinus and Callicrates, while the sculptor Phidias was responsible for the lavish decoration and the creation of the famous statue of Athena inside the temple. The building's design and striking style would go on to inspire countless other buildings throughout Greece and beyond, marking the beginning of an era of Greek classical architecture that would last for centuries.
