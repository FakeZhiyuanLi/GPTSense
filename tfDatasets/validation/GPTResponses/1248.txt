?Due to a lack of strategic and hard power, countries can be excluded from various international initiatives, organizations, and negotiations. They may not have a seat at the table in major diplomatic discussions or be able to effectively negotiate and advocate for their interests on the global stage. This can lead to a limited ability to influence global decision-making and potentially negative consequences for the country's economy, security, and overall well-being.
