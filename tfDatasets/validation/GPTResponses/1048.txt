The main quality of silicate glass that allows it to be used for windows is its transparency or clarity. Silicate glass is a type of glass made from silica (SiO2) and other compounds, which is highly transparent to visible light. This property makes it possible for silicate glass to allow light to pass through it without significantly distorting or absorbing the light. It is also a highly durable material that is resistant to scratches and impacts, which makes it reliable for use as windows. Furthermore, it is an excellent insulator, which helps to keep the temperatures inside buildings regulated, promoting energy efficiency.
