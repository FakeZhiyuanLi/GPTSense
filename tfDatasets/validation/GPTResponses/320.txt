variation within a species. It is used to categorize a population within a species that is geographically or ecologically distinct from other populations of that species. Subspecies have unique traits that are distinct from other populations of the same species, such as differences in physical characteristics or behavior. The designation of a subspecies is based on objective evidence of genetic, morphological or ecological differences, and provides a way to understand the diversity of life on Earth.
