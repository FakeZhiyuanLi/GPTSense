The Brythonic kingdom of Rheged was a kingdom of Britons in the sub-Roman period, located in what is now Cumbria, England. It existed from the late 5th century until the early 8th century, and was ruled by a series of legendary kings, the most famous of whom was King Urien. The precise location and extent of Rheged are uncertain, but it is believed to have encompassed much of the modern-day Lake District, as well as parts of Lancashire, Dumfriesshire, and the Scottish Borders. Its capital city is thought to have been Carlisle.
