In software development, the unit testing phase is typically performed by the software developers themselves. They write unit tests to test individual units, components, or modules of the software to ensure that they work as expected and meet the requirements. Sometimes, testing may also be carried out by dedicated testers or a quality assurance team, but the primary responsibility for unit testing lies with the developers.
