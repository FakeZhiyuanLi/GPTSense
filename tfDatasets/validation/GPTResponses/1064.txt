One drawback of fused quartz is that it is brittle and can easily fracture under high stress or shock. This makes it less suitable for applications where it may be subjected to sudden impact or pressure changes. Additionally, fused quartz is relatively expensive compared to other materials, which may limit its practical use in some cases where cost is a significant factor.
