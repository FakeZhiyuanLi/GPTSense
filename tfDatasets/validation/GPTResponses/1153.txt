One material that is useful in glassmaking because of its slow evaporation is Borax (sodium borate). Borax is added to the glass mixture to lower the melting point and aid in the glass formation process. It also helps to prevent the glass from cracking or forming bubbles due to rapid evaporation. Borax has a slow rate of volatilization, which helps to keep the glass mixture stable and consistent during the heating process.
