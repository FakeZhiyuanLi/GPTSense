Locke proposed that there are two types of arguments: deductive and inductive. Deductive arguments are those that are based on logical reasoning, where the truth of the premises necessarily leads to the truth of the conclusion. Inductive arguments, on the other hand, are based on reasoning from specific observations to general conclusions, and their truth is based on probability rather than necessity.
