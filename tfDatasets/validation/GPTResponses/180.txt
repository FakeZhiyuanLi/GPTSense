The harpsichord played an important role in classical music. It was the main keyboard instrument during the Baroque period (1600-1750) and was used extensively by composers such as Bach, Handel, and Scarlatti. The sound of the harpsichord is produced by plucking the strings with quills or plectra, giving it a unique and distinctive tone. However, with the rise of the piano in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the harpsichord gradually fell out of favor in mainstream classical music. Today, it is primarily used in early-music ensembles and as a solo instrument for historically informed performances.
