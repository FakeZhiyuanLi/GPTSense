Phenomenalism is a philosophical position that asserts that physical objects and events only exist as they are perceived by the human mind or by any conscious observer. It suggests that everything we know about the world is based on our perceptions and experiences, and that we cannot have direct knowledge of the external world beyond that which is immediately available to our senses. In other words, we only know reality through our subjective experiences of it, and we cannot know the "objective" reality that may exist outside of our perceptions. This view is often associated with the works of philosophers such as George Berkeley and Immanuel Kant.
