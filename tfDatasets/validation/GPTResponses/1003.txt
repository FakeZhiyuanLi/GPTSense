The Coulomb law describes the electrostatic interaction between two charged particles. The law states that the force between two charged particles is directly proportional to the product of the charges on the particles and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Mathematically, the Coulomb law can be expressed as:F = k q1 q2 / r^2where F is the force, q1 and q2 are the charges on the particles, r is the distance between them, and k is the Coulomb constant. The Coulomb law helps to explain the behavior of electric charges and is fundamental to the study of electromagnetism.
