The synchronization of an application can be achieved using various methods such as:1. Locks: Locks are used to ensure that a resource can only be accessed by one thread at a time. This can be achieved using locks such as Mutex, Semaphore or ReentrantLock.2. Condition Variables: Condition Variables are used to signal threads that a certain condition has been met. This is typically used in conjunction with a Lock to ensure that threads are synchronized.3. Atomic Operations: Atomic Operations are operations that can be completed without interruption, which ensures that the values are not modified by other threads during the process.4. Message Queuing: Message Queuing is a technique in which messages are sent and received by threads. This is typically used when multiple threads need to access a shared data structure.5. Read/Write Locks: Read/Write locks are used to allow multiple threads to read from a shared resource simultaneously, while preventing them from writing to it at the same time. This is typically used when the shared resource is read more often than it is written.
