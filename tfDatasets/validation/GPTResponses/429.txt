?Nietzsche's attack on Schopenhauer is not directly related to Kant's attack on any particular philosopher or philosophical school. However, there are some similarities in their critiques of certain philosophical concepts.Kant criticized the dogmatism of the Rationalists, who claimed to have access to knowledge about the world through reason alone. He argued that such claims were unfounded and that we could only have knowledge of the world through experience. Nietzsche, on the other hand, criticized the metaphysical and moral dogmatism of Schopenhauer, who claimed that the world was fundamentally a place of suffering and that salvation could only be found by rejecting the will to live.Both Kant and Nietzsche were skeptical of claims to absolute certainty and rejected the idea that philosophy could provide clear-cut solutions to our problems. They also both emphasized the importance of individual freedom and self-determination, rather than relying on external authority or tradition.
