The Quran uses the term "ummi" to describe Muhammad's lack of exposure to scripture. This term is often translated as "illiterate," but it more accurately refers to someone who is not literate in a particular language or script, in this case referring to the Arabic language and script. It emphasizes Muhammad's reliance on direct revelation from God and his lack of formal religious education.
