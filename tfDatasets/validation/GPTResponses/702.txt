France maintains a mixed model of public policy that combines elements of the welfare state and the free-market system. The French government provides numerous public services, such as healthcare, education, and transportation, through a comprehensive social welfare system. At the same time, the country embraces the principles of the free-market system by promoting entrepreneurship, innovation, and foreign investment. France also uses a variety of policy tools, such as subsidies, tax credits, and regulatory frameworks, to support and incentivize economic growth and development. Overall, the French public policy model seeks to balance the needs of social welfare with the demands of economic prosperity.
