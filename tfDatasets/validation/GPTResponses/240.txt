Human groups have always considered themselves as superior as compared to other nearby groups. They often viewed their own culture, language, and customs as the norm and those of others as inferior or strange. This sense of superiority often led to prejudice, discrimination, and conflict between groups. The idea of 'us vs them' has been present since early human societies, where people formed groups based on shared beliefs, traditions, and values. This mentality still persists in many parts of the world today, leading to division and hostility between different ethnic, racial, religious, and national groups.
