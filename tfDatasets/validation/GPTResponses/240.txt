The reforms named for the abbey at Cluny are the Cluniac Reforms or Clunaic Reforms. These were a series of reforms that were implemented in the 10th and 11th centuries in medieval Europe by the Benedictine monks of the abbey of Cluny in Burgundy, France. The reforms sought to restore the discipline and spirituality of the monastic life, which had deteriorated in the chaos and disorganization of the Dark Ages. The Cluniac Reforms emphasized a return to the principles of the early Christian Church, such as the rule of St. Benedict, a strict adherence to liturgical norms, and a focus on prayer and contemplation as the primary duty of monks. The reforms also fostered an independent and unified system of monasticism that was not beholden to any secular power or authority.
