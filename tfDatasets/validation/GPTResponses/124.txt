Wood can be preserved by adding certain chemicals that prevent the growth of bacteria, fungi, and insects that can cause decay or damage to wood. These are some of the most commonly used wood preservatives:1. Chromated Copper Arsenate (CCA): This is a copper-based wood preservative that contains arsenic and chromium. It is used to protect wood from decay, insects, and termites.2. Alkaline Copper Quaternary (ACQ): This is a copper-based wood preservative that does not contain arsenic or chromium. It is used to protect wood from decay, insects, and termites.3. Creosote: This is a tar-based wood preservative that protects wood from decay and insects. It is commonly used for power poles, railroad ties, and marine applications.4. Pentachlorophenol (PCP): This is a wood preservative that is used to protect wood from decay, insects, and termites. It is also used in roofing shingles and utility poles.5. Borates: Borate wood preservatives are used to protect wood from termites, decay, and fungi. They are commonly used in interior wood products like furniture and window frames.It is important to use caution when handling wood that has been treated with these preservatives, especially when cutting or burning the wood. It is also important to dispose of treated wood properly, as it may contain harmful chemicals.
