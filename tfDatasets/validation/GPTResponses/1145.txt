Glass is generally an insulator and does not conduct electricity. However, certain types of glass, such as doped glasses, can be made to conduct electricity by adding conducting materials, such as metals or metal oxides, to the glass matrix. These materials can create free electrons within the glass and allow it to conduct electricity.
