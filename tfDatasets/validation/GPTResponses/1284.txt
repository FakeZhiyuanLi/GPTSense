The code that regulates marriage varies by location and jurisdiction. In the United States, for example, marriage is regulated by state law, and each state has its own specific regulations and requirements. Some common aspects that may be regulated by these laws include eligibility requirements (such as minimum age, mental capacity, and familial relationships), licensing and application procedures, waiting periods, and officiating requirements. Other countries and regions may have their own legal codes that govern marriage.
