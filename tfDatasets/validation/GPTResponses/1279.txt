Sharia developed primarily from the Quran, which is the holy book of Islam, and the Hadith, which are the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad. Muslim scholars also drew upon their own reasoning and interpretations of Islamic legal principles to develop Sharia. Sharia is considered to be divine law for Muslims and covers a wide range of topics including personal hygiene, prayer, commerce, marriage, divorce, inheritance, criminal law, and more. Sharia is still applied in varying degrees in some Muslim-majority countries today.
