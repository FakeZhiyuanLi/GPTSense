The method used to test components under unexpected workloads is called stress testing. Stress testing involves subjecting a system to abnormally high levels of traffic or data volume to assess its endurance and stability under adverse conditions. By simulating peak workloads, stress testing helps identify potential bottlenecks, performance issues or system failures that may occur during unexpected workloads. This testing technique may involve load testing, which evaluates a system's performance under normal conditions, and then gradually increasing the load to determine at what point the system becomes unstable, and stress testing enables the system to operate correctly under higher loads.
