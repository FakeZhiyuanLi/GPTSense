The models for future generations of samurai were the legendary warriors of the past such as Minamoto no Yoshitsune, Kusunoki Masashige, Takeda Shingen, and others who embodied the virtues of bushido (the Way of the Warrior) such as loyalty, honor, respect, courage, and self-discipline. These role models set the standards for the samurai code of conduct and inspired later generations to follow in their footsteps.
