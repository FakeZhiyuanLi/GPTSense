After the French and Indian War, the British gained control of French territory in North America, including Canada and the Ohio Valley. To pay off war debts, the British imposed new taxes on the American colonies, which ultimately led to the American Revolution. The war also contributed to the solidification of American identity and the growth of distrust between Britain and its American colonies. The war also sparked tensions between the Native American tribes and the British, leading to further conflicts and displacement of indigenous peoples.
