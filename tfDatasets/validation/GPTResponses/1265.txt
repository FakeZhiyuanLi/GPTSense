The civil administrations of the Roman Empire were based on a hierarchical system where authority was centralized and concentrated in the hands of the emperor. This type of system was known as an autocracy, meaning a government ruled by one person with unlimited power. The emperor was the supreme ruler and held absolute authority over all aspects of the empire, including its administration, law, and military. Below the emperor were various administrative officials who were responsible for governing the provinces and ensuring that the will of the emperor was carried out. This system of centralized control and authority allowed the Roman Empire to maintain a degree of stability and control over its vast territories.
