Dealkalization is typically caused by the reaction of alkaline chemicals, such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, with water. As the alkali dissolves in water, it forms hydroxide ions (OH-) which can then react with dissolved minerals in the water, such as calcium and magnesium ions, to create precipitates (solid particles) that can be removed by filtration or sedimentation. This process can be used to reduce the alkalinity of water for various applications, including industrial processes and drinking water treatment.
