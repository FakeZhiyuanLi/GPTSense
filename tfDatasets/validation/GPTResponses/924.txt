Black-box testing does not qualify as grey-box testing. Black-box testing is a testing approach where the tester has no knowledge of the internal workings of the software, and only bases their testing on the inputs and outputs of the software. In contrast, grey-box testing is a testing approach where the tester has some knowledge of the internal workings of the software, but not complete knowledge.
