The air quality and ventilation system of the mine shaft requires routine testing to ensure the safety and health of workers. Testing for gas levels and dust particles is also necessary to avoid potential hazards such as explosions and respiratory diseases. Additionally, the structural integrity and stability of the mine shaft must also be assessed regularly to prevent collapses and cave-ins.
