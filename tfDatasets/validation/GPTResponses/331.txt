Transcendental idealism believes that reality is fundamentally nonphysical or metaphysical. This philosophical perspective, developed by Immanuel Kant, holds that only the mind can comprehend or experience reality, and that the external world is a construct or form imposed by the mind's categories of understanding. Transcendental idealism thus posits that reality is ultimately beyond the reach of empirical exploration or knowledge, and that there may be multiple or even infinite versions of reality, depending on how different minds structure their experiences.
