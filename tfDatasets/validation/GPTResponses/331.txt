In a slightly more complex form of communication model, the sender and receiver are connected through multiple channels of communication. This includes verbal and non-verbal channels such as spoken words, body language, facial expressions, written language, and tone of voice. Additionally, feedback from the receiver is also an important channel of communication that allows the sender to adjust their message accordingly. The sender and receiver may also be connected through various forms of technology or media, such as email, telephone, social media, or video conferencing. The context, environment, and cultural factors also play a significant role in shaping the communication process between the sender and receiver.
