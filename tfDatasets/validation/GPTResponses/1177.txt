Glass-ceramics can typically handle temperature changes of up to 1000째C (1832째F) without significant damage or cracking. However, the exact temperature range depends on the specific type of glass-ceramic and its composition. Some glass-ceramics can withstand even higher temperatures, up to 1300째C (2372째F), while others have a lower maximum temperature limit.
