The law of conservation of energy is a fundamental principle of physics that states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another. This law is a consequence of the fact that the laws of physics do not change over time, which is known as the principle of time symmetry. This means that the laws of physics are the same regardless of whether time is moving forward or backward. As a result, energy is conserved over time, and the total amount of energy in a system remains constant.
