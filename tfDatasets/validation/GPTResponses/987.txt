After the alpha stage, the next stage in the development and testing of software is the beta stage. During this stage, the software is released to a larger group of users, typically external testers or customers, for further testing and feedback. The goal of the beta testing stage is to identify and fix remaining bugs and issues before releasing the software to the public.
