The main obstacle to the expansion of the Ottoman Empire into the peninsula of Italy was the powerful naval forces of the Mediterranean powers in the region, particularly those of Venice and Genoa. These maritime forces were able to repel Ottoman incursions and prevent Ottoman forces from establishing a foothold on Italian soil. In addition, Italy was also home to powerful city-states, such as Florence and Milan, which were able to resist Ottoman advances through diplomacy and military means. The rugged landscape of Italy, with its mountains and river valleys, also made it difficult for the Ottoman army to move troops and supplies, further hampering their expansion efforts.
