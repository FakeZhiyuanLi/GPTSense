The older language that is thought to strongly resemble that of the Quran is classical Arabic. This is because classical Arabic was the language used during the time of the Prophet Muhammad and Islamic civilization in its early years. The Quran itself is considered a prime example of classical Arabic and has been preserved in its original form since its revelation in the 7th century.
