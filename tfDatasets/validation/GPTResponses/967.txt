The relationship between rest-mass and rest-energy in the concept of special relativity is given by the famous equation known as the mass-energy equivalence formula: E = mc^2, where E represents the rest-energy of an object, m represents its rest-mass, and c represents the speed of light in vacuum. This equation shows that rest-mass is equivalent to a certain amount of rest-energy, and the exact amount of energy stored in an object's rest-mass can be calculated using this equation. It also demonstrates that energy and mass are two sides of the same coin, and that mass can be converted into energy and vice versa.
