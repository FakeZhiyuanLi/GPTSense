John Locke used the term "tabula rasa" to refer to the idea that at birth, the human mind is a blank slate without any innate knowledge or understanding. He believed that all knowledge was acquired through experience and sensory perception. This meant that our thoughts, beliefs, and ideas were all formed by our environment and interactions rather than simply being innate characteristics.
