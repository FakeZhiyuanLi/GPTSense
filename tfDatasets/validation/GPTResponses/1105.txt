German populations within the country wanted several things, including economic stability, political stability, and national security. They also desired the restoration of Germany's international status and influence, which they believed had been lost due to the harsh terms of the Treaty of Versailles. Additionally, they sought an end to the political and economic chaos that had characterized the Weimar Republic, as well as a strong, authoritarian government that could effectively address the country's problems. Some Germans also desired the expansion of German territory, particularly into Eastern Europe, and the establishment of a Greater Germany. However, opinions in this regard were divided, with some Germans favoring peaceful means of achieving this goal, while others favored military force.
