The commonly held notion regarding the dual nature of the soul is called dualism. It is the belief that the soul has two distinct aspects â€“ a spiritual or immaterial aspect that is eternal and unchanging, and a physical or material aspect that is mortal and subject to decay. This belief is prevalent in many religions and philosophical systems, including Christianity, Hinduism, Platonism, and Descartes' philosophy.
