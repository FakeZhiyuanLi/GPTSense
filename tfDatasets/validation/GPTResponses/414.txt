Descartes was criticized in various sections of his philosophical work, including his views on mind-body dualism, his method of doubt, and his argument for the existence of God. Some critics argued that his dualism was incomplete or implausible, while others questioned whether his method of doubt was truly effective or if his argument for God relied too heavily on circular reasoning.
