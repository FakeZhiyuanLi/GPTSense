organisms that includes all the descendants of a common ancestor. Clades are based on evolutionary relationships and are often represented as branching trees or diagrams called cladograms. Members of a clade share a set of genetic, morphological, or behavioral characteristics that distinguish them from other organisms, and they are typically grouped together at the level of family, order, class, or higher. The concept of clades is a fundamental organizing principle in modern biology and is used to better understand the diversity and evolutionary history of life on Earth.
