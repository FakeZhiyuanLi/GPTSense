There is a significant amount of human variation that occurs between continental populations. However, it is important to note that not all individuals within a continental population are the same, and there is also a significant amount of genetic variation within these populations.Some of the factors that contribute to this variation include differences in genetic ancestry, environmental factors such as diet and exposure to pathogens, and cultural practices such as marriage patterns. It is also important to consider that these factors can interact in complex ways to shape patterns of variation.Overall, estimates of genetic variation between continental populations suggest that there is a considerable amount of diversity. For example, studies of genetic variation in human populations have shown that around 85% of genetic variation occurs within populations, while around 15% occurs between populations. This suggests that while there is significant variation between populations, there is also a great deal of variation within populations.
