There is no one answer to this question as it depends on the specific context and time period in which the Jews in question remained.During the Holocaust, Jews who remained in Nazi-occupied territories were typically subjected to persecution, forced labor, and deportation to concentration and extermination camps. Those who managed to survive often did so by hiding or being protected by non-Jewish individuals or organizations.In the aftermath of World War II, Jews who remained in various European countries faced varying levels of discrimination and antisemitism. Some were able to rebuild their lives and communities, while others faced ongoing persecution and sometimes violence.Today, Jews who remain in countries around the world continue to face discrimination and sometimes violent attacks. However, many are able to live relatively safe and fulfilling lives, and some communities have even experienced periods of growth and renewal.
