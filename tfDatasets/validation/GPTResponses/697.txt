Japanese women began being more educated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries during the Meiji era, when Japan underwent modernization and westernization. The Meiji government invested heavily in education, establishing a national education system that included compulsory education for both boys and girls. The government also opened schools for women and promoted women's education as a means of improving the nation's economic and social status. Women's education continued to expand during the Taisho and Showa periods (1912-1989), with more opportunities for women to attend high school and university.
