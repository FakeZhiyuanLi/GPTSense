Andrea Palladio was a primary influence on many 19th century neoclassical architects, such as Thomas Jefferson, John Nash, and Charles Barry. His architecture embodied the classical principles of proportion, symmetry, and order, which were key components of neoclassicism. His publication of "The Four Books of Architecture" in 1570 became a fundamental source for architects in the 19th century who sought to revive classical architecture.
