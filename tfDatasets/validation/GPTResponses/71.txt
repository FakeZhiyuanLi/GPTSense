Many people characterize the new perspective as being more informed with modern and contemporary scholarship, historical and cultural contexts, and a greater emphasis on the Jewishness of Jesus and the Apostle Paul. It encourages a revision of traditional Protestant understandings of salvation, justification, and the role of faith and works in the Christian life. The new perspective challenges the traditional Lutheran and Reformed interpretation of Paul, which was based on a distinction between law and grace and an emphasis on individual salvation.
