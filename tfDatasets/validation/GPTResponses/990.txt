Beta testing is usually released to a select group of users or customers who are willing to test an application, software or product before the final release to the general public. This group of testers is typically referred to as beta testers. Beta testing helps identify flaws and bugs in the product and provides feedback that can help improve the product's overall quality. Beta testing is often considered the final stage of testing before the product is released to the public.
