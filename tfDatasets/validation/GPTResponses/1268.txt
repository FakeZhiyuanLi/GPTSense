The main responsibility of the Ottoman state in relation to lands was to collect taxes and ensure law and order. The Ottomans collected taxes from the landowners and farmers and provided protection against bandits and marauding tribes. They also had the authority to distribute land among the population according to Islamic law and practice. In addition, they were responsible for implementing land policies and regulations, such as land tenure and land use planning.
