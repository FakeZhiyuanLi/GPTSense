Thomas and others sought to distinguish between the Y chromosome of Jewish priests (known as the Cohen gene) and those of non-Jews. This was done in order to confirm or refute claims of Jewish descent and lineage, particularly among those seeking to become priests themselves. The Cohen gene is believed to have descended from a common male ancestor and can be traced back thousands of years, making it a valuable genetic marker for Jewish identity and heritage.
