A substance called "polishing compound" is often used on the surface of window glass to make it smooth. It is a gritty paste that is applied to the glass and then rubbed in with a cloth, removing any imperfections or scratches on the surface. This process is called "polishing" and it can enhance the clarity and transmission of light through the glass, making it look smoother and more transparent.
