A bukeyashiki is a traditional Japanese-style aristocratic residence. These were typically large, sprawling homes with multiple buildings and expansive grounds. Bukeyashiki were built during the Edo period (1603-1868) and were owned by samurai and other members of the nobility. They were designed to reflect the owner's social status and were often decorated with intricate painting and delicate woodwork. Today, many bukeyashiki have been preserved and are popular tourist attractions.
