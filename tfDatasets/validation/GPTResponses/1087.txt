The security of Paris is primarily the responsibility of the French National Police and the Gendarmerie Nationale, under the supervision of the Ministry of Interior. In addition, there are several specialized units such as the RAID (Research, Assistance, Intervention, and Deterrence) and the BRI (Intervention and Research Brigade) responsible for counter-terrorism and criminal activities. The city also has its own police force, the Prefecture of Police, which oversees security and public order in Paris.
