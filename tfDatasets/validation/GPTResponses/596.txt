A climbing elevator is a type of elevator that moves vertically and horizontally, allowing it to climb up and down the exterior of a tall building. It is typically used for the construction or maintenance of skyscrapers, where traditional elevators are not practical due to their limited range and inability to move at different angles. Climbing elevators are usually suspended by cables and can be operated manually or with electric motors. They are designed to provide safe and efficient transportation for workers and equipment to various levels of a building while keeping them secure and stable.
