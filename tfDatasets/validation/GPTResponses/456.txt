One can use statistical analysis to look at differences between groups. This can include techniques such as hypothesis testing, regression analysis, or analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare groups based on different variables such as behavior, attitudes, or preferences. Another approach is to use qualitative research methods such as interviews, focus groups, or ethnography to understand the perspectives and experiences of different groups.
