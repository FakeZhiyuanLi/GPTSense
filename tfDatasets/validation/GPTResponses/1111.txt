During the war, the German population in what is now known as Kaliningrad suffered greatly. The Soviet Red Army invaded East Prussia and fought fiercely against the German defenders. The battle for Königsberg (now Kaliningrad) lasted several weeks and resulted in large numbers of casualties on both sides.After the Germans surrendered, the Soviet Union annexed the region and forcibly expelled the remaining German population. Those who did not flee or were not killed during the war were rounded up and sent to labor camps in Siberia or forced into labor in the Soviet Union.It is estimated that around 200,000 Germans were killed during the battle for Königsberg and the subsequent expulsion, while around 400,000 fled or were forcibly removed from the region. Today, the German population in Kaliningrad is small, with most residents being of Russian or Polish descent.
