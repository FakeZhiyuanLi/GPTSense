Barium oxide is often used as a component in glassmaking, as it can substitute for other metal oxides such as calcium, strontium, or lead. It can improve the refractive index, reduce thermal expansion, and increase the hardness and chemical durability of the glass. However, excessive amounts of barium can also cause problems such as opacity or cloudiness in the glass. Additionally, barium compounds can be toxic, and proper safety precautions must be taken when handling them.
