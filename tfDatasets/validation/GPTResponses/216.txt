When laws are broken in corrupt countries, it typically leads to a lack of trust in the country's governance and legal system, thereby discouraging foreign investment and trade. This can lead to decreased demand for that country's products and services on the international market, resulting in a loss of economic opportunities and revenue. Additionally, corrupt practices may result in economic sanctions or other penalties from the international community, further damaging a country's reputation and economic prospects.
