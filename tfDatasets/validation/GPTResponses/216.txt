Some genetic markers have varying frequencies among different populations around the world. For example, sickle cell anemia is more common in populations from regions with a high prevalence of malaria, such as sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and parts of India. The frequency of the gene for lactose intolerance is higher in populations with a history of dairy farming, such as those of European, African, and Middle Eastern descent, compared to populations in Asia and Africa who historically did not consume milk beyond infancy. Similarly, the HLA gene complex, which plays a significant role in the immune system, has varying frequencies across populations and ethnic groups, which can affect an individual's susceptibility to certain diseases.
