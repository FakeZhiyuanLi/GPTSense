Kozane were made of small rectangular or hexagonal metal plates that were linked together with silk cords or leather strings. The plates were typically made of iron or steel, but occasionally copper or other metals were used. The surface of the plates could be smooth or decorated with designs, and they were often lacquered or painted to protect them from rusting. Kozane were traditionally used in the construction of Japanese armor, especially during the feudal period.
