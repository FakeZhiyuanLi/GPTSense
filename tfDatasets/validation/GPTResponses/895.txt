White-box testing is a type of software testing in which the tester has knowledge of the internal workings of the software being tested. This includes having access to the source code and understanding the software architecture, design, and implementation.There are several activities involved in white-box testing, including:1. Planning: The tester plans their testing activities, including which parts of the code they will test and how they will test them.2. Code review: The tester reviews the source code and analyzes it to understand how the software works and how it performs various functions.3. Test design: The tester designs test cases that will exercise specific parts of the code and identify any defects.4. Test execution: The tester executes the tests and logs any defects they find.5. Debugging: If defects are found, the tester works with developers to identify and fix the root cause of the problem.6. Reporting: The tester reports their findings to project managers, developers, and other stakeholders, providing insights into the quality and performance of the software.White-box testing is typically used in conjunction with other testing methods, such as black-box testing, to ensure comprehensive software testing.
