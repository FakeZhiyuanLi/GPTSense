Adding certain materials to glass can make it less refractive. One example is adding fluorine to glass, which creates a low refractive index and makes the glass appear invisible. Another option is to coat the surface of the glass with a thin layer of material such as magnesium fluoride or silicon dioxide, which can reduce its refractivity.
