Kierkegaard believed that reality cannot be a system for human beings because human beings are subjective individuals. Each individual has their own unique experiences, emotions, and beliefs that cannot be fully comprehended by others. Therefore, any attempt to create a universal system to explain reality would fail because it would not be able to fully take into account the subjective experience of every individual. Additionally, Kierkegaard believed that faith and the pursuit of individual meaning and purpose are essential components of human existence which cannot be fully explained or encompassed by any system.
