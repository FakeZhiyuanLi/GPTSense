The surface texture of glass is determined by a combination of factors such as the manufacturing process, the tooling used, and the chemical composition of the glass itself. It is not caused by a specific force, but rather by the way the glass is manipulated and processed during production. For example, the use of molds or rollers can create a specific texture on the surface of the glass, while the addition of certain chemicals can alter its surface properties.
