One thing that is not as common in open education is traditional forms of credentialing or certification, such as degrees or diplomas. While some open education initiatives offer certificates of completion or badges to acknowledge learning achievements, they may not hold the same weight in the job market or academic institutions as traditional degrees. Additionally, some open education resources may not be accredited or recognized by formal educational organizations or government bodies.
