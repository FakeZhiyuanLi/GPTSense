Once the bottom-up testing process has been repeated over and over again at all levels, it helps with the following:1. Improved quality: As the testing is done at each level, defects and issues are identified early in the software development life cycle. This helps in addressing them early and improving the overall quality of the software.2. Faster time to market: The early detection of defects and issues enables the development team to fix them quickly, thus reducing the time taken to develop and release software.3. Better visibility: Bottom-up testing provides better visibility into the software development process. It helps identify which modules are working well and which are not, enabling the team to plan and prioritize further testing efforts.4. Reduced testing cost: Bottom-up testing helps in the early detection of defects and issues, which reduces the cost of fixing them later in the software development life cycle.5. Efficient QA process: As testing is done at each level, the overall testing process becomes more efficient. It helps in identifying defects and issues at an early stage, which reduces the need for extensive regression testing and rework.
