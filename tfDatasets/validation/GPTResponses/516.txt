There is no definitive answer to this question as it is not clear which specific raised relief map is being referred to. However, if we are talking about the first raised relief map in general, regardless of the food stable used, then it is believed that the first such map was created by Italian artist Pietro del Massaio in the 15th century. He created a model of the Tiber River valley in which the major terrain features were represented by raised plaster relief on a wooden base.
