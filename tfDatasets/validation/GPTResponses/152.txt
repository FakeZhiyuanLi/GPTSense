Research has shown that zinc may be effective in killing or inhibiting the growth of several types of cancer cells including prostate cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, and leukemia. Zinc has been observed to induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) in cancer cells by activating various cellular pathways. However, further studies are still needed to fully understand the mechanisms of zinc's anti-cancer effects and its potential for clinical use.
