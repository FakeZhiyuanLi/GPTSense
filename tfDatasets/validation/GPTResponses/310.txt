1. Genetics: The advancement in DNA sequencing technology has enabled researchers to study the genetics of animal populations and individuals at a level previously thought impossible. This has led to breakthroughs in areas such as disease resistance, conservation, and evolution.2. Animal behavior: Advances in technology such as robotics, artificial intelligence, and sensors have enabled researchers to study animal behavior in ways that were previously impossible. These tools have helped to shed light on animal communication, social organization, and cognition.3. Conservation biology: The use of new technologies such as remote sensing, machine learning, and big data analytics have enabled conservationists to better understand and protect vulnerable populations of animals. This has led to the development of new conservation strategies and approaches.4. Animal welfare: There has been a growing interest in animal welfare in the 21st century, and this has led to advancements in animal welfare science, including the development of new ways to measure animal well-being, the identification of factors that affect animal welfare, and the development of new tools and technologies to improve animal welfare.5. Evolutionary biology: The ability to sequence genomes has provided new insights into the evolutionary history of animals. This has led to the discovery of new species, the elucidation of evolutionary relationships, and the identification of the genetic basis for complex traits, such as those involved in adaptation and speciation.
