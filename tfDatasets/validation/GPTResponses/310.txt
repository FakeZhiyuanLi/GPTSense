Idealism is in conflict with materialism, which asserts that reality can be fully explained through physical matter and its interactions. It is also in conflict with dualism, which posits that there are two separate entities in existence: the physical body and the immaterial mind or soul. Additionally, compatibilism, the view that determinism and free will can coexist, is in conflict with idealism, which often emphasizes the role of consciousness in shaping reality.
