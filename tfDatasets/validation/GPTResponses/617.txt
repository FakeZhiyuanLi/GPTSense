is known as a traction machine, which uses cables and a rotating drum to lift and lower the elevator car. These types of elevators typically had slow speeds and were limited in the weight they could carry. Modern freight elevators, on the other hand, are typically controlled by hydraulic systems or geared traction machines which can lift heavier loads and are more efficient.
