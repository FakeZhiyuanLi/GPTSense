There are various safety features to prevent entrapment, depending on the context, but here are a few examples:1. Pool safety covers: A safety cover for a swimming pool should be strong enough to support the weight of a person or animal and should not have any gaps that could allow someone to slip through. This prevents people and animals from accidentally falling into the pool and becoming trapped.2. Elevator doors: Elevator doors should have sensors that detect when something or someone is in the way of the closing doors. This prevents people from becoming trapped in between the doors or getting caught as the doors close.3. Garage doors: Garage doors should have sensors that detect if something or someone is in the path of the closing door. This prevents people, pets, or objects from becoming trapped under the door as it closes.4. Baby cribs: Baby cribs should have slats no more than 2 3/8 inches apart to prevent a baby's head from getting stuck between the slats. Additionally, the crib should not have any gaps or spaces that could allow a baby to become trapped.5. Car windows: Car windows should have buttons that automatically stop the window from closing if they encounter resistance, such as a person's arm or head. This prevents people from becoming trapped in the window as it closes.
