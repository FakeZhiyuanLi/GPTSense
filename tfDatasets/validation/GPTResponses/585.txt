In the mid-18th century, British architecture shifted towards the Palladian style, which was characterized by a return to classical proportions and symmetry, inspired by the architecture of ancient Greece and Rome. The style was epitomized by the work of architect and designer Robert Adam, who blended classical forms with Rococo ornamentation to create a unique and elegant style. Georgian architecture also became more prevalent, characterized by the use of brick and stucco and the integration of classical details, such as the use of columns and pediments. Additionally, Gothic Revival architecture began to gain popularity in the later half of the century, with St. Pancras Station and the Houses of Parliament being notable examples of this style.
