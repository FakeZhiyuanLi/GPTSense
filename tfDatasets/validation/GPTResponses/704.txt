Since the early colonial history of the United States, groups of people have been classified as belonging to different races. This classification was initially based on physical characteristics such as skin color, hair texture, and facial features. The idea of race gained notoriety during the slavery era of the United States, when African slaves were brought over to work on plantations. The concept of race has continued to evolve and shape American society throughout its history.
