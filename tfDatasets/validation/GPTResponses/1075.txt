After World War II, following the Potsdam Agreement, East Prussia was divided between Poland and the Soviet Union, leaving it completely disconnected from the rest of Germany. To provide transport to East Prussia, the Soviet Union built a transportation system that included a highway and railway network connecting Kaliningrad (formerly KÃ¶nigsberg) to the Soviet Union. The transportation system allowed for the movement of goods and people between Kaliningrad and the rest of the Soviet Union, and also facilitated movement between Kaliningrad and Poland.
