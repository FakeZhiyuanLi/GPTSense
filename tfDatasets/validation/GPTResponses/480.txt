The second wave of neoclassical architecture occurred in the early 20th century, primarily between 1900 and 1930. It was a revival of interest in classical forms and motifs, just like the first wave, which occurred in the 18th century. This period saw a resurgence of classical architectural styles, such as Greek, Roman, and Renaissance, and many well-known architects like John Russell Pope, Thomas Hastings, and Paul Philippe Cret contributed to its development.
