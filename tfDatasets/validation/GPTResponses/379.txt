Lieberman and Jackson found profound problems using cladistics to support concepts of convergence and homoplasy. They noted that cladistics assumes that all shared traits are due to common ancestry, whereas convergence and homoplasy involve unrelated organisms evolving similar traits independently. As a result, cladistic analyses may incorrectly group unrelated organisms together based on superficial similarities, leading to incorrect evolutionary relationships. Lieberman and Jackson argued that the incorporation of additional sources of data, such as molecular analyses and fossil evidence, can help mitigate these issues and provide a more accurate understanding of evolutionary relationships.
