Many soldiers from Hanover emigrated to North America during the 18th and 19th centuries, particularly to the British colonies that later became the United States. They were often recruited to fight in the British Army during conflicts such as the American Revolution and the War of 1812, and many chose to stay in the colonies after their service ended. They settled primarily in the Mid-Atlantic and Southern regions of the United States.
