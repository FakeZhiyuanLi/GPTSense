The first law of thermodynamics, also known as the law of conservation of energy, states that energy cannot be created or destroyed but can only be converted from one form to another. This means that the total amount of energy in a system is constant, and any energy input must be balanced by energy output. Heat flow is a type of energy transfer that results in a change in the internal energy of a system. The first law of thermodynamics helps to explain many phenomena, including the behavior of engines, the efficiency of energy conversion, and the properties of materials under different conditions.
