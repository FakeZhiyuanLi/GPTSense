Margaret Thatcher won the 1975 election by a large margin.However, it is worth noting that there was no general election in 1975 in the UK. The nearest general election was in 1974, where the Labour Party led by Harold Wilson won a small majority, but a second general election was held later that year, in which Labour won fewer seats and had to form a minority government. Margaret Thatcher and the Conservatives did not win an election until 1979.
