Many insects are beneficial to the environment. They perform important roles such as pollination, seed dispersal, natural pest control, and decomposition. Some insects also serve as a food source for other animals, contributing to biodiversity and the food chain. However, some insects can also be harmful to the environment, such as invasive species that disrupt ecosystems or those that damage crops.
