Descartes was a rational idealist. He believed that the human mind can access true and certain knowledge by using reason to systematically doubt all assumptions and beliefs, and then building up knowledge from clear and distinct ideas that cannot be doubted. He also believed in the existence of a perfect, eternal, and unchanging realm of ideas and truths that underlies the physical world.
