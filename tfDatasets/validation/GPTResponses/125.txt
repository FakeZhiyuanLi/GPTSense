Mimicry complexes are usually found in insects and some other animals, particularly in those species that rely on camouflage, mimicry, or other visual or acoustic strategies to evade predators or attract prey. They are also found in plants, where they mimic the appearance and scent of other plants in order to attract pollinators or deter herbivores. Mimicry complexes are most common in tropical regions, where biodiversity is highest and competition for resources is often intense.
