In the early days, elevators were powered by steam engines. Later, hydraulic elevators that relied on water pressure were introduced. In the 19th century, electric elevators became popular and are now the most common type of elevator machine. Modern elevators use AC and DC electric motors. Some high-rise buildings have also started using gearless elevators that are powered by permanent magnet motors.
