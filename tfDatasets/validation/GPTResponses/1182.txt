The bull's-eye was originally used as a target for archery and later for firearms. In archery, the aim was to hit the center of the circle, which was the bull's-eye. In firearms, the bull's-eye was used as a target for marksmanship training or shooting competitions, aiming to hit the center of the target again. The term "bull's-eye" is now commonly used to refer to hitting a specific target or achieving a precise goal.
