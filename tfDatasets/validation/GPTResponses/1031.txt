The historical narratives from the time period of the pre-Islamic Arabian Peninsula are unique to the Quran among holy books. The Quran contains several references to the customs, traditions, and beliefs of the Arabian society before Islam. These narratives provide insights into the socio-economic, political, and religious dynamics of the Arabian Peninsula during the 7th century CE. Some of the prominent historical narratives found in the Quran include the stories of the Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham), the Prophet Yusuf (Joseph), and the Prophet Musa (Moses), among others. However, the quranic versions of these stories often have distinctive aspects and vary from the versions presented in the Hebrew Bible or the Christian Old Testament.
