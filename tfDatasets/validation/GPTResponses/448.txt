There are several scholars who have provided proof that mechanical engineering was prominent during the Han period:1. Derek J. de Solla Price - He was an English physicist and historian of science who conducted extensive research on ancient Chinese mechanical engineering in the Han period. In his book "Gears from the Greeks: The Antikythera Mechanism" he compared the sophisticated antique Greek astrolabe with the Chinese South-pointing chariot, one of the most famous examples of a geared mechanism from the Han dynasty.2. Joseph Needham - He was a British scientist and historian who wrote extensively on Chinese science and technology. In his book "Science and Civilization in China," he discussed the remarkable advances made in mechanical engineering during the Han period, specifically in the areas of water-powered devices and clockmaking.3. Guo Shuchun - He is a Chinese mechanical engineer and historian who has researched extensively on the subject of ancient Chinese machinery. In his book "Ancient Chinese Machinery: The Science and Technology of China's Ancient Era," he provides many examples of the ingenious mechanical devices created during the Han period, such as the famous flying pigeon automaton.These scholars and others have contributed to our understanding of the important role played by mechanical engineering in the Han dynasty, and its impact on subsequent developments in technology both in China and globally.
