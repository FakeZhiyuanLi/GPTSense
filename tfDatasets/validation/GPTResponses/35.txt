Before the solar/wind revolution, Portugal had predominantly generated electricity through hydropower. The country has several large dams, which were built in the mid-20th century, including Alqueva Dam, Cahora Bassa Dam, and Venda Nova Dam, which provided most of the electricity for the country. Portugal also had some limited use of biomass and geothermal energy for electricity generation.
