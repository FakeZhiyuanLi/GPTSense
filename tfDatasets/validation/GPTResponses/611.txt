Gravity is what enables the cab to go down by its own weight. When the cab is lifted at the top of a crane, the weight of the cab creates potential energy. When the cab is released, this potential energy is converted into kinetic energy and the force of gravity causes the cab to accelerate downwards. As the cab descends, it gains momentum and its speed increases until it reaches the bottom of the crane. This is how the cab is able to go down by its own weight.
