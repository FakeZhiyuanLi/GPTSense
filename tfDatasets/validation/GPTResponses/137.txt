Insects receive food such as nectar or pollen as a reward for pollination. These resources are vital for their survival and reproduction. Some plants may also provide shelter or breeding sites for certain insects. Additionally, their pollination efforts contribute to maintaining the biodiversity and health of ecosystems.
