The attribute of all biological systems is the presence of cells. All living organisms, from the smallest single-celled microorganisms to the most complex multicellular organisms, are composed of cells, which are the basic units of life. Cells perform a variety of functions necessary for life, including energy production, reproduction, and the maintenance of cellular processes. Therefore, the presence of cells is a fundamental characteristic of all biological systems.
