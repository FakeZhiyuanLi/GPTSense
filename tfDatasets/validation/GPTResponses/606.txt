The classical period of Greek history is commonly defined as the time period from the 5th century BCE to the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE. This era is characterized by the rise of Athens as a dominant city-state, the Golden Age of Athens under Pericles, the Persian Wars, the Peloponnesian War, the conquests of Alexander the Great, and the spread of Greek culture and ideas throughout the Mediterranean world.
