1. Environmental Impact: Diverting water from rivers can negatively impact aquatic ecosystems, including fish and other aquatic species. It can also lead to the destruction of wetlands, loss of habitat, and reduction of water quality.2. Agriculture: Diverting river water can be used for irrigation to support crop production, but overuse can lead to soil salinity and erosion, reducing crop yields and causing long-term damage.3. Drinking and Domestic Use: Diverting river water for drinking and domestic use can result in water scarcity downstream and can cause conflicts over water resources.4. Industrial Use: Diverting water from rivers can be used for industrial purposes such as power generation, manufacturing, and mining. It can lead to environmental degradation, including the discharge of polluted water back into the river.5. Recreation and Tourism: Diverting water from rivers can reduce the availability of water for recreational activities such as fishing, swimming, and boating. It can also harm tourism activities that rely on the natural beauty of rivers and watersheds.
