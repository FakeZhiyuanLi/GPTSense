Francis Bacon is considered to be one of the most important figures of the Scientific Revolution, and his philosophy is generally classified as empiricist. He believed that knowledge should be based on observation and experience rather than on purely theoretical or abstract reasoning. Bacon also advocated for the use of experimentation and the scientific method to gain knowledge about the natural world.
