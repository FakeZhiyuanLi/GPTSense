Zinc can be toxic to dogs, particularly in high doses or over long periods of time. It can cause symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, loss of appetite, and even liver and kidney damage. In severe cases, zinc toxicity can be fatal. Other animals such as cats and horses can also experience toxicity from zinc, although it is less common.
