Cladistics is a method in biology used to determine the evolutionary relationships between organisms. It is based on the analysis of shared characteristics, or traits, between species, which are then grouped together into "clades". These clades are then arranged in a hierarchical tree-like structure that shows how organisms are related to one another. The goal of cladistics is to provide a comprehensive and accurate understanding of the evolutionary history of life on earth.
