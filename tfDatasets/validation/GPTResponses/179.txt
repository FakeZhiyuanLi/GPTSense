Dimethylzinc, diethylzinc, and diphenylzinc are all organozinc compounds, which are chemical compounds containing a carbon-zinc bond.Dimethylzinc (Zn(CH3)2) is a colorless, flammable liquid with a pungent odor. It is used as a precursor for the synthesis of other organometallic compounds, as a catalyst in organic reactions, and as a source of ZnO thin films.Diethylzinc (Zn(C2H5)2) is another colorless, flammable liquid with a sweet odor. It has similar uses to dimethylzinc, but is also used as a pyrophoric reagent in chemical synthesis.Diphenylzinc (Zn(C6H5)2) is a white powder that decomposes upon heating. It is used as a reagent in organic synthesis and as a source of ZnO nanoparticles.
