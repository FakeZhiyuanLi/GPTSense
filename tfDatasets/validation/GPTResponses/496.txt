The samurai military was modernized during the late 19th century, specifically in the Meiji period (1868-1912) in Japan. The Meiji government implemented a series of reforms, such as the establishment of a conscription army, the adoption of modern technologies and military tactics, and the abolition of the samurai class, which ultimately led to the modernization of the samurai military.
