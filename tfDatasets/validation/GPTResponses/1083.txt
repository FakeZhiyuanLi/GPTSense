In Sufi thought, experiences that bring one closer to truth include:1) Love and devotion towards God: The Sufi path emphasizes the importance of developing a deep love and devotion towards God as the ultimate source of truth.2) Self-knowledge and self-awareness: Self-knowledge is considered essential in Sufism, as it enables one to better understand their own faults and weaknesses and to strive towards self-improvement.3) Surrender to the will of God: Surrendering to the will of God and accepting all that comes with it is believed to lead to a greater understanding of truth.4) Purification of the heart and mind: Sufism places great importance on purifying one's heart and mind of negative thoughts and emotions, such as jealousy, greed, and anger, which can cloud one's understanding of truth.5) Serving others: Serving others and showing compassion towards them is seen as a way of connecting to the divine and understanding the interconnectedness of all things.
