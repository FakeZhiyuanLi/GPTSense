One example of a maintenance-related elevator death occurred in Brooklyn, New York in 2015 when a 25-year-old man was crushed to death by an elevator while trying to exit it. The elevator had been shut down for maintenance and the technician had left the doors open while he went to retrieve tools. The man stepped into the elevator shaft, thinking the elevator was at his floor, and was crushed when the elevator suddenly started moving downward. The maintenance company was found guilty of criminally negligent homicide in 2018.
