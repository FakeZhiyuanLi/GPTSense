The Curonians were a Baltic tribe who inhabited the southern and western shores of the Baltic Sea, including the area that is now part of East Prussia. In the 13th century, the Curonians were conquered by the Teutonic Knights and gradually assimilated into German culture. Some Curonians converted to Christianity and adopted German customs, while others were forcibly expelled or enslaved. The last distinct Curonian community in East Prussia is believed to have disappeared by the 16th century.
