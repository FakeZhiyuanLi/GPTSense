The theory behind empirical analysis is that data collected through observation and experimentation can be used to understand and explain phenomena in the real world. Empirical analysis uses statistical methods to analyze and interpret data in order to test hypotheses and make predictions. The goal of empirical analysis is to produce reliable and valid findings that can be used to inform decision-making in various fields including economics, psychology, sociology, and medicine. Theories in empirical analysis are developed based on existing scientific knowledge and are tested through research. The scientific method is the basis for empirical analysis as it involves systematic observation, data collection, and hypothesis testing to arrive at a conclusion.
