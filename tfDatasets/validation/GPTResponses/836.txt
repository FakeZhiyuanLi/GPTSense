The primary reason for testing software is to ensure that it meets the requirements and functions as intended, with minimal defects or errors, before it is released to the end-users. Testing also improves the software's reliability, usability, and performance, and helps identify and resolve any issues that may affect the end-user experience or business operations. Testing is an essential part of the software development life cycle and helps ensure that the software meets the business and end-user needs.
