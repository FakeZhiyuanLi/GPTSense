The laws of thermodynamics do not change in the heat death of energy. These laws describe the fundamental principles that govern the behavior and transformation of energy in the universe. They dictate that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or transformed, and that the total entropy (or disorder) of a closed system always tends to increase over time. These laws remain constant and applicable even in the heat death of energy.
