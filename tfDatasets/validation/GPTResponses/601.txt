Gender is another problematic category due to sexism and discrimination based on traditional gender roles and stereotypes. People are often judged and treated unfairly based on their gender, leading to inequalities in areas such as education, employment, and healthcare. Additionally, individuals who do not identify as male or female often face discrimination and lack of inclusion in society.
