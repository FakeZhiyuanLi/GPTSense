is called a chemical reaction. Specifically, when hydrogen reacts with oxygen in the presence of a catalyst, like a fuel cell, the chemical energy stored in the hydrogen molecules is converted into electrical energy and water vapor is produced as a byproduct. This process is called hydrogen fuel cell technology, and it represents an efficient and eco-friendly way to generate electricity.
