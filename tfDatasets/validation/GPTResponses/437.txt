There are several factors that partially account for the appearance of light skin in humans. One of the key factors is the distribution and intensity of sunlight in different regions of the world. People living in regions with low sunlight exposure had to adapt to produce more Vitamin D, which is synthesized in the skin when exposed to sunlight. This adaptation favored lighter skin pigmentation, which allows for better UV radiation absorption.Another factor is selective pressure for sexual attraction. It is suggested that light skin in humans evolved as a sexually selected trait, as it is perceived as a sign of youth, health, and fertility. This means that individuals who possess light skin may have had an evolutionary advantage in finding a mate and reproducing.There are also genetic factors involved. Research has shown that several genes are responsible for skin pigmentation, and mutations in these genes can lead to variations in skin color.Overall, the appearance of light skin in humans is likely the result of a combination of environmental, social, and genetic factors.
