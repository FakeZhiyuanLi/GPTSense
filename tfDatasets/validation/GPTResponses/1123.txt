The term "quartiers sensibles" is often used in France to refer to neighborhoods that are economically or socially deprived and have higher crime rates. They are usually located in urban areas, particularly in Paris and Marseille, but also in other cities across the country. However, it is important to note that the concept of "quartiers sensibles" is subjective and varies depending on who is using the term.
