The idea that humans can be divided into biologically distinct races is often used to justify discriminatory practices and policies based on race, such as segregation, racial profiling, and eugenics. These practices rely on the belief that certain races are inherently superior or inferior to others in terms of intelligence, physical abilities, and cultural values. Additionally, the idea of race has been used to support theories of biological determinism, which suggest that individual and group outcomes are predetermined by genes and cannot be changed by environmental factors such as education or social opportunities.
