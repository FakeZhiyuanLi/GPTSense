The branch of physics that might support a worldview similar to Platonic dualism is quantum physics. This is because quantum physics theorizes that the world is made up of two distinct entities - particles and waves. These entities are believed to coexist in a complementary relationship, much like the soul and body in Platonic dualism. Additionally, quantum physics suggests that there may be a non-physical aspect to the universe, as particles can exist in a state of entanglement, where their movements are linked regardless of distance, suggesting a form of interconnectedness beyond physical space. This idea of interconnectedness is reminiscent of the Platonic concept of a spiritual realm that ties all physical objects together.
