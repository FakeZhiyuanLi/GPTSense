For example, the Quran describes the development of the human embryo in great detail, which was discovered by modern science only recently.2. Prophecies: The Quran contains many prophecies that have come true. For example, it predicted the victory of the Romans over the Persians, which happened soon after the Quran was revealed.3. Linguistic Eloquence: The Quran is considered to be a masterpiece of Arabic literature. Its poetic and eloquent language is seen as a sign of its divine origin.4. Moral Teachings: The Quran contains many teachings that promote good morals and ethical behavior. Its emphasis on honesty, justice, compassion, and forgiveness is seen as evidence of its divine wisdom.5. Preservation: The Quran has been preserved in its original form for over 1400 years, with no changes or alterations. This is seen as a miracle in itself, as no other ancient text has been preserved in this way.
