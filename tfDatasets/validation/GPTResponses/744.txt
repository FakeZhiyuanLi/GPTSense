Most of the eastward sector of the Roman expanse chose to have a rebirth of Greek traditions and appreciations in the Hellenistic period, which lasted from the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE to the Roman conquest of Greece in 146 BCE. During this time, Greek culture and language spread throughout the eastern Mediterranean and Asia Minor, influencing the development of Hellenistic kingdoms and cities in Egypt, Syria, and Asia Minor. The Romans later adopted and adapted many aspects of Greek culture and philosophy during the era of Roman Hellenism in the 2nd and 3rd centuries CE.
