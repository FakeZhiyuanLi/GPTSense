An object's movement through space is determined by several factors:1. Speed: The rate at which the object is moving.2. Velocity: The speed and direction of the object's movement.3. Acceleration: The change in velocity over time.4. Inertia: The object's resistance to change in motion.5. Gravity: The force that attracts objects towards each other.6. Friction: The force that opposes motion when two surfaces come into contact.7. Air resistance: The friction caused by the object moving through air.8. Momentum: The object's mass multiplied by its velocity.
