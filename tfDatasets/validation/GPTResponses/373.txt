The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the following measures for treating malnutrition and diarrhea:1. Oral rehydration therapy (ORT): ORT is the cornerstone of treatment for diarrhea, especially in children. It involves replacing lost fluids and electrolytes by giving a solution of sugar, salt, and water.2. Nutritional support: Malnourished people need additional nutrients to help rebuild their bodies. WHO recommends that children with severe acute malnutrition be treated with ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTFs) or other specialized foods, which contain all the necessary nutrients.3. Correcting micronutrient deficiencies: In addition to macronutrients like protein and carbohydrates, people with malnutrition may be deficient in essential vitamins and minerals. WHO recommends correcting these deficiencies through vitamin and mineral supplements or fortified foods.4. Treat underlying infections: Infections like pneumonia and malaria can worsen malnutrition, so it's important to identify and treat these conditions promptly.5. Improve hygiene and sanitation: Poor hygiene and sanitation can lead to diarrhea and worsen malnutrition. WHO recommends improving access to clean water and sanitation facilities to reduce the incidence of diarrhea and other infectious diseases.
