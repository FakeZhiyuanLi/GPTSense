Behavioral psychologists, such as Ivan Pavlov, B.F. Skinner, and Edward Thorndike, focused on identifying stimuli that can influence learning. They conducted experiments to understand how behaviors are shaped by the environment and how stimuli (positive or negative) can influence an individual's learning and behavior. They believed that behavior is a product of the environment and that learning occurs through repeated reinforcement and conditioning.
