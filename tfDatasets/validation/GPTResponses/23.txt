Stage 1 in the life of a bill is the introduction stage. This is when the bill is first introduced in either the House of Representatives or the Senate. The bill is assigned a number and given a title that indicates its purpose. The sponsor of the bill introduces it by reading it aloud or by placing it in a hopper. The bill is then referred to a committee for review and consideration.
