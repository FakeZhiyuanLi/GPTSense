Many Greeks migrated to cities in Western Europe and North America after the 19th century. This migration was driven by economic and political reasons, as well as by the desire to escape poverty, war, or persecution. Some popular destinations included New York City, Chicago, London, Melbourne, Sydney, and Toronto.
