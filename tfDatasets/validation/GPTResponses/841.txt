Chemical energy is stored in the bonds between atoms and molecules. When these bonds are broken, the energy is released. Chemical energy can be found in various forms, such as in food, fuels, and batteries, among others. When these substances are burned or oxidized, the chemical energy is released and transformed into other forms of energy, such as heat, light, or electrical energy. The location of chemical energy storage depends on the substance, but it is usually found in the chemical structure of organic compounds such as carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins.
