There are a few things that can reduce the amount of force needed to propel a cab:1. Aerodynamic design: A cab with a sleek aerodynamic design can reduce wind resistance and drag, which in turn reduces the force needed to propel the cab.2. Lightweight materials: A cab made of lightweight materials such as aluminum or carbon fiber reduces the weight that needs to be moved, therefore reducing the force needed.3. Efficient engine: An efficient engine with good fuel economy can reduce the amount of force needed to power the cab.4. Low rolling resistance tires: Tires with low rolling resistance require less force to move the cab.5. Regenerative braking systems: When a cab brakes, the energy is usually lost as heat. A regenerative braking system captures some of this energy and converts it to electricity that can be used to power the cab, reducing the force needed from the engine.
