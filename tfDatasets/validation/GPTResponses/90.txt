Portugal has one of the highest rates of consumption of seafood, particularly codfish (bacalhau), sardines, and octopus. Other popular Portuguese dishes include grilled meat, stews, soups, and pastries such as pastel de nata (custard tart) and arroz doce (sweet rice pudding). Olive oil, wine, and cheese are also important components of the Portuguese diet.
