The word "glass" commonly refers to a transparent or translucent material made by melting sand and other materials together and cooling them rapidly to form a hard, often brittle substance. Glass can come in many forms, including clear, tinted, frosted, tempered, laminated, and more. Glass is used in a variety of applications, such as windows, mirrors, lenses, screens, bottles, jars, and decorative objects.
