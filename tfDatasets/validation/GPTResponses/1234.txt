China has never lost its permanent seat at the UN Security Council. China became a permanent member of the Security Council, along with the United States, United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union (now replaced by Russia), when the UN was established in 1945. The five permanent members have veto power over any substantive Security Council resolution, making them the most powerful actors in the UN system.
