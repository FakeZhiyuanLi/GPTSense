The terms "Hispanic" and "Latino" are not specific because they are broad categories that encompass a diverse group of people with various cultural backgrounds, nationalities, and ancestries. The terms are often used interchangeably and can refer to people who come from or have cultural ties to various Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America or Spain. However, there are differences between various Hispanic/Latino populations, including differences in language, religion, customs, and traditions. Additionally, these terms do not capture the diversity within each individual community or ethnicity, nor do they take into account factors such as race or immigration status.
