Hume argued that our expectation of the sun rising was based on past experiences and the principle of uniformity of nature. According to this principle, we assume that the future will be like the past and that the same causes will produce the same effects. Therefore, since we have consistently observed the sun rising every day, we expect it to continue to do so in the future. However, Hume also cautioned that this expectation is not based on logical reasoning or any necessary connection between past and future events, but rather on habit and custom.
