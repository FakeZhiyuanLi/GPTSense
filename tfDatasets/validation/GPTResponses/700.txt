The foundation that was laid for the demographics of the modern Greek Enlightenment era was the Greek War of Independence that started in 1821. The war brought about significant changes in the social, economic and political landscape of Greece, leading to a surge in population growth, urbanization, and the emergence of a middle class. With the establishment of the modern Greek state in 1830, there was a renewed interest in education and the pursuit of knowledge, leading to the emergence of intellectuals and scholars who would become the driving force of the Greek Enlightenment era. These intellectuals were mostly middle-class and came from urban areas, and they played a significant role in shaping Greek society and culture.
