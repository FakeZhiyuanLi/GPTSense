The formalization of the division of small powers and great powers can be traced back to the Congress of Vienna in 1815. This international conference was held after the defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte, and its purpose was to reestablish stability and balance of power in Europe. The Congress recognized the importance of maintaining order and stability in the international system by creating a hierarchy of powers based on their importance and influence. The Great Powers, which included Russia, Prussia, Austria, Britain, and France, were recognized as the dominant powers in Europe, while the smaller powers were relegated to a lower status. This formalization of the division of powers helped to shape international relations in Europe and beyond for the next century.
