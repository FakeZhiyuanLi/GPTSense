1) Simulating a high volume of users accessing the system simultaneously: This method involves creating a virtual environment that simulates a real-world scenario where many users are accessing the system simultaneously. This is done by using specialized software that generates a large number of requests to the system, which can then be measured and analyzed to identify any performance bottlenecks.2) Stress testing: This method involves pushing the system to its limits by subjecting it to conditions that exceed its normal operating capacity. This can involve increasing the load on the system beyond what it was designed to handle, or introducing faults or errors deliberately to see how it responds. Stress testing is useful for identifying the maximum capacity of the system, as well as any vulnerabilities or weak points that need to be addressed.
