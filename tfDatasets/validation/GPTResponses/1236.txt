The primacy of the United States has factored into maintaining peace among powers, especially since the end of World War II. The United States emerged as the dominant superpower and has played a leading role in creating and maintaining various international organizations and agreements, such as the United Nations, NATO, and the World Trade Organization. The US has also imposed economic sanctions and deployed military forces to maintain peace in conflict zones. The US's global influence and military capabilities have deterred other countries from engaging in conflict and have been crucial in promoting global security and stability.
