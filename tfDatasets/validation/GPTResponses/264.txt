There were several philosophers and thinkers throughout history who could be considered extreme empiricists, such as:1. John Locke - Locke is considered one of the founding fathers of empiricism, believing that all knowledge is derived from sensory experience.2. David Hume - Hume also believed that all knowledge comes from sensory experience, and argued that there is no rational basis for many of our beliefs.3. Francis Bacon - Bacon emphasized the importance of observation and experiment in the pursuit of knowledge, advocating for a scientific method based on empirical evidence.4. John Stuart Mill - Mill was a strong advocate for empiricism and believed that all knowledge should be based on observation and experiment.Overall, extreme empiricists believe that knowledge of the world can only be gained through sensory experience and the careful observation of phenomena, with no room for intuition or speculation.
