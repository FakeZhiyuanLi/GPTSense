In a reversible isothermal expansion of an ideal gas, all of the heat energy absorbed by the system can be fully converted into work. This is because the process is reversible, which means that there is no irreversibility in the system which can lead to energy losses. Additionally, the expansion is isothermal, which means that the temperature of the system remains constant throughout the process, ensuring that all of the absorbed heat energy can be converted into work without any loss or gain of thermal energy. Therefore, in a reversible isothermal expansion of an ideal gas, all of the absorbed heat energy can be fully converted into work.
