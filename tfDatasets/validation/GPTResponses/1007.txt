There is no fixed number of ahzab (chapters) in a juz' (part) of the Quran as the division of the Quran into juz' is based on the length of the surahs (chapters) and not on the number of ahzab (chapters) in it. Each juz' consists of roughly 20-25 surahs depending on their length. However, on average, one juz' may have around 4-7 ahzab (chapters).
