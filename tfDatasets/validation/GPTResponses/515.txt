One notable disciple of Leibniz was Christian Wolff. He was a German philosopher who expanded on and popularized many of Leibniz's ideas, particularly in the fields of metaphysics, ethics, and mathematics. Wolff was a professor of philosophy at the University of Halle, and his works helped to spread Leibniz's ideas throughout Europe.
