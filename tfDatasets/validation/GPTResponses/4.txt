Maududi, also known as Sayyid Abul A'la Maududi, exerted the most impact in his home country of Pakistan and in the broader Islamic world. He founded the political party Jamaat-e-Islami in 1941, which aimed to establish an Islamic state in Pakistan and promote Islamic values and principles in society. Through his writings and speeches, Maududi also influenced many Islamic movements and organizations around the world, including the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and the Islamic revival movement in Indonesia. His ideas on Islamic governance, the role of women in society, and the relationship between Islam and politics continue to be influential in Islamic discourse to this day.
