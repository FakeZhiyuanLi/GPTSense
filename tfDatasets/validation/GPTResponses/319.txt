Several Greek philosophers had idealistic views, including:1. Plato: believed that material world is only a shadow of the real world of ideas and that true knowledge is not gained through sensory experience but through reason.2. Pythagoras: believed that the universe is based on math, and that everything in the universe can be explained through mathematical principles.3. Parmenides: believed that reality is unchanging and that change is an illusion created by our senses.4. Plotinus: believed in a hierarchical structure of reality, with the ultimate reality being a divine and transcendent One.5. Proclus: believed that the universe is an emanation from a divine source and that knowledge of this source can be attained through the contemplation of divine beauty.These philosophers were all inspired by the idealistic philosophy of Plato and sought to understand reality through reason and contemplation of the ultimate truth.
