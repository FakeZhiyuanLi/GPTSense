The Ottoman court system adopted four tiers:1. Kad覺 Courts - lowest level courts, presided over by kad覺s (judges) and dealt with minor civil and criminal cases.2. Kaza Courts - dealt with more serious civil and criminal cases and were overseen by a kad覺-覺 kaza (chief judge).3. Provincial Courts - handled appeals from the kaza courts and were presided over by the pasha (governor) of the province.4. Imperial Supreme Court - highest level court, presided over by the Sultan and his advisors. It dealt with the most serious cases and served as the final court of appeal.
