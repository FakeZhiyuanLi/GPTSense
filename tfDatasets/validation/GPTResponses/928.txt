Forensic anthropologists are very good at identifying human remains, especially by analyzing skeletal remains. They can determine the age, sex, height, and ancestry of a person based on bone structure and skull characteristics. They can also analyze trauma to the bones, such as fractures or bullet holes, and determine the cause and manner of death. Additionally, they can analyze teeth, clothing, and personal effects found with the remains to provide more information about the person's identity. Forensic anthropologists are also skilled in interpreting data from other experts, such as DNA analysts and pathologists, to assist in identifying individuals.
