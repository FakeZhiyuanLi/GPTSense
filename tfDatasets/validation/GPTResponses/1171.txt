The presence of a meniscus or boundary layer is evidence that there is an inner surface between glass and melt. This is visible as a curved shape where the glass and melt meet, caused by differences in the surface tension of the two materials. Additionally, chemical and physical analysis of the interface can reveal differences in composition or structure compared to the bulk materials.
