During the Cretaceous period, it was thought that areas near the seas had a warm, humid climate with high levels of rainfall. This was due to the greenhouse effect caused by high levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the absence of polar ice caps. As a result, the sea level was much higher than it is today, with shallow seas covering large portions of the continents. These areas were teeming with marine life and supported diverse ecosystems.
