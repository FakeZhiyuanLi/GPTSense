The section of the Quran that inspires some Muslims to ritually wash themselves before touching their copy is Surah Al-Waqiah (Chapter 56). This surah discusses the importance of cleanliness and purity, and some Muslims believe that they should cleanse themselves before coming into contact with the Quran as a sign of respect and reverence. This practice is known as wudu or ablution.
