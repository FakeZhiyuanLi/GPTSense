The exponential dependence of a reaction rate on temperature is described by the Arrhenius equation. It states that the rate constant (k) of a reaction is a function of the activation energy (Ea), temperature (T), and the gas constant (R), and can be expressed as:k = A * exp(-Ea/RT)where A is the preexponential factor or frequency factor, and exp means "raised to the power of e," which is approximately 2.71828. This equation shows that the rate constant increases exponentially with increasing temperature, with a greater effect on the reaction rate at higher temperatures due to the exponential dependence.
