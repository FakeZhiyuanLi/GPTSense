The Taira clan expanded their power through a combination of military conquest, strategic marriage alliances, and political alliances.They initially gained political and military power in the late 11th century through their alliance with the Fujiwara clan, the most powerful family in Kyoto at the time. They also developed a strong navy and controlled the sea routes, allowing them to expand their influence along the coast of Japan.In the late 12th century, the Taira clan seized power from the Minamoto clan, their main rivals, through a series of battles known as the Genpei War. The Taira clan won several key battles, including the Battle of Dannoura in 1185, which gave them control over Japan.However, their rule was short-lived, as the Minamoto clan eventually regrouped, defeated the Taira clan, and established a new shogunate in Kamakura.
