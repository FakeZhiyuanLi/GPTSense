Energy or vice versa, according to the principle of mass-energy equivalence proposed by Albert Einstein in his famous equation E=mcÂ². This means that matter is a form of energy and the two are interchangeable. It is possible to convert matter to energy through processes such as nuclear reactions, which release vast amounts of energy from small amounts of matter. Conversely, energy can be converted into matter through processes such as pair production, where high-energy photons can create matter-antimatter pairs.
