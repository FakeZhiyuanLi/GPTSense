The factor used to expel or include citizens in the Lausanne Treaty was based on their ethnicity and religion. The treaty aimed to establish populations based on religious and ethnic lines, which led to the agreement to exchange populations between Greece and Turkey. Greek Orthodox Christians were forced to leave Turkey, while Muslims were forced to leave Greece. The treaty also granted minority protections for some ethnic and religious groups that remained in the countries.
