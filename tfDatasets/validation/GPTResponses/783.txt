Forensic anthropologists can determine several things about the ancestors of someone from their skeletal remains:1. Ancestral origin: By studying the cranial features, dental morphology, and other skeletal characteristics, forensic anthropologists can determine the race or ethnicity of the individual's ancestors. For example, they may be able to determine whether the individual's ancestors were of African, European, Asian, or Native American descent.2. Age: By analyzing the sutures on the skull and the degeneration of the joints and bones, forensic anthropologists can determine the approximate age of the individual at death. This information can also provide clues about the age of the individual's ancestors.3. Health status: Skeletal remains can reveal important information about an individual's health history, including evidence of disease, malnutrition, trauma, and other health conditions. This information can also provide insights into the health status of the individual's ancestors.4. Physical characteristics: Forensic anthropologists can study the size and shape of the bones to determine physical characteristics such as height, weight, and body type. This information can also provide clues about the physical characteristics of the individual's ancestors.Overall, forensic anthropologists can combine multiple pieces of information from skeletal remains to paint a picture of an individual's ancestry, health history, and physical characteristics.
