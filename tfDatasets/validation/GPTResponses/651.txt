The movement that caused the resurgence of neoclassicism is known as the "neoclassical revival" and occurred in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. This movement was a reaction to the excesses of the Rococo and Baroque styles that were prevalent in the previous centuries, and sought to revive the classical principles of simplicity, symmetry, and proportion that characterized ancient Greek and Roman architecture and art. The neoclassical revival was also driven by a growing interest in classical antiquity, as well as a desire to express the Enlightenment ideals of reason, order, and rationality in art and architecture. The movement was particularly influential in Europe and America, and can be seen in the works of artists and architects such as Jacques-Louis David, John Flaxman, and Thomas Jefferson.
