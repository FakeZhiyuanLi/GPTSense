is known as "opera seria" emerged in the 17th century. This form was characterized by a more serious, dramatic tone, often featuring historical or mythological subject matter and showcasing the technical abilities of trained singers. Opera seria also employed a recitative style of singing that was closer to speech than to traditional melodic singing. This marked a departure from earlier forms of opera, which tended to be more lighthearted and comedic, and relied on simple melodies and harmonies.
