Many Circassians were forced to leave their homes in the Caucasus due to the Russian-Circassian War in the 19th century. They migrated to various places, including the Ottoman Empire (modern-day Turkey, Syria, and Jordan), Egypt, and other parts of the Middle East. Later on, Circassian migrants also settled in Western Europe, North America, and Australia.
