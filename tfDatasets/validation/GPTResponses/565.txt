The traction machine is typically guided by a control panel that is operated by a physical therapist or other medical professional. The control panel allows the therapist to adjust the amount of force being applied to the patient's body, as well as the duration and frequency of the traction therapy. The machine itself includes a motor that powers the movement of the device and a number of gears and pulleys that help to distribute the force evenly across the patient's body. In some cases, the traction machine may also include sensors or other advanced technologies to help monitor the patient's progress and adjust the treatment accordingly. Ultimately, the precise mechanisms that guide the traction machine will depend on the specific type and model of equipment being used, as well as the individual needs of the patient.
