The solar process that can be used to produce different fuels is known as artificial photosynthesis. This process involves using sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into various fuels such as hydrogen, methane, and ethanol. The process mimics the natural photosynthesis process that occurs in plants. Artificial photosynthesis technology is still in its early stages of development, but it has the potential to play a significant role in the production of renewable and sustainable fuels in the future.
