The cluster structure of genetic data is dependent on the initial set of genetic markers used for the analysis. The choice of markers can greatly influence the resulting clusters and can potentially affect the accuracy of the conclusions drawn from the analysis. Therefore, it is important to carefully select an appropriate set of markers based on the research question and the genetic population being studied.
