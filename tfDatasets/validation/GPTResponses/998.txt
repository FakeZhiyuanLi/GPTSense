The lowest quantum mechanical energy state of photons is known as the ground state or the vacuum state. This is the state in which there are no photons present, and the energy of the electromagnetic field is at its lowest possible level. However, it should be noted that the concept of a ground state or vacuum state is a theoretical construct and cannot be observed directly.
