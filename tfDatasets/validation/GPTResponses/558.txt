The imperial Roman style originated from a blend of Greek, Etruscan, and Italic influences in the 1st century BC during the Augustan era. Augustus, the first Roman emperor, sought to create a new visual language that would express the power and authority of the Roman Empire. He commissioned vast public buildings, monumental sculptures, and ornate decorative arts that celebrated the military conquests and political achievements of his reign. The imperial Roman style was characterized by its grand scale, bold architectural forms, richly embellished surfaces, and classical motifs. It continued to evolve and flourish throughout the Roman Empire until the 4th century AD.
