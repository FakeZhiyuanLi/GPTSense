One example of an excessively loyal samurai is the story of the 47 Ronin, who avenged the death of their lord Asano Naganori by killing his enemy, Kira Yoshinaka. The samurai had been forced to become ronin (masterless samurai) after their lord was ordered to commit seppuku (ritual suicide) for drawing his sword in the shogun's palace. Despite being forbidden from taking revenge, the 47 Ronin spent two years planning and executing their attack on Kira's estate, knowing that it would lead to their own deaths. Their extreme loyalty and commitment to the Bushido code of honor made them a symbol of samurai spirit and inspired many stories, plays, and movies.
