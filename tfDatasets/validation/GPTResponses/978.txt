After a major change in code that leads to regression, the software may not function as intended and may cause errors, bugs, crashes or even data corruption. The development team will need to identify the root cause of the regression and fix it immediately. They will also need to perform thorough testing to ensure that the software continues to function as expected and any existing functionality has not been impacted by the changes made. The team may also need to roll back to a previous version of the code or release an emergency patch to fix the issues. It is important to address any regressions quickly and effectively to minimize any negative impact on users and maintain the quality of the software.
