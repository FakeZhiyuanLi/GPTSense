The Coulomb force, also known as the electrostatic force, is responsible for the interaction between electric charges. This force is generated by the presence of electric charges and is mediated by the electric field. The Coulomb force is attractive between charges of opposite sign and repulsive between charges of the same sign. The strength of the Coulomb force depends on the distance between the charges and the magnitude of the charges. It follows an inverse square law, meaning that its strength decreases as the separation between the charges increases.
