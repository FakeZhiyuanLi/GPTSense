Berkeley considered matter to be merely an idea in the mind of an observer, rather than a physical material substance existing independently of perception. He famously stated, "To be is to be perceived" which means that the existence of anything, including matter, depends on it being perceived or observed by a conscious mind. In other words, matter has no reality outside of our perception of it.
