Middle powers are countries with significant influence and resources that are not considered great powers or superpowers. They are considered intermediate players in global politics, often playing a key role in international relations, diplomacy, and regional stability. Some examples of middle powers include Canada, Australia, South Korea, Switzerland, and Sweden. These countries have substantial economic, military, or diplomatic capabilities, and can often act as intermediaries or mediators between larger powers in international conflicts or negotiations.
