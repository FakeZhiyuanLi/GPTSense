Hobson argued that imperialism was an international economic phenomenon driven by capitalist interests seeking new markets and investment opportunities. He believed that the monopolistic control of resources and markets by a small group of financiers and business interests was at the root of imperialism, leading to conflicts and exploitation of the colonized nations. His analysis emphasized the economic and political factors behind imperialism, rather than cultural or racial factors, and he advocated for international cooperation and a more equitable global economic system.
