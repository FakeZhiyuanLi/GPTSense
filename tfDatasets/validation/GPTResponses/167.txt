Many residents in some parts of the world, such as the Philippines and Indonesia, combine Islamic and Christian practices. This practice is commonly known as syncretism, where people adopt beliefs and practices from two or more religions. In the Philippines, for example, the people practice a unique blend of Christianity and Islam, known as "Chrislam." This blend includes the use of both the Bible and the Quran in religious practices, as well as combining Christian and Islamic holidays and traditions.
