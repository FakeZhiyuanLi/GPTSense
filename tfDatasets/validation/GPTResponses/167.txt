Meanwhile, other insects like grasshoppers, caterpillars, and aphids feed on the foliage, stems, and roots of plants for nutrition.In addition, certain insects such as ladybugs and lacewings prey on other insects that may be harmful to plants. Lastly, insects also use plants as a source of shelter and protection from predators.
