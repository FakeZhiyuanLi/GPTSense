ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) was intended to be a standardized system for encoding textual information on computers and communications equipment. Its purpose was to ensure that information could be transferred between different computer systems and devices, regardless of the manufacturer or origin, without any loss or corruption of data. ASCII was first developed in the 1960s and has since become the de facto standard for representing text in digital form, with a wide range of applications in computing, telecommunications, and other industries.
