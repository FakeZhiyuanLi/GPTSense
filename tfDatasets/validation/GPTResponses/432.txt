The Yuan dynasty, led by Kublai Khan, attempted two major invasions of Japan in 1274 and 1281. In the first invasion, they sent about 900 ships and in the second invasion, they sent approximately 4,000 ships with an estimated 140,000 soldiers. However, both invasions were unsuccessful due to various factors such as bad weather, strong resistance from the Japanese defenders, and the superior tactics of the Japanese navy.
