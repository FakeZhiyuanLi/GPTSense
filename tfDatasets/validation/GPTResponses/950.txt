Unit testing looks to eliminate defects or bugs in code by testing each individual unit or component of the code in isolation from the rest of the system. It ensures that each unit meets its design specifications and functions correctly before integrating it with the other units. The purpose of unit testing is to identify and fix errors early in the development cycle, so they do not become more complex and expensive to fix downstream. By eliminating defects in the code, unit testing improves the software quality, reliability, and maintainability.
