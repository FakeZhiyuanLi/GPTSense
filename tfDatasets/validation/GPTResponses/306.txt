Artificial intelligence researchers have no generally accepted concept of population. This is because the concept of population is mostly used in statistics and biology, whereas artificial intelligence researchers focus on creating algorithms and models that work with specific datasets rather than generalizing to entire populations. However, some AI researchers have developed their own definitions of population within their own subfields, such as reinforcement learning, deep learning, and evolutionary algorithms.
