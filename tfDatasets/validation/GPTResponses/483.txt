Bushido, the code of conduct for samurai, was originally formulated in the 12th century in Japan. However, it was not formalized until the 17th and 18th centuries during the Tokugawa Shogunate. The code was further refined and popularized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, during the Meiji period, as part of the government's efforts to modernize and unify Japan.
