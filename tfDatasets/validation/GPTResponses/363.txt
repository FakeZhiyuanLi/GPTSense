The water scenes in Jaws were filmed using a combination of techniques.1. Real shark footage: Filmmakers shot real footage of sharks swimming in the ocean to use in the movie. However, it was not enough to depict the terrifying creature that the shark in the movie was supposed to be.2. Mechanical shark: The movie famously used a mechanical shark nicknamed "Bruce" to create the attacks and chase scenes. The underwater scenes with the mechanical shark were shot using a variety of rigs and platforms to make the shark look as real as possible.3. Divers in shark suits: During some of the scenes, divers wearing shark suits were filmed to give the impression of the sharks swimming below the surface.4. Miniature models: Some of the close-up shots of the shark were filmed using miniature models that were operated by the filmmakers.All of these techniques were combined to create the terrifying scenes of the shark attacking and stalking its prey in the water.
