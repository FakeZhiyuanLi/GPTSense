The Ottoman Empire attempted to balance religious and legal diversity in its legal policies. The empire was home to a diverse set of religious communities, including Muslims, Christians, and Jews, and it sought to create a legal system that respected the rights of each group. The empire's legal policies were therefore designed to balance the preservation of Islamic law with the recognition of the rights and legal traditions of non-Muslim communities. This was achieved through a complex web of legal codes and institutions that attempted to accommodate the different religious and legal traditions of the empire's inhabitants.
