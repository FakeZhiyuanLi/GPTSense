The Ottoman state was guided by the practice of Islam in its responsibilities, as the Ottoman Empire was an Islamic state. Islamic principles and laws were used to govern the society and make decisions related to justice, trade, and administration. Sharia law was established as the legal system of the state, and Islamic scholars served as advisors to the sultan and other government officials. The Ottoman state also provided support for mosques and religious schools, which reinforced the importance of Islam in society.
