High-index glasses are valued because they are thinner and lighter than regular glasses. This makes them more comfortable to wear, especially for people with strong prescriptions, and they also provide better visual acuity. Additionally, high-index glasses are often more aesthetically appealing, as they can create a more natural look by reducing the magnification and distortions that can occur with thicker lenses. Finally, they can be a more convenient option, as they may not require as much material or as large of a frame, making them more portable and easier to fit into a variety of styles.
