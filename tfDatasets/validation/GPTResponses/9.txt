discriminatory policies against Muslims?The inability to separate Islam from Islamism can lead many in the West to support discriminatory policies against Muslims because it creates a false belief that all Muslims are potential terrorists and that their religion promotes violence and radicalism. This misconception is further reinforced by media coverage of violent attacks that are attributed to Islam and the conflating of the terms "Muslim" and "terrorist."This misguided perception of Islam results in policies that target Muslims based on their religion, such as travel bans, surveillance, and exclusionary immigration policies. It also leads to hate and violence against Muslims, including harassment, assault, and the desecration of their places of worship.Therefore, it is essential to emphasize the distinction between Islam and Islamism and to recognize that the majority of Muslims are peaceful and law-abiding citizens who do not advocate violence or support extremist ideologies. It is only by separating Islam from terrorism and rejecting discriminatory policies based on religion that we can promote peace, tolerance, and equality for all.
