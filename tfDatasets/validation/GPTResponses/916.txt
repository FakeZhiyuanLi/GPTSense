The development of changes under Ottoman rule led to lowered status and loss of power for the Greeks. Their institutions, traditions, and language were suppressed, and they were often subjected to discriminatory policies and violence. The Greek Orthodox Church was also placed under the control of the Ottoman authorities, limiting its ability to function independently. As a result, many Greeks migrated to other parts of Europe or the Americas, seeking a better life and greater freedom. However, despite the challenges they faced, the Greeks managed to preserve their language, culture, and identity, and ultimately emerged as an independent nation in the 19th century.
