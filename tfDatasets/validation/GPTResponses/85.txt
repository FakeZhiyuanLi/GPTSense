Portugal spearheaded the European Age of Discovery (also known as the Age of Exploration) in the 15th and 16th centuries. During this time, Portuguese explorers such as Vasco da Gama and Ferdinand Magellan established new trade routes, discovered new lands, and expanded European knowledge of the world. Portugal's exploration efforts helped to establish a global network of trade and led to the establishment of colonial empires in the New World and Asia.
