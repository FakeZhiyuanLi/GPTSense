The Italian city-state of Florence is often credited with the revival of Greek way of life during the Renaissance. The Medici family, who were influential patrons of the arts, supported the study of ancient texts and sponsored scholars who traveled to Greece to learn Greek language and culture. This led to a renewed interest in Greek philosophy, literature, and art, and contributed to the spread of humanism and the growth of Italian Renaissance.
