Entropy is a measure of the degree of disorder or randomness in a system. In thermodynamics, it is a property that quantifies the number of possible arrangements of molecules or particles in a given system. The higher the entropy, the more disordered and less predictable the system is. In information theory, entropy refers to the amount of uncertainty or randomness in a message or signal. The concept of entropy is used in many fields such as physics, chemistry, biology, and computer science.
