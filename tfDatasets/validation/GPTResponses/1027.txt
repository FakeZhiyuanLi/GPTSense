When an isolated system is given more degrees of freedom, the mathematical result is an increase in entropy. This means that the system becomes more disordered and has a greater number of possible states. This is known as the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which states that the entropy of an isolated system will always tend to increase over time, and that any process that occurs in nature will always obey this law.
