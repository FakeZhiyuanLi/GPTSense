One notable legal case involving open source and IBM is the SCO v. IBM case. In 2003, The SCO Group sued IBM for alleged copyright infringement and breach of contract related to its use of Linux, which is an open-source operating system. SCO claimed that IBM had improperly contributed code from its Unix system to Linux. The case went on for several years before ultimately being dismissed in 2011 after a judge ruled that SCO did not have ownership of the disputed intellectual property.
