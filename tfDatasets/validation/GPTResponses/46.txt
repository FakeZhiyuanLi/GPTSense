Tajikistan did not exist as a distinct political entity during the time of the Umayyad Caliphate (661-750 CE). The region that is now Tajikistan was part of the larger Persia region, which was conquered by the Muslim Arab armies during the Umayyad period. However, the specific territory of Tajikistan was not specifically controlled by the Umayyads or any other Islamic empire until later periods.
