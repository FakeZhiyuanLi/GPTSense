If people are related by descent, it means they share a common ancestor or ancestors. It refers to the biological or genetic relationship between individuals who are part of the same family tree. For example, a person's parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, and so on are all their ancestors, and any siblings, cousins, nephews, and nieces are all related to each other by descent through those ancestors.
