The Greek influence in "Little" Asia, also known as Anatolia, lasted for several centuries, from the time of the Greek colonization in the 8th century BC until the gradual decline in the power of the Greek-speaking Byzantine Empire and the expansion of the Turkish Ottoman Empire in the 13th century AD. During this period, Greek language, culture, and religion had a significant impact on the region, and numerous Greek city-states, colonies, and kingdoms flourished in Anatolia. The Greek influence in Anatolia continues to be felt today, as many ancient Greek ruins and monuments still stand in the region, and Greek language and culture have left a lasting legacy on the local population.
