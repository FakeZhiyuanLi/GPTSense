Hydraulic cranes use Pascal's law in the following manner:1. Pascal's law states that when pressure is applied at one point in a closed fluid system, the pressure is transmitted equally to all points in the system.2. Hydraulic cranes use fluid (usually oil) to transfer force from one point to another. The fluid is held in a closed system of pipes and cylinders.3. The crane operator applies force to the fluid by pumping a lever, which creates pressure in the system.4. The pressure created by the operator is transmitted equally to all points in the system, including the cylinder that raises and lowers the crane's arm.5. As the pressure is transmitted to the cylinder, it pushes a piston, causing the arm to move up or down.6. The arm's movement is directly proportional to the amount of pressure applied by the operator. This allows for precise control of the crane's movements.Overall, hydraulic cranes leverage Pascal's law by using fluid pressure to move heavy objects, including those that would be impossible to lift manually.
