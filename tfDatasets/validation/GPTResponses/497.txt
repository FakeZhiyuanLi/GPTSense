According to Hegel, thought necessarily takes the form of a dialectic process or the movement of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. This process involves the clash or opposition of two opposing ideas or concepts (thesis and antithesis), resulting in the creation of a new and higher level of understanding (synthesis). Hegel believed that this dialectic process was not only present in thought but also in the historical and social development of human society.
