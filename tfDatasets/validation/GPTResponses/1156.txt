Different materials are used in a laboratory for experimentation and research purposes, whereas in factory production, materials are used to create final products for sale. The materials used in the laboratory are typically of higher purity and quality and are often more expensive, as they need to meet strict standards to ensure accuracy and reliability of results. In factory production, the materials used are chosen based on their cost-effectiveness and availability, as well as their suitability for the intended end-use of the product. Additionally, the processes used to manufacture materials for lab use are often different from those used in factory production, as the former requires more rigorous testing and purification methods.
