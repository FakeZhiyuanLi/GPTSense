The second law of thermodynamics states that the system doing work always loses some energy as waste heat. This law states that in any energy conversion process, some energy will inevitably be degraded into a less useful form (such as heat) and cannot be recovered or reused. This is due to the fact that in every energy conversion, some energy is lost as waste heat because no process can be 100% efficient.
