Christian worship and prayer were heavily influenced by the religious followers of the Son of God, Jesus Christ. This devotion of time involves attending church services, engaging in personal and group prayer, reading and studying the Bible, and participating in spiritual disciplines such as fasting and giving to those in need. Christians believe that spending time in devotion to worship, prayer, and other spiritual disciplines allows them to grow closer to God and live a fulfilling and purposeful life.
