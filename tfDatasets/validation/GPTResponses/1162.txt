Liquidmetal Technologies uses a unique combination of metals, including zirconium, titanium, nickel, copper, and beryllium, to create its amorphous metal alloys. These metals are melted together and rapidly cooled to form a non-crystalline structure that has unique physical and mechanical properties.
