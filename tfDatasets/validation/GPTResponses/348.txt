During the early Triassic period, which occurred about 251 to 247 million years ago, the Earth experienced a hot and dry climate. Pangea, the supercontinent that existed at the time, caused the interior of the continents to be far away from the moderating influence of the ocean. This, combined with high levels of volcanic activity, resulted in a severe greenhouse effect, leading to high temperatures and arid conditions in much of the interior of Pangea. However, there were also some more temperate regions closer to the coasts and higher elevations, where forests and other vegetation could grow.
