The FBI feels that providing general descriptions of suspects or persons of interest helps to facilitate the public's help in identifying and locating the individual. This is because the public can often recognize and remember key details such as clothing, tattoos, or physical features that may assist in the investigation. By providing general descriptions, the FBI is able to connect with the public and work together to solve crimes and bring justice to those involved.
