Software that undergoes thorough testing and debugging, as well as has built-in error handling mechanisms and contingency plans, would have a better defect tolerance. Additionally, software that employs fault-tolerant design principles and uses redundant systems can also have good defect tolerance. Such software is often used in safety-critical systems, such as aviation or medical devices, to ensure that any defects or errors do not cause catastrophic consequences.
