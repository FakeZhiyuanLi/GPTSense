The race concept is widely used by people all over the world, but its origins can be traced back to European colonialism and imperialism. It was during this period that the idea of race was used to justify the subjugation and exploitation of non-European peoples. Today, race is still used in many cultures to categorize people based on physical characteristics such as skin color, hair texture, and facial features, but its validity as a scientifically accurate concept has been widely discredited. Instead, it is now understood that race is a social construct that is shaped by historical, cultural, and political contexts, rather than any biological or genetic factors.
