In most political parties, the party policy is made by the party leaders and senior members in consultation with the party's membership base. The party's policy-making process can involve various gatherings, including summits and meetings, where ideas and positions are presented and discussed. Ultimately, the party's elected officials or high-ranking officials vote on policy proposals and determine the organizationâ€™s policy platform.
