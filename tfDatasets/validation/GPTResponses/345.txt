The discussion about whether or not chocolate-covered biscuits should be included in the goods and services tax (GST) is an example of the difficulty of explaining what foods were and were not included in the tax. The argument centered around whether chocolate-covered biscuits fell under the category of 'chocolate' or 'biscuits', as chocolate was taxable under the GST while biscuits were not. This highlighted the challenges faced by food manufacturers and consumers in understanding which items were included in the tax and which were exempt.
