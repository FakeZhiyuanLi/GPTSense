The fusion process in stars releases another store of potential energy which was created at the time of the Big Bang. During nuclear fusion, light elements (such as hydrogen) are fused together to form heavier elements (such as helium), which releases a large amount of energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation. This process occurs in the core of stars and can continue until heavier elements such as iron are formed.
