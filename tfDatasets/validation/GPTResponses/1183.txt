The first great powers during the post-Napoleonic era were concentrated in Europe, particularly in the countries of Britain, France, Russia, Austria, and Prussia (which later became Germany). These countries emerged as the dominant powers in Europe due to their military and economic strength, territorial influence, and political stability. They played a significant role in shaping global affairs and setting the agenda for international relations in the 19th century.
