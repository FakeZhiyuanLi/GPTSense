The ascent of the Matterhorn marked a significant achievement in mountaineering history. It was one of the last great peaks in the Alps to be climbed and its steep faces and narrow ridges posed a significant challenge to even the most experienced climbers. The first successful climb of the Matterhorn, achieved by Edward Whymper and his team in 1865, marked a turning point for mountaineering as a sport and paved the way for future conquests of other great peaks around the world. However, the climb was also marred by tragedy, as four members of the team, including Whymper's guide, fell to their deaths during the descent. The ascent of the Matterhorn remains a symbol of human achievement and the risks that come with pushing the boundaries of what is possible.
