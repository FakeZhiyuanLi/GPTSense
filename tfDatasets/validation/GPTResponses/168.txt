Organozinc chemistry is the study of the chemical properties and reactions of organic compounds that contain a covalent bond between carbon and zinc atoms. It includes the synthesis, structure, and reactivity of organozinc compounds, as well as their potential applications in organic synthesis, catalysis, and material science. Organozinc compounds are important intermediates in many organic reactions, such as cross-coupling reactions, Grignard reactions, and carbonylation reactions. They are also used as reagents in organic synthesis and as precursors for the preparation of diverse functional materials.
