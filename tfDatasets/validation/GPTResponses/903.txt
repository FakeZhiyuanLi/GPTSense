Black-box testing is a method of software testing where the tester only assesses the functionality of the software without having any knowledge of its internal structure, design or implementation. This testing focuses on the input and output of the software system and is mostly done at the end of the development process.White-box testing, on the other hand, is a method of software testing where the tester analyzes the internal structure, design, or implementation of the software code in addition to focusing on its functionality. This testing is done by the developer or with the help of code analysis tools, and it aims to check the correctness and optimization of the code along with finding any potential bugs or errors.Therefore, the main difference between black-box testing and white-box testing lies in the access to information and the focus of the testing process. Black-box testing is based on the inputs and outputs of the system, while white-box testing analyzes the internal structure of the system to ensure its efficiency, accuracy, and optimize it as much as possible.
