The type of ballot used to elect the presiding officer and deputies of the parliament varies depending on the specific parliamentary rules and procedures in place. In some cases, a secret ballot may be used to ensure confidentiality and prevent intimidation or coercion. In other cases, a show of hands or electronic voting system may be used. Ultimately, the type of ballot used is determined by the parliamentary rules and procedures in place and may vary from country to country or even within different parliamentary bodies within the same country.
