Bottom-up testing helps facilitate the testing of individual units or components of a system or software application. It starts with testing the smaller or basic units, and then gradually moves up to testing higher-level functionalities that are made up of these units. This approach allows developers and testers to identify and fix problems early on in the development cycle, reducing the risk of defects in the final product. This type of testing can also help to ensure that each unit is functioning properly before being integrated with other units or components.
