During World War II, the northern part of East Prussia (now Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia) saw significant military action. The German Army launched Operation Hannibal in January 1945, in an attempt to evacuate civilians and refugees from the area before the approaching Soviet Army. However, the operation was chaotic and resulted in many casualties and deaths.In April 1945, the Soviet Army launched a major offensive against German forces in East Prussia. The Battle of Königsberg (now Kaliningrad) ensued, in which the city and surrounding areas were heavily bombarded and fought over. The Germans used the fortified Königsberg Castle as a base of resistance, but ultimately surrendered to the Soviet Army in early May 1945.After the war, East Prussia was partitioned between the Soviet Union and Poland. The northern part, including Königsberg, was annexed by the Soviet Union and renamed Kaliningrad Oblast, while the southern part became part of Poland. The remaining German population was largely expelled or fled, and the area was repopulated with Russians and other Soviet citizens.
