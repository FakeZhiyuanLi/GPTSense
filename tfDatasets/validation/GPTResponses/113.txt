The end of Wang Mang's regime was caused by multiple factors, including:1. Economic instability: Wang Mang's land reforms and redistribution policies had caused significant economic disruption, leading to inflation and food shortages.2. Natural disasters: A series of natural disasters, such as floods and earthquakes, also contributed to the economic instability and food shortages.3. Rebellions and uprisings: Various rebellions, including one led by the Red Eyebrows, began to challenge Wang Mang's rule and gained significant support.4. Military defeat: Wang Mang sent his armies to suppress the rebels, but they were ultimately defeated, weakening his regime's power.5. External pressures: The Han dynasty in the south began to rise in power again and posed a threat to Wang Mang's regime.All of these factors contributed to the eventual downfall of Wang Mang's regime in 23 AD, when an uprising in the capital city of Chang'an led to his overthrow and execution.
