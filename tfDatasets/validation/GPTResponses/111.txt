The tradition of regarding Virgil as a great magician started in the Middle Ages. During this time, stories and legends were created that portrayed Virgil as a wise and powerful magician who could perform miraculous feats, such as controlling the weather, speaking to animals, and summoning demons. These stories were likely inspired by Virgil's own writings, such as the Aeneid and the Eclogues, which contain elements of magic and the supernatural. Additionally, Virgil's reputation as a scholar and philosopher may have contributed to the association of his name with magic and wisdom.
