1. First Reading: A Bill is introduced in either the House of Commons or the House of Lords. This is referred to as the First Reading, and is usually a formality.2. Second Reading: The Bill is debated at length in the relevant House, as MPs or Lords discuss the general principles contained within it. If there is a vote, a simple majority is generally all that is required for the Bill to pass to the next stage.3. Committee Stage: Bills are then scrutinized in more detail by a Committee of MPs or Lords, depending on the House in which it originated. The Committee will review the Bill line by line, considering any amendments that are suggested.4. Report Stage: The House will then examine the Bill again, taking into account any changes made during Committee proceedings. A vote is taken on each amendment, and if the Bill is changed, it must go back to the House of Commons or the House of Lords, as appropriate.5. Third Reading: This is the final chance for a House to debate and vote on the Bill as a whole. This is also the last opportunity for any changes to be made.6. Other House: If the Bill originated in the Commons, it will pass to the House of Lords, where the same process will be repeated. If the Bill is approved by the Lords without amendment, it will go to the Queen for Royal Assent.7. Royal Assent: Once a Bill has been approved in both Houses of Parliament, it is sent to the Queen for Royal Assent. The Queen will then sign the Bill, giving it the force of law, and it becomes an Act of Parliament.
