i have just watch "harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban" to day, it is a nice show, funny and it's popular! a lot of people are watching there, number of fans of harry potter is still increasing the graphics are better than the first movie but darn! i missed the second one maybe i should get the dvd and watch it someday harry's wizardry had improved a lot, i can say. daniel radcliffe and gang are much older now, can see that they are much more matured so what can i say? must watch!
