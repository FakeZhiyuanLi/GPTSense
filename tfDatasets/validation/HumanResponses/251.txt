when i was 10 years old, i was wrapped up in so many things at one time. we had moved twice in less then a year. i remember one time, my mom and i went to the zoo. and we went into the ape house. i remember the ape's name: from "the jungle book", king loui. i just sat there watching him, till my eyes got really watery, i was looking like i was going to cry. then i i followed him outside onto the ropes that they climb on. and then we had to go home.
