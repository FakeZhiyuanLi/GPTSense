if any of you have seen the movie slackers then you know what i am talking about. i know you may be wondering why i am writing about this subject but my friend was doing some impressions of it so it just was something i thought i should write about. now remember when the weirdo kid sings "you have the key to my little locked room" that cracks me up just thinking about it. my friend bido can do that impression really good. also when he makes the hair doll out of a girls hair that he likes. " but it fell out of your hair that way" funny and gross at the same time. well if none of you have seen it then you need to rent it. it has some disgusting parts but if you get to the funny parts you'll start rolling on the floor.
