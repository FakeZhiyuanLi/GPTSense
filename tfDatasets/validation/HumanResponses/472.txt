ok im back now. i wanted to write more in my previous posts but i kept getting interrupted. we all know how that is. anyway, the job situation sucks because of the government and thier fearless leader, george w. bush. im i the only one in this great nation or this big world who thinks this guy is a true nutcase? i honestly think that this guy is a grade a moron. on a lighter note, i am over at my friends place and his dad is one of the lucky few who have a 2004 toyota prius. i have got to be one of the luckiest 17 year olds because i get to drive this amazing car. but it aint mine, so thats all i get. i hope to get a job here in the near future so i can get my xb. anyway, im getting tired so ill go before i fall asleep at the keyboard. peace. ~k-evil ps the second post had the worng time on it, disregard that.
