i'm having a great week in colorado. first we went to colorado springs and did fun stuff there, then went to an old mining town called leadville (it's the town of highest elevation in the u.s.). today we went to the first rounds of the drum and bugle corps championships. for those of you who don't know what that is, it's the kind of stuff they did in drumline. i get back sunday, see ya then.
