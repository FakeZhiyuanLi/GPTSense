i was too innocent or stupid not to know this earlier. trust is the most important thing to keep all of relationship among couples, friends, colleagues and family. i think " trusting somebody is your own firm belief about the person which doesn't change by others ." when you judge someone, you should be careful that you make your own decision base on your idea about the person not base on the other's words, because it's you to know the person better and even you don't know the other's will or intension if it's totally ture.
