ok, update-mitchell=savior the guy has been alot of help and he even let me stay over at his house. he and claire are all lovey dovey, and its cute new cartoon coming up, nothing incredible, but a nice premise now im bored, nothing to do but play videogames. i called hannah and she told me she'd call back in about an hour, (2 hours ago, roughly) so no real hopes there, ill probably not ge to talk to her till tommorrow. no big though, im trying to be as little less melodramatic, and alittle less clingy other than that meatloaf and im memorizing sweet tranzestite (the song) as i type! still a little erked, but cant change it, if hannah and mitchell couldnt fix that part then thats my job! adios mon cherie!
