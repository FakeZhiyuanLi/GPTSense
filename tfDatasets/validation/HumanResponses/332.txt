so i have a big fucking interview tomorrow for my new school. i am also scared of talking to people that i don't know, including girls. so that's going to put me in a bad spot. and i wonder what questions that they'll ask. it's probably something like: -why did you apply to iphs? -from your first view, what seperates iphs from any other school? -will you be using the csu pomona library often? any help if you can?
