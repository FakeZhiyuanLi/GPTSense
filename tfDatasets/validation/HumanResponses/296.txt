okay there is a nice gap here of about 19 days. pretty much everything that hapened here involved these steps (delete as applicable): 1) going to sheffield for my course 2) going to [lectures/the library/mairas] 3) going to [rollers/nmb/the albanian death-burger van/some other place] for [breakfast/lunch/dinner] 4) going to the [graudate/red lion/globe/brown bear/forum/haha/some other place] to meet [natassa/sofia/maira/sateesh/jay/miguel/xhrstos/somebody else]. 5) coming back to doncaster to work at the chace. just pick some or all of the above with a healthy mix of options nineteen times and that's it. exactly what probably happened.
