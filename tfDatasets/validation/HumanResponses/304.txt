"day by dayall the same" some people says a day passes very slow,while others say its extreamly fast.no matter what,we must make use of the time which everyday provides us. now back to realityso there is just 2 more days to my school stage play.actually its 1 more day including today,but i'm refering to the day i'm going. many incidents might happen in a day.in just 24 hours,it can be a last day of a men's life. the thing i'm going to share today has nothing to do with that.friend we make has various types of attitude,temper and personalities.sometimes,those behaviour might cause a little misunderstanding to each other which concludes a broken friendship! if you are a person with wisdom,you won't be easily fooled by such madness. so next time if anyone comes in such situation,remember.
