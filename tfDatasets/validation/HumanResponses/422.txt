so fantasia is our new american idol. it's nice to have someone two years in a row showing the world that nc isn't full of morons! however, i do have to admit that i wish diana would have won. i do like her sytle a bit better. my head still hurts, but at least i had a fun day today. i love my road days. i get to see tons of old friends. :) if i thought a couple years ago everything would work out this good, i would have switched jobs a loonnnnnnnnnnnngggg time ago! now it's time to hit the sack. i have a friend coming in from out of town to say the weekend with me so i need to get some sleep. and i also need to get up early to swing by target to pick up my copy of return of the king. shame on me! i didn't get it on the release day. what the hell is wrong with me? g'night :)
