as you both (or anyone else that may be randomly reading my blog, hi there random stranger :d)  anyways  as you both know i am going out of town  booo yaaaa biatch . for the next 3 weeks so i am going to try to blog as often as i can in case i'm not able to whilst i am away. so let's all look forward to some pointless blogs with little or no regard to entertainment value. good times. on a freaky note; there is a painting that has been following me around since yesterday. i see this painting everywhere i go. i think i am afraid, for real it could be deja vu  but i don't think so i've seen this same painting in the office, in the tanning salon, on the tv at the gym  it keeps popping up  and it's not even like a famous painting, it's a palm tree. i just want it to go away, but since i am facing it from where i am sitting now it will stare me down for the next 6 hours. *shudder* i hope it shant haunt you all as well.
