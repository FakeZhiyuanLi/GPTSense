hey there! this is my first press release. i would have had one up sooner, but business has had me out straight. yes the rumors are true about me heading into pop music. i've allways had an interest in pop and dance music over the years. so it's about time i finally head down that road for real. i have the most fun in that genre out of any other i find. i'm still working on the finishing touches with the release of 'off the deep end'. i can't wait until it's out because i've been working on it far too long. it'll be nice to start composing happier, more upbeat songs than i have been. it will be a change, but it will be a nice needed change. i have to get back to work, but stay tuned. i'm releasing a new single very soon! -rk
