well, if i'm going to lose weight, i have to diet. i'm starting today. on monday, i'll start with weight watchers. i found my ww info. the meetings are on tuesday, a swim day, so i probably won't be going to them. and at night, if i go to a meeting i should go to oa . it's so hard to get out at night with the kids so little. our evenings are very rushed, and i want to spend time with my kids. that's one of the reasons i had kids.
