when i was 6, i was in love with my father. i would always walk down to the corner of isabelle lane, and my street, it was a cul-de-sac. and i would sit there with my blankey, and wait for my dad to come home from work. and when i saw him in his car, my eyes would widen so wide they would look like they were going to pop. and he would always bring my brother and i candy home, every day. and he would bring my mom home something special. like flowers, or a bottle of wine. and one day, he didn't come back.
