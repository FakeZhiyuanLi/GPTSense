"it's fucked up how a man's life can be attacked" - mike skinner, the streets i have a problem. i vowed to myself and told everyone else that i wouldn't get "her" back in any picture anymore. it's been working since summer school session two started. but now this! i had a dream last night like most people did here on earth. i don't remember what my dream was but it was a regular dream about hanging out with girls. "she" was in it! and we hung out and fell in love. i really need to find myself an ideal girlfriend now. what a loser, eh?
