thanks to kery, i am going to invest in one of those flash memory thingies.i have been looking around for them and was glad for the information. i discovered that i do have a port on the front of my computer - everybody jump and clap! i don't suppose i can insert a sound clip here? this new technology should really be a big help this upcoming semester when i plan to take more classes than i have before. anything that will make that easier for me and reduces the stress i feel.
