so, i've been prepping for something like three weeks. the big day is thursday. i think i'm ready, but there are some huge butterflys in my stomach (something from the pleistocene era). what's thursday, you ask (come on, i know you're asking and if not, wake up!)? not a game, not a race. no, nothing so mundane. it's a job interview (argh) i've been reading so much background information on the company, industry segmen. etc. i think i'm going into overload. blogs are great, but they can take alot of time. kind of like when the internet first took off. you find yuourself travelling down tangents, discovering new blogs, reading, clicking, "oh my god i've been doing this for 23 straight hours." anyway, i'll let you know how things go. i'm withholding any more details until i actually go through it, so i'll let you know.
