this has been a long week for me. this was the first full week back to work. i have been sick. i feel a whole lot better. god has been so good to me. i am alive and have my health and strength. my weekend was a strain at times. satan has a way of trying to steal your joy. well, he tried but failed tremedously. he even try to break up my spirit before church this morning. started praying and praising god. he had to go because god was in that place. i preached this morning on romans 12:4 through the 15th. how there needs to be unity in the body of christ and that we all had to work together. the father, son, and holy spirit was present in that place, that people had to give him the glory! i praise god for the ministry that my husband and i have downtown in los angeles. we pastor at the harbor light. hallelujah! god is so great! so if you are ever in the area, stop on down at the harbor light. 809 east fifth street. blessings!
