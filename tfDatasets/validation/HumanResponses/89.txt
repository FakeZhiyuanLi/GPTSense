monday, man do i hate mondays and work. at least my boss wasn't here today and i was free to actually get stuff done without her f**kin' face bothering me. i wish there was someway to get deported back to wheve ever in the hell she was from. oh well. besides that, the day was excellent and her was near me most of the day, that was the best thing about the day. her perfume is still on my clothes.very nice
