next year's school schedule sucks. and everyone knows it. the solution: stop thinking up of fucking ideas on how to stick to government policy and just follow the other schools that use 6 periods. here's the schedule: monday/tuesday: p1-p6 wednesday: p1, p3, p5 thursday: p2, p4, p6 friday: start at 0815 and not 0750 p1-p6 it's a crock of shit. why not just let me put napalm in the office and light a match?
