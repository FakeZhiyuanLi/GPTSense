one of my unconscious pastimes, i discovered, is trolling the web for curious stuff. from interesting, unique, and useful websites and services to gears, deals, and apps. i would sit in front of my pc, fire up my browsers and search for random stuff via any search engine i happen to be on. after doing this for nearly 10 years now, i felt it would be nice to share my discoveries with everyone who cares to check out the cool stuff i happen to stumble upon. well, this is the venue for that. welcome to nowdstuff!
