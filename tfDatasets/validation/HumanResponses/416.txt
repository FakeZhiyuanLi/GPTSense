having read some other blogs, i feel safe in the knowledge that no matter how boring i make this, i'll still be in good company. i've already seen what basically, after 1 month of reasonable blogging, amounts to a "breakfast blog" i.e. "today i had *2* slices of toast and some honey, it was nice". clearly in the top trumps world of blogging, a log of arousal beats breakfast hands down. i have been tempted to use the "p.s. i am w**king as i write this" signature in tribute of the wonderful tmwrnj, but i don't think anyone would get it.
