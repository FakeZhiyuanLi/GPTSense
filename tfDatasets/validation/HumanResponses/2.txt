when i first moved here, people told me that san francisco weather is awesome and therefore the raised home prices and the taxes and what not, and i used that to justify the fact that i could never buy a home anywhere respectably close to anywhere id want to be. but tell me. what good does 40 degree weather do for me in july i had some friends visiting, and the whole damn city was an ice belt in fucking july. thats not great weather. its shitty weather, and to make it even better, its hard to see three feet in front of the car when you're driving on the golden gate. cant walk outside, cant stand outside, cant put my top down. fuck that, they should pay me to live there.
