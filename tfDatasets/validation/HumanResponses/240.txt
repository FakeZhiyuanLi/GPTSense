i find it interesting that life after highschool should be like flipmode. i have all but lost contact with my former best friend of ten years, made an old nemesis a best friend, rebuilt friendships, and bridges for that matter, with old enemies, and dumped all who i held close. i also love my work *sales associate at wal mart= cashier* which is something i never thought i'd say. things are going well for me, and can only get better. tomorrow i am buying a webcam which i will use to send my alex bear pics of me while he is in costa rica, then i'm going to work on a digi cam so that i can easily make albums of my next few vacations/adventures. mike out
