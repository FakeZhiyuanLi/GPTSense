i woke up this morning to wish my best friend victor a save trip to france. afterwards i got a chance to spend some time with gloria. i called her up and ask her if she could pick me up. we then went to the dollar movies to go see butter fly effect. i would have droved to her house but my car is at the doctorâ€™s office getting surgery. hopefully she'll be ready sometime this week. doc said she would make a full recovery.
