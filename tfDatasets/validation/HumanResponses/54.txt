it sucks. day 3, and i'm already scrapping it. for the past 3 days, i have had a headache, been tired, and been obsessed with food. i learned some great lessons from it about watching what i eat and limiting bad carbs, but my body told me that something was wrong. so, now i'm enjoying a smoothie and getting some energy. yaay! the good thing is, now i'm motivated to work out more. kinda hard to work out when you have zero energy. lots more to say, but no time right now to say it. until later. stay away from any diet that prohibits fruit!
