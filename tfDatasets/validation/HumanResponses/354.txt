well, i'm back from iom now. came back on thursday but have been ill all weekend. i've got a job for just one week at a posh architects firm, very nicely paid! the building is a converted barn they, of course, architected themselves and its really nice to work in, although (here comes the ot in me!) it is a wheelchair nightmare! i don't suppose i'll ever stop thinking like that now, its ingrained into me! i've got a few photos from iom, will post them when i get chance to load them onto my computer! oh and by the way, check out the links section on the right. i'm really pleased with myself, never used html before but managed to do it - i'm dead proud of myself!
