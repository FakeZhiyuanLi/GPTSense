thane centre. took my batches like always. returned in 2 and half hours, took a seminar on it careers. god i'm good ! sometimes you feel so lone that life seems like it is meaningless, my friends at thane centre were more than happy to see me just as much as i was to see them. these are good people. my dearest kid was there too. i hope she picked up a lesson on saying no when needed. if i could change the world i would wish a lot of people like the ones i know well. i could get them the world. i think i am too tied up at times. i am such a loser i think. my life is lone. i lost all i could have procured, 1) education 2) time 3) the women i like (never thought i was fit enough for them anyway.) i hate to be called a winner, each time i am called one i realize how much i've lost. maybe it is my ego, my depression, i try hard to make people laugh but then how much can i fool myself. i am the fool who plays the fool. i dont have to pretend.
