my moms finding another cruise to book, woohoo! yeah pretty damn exciting, it's going to be fucking awesome cuz i can bring a friend. hopefully were going on this seven day that goes to montego bay, cozumel, and grand cayman. that one's on a huge ship called the carnival conquest. yeah that was pretty much the highlight of my day. other than that it's been pretty dull. i think i'm gonna call laura later i miss her.
