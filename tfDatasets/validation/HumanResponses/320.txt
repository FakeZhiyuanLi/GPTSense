still no power. ugh getting really tired of it. thank goodness mom and dad got theirs back so we stayed there last night. haven't really been feeling all that hot. been real sick to my stomach again the past couple of days. payton's staying at a friends house tonight (tanya) and i guess it's another night at the parents for dh and i.
