i dunno, it may just be me, but i find having a cup of tea solves almost every problem. for a bit at least. its just simple, the worlds ending! what shall we do while we wait? i know lets put the kettle on for some tea (never coffee). its just one of those things. ive found cups of tea very handy, although painful when actually handling the very hot cups. its just something you can relie on, a good old british cup of tea (although it is actually chinese). sorry people, that iz if anyone does actually comes here, but i find it a lot better typing all this stuff out. it calms the soul, just like a cup of tea. ah-ha! a cunning plan is a foot, type while having a cup of tea. its so cunning you could put a tail on it and call it a fox.
