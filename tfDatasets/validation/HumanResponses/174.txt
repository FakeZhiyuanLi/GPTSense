well, here we are, it is fathers day. a little depressing for me, but, the nice thing is that liz gave me a little cash to take gary out to dinner for celebrating both father's and mother's day. tomorrow i am beginning wwatchers again. i think i have plenty of wise choices on hand, and i hope to get our pool passes tomorrow during lunch. i have also started de-cluttering the house. i decided that just because dh doesn't care about living in a pig stye, does not mean that i have to. i will de-clutter and clean my half of the rooms as i do them. lets see if that gets him moving.
