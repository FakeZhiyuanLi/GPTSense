this week is the beginning of my soccer team's pre-season. it wasn't as bad, as last year, and i was more in shape this year. the running was actually pretty easy, come to think of it. i haven't touched a soccer ball all summer though. band camp was ok last week. i slept over at andrew's house friday night and we burned all of our school stuff in a large bonfire. then we stayed up until 2, playing halo. saturday morning my dad picked me up, then we rode our bikes back past andrew's house, to the hortensius' house, which is somewhar in maryland. it wasn't that difficult, but my dad went so far ahead that i didn't know where to turn.
