well, yesterday was a bust as far as the points go. i didn't even keep track of them, and i am sure i was a little over. however, i did not snack at all. went to the pool with liz after work and actually mananged to do 6 laps. not one right after the other mind you, but, i did 6. :) i will stick with the 6 laps for now, and try to decrease the amount of time between them. once i have done that i will add two more laps.
