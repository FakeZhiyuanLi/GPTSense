my summer is going great. normaly if i was doing what i have been doing i would have been bored out of my mind. this year is different for some reason. all i seem to want to do is veg. tonight i went to see avp it was great. the worst thing is i thought i saw my loves car out in the parking lot. i was worried out of my mind about what i would do if i saw her. i would have probably ran for some reason. in the movie "the village" one of the leads was affraid to do what he wanted most. i feel like him, i am too affraid to approch her but it pains me that i won't. well i better get back to vegging, goodnight.
