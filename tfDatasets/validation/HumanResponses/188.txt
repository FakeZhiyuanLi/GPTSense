hey. i'm in a great mood today. i think i am finally over my love. i still want to be with her but i'm not so utterly depressed anymore. last night i had a dream that i could remember which is quite a feet for me. it was about an older me on a realy realy fast train with a very attractive blonde sitting next to me very scared. she eventualy falls asleep on me and that's when i wake up. i'm not so sure why i'm writing my dreams down now but like i said dreams that i can remember don't happen very often. i also start going back into school today. i'm meeting with a few teachers and my councelor. i have been veging almost all summer and i am ready to get back to school. well i beter get going i don't have much time before i have to leave. well bye for now.
