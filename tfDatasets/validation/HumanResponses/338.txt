i just finished watching collateral. watching movies on the computer don't make them scary. hehe. all this light shining into my room, you get the picture. anyways that ts pissed me off. the recording guy or whatever happened to it made the movie replay the last few hundred seconds of audio. so they were in the car and you here the techno music from the club. shitty! overall, the movie was teh hipx0rz. but not the best i say, bourne supremacy was better. in my life: my parents keep talking about maths so i told them to think about that again in four weeks. now is too early. i need to concentrate on school once it starts. i don't want 4 as and 2 ds again. heh. oddest grades ever. i still need a girlfriend for the new school year. i already hate wchs, and don't make it any worse.
