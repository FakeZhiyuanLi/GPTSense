i have recently discovered the coolness that is multiplayer gaming. in my particular case, it was in the form of final fantasy:crystal chronicles for the gamecube. before this, i had always considered gaming to be, for me anyways, a solo past time. i wasn't into online gaming at all, and i tend to play games i like obsessively, so no one wanted to challenge me. but ff:cc has changed my anti-social ways! i am ready to play with others! i might even try worlds of warcraft when it comes out! (i hope i'm not getting in over my head.)
