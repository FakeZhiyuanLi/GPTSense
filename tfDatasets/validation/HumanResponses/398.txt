i'm staying at my cousin kai's house in milford. he goes to eagles nest church, which is hosting lamb jam, so he got me to volunteer to help out there this weekend. i guess it's fun, we get in for free and can listen to the music while we're parking cars. i got to work the high security gate and let all the band members in, that was fun. at 8, we got to usher for plum (ok) and superchi(k) (they were good i guess). we got home around 11:30, dead tired.
