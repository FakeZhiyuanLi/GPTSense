i recently bought 2 movies. ronin and lock, stock, and two smoking barrels. both are great movies and if you haven't either of them, i highly recommend them. ronin has robert de niro in it. so you'll know it's good. i also have a newly found respect for rocapella, and have been listening to them a lot lately.
