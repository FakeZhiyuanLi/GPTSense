ok so boys are a major part of my life so i am going to be posting many blogs about them! first if there are guys out there reading this then i want to say that girls (in general) don't like to make the first move and surely hate to not know how a guys feels! i am actually turned on when a guy is able to express himself to me. second i want to tell of something that has happened to me in the past. i hate it when guys are not able to act themselves if there is something between us. how immature is that.really. then if a guy has a grudge against a girl i can't stand it how they center their lives around it and try to get back at them by getting on other girls and stuff. once again that just proves they are immature and obviously don't know what they are doing. so guys learn to make the first move on a girl and get over the akwardness between girls and boys
