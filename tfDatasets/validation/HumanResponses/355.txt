well folks, it was my last exam today (which went pretty well) and now i'm finally free! no more uni! its a bit strange to think that's my 3 years gone, but i must say i am feeling the lack of weight on my shoulders already! well, i'm off to the isle of man tomorrow for the tt races, staying with friends, so i'll update this, complete with photos from iom when i get back, so watch out for those! well, i'll be back in 2 weeks! ta-ta
