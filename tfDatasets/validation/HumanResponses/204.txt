i'm waiting here for lindsay to come up in visit me for the week. i haven't seen her in a couple weeks ever since i've started my job up here and she stayed back in cincinnati. it will be fun to have her around for the week since i've missed her so much and she makes me very happy when we are together. well i guess i should say she makes me happy all the time, even when we are not together. my parents are coming up at the end of the week to help me set up my new house. my dad and i are going to put new shingles on my roof and my mom, with the help of lindsay are going to work in the house and doing some landscaping. it is going to be a hard 4 days of work that is for sure. my house is going to look a lot different when we are all done.
