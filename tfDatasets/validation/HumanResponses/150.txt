2day really a big struggling day. cos of something i done wrong i get scolded by a sister in christ. after i get scolded, i tel myself "its was my wrong to play so don like tat, smile!" but i still can't get through the struggle. after a few mins, my mind became very confused and my heart was very empty. who knos the more i struggle, the more confused in my mind. i felt like being a mad person, but i tel myself not to give up. if i give up, the evil will win the battle. when these kind of things happen, i will need a quiet place or enviroment to hav a clear mind so tat i can fight the battle. ppl who donno me well, might think tat i'm a mad person or wat. all these things has blocked me from serving god, doin things properly and its oso make me cannot concentrate on thinking things. i wish i could find a cure for tis kind of strange illness.
