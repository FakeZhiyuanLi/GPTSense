its so great when the person who is probly the worst at keeping secrets gets mad at you for telling something that they didnt even tell you not to tell.well they did at one point.but then they were the one who hinted to the person that they cheated at camp.even tho camp doesnt countbut they were the one who told the person about the other person so when the person asks bout the other person.dont they deserve to kno.and its not like the cheater and person are even gonig out anymore or even like eachothr anymoreand besides.its not like my best friend knows how to keep secrets
