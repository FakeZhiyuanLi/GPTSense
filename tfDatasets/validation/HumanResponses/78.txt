today is tyhe first day of the birankai summer camp here at san francisco state university. i rode my motorcycle here, which wasn't all that bad. in fact i enjoyed it! anyway i didn't train the first calss today. i was a little burned out from the drive and i was ready to just lay down. well not much more to write.
