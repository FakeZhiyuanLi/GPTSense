today is the eve of the last day of school. what an exhausting week this has been. the kids are so ready for summer, but then again so am i. i had a good year with some really good kids in my fifth grade class. the last day of school is always a little emotional. the kids, even though they are ready for summer, they still give you that look as they leave, "i wish i could be in your class again. " i try to keep a strait face, but sometime it is difficult. it is the eve of the last day of school, what a wonderful time of the year for teachers.
