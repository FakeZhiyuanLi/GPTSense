i just finish practicing the 2nd movement of the bach double. i woke up around 9:00 p.m. and i’ve been practicing since. my schedule is so messed up right now. i feel re-energized though after my short nap. hopefully i won’t stay up to long like i did last night. i just got of the phone with gloria. she just got out of work and she wants me to accompany her to whataburger. until next time.
