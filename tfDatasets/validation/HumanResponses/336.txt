so i've been working (unpaid, unknown) on wikipedia stuff. i've been adding many things and fixing some others. wikipedia is by-far the best encyclopaedia ever. since it's open source, everyone can add to it useful information. spamming has never been an issue there, but you know i'm hot. [just kidding] want to see what i've done? it's on the right. i don't even have a user name yet, i will transfer my information later.
