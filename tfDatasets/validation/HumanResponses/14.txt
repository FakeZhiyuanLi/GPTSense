i use spread sheets at work to manipulate information. we don't have much of a need for formulas to that part has been a good review for me. i tried for weeks to get the office manager (i use that term very loosely)to put a particular log in abc order. we enter information in a log and it's given a reference number. well, you can imagine what that log looked like with over 700 employees. the problem came when we had to look up a reference number. no one had access to the computer file to search for it that way. we were supposed to look through this endless report (with a very small font). made me want to pull my hair out. well, that "office manager" departed and the new one did finally make that change and life is good now.
