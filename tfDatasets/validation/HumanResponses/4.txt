my name is lara. whoever you are, whether family, friends or strangers i bid you hello. what this blog is to me is a space to run away and free myself. to gather my thoughts, to create, unwind and run my fingers through my brain. if you wish to look, be my guest. not everything here will make sense to you and some may find it offensive or self-indulgent at times. welcome and step into my shadow of the moon.
