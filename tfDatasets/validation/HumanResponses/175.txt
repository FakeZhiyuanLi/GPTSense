hopefully this will be a restfull weekend. so far, so good. found out today that michael made all-stars, so, he and gary will have practice everyday this week. this will actually make it a little easier for me to regulate food etc. on the food issue. wwatchers will start on monday, and i will be off to the store in a little bit to stock up on some things. although, i must say, that is the beauty of wwatchers, nothing is out of bounds as long as it fits into the points range. i will however be limiting refined carbs, so, i will need to be sure to get plenty of whole grain bread options for lunches etc. i will be posting my previous days food log each morning. i am hoping that this will help a little with the accountablility.
