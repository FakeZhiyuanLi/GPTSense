i feel as though i'm going insane. why would god have created love when all i can see it doing is causing pain. i hate to see her in pain. she says every guy she has ever trusted has hurt her. i know i have and i don't know if i will ever be able to forgive myself. i am not worthy of her. now she likes another guy. if he will make her happy i suport him completely. but i keep on thinking that there is no way that he will love her as much as i do. i know that i am suposed to get over her, i wish i could. i am completely broke. i have no money to spend on anything. even if i thought that i would stand a chance with her i couldn't have done it due to lack of funds. i still dream about her, but it's not like what you think. i dream about her saying that she loves me, or just us holding hands, even our wedding. i know that none of these dreams will come true. i wish with all my might that they would but i know they won't. bye for now.
