your eyes which first held me captivated where i stood. your smile to dazzle the sun and warm every corner of my soul. your voice like a sparkling mountain stream which flows into my heart. your walk and the way your gracefulness takes my breath away. your hair about which i dreamed cascading into my face as you leaned over me. your hands whose caress i crave to hold my face in their tenderness. your arms i long to have around my neck as you pull me close to your warmth. most of all everything you are changed the way i feel about my life. i love you.
