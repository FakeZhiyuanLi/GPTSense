the day is finally coming!the day everyone waited throughout the whole year it is my school's most proudest event of the year.the school stage play. this event had brought to me many unforgetable memories the past few years(nothing to do withthe show). anywaylife is like a journey.no matter how hard the journey is,we must still go on hope everyone who are going to the 'drama' enjoys it
