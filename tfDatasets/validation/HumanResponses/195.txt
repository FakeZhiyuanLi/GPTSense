thanks brother julius for your comment. i feel pretty good today. i am up and about. yesterday i had preached, "what on earth are you doing here?" it was from romans 12:1-9. it was pretty good, god was in the house! i have people praying for me, for my husband and i in st. louis. it so great to know that people are standing in the gap with you. my mom has been a great support to me. i love her with all my heart, because she is so strong. we are more closer than we ever been. i am so glad. i can't wait til they come in august. i am so so so so so so so so so so excited! can't you tell! like i said in my past blog, the doctor said my blood tests are fine. i am very healthy. wow! praise god! the doctor will be working with us to figure out what exactly is going on. i know that god is in control! amen!
