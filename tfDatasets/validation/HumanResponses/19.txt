drama is a great thing, especially improv. it opens your mind, and you make connections more quickly. acting is one of the greatest arts in the world. i hope i have convinced someone to try out drama one day. actually, you may not enjoy drama if you don't have a certain personality type. you kind of need to be fairly outgoing, so many people dislike acting for this reason. ahem. allow me to be going now.
