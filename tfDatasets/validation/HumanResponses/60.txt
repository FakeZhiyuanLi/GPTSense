i found this cool website with lots of free stuff for websites. it is gifs animations clipart software hosting. it includes java scripts which i'm implimenting in my website. i started yesterday adding java script to the photograph pages. when you click on a photograph to view the larger size, on the pages with the java script, a pop-up will give the larger picture. with this design, you won't leave the photograph page which will be convienent to those with dial-up, and also will help control bandwith on my server. it will take awhile because i plan to convert all of my photographs to that format. i'm starting in order on the list on the main page. i won't keep updates as to when i finish java scripts on each page because its not new information. its just something behind the scenes that makes navigation in my website more simpler.
