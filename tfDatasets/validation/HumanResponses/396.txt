lamb jam wasn't as good saturday as it was sunday, except for chris rice. i really didn't have to do as much saturday, i'm not sure if that was a good thing. i saw some people from church there, and some people from smyrna. it was a great festival i guess, just the music wasn't really what i like on saturday. my uncle bob and my cousin (his daughter) nicolette went to a grateful dead concert, which is kind of the opposite of lamb jam. they got to our house around 3 this morning (from the tweeter center).
