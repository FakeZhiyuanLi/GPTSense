lately i’ve been feeling somewhat lazy. i’m supposed to be practicing at least 6 hours on my violin and prepare for my vso audition. i’m beginning to have doubts of the audition. if i don’t start to practice , i’ll never be ready. hopefully dr. dawson will be able to give me an extra lesson tomorrow.
