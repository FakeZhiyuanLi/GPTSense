well after that amazingly grueling day i could really use a hug. come to think of it, i bet if all those cranky arseholes that called me today had had a hug or two before they decided to 'grace me with their presence' (yeah right!) maybe they wouldn't have been such eegits! you know, i once read that to be a truly happy person you need to have 12 hugs a day.12! how many of us get even half that much, honestly? no wonder we're a miserable bunch of gits eh? maybe doctors should stop prescribing prozac and start prescribing hugs. maybe the nhs could save some funds if they had a staff of 'hug volunteers' in fact, i think we could start a medical revolution. or maybe i'm just dreaming, but while i'm fantasizing i think i'll be imagining this particularly charming and handsome spanish guy i work with filling my hug prescription on particularly bad days now there's some medicine that won't require a spoonful of sugar to help it go down ;-)
