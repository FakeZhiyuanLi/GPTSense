well, the name fits! i am googled to death! i am finding this assignment challenging. i apparently am "tech challenged". i said in the first class that i have crashed some computers and while that was in jest, i do seem to have a knack for getting the screens to do wild and crazy things. yesterday, i got my project's font to grow like jack's beanstalk. i havent' been able to get into my project at home and wouldn't you know it, i'm having another bad hair day!
