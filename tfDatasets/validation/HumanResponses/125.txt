well he got his money mailed about a month from when he saw me. i just hope the lady who talked to me on the phone will stick to allowing me to pay the $25.00 per month. i just have a hard time trusting doctors offices as i was lied to three years ago and i ended up getting a collection agency after me. i also left a note with my payment telling them that my indigent application is still being processed and i will mail them a copy of my cicp card once i get one (if i do). i think though they will be willing to work with me, but we will see.
