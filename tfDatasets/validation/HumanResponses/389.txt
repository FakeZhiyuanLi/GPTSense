well i think we have a pretty mean girl in our schoolone of my friends moved away to another school and was going out with a guy from our school. they broke up and then this pass around hoe carissa had to come and think she was all that and go after him. the only real reason why they are going out is because they know that they can both get the $ex that they have always wanted. she is always talking too about how she can't wait for the summer to have $ex. know how mean is that to do that to the friend millie(nickname) who was just trying to get over the stupid bastard jimmy? i mean she still liked him too.but now that is over with and their going out (carissa and jimmy) millie decided that's it for both of them and won't probably like them ever again.or maybe.so it was chaotic!
