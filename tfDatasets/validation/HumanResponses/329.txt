this is not the funniest movie that i've seen. why does everyone think it's so funny? anyways, napoleon should have known some tae kwon do and kicked some ass. but he didn't. he did get the girl that was not half-as-bad though. so that was a good start for him. mwahaha. now, on to other movies. i have to download collateral so, later.
