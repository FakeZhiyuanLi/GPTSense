yep. sitting here on a friday night, slightly perturbed. fuming actually. i've made up my mind. they can have their buck an hour back (and the massive amount of grief that goes with it) and i'm cutting my hours and going back to day shift. we'll see how they like it without their crutch. either way, i win.
