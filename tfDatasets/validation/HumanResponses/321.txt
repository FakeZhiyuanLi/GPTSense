well the storm has passed but the devastation it left behind is everywhere. huge oaks the size of houses are toppled over like toys. we are still without power. that storm was nothing like i have ever seen before. it was beautiful and scary at the same time. on a more positive note the pregnancy is going along just fine. i have an appt. on fri with dr. dereaux. she is the doc that did my d&c after the miscarriage. i'm not as nervous as i was in the beginning. still have to take meds or m/s hits. i have already gained a couple of pounds due to all the carbs i've been eating. hope doc doesn't get on to me about that. bill and payton took water and supplies to robert and family (bil). the are an hour away in winter haven. they lost all their shingles off the roof and there neighborhood was hit pretty hard. i guess they can't find water or ice anywhere. we had some gallons left over so they drove them over.
