i am probably the only swimmer who is slower when flipping than when not flipping. i tried to flip at every turn. i've improved in that i am no longer afraid to turn. but for most of the turns today, i turned all the way and stood up. i then realized that if i twist a bit, so that i come out of the turn on my side, i'm much more comfortable pushing off the wall than when i'm on my back. once i made that change, i was doing better. it would help if i could get close enough to actually touch the wall on every turn, but i am making progress. duration: 30 minutes distance: 1000 yards workout: 200 free/warm up, 300 free, 400 kick (50 dolphin, 50 back, 100 free)x2, 100 free weight: 212 pounds
