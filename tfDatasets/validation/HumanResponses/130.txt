from friends to lovers ] by joe vieira sometimes i feel sad and sometimes i feel blue but whenever i see you, i'm as happy as can be for you bring a smile upon my face and a feeling of joy within my heart you're like my sunshine in the morning and my stars that glow at night you're like the waves in the ocean the cool breeze in the wind like the call of the birds in the morning dew like the sounds of beauty in the night you see all of these things are of beauty and love that's how i feel whenever you are near for it was the passion and desire from both of us that opened up the world for our eyes to see for our love of each other will grow and grow and our needs and desires will be more everyday for a friend you once were and will always be has turned into love as it should have been so i want you to know as a friend and lover that in my heart and arms you'll always stay for our love for each other will never fade.
