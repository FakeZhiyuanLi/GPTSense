.and i'm still tired. i had a really weird dream last night that i was at a football game in cleveland and was sitting in the stands with drew carey. we were cuddling and kissing and stuff, even though his girlfriend was sitting right next to him. weird, eh? and then i felt really bad because he cheated on his girlfriend and kate, since he was cheating on his girlfriend with her too. but i digress. today should be fairly boring, since my mom will be at work until 3:30pm and it's currently 11:34am. i'm kinda glad summer is almost over, it's getting pretty drawn-out and boring. i'm hungry againi think i'll go heat up a frozen pizza. mmmm, pizza. anyways i'm gonna go now, not really a whole lot to say since, like i said, i just woke up.
