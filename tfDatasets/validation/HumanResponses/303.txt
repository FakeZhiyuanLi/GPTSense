"be qaulified before justifying" have a confident mind and enough proove before doing,taking action or justifying ourselves. it is quite a bad day today in school today.but on the other side,i'm quite happy of it! its like a self achivement since last year.the story is simple,an uncompatible teacher was acusing me that i did not do a work.however,i prooved myself right and she was ashamed by her owan foolish actions and meaningless talks.thus her shamefullness by misusing her power.at last,thanks to my friends i never did something stupid. 1 more day to smi's school drama.there will be a show today.too bad i'm not attending it. actually i am saving it for tomorrow
