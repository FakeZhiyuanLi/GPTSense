school is once again in full swing and im not liking it one bit. but this is my last year of high school so i really cant complain too much about that. anyway, im back in school and still have nothing to do. my job search isnt doing much better. i wanna get my xb but with my job situation the way it is, its not gonna happen. it would be nice if this place i applied to called me back and said hey you got the job. that would be so nice. anyway im gonna go for now so ill post something again when i get around to it. peace
