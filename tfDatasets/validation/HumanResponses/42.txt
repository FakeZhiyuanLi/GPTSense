it is that time of year again, where all can pretend, to be who we desire, not who we are, as mystery fills the air, everyone's let down their hair, some go for scare, looking like a nightmare, others just weren't sure what to wear, and did little to prepare, they surely aren't millionaires, but no matter the outer wear, their lives are still in despair, as the day ends and the return to solitaire. the end.
