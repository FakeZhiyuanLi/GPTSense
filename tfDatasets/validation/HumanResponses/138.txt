so my other writtings talk about this alwsome girl. we'll i really like her and i won't to take our realtionship to the next level. right now we are like just talking. but i would like to ask her out. but right now she is confused. i really don't understand why thou. i know about this guy that like's her, but she's told me that there just friend's and she wouldn't date him. so i don't think thats that she is confused about, unless she does like him, but i trust her. i just don't understand. i keep praying that god will just be there and help me and guid me in all i do. i just don't won't to pressure her and lose her like i have in last realtionships. she is just so awsome, and i don't won't to lose her. she is like every thing i have ever wonted.
