last night gloria and i went to go the the day after tomorrow. i thought the movie was fun and exciting. they really did a nice job on the special effects. it was also pretty funny. there was a scene where mexico closes the border because to many illegal immigrants (u.s.) are crossing. anyway, tomorrow is my big audition and i plan to take advantage of the time to practice. i probably wont post any blog's till wednesday. wish me luck!
