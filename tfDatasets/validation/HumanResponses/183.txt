timeless moon weeps. tears of saline for the should have known. how could it sit up there full, round, and bright. not to have seen? not to have felt, the uneasiness. or did it just ignore the signs? judas moon, will your color be red on the 'morrow? has the last soul been used? will the emptiness bring about my demise? i beg the answers. it is i that needs a new soul. it is i that weeps for the unknown. it is i that ignores. it is i that will stand rigid as the blood of a moon drips down upon my head.
