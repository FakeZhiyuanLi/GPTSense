they say that honesty is the best policy. but is it necessarily the best thing if everyone ends up getting hurt? i mean, im just tryin to do the right thing for everyone, but i just dont think its possible. its such a fucked up situation and im just tryin to deal with it the best that i can. im sorry to anyone whos gotten hurt by all this.i swear, it was never my intention.
