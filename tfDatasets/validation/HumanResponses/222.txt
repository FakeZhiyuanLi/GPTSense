you aren't born a writer. never attend any courses on writing. you hated school. bad vocabulary. lousy grammar. no professional training in singing and dancing. but you yearns to be a writer? keep on dreaming! dreaming? heck no! this is a start. i'm telling the world i'm not dreaming. i will start writing. i am writing. and as such i am a writer. not sure for how long, but this is a start. not as good start as many, but still a start. maybe my writing sucks, but who cares. i know i'm illiterate, but i'm not stupid either. who knows i might improve my writing in time don't believe? it's a long walk and plenty of time for that. cheers!
