and here's why: more often than not, a cd is cheaper or at most only £1 more expensive. how come? why are on-line purchases so expensive, material costs are virtually zero? as an example, thin lizzy - live & dangerous - £9.95 on napster, £7.99 for the cd at amazon.co.uk. you can pretty much play a cd on any damn cd player you choose, you can't do the same for your drm protected download. the quality of music from a cd is better because the downloaded music is compressed using a lossy algorithm. you can - usually - rip your cd to mp3, wma, ogg or whatever you fancy and again play the non-drm'd rip wherever you please. after my experience with napster, (i was unable to restore music i had purchased because it was no longer available on their catalogue) i shall never ever again purchase downloadable music, instead i shall always buy the cd at least for as long as they continue making them.
