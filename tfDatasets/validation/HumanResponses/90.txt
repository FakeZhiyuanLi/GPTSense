the next thing i chose was the motherboard. i ended up just finding an editors choice and going with the newer version of it. one of the biggest thing i wanted was something that was overclock friendly and the aopen ax4 spe max ii was just the thing. it has 2 physical usb ports with the connections for 8 of of them. it also features 2 bios chips with one as a backup in case you burn out the other one. there are 5 pci slots and one agp slot. it can take up to 4 gigs of memory. this thing is pretty damn cool. its a standard atx form factor. up next is the processor.
