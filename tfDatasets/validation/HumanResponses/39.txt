my how the moon shines brightly tonight, it lights up a dark room, tossing about a mysterious glow, silent fingers of light seem to creep across the room, but there is one object that catches my eye, her lower leg quietly rests along side the sheet, like a caressing touch the moonlight rolls up, towards her inner thigh, with a slow sigh and exhale the sheet raises, quickly the moon light races towards her lower back, exposing the gentle curves of her petite frame, within a blink the clouds cover the light, and now it is time to say good night. the end.
