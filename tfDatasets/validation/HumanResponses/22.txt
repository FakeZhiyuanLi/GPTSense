ok, so, i used to have a weblog at xanga.com, with all my friends as well. and it just got to the point that.i couldn't anymore. i was so tired of not being able to be open (my friends and i are close-knit, but i have a thingee i keep from them and it's just getting bigger, yeah, more on that later) and it hurt me, 'cause i knew how easy it would be to just say, 'hey!' but i can't! oh man, i'm silly, and secretive, and bashful. anyway, the huge secret? not that big: i don't have cancer, know the formula for cold fusion, have a secret life as a prostitute, my parents aren't getting divorced.it's not anything that big. *heaves a huge sigh* ok, this is tough to say in the open. i have a crush on one of my friends, who read my site, kyle. a huge crush, a crush that makes it hard to breathe, and lives up to the name *crush*! ok, enough for today? you're probably bored. :) later, i'm out.
