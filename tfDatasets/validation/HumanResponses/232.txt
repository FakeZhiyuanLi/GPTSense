thanksgiving was fun. we did not do the traditional thing and have turkey, we had pork roast instead. pork roast is better than turkey anyway. though, today we did have turkey. it was a trash can turkey. this is a really cool way to cook a turkey. when the turkey is done, it is jucier than turkies that are cooked in the oven. it also is done a lot quicker. no matter what size the turkey is, it will be done in 90 minutes. my dad found this in a camping cook book. well, that is all for now. see ya!
