as i sit here today, i realize that i am blessed. it could have been worse, but i praise the lord for every pain, setback, or thing that i am going through. i am blessed, and the reason why i am blessed, because i still have my health. even though i have been through every blood test i could think of, i am still healthy. i have realize that the devil is at work. i will continue to praise the lord! though sickness may rack my body, i will praise the lord! hallelujah! interesting how the lord allows things to happen. part of me wants to give up, but i will not give the devil a foothole! amen! yet, i don't see the miracle, it's there! my breakthrough is there! i will ever praise the lord! i have to, that is the only i am going to get through this. no one exactly knows what i am going through, but that's okay. because scripture says, "the fervent prayer of the righteous availed much!" amen!the lord is my protector! god is so great!
