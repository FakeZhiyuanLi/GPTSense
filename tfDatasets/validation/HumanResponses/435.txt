distance: 1100 meters duration: 29 minutes plus 2 laps. i forgot to start my timer. workout: 200 free/warmup, (50 sprint/free, 50 recover/free)x2, 200 pull breathe 7,3,5,3, 300 kick 100 sizzor, 50 dolphin, 50 back, 100 sizzor, 200 free/cool down. it's definitely getting easier. i'm going to try to swim 300 w/o stopping next time. i didn't flip. i'm not comfortable doing that in the big shared lanes. i really like swimming 50 m before turning better than 25 yards. weight: 212 pounds - not bad considering my father's 85 birthday party was last weekend and i spent sunday eating, uh, i mean, visiting with my brother.
