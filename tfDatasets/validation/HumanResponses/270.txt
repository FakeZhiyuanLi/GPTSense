in the general climate of pan-hellenic euphoria after the 1-1 draw against spain, i think that otto rehhagel, coach of our national soccer team, should be our next president of the hellenic republic. he deserves it 100%. mostly, because he took a bunch of overpaid, under-stimulated, super-egotistical players and turned them into a superb fighting team. be on the lookout now for the final match against russia on sunday, when a draw is enough to send greeks into the second round, and an entire country into pandaemonium. cheers, and as the greek fans chant: είναι τρελός, είναι τρελός ο γερμανός (he is crazy, the german is crazy). ioannis, 200040616211000
