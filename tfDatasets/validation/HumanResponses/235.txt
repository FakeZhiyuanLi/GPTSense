life is going good. i am still doing wrestling, but my idiotic coach is not letting me wrestl for varsity until after thanksgiving. oh well, i will just have to wait, because i need to wrestl varsity this year. school is going well. i have good grades. not much is happening in my life, so i don't have much to write. so, see ya'll.
