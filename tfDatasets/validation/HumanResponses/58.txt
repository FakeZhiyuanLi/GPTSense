the hurricane is coming  and we are doomed. especially aliss and i if we end up having to endure a night and a day with mom and abuela  i'd prefer to stand outside in the middle of the hurricane. anyways, so this could very well be my last post, if i die  so i'd like to say that i would definitely be disappointed that i would miss out on my trips to vegas and back to nyc, but hey those are the brakes baby.
