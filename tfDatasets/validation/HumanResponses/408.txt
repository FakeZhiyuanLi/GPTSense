this is such a great word. i heard it today in my acls class and decided that i would use it. it means, "to talk in a dogmatic and pompous manner". i went to my college roommate charisse's wedding last weekend in nodak. she was, by far, the most beautiful bride i have ever seen. i think she should be in the bride magazines. it was just a perfect wedding. and i didn't even get depressed.
