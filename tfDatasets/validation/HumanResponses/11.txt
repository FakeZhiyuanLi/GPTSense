while i'm at it, i thought i might ask a quick question to my (very few) loyal readers: does anybody know about any democrat dirty tricksters? it's not so difficult to list off obviously-dirty political techniques (like push polling, flyering neighborhoods with false information to suppress turnout, paying preachers to suppress black turnout, and dosing the opposition campaign headquarters) that republicans across the country (the bushies in particular) have been guilty of in the last ten years, but i can't think of a single example of similar bad acts by democrats. this may be because i'm reading the wrong things, but i don't think so, and i'd like to suppose that electoral corruption isn't a hallmark of the republican party. so, what dirty tricks are democrats guilty of, and who are the people behind them (again, for the republicans i can name names)?
