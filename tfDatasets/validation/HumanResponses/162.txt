iâ€™m just about ready to get some rest. today, i mean last night, gloria and i went to wal-mart to buy some windshield wipers and plastic rims for my car. afterwards we stopped at a local car wash to wash my car. my car was in need of a wash big time. now all i need to do is fix the transmission and air conditioning and it will be good as new. i also forgot to mention a new paint job. lol anyway, tgif. today happens to be payday. too bad i have to work but at least i'll have time to practice my violin.
