today was the first full day of training. the mat that we trained on is meant for wrestling, and it was especially hard on my knees today. i liked all the classes and i feel ready to have dinner, a few beers, and then time for bed. each instructor definitely has their own style, all are awesome. i'll have to come back to edit this once later. 1 day done, 4 more to go.
