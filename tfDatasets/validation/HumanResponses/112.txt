up at the crack of dawn this morning - 05:13 to be exact - early. spent the next hour helping my son to not wee all over the loo seat and reading an abc book with a big fluffy rabbit embedded in the crook of my neck. we have a milk van - actually no let me clarify - milk articulated lorry that delivers milk at 4.45 unbelievably noisily. what happened to the battery operated ones? or am i the only one with a 40 ton artic clammering down our road clinking with bottles each morning? the wren eggs are still safe and none have hatched yet. i'll let you know when they do.
