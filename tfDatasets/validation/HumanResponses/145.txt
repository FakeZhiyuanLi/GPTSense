i won't complain i've had some good days i've had some hills to climb i've had some weary days and some sleepless nights but when i think things over all of my good days outweigh my bad days so i say thank you lord i won't complain sometimes the clouds are low i can hardly see the road i ask a question, lord, why so much pain? but he knows what's best for me although my weary eyes can't see so i'll just say thank you lord i won't complain the lord has been so good to me he's been good to me more than this old world could ever be he's been so good to me he dried all of my tears away turned my midnights into day so i'll just say thank you lord i won't complain (this is not an original by me i just like it)
