.but now is the time for a quick blog. george best gets a new liver and *still* binges on booze. what a twat! he might claim that alcoholism is a disease, but the stupid motherfucker should be getting treatment for it then, and not poisoning a liver which could have been used to give someone else a few more years. in my opinion he's an arsehole and no matter how well he once played football he'll remain one until he finally acts responsibly. it just pisses me off so much that he could do something so pathetic. grrrrrrrr
