the last week or two of june is always boring. school is over, but summer activities haven't really started yet. this is the part of the summer where i sleep in till 1 in the afternoon and do nothing all day. the only remotely interesting thing that's happened in the past week is that yesterday i got my hair cut. i got 4 inches taken off and i also got it a lot more layered than it was before . the shortest layer is up to my chin! it's a nice change, especially since the hair dresser blow dried it so nicely and it's all nice and straight and pretty. it's too bad that i'll have to take a shower soon and ruin it! meh. i'll be going up north either tomorrow or thursday, still unsure, so i'll finally have something to do. i'll have my cousin dana and my grandparents to keep me busy! there's also more to do up north during this particular part of summer. i mean there's a lake. and there's boats. unless we get terrible weather the whole time, i don't think i'll be able to stay inside!
