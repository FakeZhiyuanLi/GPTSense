so, i just had an interview today for a promotion within my company. the upside and downside is that this would involve leaving my home, and moving to another city and state. part of me is excited (i have not been picked for the position yet, so excitement is premature.) and of course, part of me is down-right terrified. i'm not as afraid of moving to a new city as what moving to a new city for my job means moving to a new city for my job would mean that i am one of "those people" that chooses their job (and money) over their friends. that scares the shit out of me.
