i'm finally done my punishment, and not really sure if i have a limit on computer time now. comcast is dumb and they changed all our channels, so now we don't get tbs or abc family, which had all the movies we watched on. they control everything, those evil pigs. so now the sr. high site is as good as it's gonna get until i get some content from mr. barr. guess i'll talk later. bye
