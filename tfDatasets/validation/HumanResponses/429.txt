i lost my passport and am suppose to be going on vacation in two weeks! now i have to have an emergency service expedite my application so that i won't miss my vacation. i've lost my passport before, but it was taken care of for me b/c it was the fault of the airlines for losing our luggage. luckily we were back in the states. and yes, i am absent minded enough not to remember to put my passport in my carry-on luggage or purse. terrible, i know. anyway, here i am trying to fill out the online customer verification forms and my computer freezes. okay, no problem. i'll just open another window and redo it. now their site is down! i've got a headache now. so i call the service and he says that the site is down, but i should try again in 15 minutes. okay, fine. it's official. i won't be able to get this stuff done until tommorrow, but the guy says i should still get my passport by sept. 1st. stress!
