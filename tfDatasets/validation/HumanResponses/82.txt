i'm currently obsessed with paranormal stuffs. found the atheist board at gamefaqs, and they made a pretty great debate there whether god exists or not. i'm an atheist myself, but i always believed that anything may or may not be possible in this world. however, i read one of the posts about if you do no believe in god, you will go to hell. i mean, that is seriously ****ed up. does that mean a person who is good in moral terms will burn in hell if he didn't believe in god and a criminal who believes in god will go to heaven? still trying to figure out what is the seven gates of hell. i heard there are 6 gates at the us and a gate at the uk. heavy rain in the early morning. it's been years since i smelt this kind of rain. the smell of the sea.
