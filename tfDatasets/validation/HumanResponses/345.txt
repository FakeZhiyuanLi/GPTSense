as you may have guessed, i am bored. benji was supposed to get online at 4:30pm but i guess he forgot or something. or else someone else is using the phone. but anyways, just wanted to mention some songs that i really like. meiko kaji - flower of carnage zamfir - the lonely shepherd al hirt - green hornet electric light orchestra - mr. blue sky hootie and the blowfish - only wanna be with you that's all for now. i'll write back later.
