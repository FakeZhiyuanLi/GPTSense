so i get to do my first mini-set this weekend at the brecht forum. it's for a organization of south asian activists that are in town from all over the county. i'm housing two girls at the apartment which, in hind-sight, was an unnecessary stress on my relationship. one chick was really dope though, indian and chilena and she spoke spanish. i tried reaching juancho because apparently they know each other. hopefully, i'll put in a better performance this week. lately, i've been so focused on putting new shit out there that i haven't emphasized my performance enough. i'm trying to step that up a notch too. any suggestions?
