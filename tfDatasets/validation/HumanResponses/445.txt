jinhye got a guest from janpan who was her house host during her staying in janpan. i joined them, had lunch together and went shopping with them. there was nothing much i've done for him, but i was surprised to get a presant from him before i say good bye to him. it was nice cookies. i used to ask a lot of favors to my friends, families, co-workers, and strangers. i doubt whether i expressed enough to them how much i was thankful becase of them. i should say thank you everytime i get a help from somebody and i have to payback to them. otherwise, those people might misunderstand as being used. i think one of the secret for keeping a long relationship with someone is expressing truthfully how much you are thankful to the person everytime you get a favor from him or her.
