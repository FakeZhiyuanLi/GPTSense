alright, due to the lack of people signing up, i'm going to seriously need anybody who reads this (nobody) to try to get all other members they know to sign up. that way, may this troupe won't completely collapse before it's even taken off. i'm also thinking that now that school's wrapping up, maybe we should have a meeting sometime soon. piotr won't be able to make that one, as he's having a merry old romp in polandland, but assuming other people can make it, we might actually get stuff done. and yes, i promise that this time we'll have actual scripts, though i encourage you people to write some as well, as always. by the way, abby, if you're reading this, it might be a good idea for you to set up a new username if your old one is, in fact, wonked out. if you do, i can invite that one into the group.
