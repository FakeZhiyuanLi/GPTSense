why do i find it so hard to say what i am thinking it pisses people off because i cant speak my mind! like tara said to katherine the other day: "megan cant argue with a grapefruit let alone me or you" its so true though i'm crap, its so much easier to just keep my mouth shut it saves people from laughing at me. y do i have to be so paranoid rah! if someone laughs and i don't know what they are laughing at i automatically think that it is me, maybe because i usually make a fool of myself i just expect it! rah!
