waking up at 7:00 a.m. during spring break to get ready for work: sucks! on the other hand, playing mario kart double dash and mario party 5 with your girlfriend till 1:00 in the morning: priceless. heehee. i feel so exhausted right now. mainly because of work but also because i only slept for a few hours last night. my girlfriend gloria and i rented mario party 5 and we couldn’t put it down. she’s very competitive it’s hard to put my guard down. anyhow, its almost 4:00 p.m. and i plan to break a new record by sleeping early. good think i don’t have to worry about waking up early for work tomorrow morning. i plan to practice the second movement of the bach double tomorrow. my recital is only a few weeks away.
