the child darkest shadows come and sun is gone we together bond in liqueurs love forbidden fruits we tast we like incircle ourselves in vicious play the mourning come takes love away words of wisdom old phrases told within the kingdom life behold the child one with potion seeks the death in life freely weeps to yesterday we drink a toast in futures past the wrongs we wrote in keeping time the futures come to write the wrong and save the child although the love fades to grey for you and child the love will stay for two who played with poision gay cupids arrow hath missed it's prey good comes from bad you came on this day our good child we'll say alicia dawn tully she wrote this and for some reason, i like it. talking to her about her writing really opens up her self to me, i learned alot about her from our convesations.
