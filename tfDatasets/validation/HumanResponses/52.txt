i was looking for an email in my inbox, and i found some pictures of jack that i have on my phone and had emailed to myself. he is so adorable! i need to take some new pics this one is a couple months old. as he's gotten bigger, his markings have become much more distinct. perhaps i'll have more to share soon. for now, enjoy!
