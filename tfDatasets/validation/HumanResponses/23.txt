today is at least a year, if not two, since my last post. in that meantime, i've had three other xanga sites, multiple mini crushes, one devastating one, and more other random things that i can possibly say. i am apart from my friends once again. perhaps by choice this time, i learned this year that between those i hold dearest and myself is a completely different value system. i can't expect to change people, to make friends conform to what i hold important. i have to change. one year. one year more. one year more and no more. no more. no more.
