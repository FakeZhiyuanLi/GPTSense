bleh. i'm so bored right now. i've just finished memoirs of a geisha by arthur goldman. it's a really good book. i'd recommend it to a friend of mine, christina, and she said it was fabulous. yup. i have to go to tutoring tomorrow. i don;t want to go. ugh! i hate trigonometry! i still have to figure out how livejournal works, meaning all the customizing. i don't think it'll take to long for me to figure it out but i'm to lazy. :@ anyways i have to go now.
