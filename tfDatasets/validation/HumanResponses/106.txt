there's nothing like a good lie! lies can get you out of, and into a lot of shit  and there is no greater feeling than getting called a liar!:) not! :(  anyway i have this friend who's kind of in a ruff spot right now. this friend is getting in a lot of trouble and i think its kind of my fault ,but friend assures my its not so i guess ill believe that but the other day at my school i was getting "harassed" about shit i don't know much about then the next day i go back and was called a liar for telling a lie that i didn't even know was a lie gay any waythe friend that got in trouble happens to be my crush! now i don't know what is going to happen and things really suck ! im hoping things get better but with my luck they wont!
