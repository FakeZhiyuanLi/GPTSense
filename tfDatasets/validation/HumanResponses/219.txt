what can i say.i guess my blog has taken on a new popularity. good luck to everyone on the road. you can't read this right now, but oh well. have fun, don't take it too seriously. the band concert went really well, and i'll post the link on my next blog to pictures from the big show. i was really happy with it, although the 5th graders were toast. drum corps helped though. i told them that they needed to snap out of it and they turned it on about 2 songs into the concert. next song they sounded like pros. it was a good moment. after that i went to wayside with wagner and had some brews and pizza. this weekend i'm helping john move and doing some packng myself. a week and a half from now i'm going to be in va beach. can't wait.
