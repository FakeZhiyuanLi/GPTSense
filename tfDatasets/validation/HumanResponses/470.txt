why not? everybody's doing it. i just recieved 6 gmail invitations to give out, all because of the great google gods. so here's the deal, the first 6 people to leave a comment to this post with there full name, and a valid, non yahoo msn or hotmail, email address will recieve one of the 6 coveted gmail invitations. that sound easy enough? well, just for being a reader of this great blog, you will also recieve the ability to read, reply, and send all your email through the awsome gmail service. it just can't get any better than this. have fun, i hope at least 6 people actualy read my blog lol
