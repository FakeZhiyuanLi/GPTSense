well today i went on a hike in shades state park. it was fun. it was a really nice day to go on a hike. it was not to hot for when you are hiking, but when not hiking you are not to cold. it also is not to long of a drive. yesterday was horrible though. i had to spend my whole day doing things with the church, and have a million pictures taken of me. i hate pictures! well, this week of school will be cool, because i have only 2 days of school. i get the rest off for thanksgiving. i also get to go on my first varsity meet on tuesday. it will be fun! well, see ya.
