i've been noticing recently the distinct lack (at least round where i live) of the toothbrush moustache. looking back over what limited historical records i possess, it seems that the second half of the twentieth century has seen a general dearth of this form of facial hair. this is a great disappointment to me. can anybody suggest a reason for this strange phenomenon, or does anybody have one? or know someone that does?
