there are three kinds of people. first, people who say things behind you. they would not be really true firends but those who you should be away from. second, people who doesn't say much, or say some good things about you. they might be your good friends but still not the best friends. third, people who gave you advices especially about your weeknesses. they are my family and some friends to me. i consider them as my best true friends who will be there for me for good.
