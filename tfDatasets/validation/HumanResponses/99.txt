scotch tape is so totally the best for creating a sculpture because sculptures should represent something important to life, and scotch tape is about as important as taking a shower every day. (i don't know about you, but that's very important to me.) i think making a sculpture out of scotch tape would be an apt and well deserved tribute to that common household accessory people are always looking for and never have enough of, especially around christmas. ^___^ come on, agree with me. you know you want to.
