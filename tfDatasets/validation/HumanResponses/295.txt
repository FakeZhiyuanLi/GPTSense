15.30: just arrived in sheffield. the plan is, of course, to get a load of work done. but i think that will be left to tomorrow as it such a lovely day! (although apparently tomorrow will be even better. damn.) the good news is that i did finally finish the translator cgi, and it will be up tomorrow.
