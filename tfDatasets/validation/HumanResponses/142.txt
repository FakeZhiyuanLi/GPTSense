i've been hitting the "snooze" button on my alarm clock since 9:00am. work sucks, paychecks are good. agh. gotta be at work in an hour and a half. i work at the fine establishment of accu-temp heating and air conditioning. i answer phones. i make shipping lables. i stuff envelopes. i have to dress-up. but then again i never go into work earlier than noon and i never work weekends. and the pay is decent. im too tired to come up with anything good to talk about. i'll write more later.
