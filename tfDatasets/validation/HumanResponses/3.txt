now that orkut mania has completely taken over. and the realization has hit, that after uve added everyone u could possibly add, there is nothing more to really do, than to log on and make sure your face is appearing up in the recently logged on lists, i started browsing the communities, and surprisingly found a lot of interesting conversations taking place, in communities such as "pakistan" and "lahore" and "pakistani music". as a result. ive bought a book on the recommendation of a complete stranger, and im going to be getting back to that now. i dream of microwaves.
