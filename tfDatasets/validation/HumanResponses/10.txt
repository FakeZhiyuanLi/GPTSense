i just wanted to preempt this one. i'd like to permit anonymous comments on this blog, but only for the convenience of people who don't have accounts or something comparable. as such, here's a request for any anonymous posters: please sign your (a consistent) name in your posts. i just don't want to mess with trolls, and i think it's not excessive to ask a reasonable person to take responsibility for their words.
