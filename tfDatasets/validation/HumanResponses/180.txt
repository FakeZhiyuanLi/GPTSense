at night i dream of you, coming to be by my side. i see your silhouette at first; i watch your calm, quick glide. vivid images; pictures in my mind. my night's love, my passion; all in you i shall find. once again, you'll whisper to me, "hello, my dear. " your touch eases me, removing any fear. your gaze meets mine; the warm look in your eyes, it melts my heart. from now on nothing but blue skies! tonight you romance me; our bodies entwine. you enter; i gasp! our souls combine. a touch here, a tickle there, it enthralls me; i am captivated. our bodies move, the motion constant; my body's completely activated. throughout the night our passion flows, coming together, my emotion grows. for you, in dreams, oh, how i care. but when morning comes, i am left in despair. anther night gone and passed. i awake in ecstasy all alone. for you visit at night; in dreams you come. and i dread the coming of a new dawn.
