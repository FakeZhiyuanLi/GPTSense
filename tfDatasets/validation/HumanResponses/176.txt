well, i was going to start this out as a log for my weight loss journey. i guess that will still be my focus, but, i do plan to use this for other events in my life as well. daniel, my older son, just graduated high school on tuesday, what a tough time it is going to be, letting him go. i never thought watching one of my kids leave home to go to school would be so difficult. oh well, life will go on, without as much humor as before, since dan is our resident comedian. weight watchers is the name of the game from this point on. i am really not a fan of flex points, but, i really need to get off this medication i am on. the only way i will be able to accomplish this is to loose, loose, loose. i plan on going to get our pool passes tomorrow, so no more excuses about exercise either.
