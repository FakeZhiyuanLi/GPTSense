some people will tell you that there is no reason to not wear leather, because it's just a by-product of the animal industry that will go to waste. however, research by university of minnesota faculty member carl v. phillips shows that leather accounts for 3.8% of the profits made by raising cattle. if the leather business were to disappear, approximately 2% fewer cows would be slaughtered each year. to put this in perspective, that is more than a million cows per year. leather is not a harmless by-product. that's right asshole, eat it up.
