i saw it on friday, and i'd like to post more about it soon. but for now, i just have to make the public service announcement go see this movie. sure, it's biased. but it's a bias that has not been presented yet. and i'm all about the drummer who takes to his own beat, thoreau-style. until i can post more, fight the system.
