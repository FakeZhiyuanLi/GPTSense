.as this is the first post to something i have never done before, i should explain the title; only echoes . other than the fact that it is part of a line in an ultravox! song (hiroshima mon amour), it kind of represents what this is about; echoes of what i am doing and thinking. how often i get to post to this is something i cannot predict. i am in the middle of a computing degree and working full time, so time is short. it's also coming from scotland so expect opinions from that perspective. it's actually hard to know what to write to something like this but it will get better or more interesting as i get accustomed to it.and once i think of something to say. maybe next post i'll say a little of who i am; that might be fun!
