i hate it when i do this. something important occurs to me at an inappropriate time and i think 'oh yeah. i'd better not forget that!' well, i forgot to remember that the swissmodel server isn't exactly swift at processing queries i had 5 hours to finish an assignment, and i've spent four waiting for the results (which still aren't here). fan-fucking-tastic.
