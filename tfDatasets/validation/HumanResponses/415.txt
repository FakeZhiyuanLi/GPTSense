work is boring. finding it hard to motivate myself to write a literature review on polistes wasps. it'd probably only take me a few days to expand on my previous review, but i still would rather look at pseudo-pornographic pictures of meat on the net than actually do it. my wasps are still alive (well, one nest of them anyway) and the parasites still kick ass. but not much i can do with them other than feed and water them. suppose i could release them into the air conditioning vents, bwahahaha. gonna hit the showers early today, read up on st. petersburg so i'm prepared for when i go next week :) geoff capes.
