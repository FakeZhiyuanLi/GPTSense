nowadays is an adverb that means "at the present time" or "these days." it is used primarily to show contrast between a period, state or situation in the present that is different from the past. most often it follows the use of used to and the conjunction but. for example: people used to dress up to go to the theater, but nowadays no one hardly does. he used to come to work early every day, but nowadays he is always late. this is not to be confused with the use of now. for instance: my favorite food used to be italian, but now it is japanese. last year i wanted to be a doctor, but now i want to be lawyer. in conclusion, nowadays nowadays is not used very often, so you are better off not using it all the time.
