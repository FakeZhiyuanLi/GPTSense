i wake up this morning, found out what had happened isn't true it's only a dream i almost cried, tears nearly fell cause everything is just dream, not real this is what happened in my dream it's a pretty nice one, i have never get a better one than this, and may be a dream that may always leave a mark in my heart. it's about 'her', someone i like in the past, now and will like in maybe, future. well nobody will be sure about that. she started to talk to me again, she's accepted me woohoo that will be really great but it's just a dream. she treats me so different. ever since i confess to her, her attitude towards me had changed: rejected at all times i ask her out; talks to me only when i talk to her i feel really bad, wonder if anyone will be able to help me
