maybe it's just my age but all this information being stored on the internet and computers makes me nervous . it's kind of like the feeling i get when i drive over a long bridge. the chesapeake bay bridge comes to mind. it makes me want to roll my windows down and get my handy seatbelt cutter out just in case the bridge collapses, i will be able to escape my car!
