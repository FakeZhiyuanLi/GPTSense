she has been my cure in days when i am not happy she is always laughing and that makes me happy when i cannot change my shorts, she says my legs are skinny and that makes me to laugh and embarass myself but i do not cry because i see that she is happy which whittles away all my feeling of crappy she is so sweet that i am now happy to not do my work, to which this poem attests.
