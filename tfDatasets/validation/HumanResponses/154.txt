this week has been crawling by so slowly. i'm glad its over. i volunteered for franklin's elementary school's sports day with christina and casey. i didn't have that good of a time but it definitely beats going to school. i have an english presentation today, but because of this mrs. bird allowed me to present on wednesday. their sports day ended at 12. i went to casey's house for a while then we decided to go to the mall. i needed to buy maggie a birthday present. we went to bretwood but soon afterwards we got bored (brentwood is not big) so we decided to go to lougheed mall , which was about ten minutes away. we shopped for a bit then went to metrotown (another mall). i was quite funny because we went from one mall to another. in the end i found this skirt for maggie at the garage clothing. i hope she likes it.
