i am in love with my lord. the reason why i say this, because he first loved me. even though i was the wretchiest girl, he still loved me. despite my faults, he saw that i needed a savior. i remember singing this song when i was young, "when my mother, my father forsake me, then the lord will take me up. when i need some help, can't find nobody else, then the lord will take me up." it's so comforting to know that god is there when you need him. blessings!
