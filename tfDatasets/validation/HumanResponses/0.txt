i've been in scotland for 5 years now and haven't had a decent rpg session yet! seeing as i was heavily involved in our monthly vampire larp and had a weekly (sometimes bi weekly) table top game at my house you can imagine i'm not to happy about that. had to leave almost all my books at home (can you hear my sobs from here, bet you can!) but i've just got my hands on hol and buttery holsomeness and i'm itchin to find some players. so if you're interested by all means leave a comment for me and/or email me at humanoccupiedlandfill@hotmail.com
