why do people buy suv's if they have absolutely no idea how to drive them? i swear i almost get killed about four times a day driving in philadelphia, mostly by suv's. i am not the best driver but at least i drive a vehicle i can handle. i saw samuel dalembert(sixers player, i see him at our gym all the time) the other day on the side of the road and i contemplated stopping to help him with whatever was going on with his tire. but then i thought, "what can i do to help this guy? give him my tire gauge? change his tire? first of all, this guy is like 7 foot 2, so i'm thinkin' his torque could be a little better than mine (even though i'm built like a norweigan washwoman) and furthermore, he's loaded. so he could hire somebody to fix his car. um, his suv. which i think he can drive.
