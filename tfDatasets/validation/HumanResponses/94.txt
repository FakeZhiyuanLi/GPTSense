it's happened i now have 1mb conn! of course there are plenty of companies that will do more for less mazullah but it's a start. i am only tied to bt for another 3 months now the regrade has been done, so i can migrate if i like after then. of course because of all the problems i had with spam, all my email now comes via bt so i would have to change my email and tell everyone again. that puts me off slightly but, having said that, an even faster conn and less money is likely to persuade. i would have to cancel this isp though and be without for a while, which i am not prepared to do at the moment because i need my connection; and i just set sub accounts for the wife and daughter which would have to change along with the parental control stuff. so, it would be a bit of a trial. but time will tell. dave
