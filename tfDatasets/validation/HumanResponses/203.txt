this blog is the place for me to rant and complain and de-stress over my senior year of high school. i needed a dedicated spot to keep track of grades, deadlines, sat scores, who accepted me and who didn't, and so on, and i felt a new blog over here would be great. just for some background info, my name is amanda and i'm a senior at coventry high school. i'm a band geek. i have a 3.7 gpa and rank 101 out of a class of 439. i'm a member of national honor society, rhode island honor society, and spanish national honor society. i like to write, draw, and compose.
