my first post, on 9/11 of all days. my previous record for keeping any sort of record of my life lasted a few weeks at most, the latter half of entries rambling on about "not having done anything". i now see the error of my ways, as by simply including things like "had 2 dumps today" or "saw sabrina the teenage witch, became aroused", i could easily fill up a blog. also, i have hit upon the idea of blogging out things that didn't happen, since it's not like all this is of significance anywhere. right, best go do something :) i wanna dress as a pirate, a camp one at that.
