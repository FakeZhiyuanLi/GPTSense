i can't believe i have been out drinking all day, now i have to figure out what to say. should i start with "it started this way", no, i used that last time. maybe i should explain it in a rhyme, no, that's not worth a dime. who am i kidding she won't let me in anyway, so i'll go back to the bar and drink the rest of my pay! the end.
