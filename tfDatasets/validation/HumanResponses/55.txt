so, my last post is rather dismal. but it's not indicative of how things are in general. so i wanted to add a disclaimer to state that i'm using this blog as an opportunity to take snapshots of how i feel at one moment. obviously, one isn't usually motivated to rant or ramble on about things they have mediocre emotions about. so, while these entries may seem to teeter from joy to misery, i am not bipolar. moody, perhaps, but not manic depressive. on that note, things are good :) better get back to work! oh yeah, day 2 of the south beach diet. things are going really well. i have lots of energy. and i am eating much healthier. perhaps i will post my progress. why? because i can. until later, keep things crazy.
