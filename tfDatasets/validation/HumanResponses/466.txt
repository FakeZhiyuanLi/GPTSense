i live and work by the beach in the bay in northern california. originally from the south i had this preconceived notion that coastal living was, well, awesome - hot all of the time with the warmest water imaginable. ha! someone forgot to inform me that the water temperature drops as you live further up north and that the pacific ocean isn't nearly as balmy as the atlantic. duh. uh, and can we please talk about the fog? horrid little overcast that can last for hours on end. it's the coast! it's suppose to be sunny. was baywatch a lie? (not that i ever watched baywatch, mind you.) fog, water temperature at 54 degrees, not exactly the sunny california i was hoping for. it's definitely not oc. unbelievable.
