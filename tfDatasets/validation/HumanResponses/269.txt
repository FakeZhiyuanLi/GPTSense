hi. a good friend of mine sent me this interesting image. one can only assume that the hungarian(s) bureaucrat(s) who was/were working at their local department of transportation was/were not fluent in english. however, one cannot but simply ask the question: "what were they thinking when they issued this car plate?" cheers, ioannis, 20040621154000 p.s. no, i am not going to write/discuss about yesterday's game between greece and russia for euro2004. as one sports site put it very eloquently, it was a russian roulette game, but the bullet exploded in spain's head :) icd
