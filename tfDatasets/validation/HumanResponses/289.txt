in ym last writing i saw that i used way too many " i guesses". yea i know, the end of the world right? you know what that's the problem with ppl today. we need to loosen up. everyone's so damn anal about what's going on in the world or whats going on in other people's lives, ( this whole gay marriage thing) when our own shit is fucked up. we're living in messed up times ladies and gents. i mean no one can be themselves without being put into a 'certain' class of people. then those people are put into a sub category and then that sub category is put into an even smaller category, until we're nothing at all. so then what is life, then? nothing. there's no such thing as black, white, gay, straight or anything of the such, were nothing at all. zen eat your heart out heh heh
