july 23 august 4 - same view the facade on jcpenny building at sher-den mall has been torn off. the only recognizable part of the old mall is the powerplant on the back side. according to the news article at the first of the year, they would take about 6 months to demolish the old mall, which is about right. august will be 5 months. once the land is clear and i take final photographs, i think i will keep the sher-den mall up for awhile as a memorial, however i will go through my photo collection and reorganize the site.
