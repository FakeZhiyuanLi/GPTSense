today was one of those days where nothing realli is going on and it's not a good day and it's not a bad day, it's kinda in-between, and it's not like im feeling anything inside of me either which is weird cuz im usually happi or depressed or just like "whatever", but today im kinda not feeling anything inside, it's like i know it doesnt make sense cuz it doesnt make sense to me either but it's one of those feelings where it's not realli a feeling, it's more like there's nothing realli going on inside of you to make you happi, or upset, or angry, or anything like that, i know it's confusing but basically one way to explain it is that im not realli feeling anything good or bad right now, it's just nothing.
