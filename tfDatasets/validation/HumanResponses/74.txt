mondays suck. i always feel tired, more so than usual. today we finished star testing for the fifth grade. i'm so glad that testing is over, but now i have to start my multiple measures. there is quite a bit of work to do at the end of the school year. i think it is the most stressful time of the year, at least for the teachers. just my thoughts on monday.
