yeah, so i have a blogger now. again. not sure how often i'll be updating it, but i'll try to keep it often for the masses, hungry for news of my interesting life. yes. so, what's up with me? well the job's going great. the car wasn't, i had to get about $600 worth of brake work done on it last week. good news: aforementioned job lets me be able to pay for this stuff without too much heartache. so yay, my car is working. let's see, what else? looking forward to the bbq this long weekend, and hopefully seeing some people from school on monday. but that's about it! last night i had a dream i was on survivor with rupert and everyone from the all stars season. turns out, they all hated him. they made fun of him and made him cry. i was like, "but it's rupert! he's the people's favourite!" so then they hated me too. it was lame. okay, until next time!
