well let's see, monday sucked as i said, the rest of the week sucked until friday. ira came over and we watched movies and shit all night. hmmmm today i went to the movies with a few people. i didn't talk much to anyone, kind of sucked because i felt pretty left out, travis had sam, sam had his brother, and travis h was with rachel, and then there was me. so yeah. i think i made things right with steph finally. this day has gone on the list as mediocre in general. no matter how much i did i couldn't shake the feeling that i was missing something. god i feel so depressed right now, i really want to talk to someone but no one's on. whatever goodnight.
