today: bike riding, rowing machining, and debary going. good ride this morning, although i have to get the emo off my ipod. i used to keep a lot f music on there that i though other people might like (which accounts for the emo), but any more to hell with it. it's really hard to change the track while on the bike. i have to reach around into the outside pocket of my back pack, and try and find the ipod, otherwise i ahev to go hands free, slip on strap off my shoulder and dig around in there while doing 14 to 20 mph, and being totally invisiable to automobiles. at the gym, i have to stop my faux rowing, and it can be kind of painfull to get back into the groove. ok, so i'll stop whining, but damn, i really hate jets to brazil. how did i not know this about myself?!
