yep. i do. this whole minnesotan accent just isn't cutting it for me. i spent independence day weekend in boston and cape cod, and i heard the best accents (second, of course, to scottish ones). i want one. for instance, 1. we were in provincetown and this guy came up to me and asked, "do they sell be-eah he-eah?" 2. sitting in front of the esplanade on the harbor, they broadcast this kid wearing a yankees jersey (the crowd booed him), and this guy in front of me proclaimed "that kid's gonna be scahhed fa life!" 3. this drunk idiot on the t yelled, "i can predict the futah- the sawks are gonna win the warld series- they're gonna trade nomah fa randy johnson" i want to sound uneducated in a fun way. why not. so i'm gonna say, as lars says, "go up frickin' 495, past the pahkin lawt and take a left at the retahded kid".
