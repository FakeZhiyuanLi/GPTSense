yay. i-poly accepted me like a little weenie because i'm teh coolies like that. but there's one problem. well, technically, two. i have to make up my maths (algebra 1b) and french 1 outside of i-poly. i'll try mt. sac semester 2. welcome to the life of indepedence. but anyways. after my interview, i went to munjal's to do some wifi thingies. we got a network up but only received the wep'd network. in which we didn't hack. and he got me thinking. why do i like girls so much (in the pants) but afraid to talk to them?
