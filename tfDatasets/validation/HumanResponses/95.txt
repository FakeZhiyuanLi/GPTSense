why is it when you want something done by a large company, they always seem to mess it up. their administration, which you would think would be tried and tested (after all they wouldn't be so big if it wasn't rock solid now would they) fails at seemingly every turn. my recent attempts at upgrading my adsl connection to 1mb have been met with this form of "don't know their arse from their elbow" style or customer service to the point i wouldn't trust them (them is british telecom/yahoo) to sit the right way round on a toilet seat three times they have failed because they cannot complete an order correctly at the orders department. i know, i know that's only their goddamned job ain't it? now set once more for the 21st may, i know it's going to fail again. i must do something to give them a kick up the ass.hmmm.thinks.i know, i'll phone them for a fifth time. keep your fingers crossed eh! dave
