today was the first day of summer vacation for me. i am a teacher living on the southern coast of california. it is pleasant for the most part, except we have what is known as, "june gloom." basically it is overcast and drizzly all day long. so evn hough it is very nearly the official start of summer, we have temperatures in the low 60's. today was sort of stay at home and drink coffee, sort files and organize my desk, i.e. a nothing kind of day. i hope to catch some good surf tomorrow, if not i plan on riding my mountain bike with my friend walter. there is always something to do here in ventura. summer 2004!
