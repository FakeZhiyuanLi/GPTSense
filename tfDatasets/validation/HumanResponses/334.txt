so my parents woke me up at 0900 and i didn't really want to go to the airport. and i still don't understand why i had to go. anyways, we left house at 10 06 and got there a little later than paul and his brother's flight from thailand. it was supposed to arrive at 1040 but came at 1036. so my dad dropped me off at the terminal and i watched around looking for bombs or people with suicide bomb belts (yes, i like helping the polizei). i was there for an hour, well until 1125 because the people at ins are slow and uber underpaid. dun dun dun! drove them to their house in northern orange county, teehee and stayed there for an hour. all they brang back was food. haha, thai people! and now i'm home doing nothing. traffic sucks outside so i can't go anywhere far today. oh well, it's the average friday. i also thought of making a movie like everyone said before and am in need of radio hosts to do this radio show shit. later.
