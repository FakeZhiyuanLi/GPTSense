我難過的是 放棄你 放棄愛 放棄的夢被打碎 忍住悲哀 i am going to give up jiemin, concentrate on studies. she had caused me to lose concentration and shattered my heart into million pieces, such disappointment. she hasn't been nice to me after my confession, now it's hard to become good friends again i won't believe that she will trust me in anything never mind, who cares? i don't think i will be nice to her either for now, a new 'me' will reappear in people's eyes, no more sorrow, bitter-gourd face or whatsoever. i am going to make a great success in my studies i will!
