today i am happy. my luck hasn't changed with my love but it doesn't seem like i'll never get over her anymore. don't get me wrong i still miss her amazingly but i'm going to trust her judgment. she will always have a special place in my heart but i don't think that she completely holds it anymore. i just hope my mood stays the same today as it has started off. well i'm going to get my day started. bye for now.
