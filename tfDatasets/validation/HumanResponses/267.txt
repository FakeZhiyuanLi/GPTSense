greetings. people say third time's the charm. well, i hope they're right since this is the third time i've tried to build this blog. the first time was ok for about a month and then everything that could go wrong, did in fact go wrong: computers crashing, drives burning, you name it. the second time, well, it was more of my fault, so i hope this time we'll do better. i am writing from patras, greece and i am interested in all those things (small and big ones) tha make you go "hmmm." be back soon. ikd, 20042805135000
