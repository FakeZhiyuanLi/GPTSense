big event scheduled. for friday. i will be shopping for groceries. its not an ending of the world event, but its a very important thing for me. for the first time in a long while i will be shopping for someone else besides myself. i think a list is in order. kinda a list, i don't want to be too organized. half the fun of shopping for food is the suprise. maybe i should just do minimal shopping. i mean rachel is coming in a little over two weeks; i should go with her to the store for the food she wants. sometimes. i get sooooo excited i want everything to be perfect. as domino would say purrrrrrr-fect
