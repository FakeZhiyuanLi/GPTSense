well actually it should say rude boyz! but i was in the mood for a duran duran reference. friday is finally here and i'm a bit poste. went to fire in vauxhall last night for rude boyz (basically it's a night for lads who like hackett tops, trackie bottoms etc). had a great time. much of which is either unprintable or would land me in jail (alledgedly). it's a really good horny night with top tunes and top totty. although the ametuer scally strip thing was a bit like blind date with burberry. so whats up this weekend? well i think s'wellen's dragging me into town for a beer tomorrow *hic*. and that's about as far as my plans go. 7 days from now i'll be in manchester - la la la great weekend y'all! mike x
