i've had a terrific day. it's been wonderfully productive. the football team was checked in with little incident, i cleaned my apartment, read, wrote, watched the olympics, and now i just finished watching the hours . gymnasts are amazing i have a new found respect for male gymnists. all that they can do and all the strength it takes and all the flexibility it requires.well, it's just incredible to watch. i can't believe that they can twist and twirl like that on the pummel horse and hold themselves perfectly still on the uneven bars. it's amazing to watch! the hours .what a movie this is about the third time i've seen it all the way through. i just love it. if you haven't seen it, rent it :) even the third time the movie still touches me in a way that is unspeakable. i'm listening to the flaming lips. quote of the evening.“each has his past shut in him like leaves of a book known to him by his heart, and his friends can only read the title.” virginia woolf
