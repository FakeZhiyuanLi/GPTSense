that's my way of saying "hi". seems to be a fresh change after the usual "hi", "hello" and "yo". grace was talking to adrian and i about the world's education system and international schools. the word "international schools" made me think about dinghy and iona, who both graduated from the same school, aged 14 and 15 respectively. dinghy's 18 now (i forgot to ask him what he's studying at the moment) while iona (17) is taking medicine. impressive, really impressive. /no1 to you two. i forgot my dreams while i'm in a half-asleep mode, whenever my parents woke me up. i mean, it was like the dream was one second ago, then i woke up, and forgot about it. weird. and uh, to the readers, please post some comment about my blog, so i know that someone is reading this other than rhodry (shaun) :p
