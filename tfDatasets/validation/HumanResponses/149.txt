man this summer has gone by slow and ive been so bored it will be freedom to go to camp next week,i cant help but drift my thoughts to kira i wish she would be back next year, i sent her a e-mail and waiting for a response i hope to see her over the summeroh man i sound like a guy whos dog died well one of my friends left the school i go to, sperated by a vein of a few miles but seperated by many many many universes,i think i like her or liked (as love is to strong a word) i might never see her again and that makes me sad but im sure ill go to campand my spirits will get a little brighter ah well w/e its late or err early. bye
