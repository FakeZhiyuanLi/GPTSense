cali is a two-year old mcnab mixed breed adopted from the mendocino humane society. cali is a skilled climber with cat-like agility and a terrier's rambunctuous personality. he can jump 5 feet in the air to grab a stick or frisbee. he has one big problem - cali is a scariedy-dog. he is afraid of plastic bags, remote controls, propane tanks, boxes, or anything that makes noise. he is easily startled and inappropriately protective. cali lives with his humans, a feral cat named aggie and his best friend winnifred, a nine year old cocker-spaniel mix.
