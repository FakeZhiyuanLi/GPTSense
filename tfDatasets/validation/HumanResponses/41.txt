it is just another day, one that resembles yesterday. i keep waiting for a change, but the waiting makes me feel strange. maybe the window above this cage, will disengage. could this be the day i fly away, or should i just stay? this feeling is turning to fear, maybe i don't want to go up into the atmosphere. i could just persevere, for tomorrow will be just another day anyway. the end.
