the band as of now still requires: ~a bass player (hannah? maybe? please?!?!?!?!) ~a drummer ~a lead singer ~an accordion player (maryanne maybe? i guess it would be kinda similar to the piano, eh?) if you already play an instrument or are thinking about taking up one of these instruments (or singing) please speak up now!
