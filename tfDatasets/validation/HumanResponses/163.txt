what a day it's been so far. i woke up pretty early to deliver some flyers on the string camp weâ€™re having over at utpa this summer. afterwards i traveled to utpa to practice my vso (valley symphony orchestra) auditions. one of my goals for this summer is to be apart of the vso. with the right practice and preperation, i'm sure i'll do fine in the audition. also, just incase i don't make it this semester, there is always next semester. i belieive that the important this is to give it a try and gain some experence from it.
