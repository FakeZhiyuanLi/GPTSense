so i ran around town today, doing some errands con mi madre, and the last thing we did was cash a ninety- five hundred dollar check. the check, my inheiritance from some distant aunt or great aunt of mine who i never met before she died, will pay for the car that i am currently driving. that will happen soon, when the lease runs out and i buy off the car. plus i will have a little (about 500) left from interest and leftover that i can use towards a large purchase. so even though i never met this lady, she has impacted my life in a very big and positive way. i can only hope to do things along the same lines.
