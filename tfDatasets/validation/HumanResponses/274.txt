fairweather flowers. i smell the sweet country side, whilst i wander the meadows, the grass, fresh from the morning dew, sways bringing my memories to life when i would run through the tall grasses, i had her beside me, following, i wished then as i wish now, she stays on, through all times. why should i feel a tear roll, moist should becomes my eyes, tearful, i knew dreams fade away at dawn, someday i shall realize the same. the morning mist has faded down, to reveal a land kissed by its presence, i pick up a fairweather flower fresh, pretty like the girl i knew.
