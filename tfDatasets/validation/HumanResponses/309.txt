it’s you. it’s every part of you. your tenderness, your sweetness, your affection, your passions, your darkness, your brightness, all of you. you are part of me. you are the king. the lighthouse. the grave. you are the heartbeat within me. when you are busy. when you’re far from me. when i miss you. god, how can i reach you? silvery moon and velvet sky failed to entertain me. they are misery, and you are my angelstar. my only angelstar. memories of you. they want to stay in my heart, forever. you. now my heart knows how to keep you. now my heart knows what to do. if you only knew.i need you.
