practicing my violin at home can be difficult at times, especially with my sister’s pet puppy howling at me. i can’t tell whether she’s singing along or singing the blues. i really need to get some practice time if i want to be ready for my recital, which is in 3 weeks. if this continues i might have to drive to pan am to use one of the practice rooms they offer. opps almost forgot, i have to get ready for work. i go in at 2:40 p.m.
