watching rainfall reminds me of tears, sometimes falling gently, sometimes falling hard, tears and rain fall for many reasons, rain can signal a change of seasons, a little rain falls in everyone's life, tears show emotions in time of strife, like rain that always finds away, let the tears fall where they may, both signaling everything will be ok. the end.
