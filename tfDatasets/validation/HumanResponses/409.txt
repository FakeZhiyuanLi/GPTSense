school, school, school. that's all i do. in fact, i am sitting here procrastinating, doing this, while i should be studying. i want to write something deep and profound, but all i have to say is that this is absolutely the last thing i should be doing. "i wish i was a dolphin", i said to my friend julie today. really, when you think about it, that would be the coolest animal to be (unless of course you got caught in a tuna net.). you could swim and jump and bob in the water to sleep, send out sonar waves and make clicking noises. everyone loves dolphins, too. i wish i was one.
