today has been good, i slept until 1pm and then had to tidy my room but to make up for the horrible task of cleaning my room i got to go to the cinema with my lovely boyfriend nick, i thougth the film was good, it was 50 first dates but nick thought it was boring and repetitive, hence the name 50 first dates. he also bought me 4 lovely red roses, if your reading this nick thankyou they are beautiful cant wait to go shopping tomo, havent got much money but i am going to spend it wisely and not buy loads of crap like i normally do. tara mite end up killing me as she gets irritated by my fussieness (sp) lol i just dont spend my money unless i really like something i think thats a good thing but she doesnt, she likes spending all of her money whenever she has any lol
