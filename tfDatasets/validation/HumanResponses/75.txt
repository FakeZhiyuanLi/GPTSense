man oh man where does the time go? it is already friday, may 21st. 2004 this was the fastest week i can remember in a long time. school is almost over, and summer will soon be here. i am so looking forward to surfing, kayaking, mountain biking, motorcycle camping and of course just doing nothing. my cohort and i finished packing the star tests for ouur district today. we finished early, so we graded writing for our classes. work was easy today. i have to admit the 500.00 i'm getting for being a star test coodinator was the easiest 500.00 i have ever made. anyway tomorrow is saturday and i am hoping for a sunny day with some fun surf. if not i'll take the sunny day and call it even.
