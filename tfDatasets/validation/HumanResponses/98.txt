today was probably one of the worst days i've ever had. and it only took about a 30 minute arguement to make it that way. yes things suck ass again. not too bad though. it feels like the worlds spinning really fast around me, and its makin me all dizzy and stuff, and i try to keep up, but i can't. yep, thats what it feels like. and it sucks. today i realised that i need to graduate highschool. that means major extra classes at the college, and major extra effort that i'm not willing to give, even though i know that i need to gradute. i'm fucked up like that. my heads fuckin pundind, and my back hurts like a little blonde bitch. i need drugs. i need my favorite friends mary, and jane. i love there company. they rock. they keep me goin when the world gets way too crazy. if only everybody would just calm down, and chill. the world would be a much more likable place. yep.yep. it would.
