hello all, did ya miss me? i knew you wouldnt heh. whatever. anyways i hope you all are in good spirits and all that good shit and um yea. so lets see whats been going on in my life that i havent even spilled yet or have just remembered? well let's see. um shit at school is perfectly normal, my mom is still a habitual bitch, and other than that im fine. well other than having a case of "monkee missing" and a chronic case of writer's block im good. so i guess i'll write something longer later. heh
