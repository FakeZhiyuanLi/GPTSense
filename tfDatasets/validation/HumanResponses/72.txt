yo. this is my first post. i don't know how this'll look on the journal, but i'll tweak it accordingly for a decent looking blog. i'll use language, so, if you're one of those who tell your mom to look at what you're surfing through on the internet, light something invaluable (to your wonderful mother) on fire while browsing this page. while she's off taking care of the fire and getting a trident to murder you, you can spend your last few minutes alive browsing. i'll see what other features this thing has so that i can add more content to make it a bit cooler. whatever. i'll post later. kiran
