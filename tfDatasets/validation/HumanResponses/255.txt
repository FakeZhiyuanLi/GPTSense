i cannot believe that you have that picture up. where did you get that? how old is that? i still have bangs! well, not like that's anything new or exciting. i think monique was here when we took that. funfun. you know, i am quite proud over the fact that i don't really have bangs anymore. i mean, yes, they're there, and they're kind of annoying, but i took the time to actually grow them out! you being a boy, you don't understand the difficulties. it is hard. cos they get in the way, and they look really unflattering when they stick up out of a headband. and since i have a cowlick, (shudders), they never do what would be nice. they're always flopping over in the wrong direction. and i kind of miss them. they hid my eyes quite nicely from my wierd old man, and hid my forehead which is quite gross from everyone else. yeah. jiminy crickets, i'm hungry. which means i have to go upstairs. crud.
