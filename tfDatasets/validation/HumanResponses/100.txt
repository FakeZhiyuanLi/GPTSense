got my license this morning i'm happy, i feel so independent-ish even though i think i'm gonna make my mom ride with me in van a bit more before i actually try to take it out by myself. but still. and my license picture isn't too bad, i look like an elf! lol. gotta go drive myself (!) to hobby lobby!
