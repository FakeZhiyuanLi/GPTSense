your promises cause pain, i can't stand the pain, you send me dancing in the rain, yet your love i can't gain, always running with a chain, your treatment is insane, in pain i rarely complain, do i only serve to entertain, always drinking champagne, i must get away from the pain, as this relationship was all in vain. the end.
