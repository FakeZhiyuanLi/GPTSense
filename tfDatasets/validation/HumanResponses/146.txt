i got bak from camp i had a blasti dont think kira is the right girl for me i prayed and did a lot of soul searching at camp and realised i need to focus more on god than girls and that same night she rejected me  funny how god always works out things yar i feel as a heavy burden has been lifted and praise god when in the mountain or in the valley or even in complete peace
