well, trevor and i went on his jet ski yesterday and it was a blast. it was so wavy and windy, it was crazy. we'd whip around hitting whitecaps everywhere. only problem was that we got a little bit of water mixed in with the gas. so it died in the middle of the lake. luckily, we were able to drift into madi's dock and her brother was able to tow us back. fun times
