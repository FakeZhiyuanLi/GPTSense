i found this sitting in my inbox when i checked my e-mail just now. it's lovely: i have attempted to "login" to the order site and am not able to. i attempted to create a password but it will not accept it. i used 8 characters with several numbers and 1 capital but it didn't accept it. i asked for my password to be sent to me, but an hour later it wasn't sent. what do i have to do? never before have i seen a statement about the frustrations of online ordering systems, so elegant that it borders on transforming into a zen koan. but here it is. "what do i have to do?" indeed.
