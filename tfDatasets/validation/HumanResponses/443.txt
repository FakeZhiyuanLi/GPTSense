i think everyone can write a book and publish it even though they are not famous, successful, or talented. not only special people, but also normal people can have great messages to deliver. i 'd like to prove this as a normal person so than i wish to encourage people to write their own stories which can make their life more meaningful and challengable. i think "life is learning experieances." this will be the title for my book. here are my life lessions, plans, and some notes which i've learned from experieances. thinking of the day when my book publish makes me so excited. i don't know how long it'll take however i totally believe that my dream, having my own book will come true.
