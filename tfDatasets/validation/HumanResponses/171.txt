today i received a phone call from the symphony office informing me that they wont tell me if i made the valley symphony orchestra until the 2nd audition is over. the weird thing about all this isâ€¦ today they send me a package that contained music for their upcoming concert. does that mean i made it? i really hope i get an opportunity to be apart of vso. i would learn so much.
