once again, i have neglected my web site. i was surprise to see bloggger.com new revamp. i like thier new templates and it’s user-friendly interface. let me just say, it was about time. anyway, enough kissing ass… so much has happened since i've last blogged. i accomplished my goals this past semester at utpa and i started setting new goals for this summer. i'm also excited summer has finally come. now i have time to practice my violin, work out, and save money for a new car and a small trip to houston with my girlfriend gloria.
