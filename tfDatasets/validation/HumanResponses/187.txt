am i the only one who was jolted to attention when the guy who was finally lighting the olympic torch turned around, and lit what looked exactly like the world's biggest joint? i couldn't believe it. i expected the camera to pull back and see tommy chong on the other end with a satisfied look on his face. how did this design get by the olympic officials? they can't be that naive. pretty damn funny. at least i've got my lasting memory of the 2004 games already.
