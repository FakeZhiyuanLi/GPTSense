whew! drill team is gonna be hot! i havent' made the team yet but im praying and i mean praying that im gonna make it cuz i realli dont think anyone understands how much i love to dance! it's just a feeling i get when i dance, and it's a great feeling and you just feel the music and let loose of all your worries and thoughts and stuff that stresses you out and just dance ur butt off! i love dancing to hip-hop and hindi or any kind of dance at all! the try-outs for drill team are tomorrow and im so nervous because you gotta go in alone in front of judges who you dont know and just dance! but im gonna do the best i can tomorrow cuz i wanna make it so badly, because dancing is the only thing im realli realli good at and i know that if i do make it (which hopefully i will) that i would work my butt off every single practice and that's a promise! i love the songs, i love everything about drill team! so basically it's like this.i love to dance!.
