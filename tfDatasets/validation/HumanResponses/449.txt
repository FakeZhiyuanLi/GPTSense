well, today is the day. at about high noon i will be under the knife, and i sort of can't wait for this thing to be over. i'd appreciate your thoughts/ prayers. i might be able to update/ talk online on a laptop, since i won't be able to sit for a week or two. i can't wait for that (note: read with sarcasm).
