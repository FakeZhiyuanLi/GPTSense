i'm so incredibly bored, the crazy russians i've been talking to have left, and now i'm all alone since no one txts back anymore. i would ask everyone if they had any problems but i wouldn't get an answer, i'm still trying to cure world hunger (and then telling no one mwahahahaha) i've helped fix many a problem but cant seem to fix my own. it's very annoying after a while, and slightly depressing. well i've talked long enough for now, any body reading must be feeling better by comparing there life to mine. byby bob
