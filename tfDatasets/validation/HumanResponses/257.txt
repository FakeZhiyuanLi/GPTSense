just went out and purchased mega millions lottery tickets. i assumed the drawings were on wednesdays and saturdays (like the regular ticket drawings) but, instead, mm drawings are held tuesdays and fridays. poop. anyway, if i win, that makes me officially rich and beautiful. i'll celebrate by buying every reader of this blog a bottle of your favorite sparkling beverage.** **overall odds of winning 1:43. you get the bottle only if i win more than $100,000.
