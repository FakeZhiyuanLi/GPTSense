why did they have to come home? i mean, really, besides the fact that they both have jobs and that they have a house here, why couldn't they just stay down there and be miserable without inflicting it on us? i just don't get it at all. you know, i usually plot my day around, "how much time will i have to spend with them?" if i go upstairs now, i know i'm going to have to spend at least an hour with them, and hear absolutely everything about az at least twice. then they'll get pissed at me when i tell them that i won't go out to eat with them they really are too much.
