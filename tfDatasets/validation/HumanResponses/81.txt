i dropped a raisin on the ground, and i couldn't find it. it's like it disappeared into the crazy patterned carpet vortex under my cube but i did find a dried cranberry, aka "craisin" (who comes up with this stuff?). it looked like it was there for a while though, cause it was all mashed into the carpet like i ran over it with my chair a bazillion times. of course i started picking at it, but it wouldn't come out. it was gross, but kinda cool. i have weird things in my cube
