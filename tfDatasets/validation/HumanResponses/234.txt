well, today was an awesome day. at first my coach wasn't going to let me wrestle for a varsity spot, but then toay he told me that he was going to let me. so, i wrestled this other 160 pounder and i pinned. so, now i get to be the 160 pound varsity wrestler. that was the highlight of my day. it may not seem that exciting, but it is to me! well that is all for today. see ya.
