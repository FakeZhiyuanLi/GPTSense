       This is going to be my last post before I leave for vacation!  Kentucky, here I come! ^^  I've spent almost all day today packing and cleaning up the house XD  I got my shorts, t-shirts, tanktops, shorts, underwear/bra's, and socks packed.  I need to still pack pants and the remainder of the clothes I need, and the stuff to keep me entertained on the 2 day car ride there ^_^  I've got 4 books (Dude, Where's My Country? ~Micheal Moore~, Stupid White Men ~Micheal Moore~, Uncle Tom's Cabin ~Harriet Beech Stow~, and Oliver Twist ~Charles Dickens~), Gameboy Advance, Notebook (I plan to write almost constantly!! I love to write and going on a long trip is perfect for it ^_^),  Camera (taking tons and tons of photos!!)  But, I know this was a short post, but when I get back from Kentucky, the posts are gonna be looooong!!!  XD

        No words can express my utter exaughstion.&nbsp; All day yesterday, we scrubbed the house from wall to wall, head to toe, one end to the other.&nbsp; The appraiser  came today, so all yesterday was stressful.&nbsp; We scrubbed the walls, the floors, vacuumed all the carpets and furniture, bleached litterboxes and the ferret cage, dusted everything, washed like 2-3 loads of dishes, 7-8 loads of laundry, cleaned all the bedrooms, and a whole lot more.&nbsp; I slept like a freakin' rock.&nbsp; It was so exaughsting. Then today the apprasier came (FINALLY).&nbsp; It took him like...2 mins to appraise the house -.-&nbsp; AND THEN we found out that we can go to Kentucky! YAAAY!!!&nbsp; I can't wait!&nbsp; I think the funnest part of the entire trip is the way down there ^_^&nbsp; I love driving through all the states looking at my surroundings and scribbling interesting things in my journal (Yes, I'm a writing sorta person).&nbsp; I can't wait!! Eeeee! lol ^_^&nbsp; Gotta run!&nbsp;

       I am so happy!!!! I told my mother I was Bisexual ^_^&nbsp; I did it casually XD&nbsp; Like I was saying previously, my best friend Katie doesn't like gays or lesbians or bi's, so I brought that up first, and I said, "I don't see why Katie doesn't like lesbians or gays!&nbsp; I would date a chick, so I guess I'm Bi or something, and what if I moved in with Katie when I turn 18, and brought home my girlfriend!?&nbsp; What would she do then?!"&nbsp;&nbsp;And my mom was like, "Yeah, I don't see why she'd be so upset!"&nbsp; I feel sooo much better now that she knows!&nbsp; It's like a huge weight off my shoulders!&nbsp; Now I have to tell 3 people.&nbsp; My father (gonna have to tell him sloooowly, cause I don't know how he'd react), my best friend Katie, and my elder sister, Sam ^_^&nbsp; I know Sam would support me in any decision I make, cause she wuvs me!! XD&nbsp; So does my father, so if I tell him slow and don't just tell him at breakfast, "Hey Dad!&nbsp; I'm Bi!" then he'll get used to the idea.&nbsp; Katie is the one I'm worried about. I love her like a sister, and I'm afraid that she's gonna lose it, but I guess I don't have a choice. I'd rather tell her now, right before I go to Kentucky, so she has 2 weeks to think about it while I'm gone, and then when I get back, maybe her mind will have changed about it.&nbsp; I guess if I'm patient and wait, good things will come ^_^&nbsp; But then again, there's always the chance that nothing will have changed and she'll still not like gays/lesbians/bi's.&nbsp; But I know if she's truly my friend, then she'll accept me sooner or later, and if not, then I move on and find friends who  can  accept me for who I am.&nbsp; I would just rather her adapt, cause I want her to be my friend :P&nbsp; Ah well, alas, if life deals you a crappy hand, throw the cards away and get a beer! XD&nbsp;

       I've had a stressful day >. still  angry about it.&nbsp; I know it sounds horrible vain and stupid, but I can't help it.&nbsp; I hate that girl so much and then to find out my best friend hangs out with her?&nbsp; I was like, O.O&nbsp; I guess it does sound selfish and stuff, but I don't want my best friend hanging out with her!&nbsp; I guess I'm afraid that if she spends too much time around her, then she'll change to be more like my enemy -.-&nbsp; I guess that's an irrational fear, but it's true.&nbsp; I guess I should just let it go, but I can't >.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

       I'm debating on a huge decision, and it's tearing me apart.&nbsp; I think I might be Bisexual and I don't know if I should tell my parents.&nbsp; They love me and would probably be comfortable with it, but I can never be sure.&nbsp; I don't want to upset them, but&nbsp;I don't want to hide it forever.&nbsp; I hate hiding it, like it's some horrible secret, when really, it's not!&nbsp; It's a wonderful thing and I embrace it fully, but being only 13, I assume my parents would just say, "You're too young to know what you are!".&nbsp; I love them and they love me but I still don't know how to break it to them.&nbsp; I don't know if they'd be happy, disappointed, or be like, "Oh...ok!&nbsp; Whatever makes you happy!"&nbsp; I think they would probably say whatever makes me happy, but there's always that slim chance that they'll be disappointed in me.&nbsp; I love them sooo much and I don't want to hurt them.&nbsp; All my friends know, and they don't care, but with my parents, it's different...>. .

       I'm watching the Sci-Fi documentary, "The Buried Secret of M.Night Shamylan."&nbsp; It started out as a "normal documentary" and ended up being more like the Blair Witch or rather one of M. Night's movies!&nbsp;They've got a specific set of approved questions to ask, certain places to be, things to say, and they CANNOT AT ANY TIME make eye contact with M. Night.&nbsp;Everything was so strict, you'd think the Sci-Fi crew was interviewing the president!&nbsp; Then, later on, M. Night and the crew go out and eat some dinner, go to a bar, etc. and all of a sudden M.Night is this happy, perky, social butterfly talking and letting people take his photos.&nbsp; He went from sheltered recluse, to Mr. Popular.&nbsp; It was like he was a different person!&nbsp; Even Johnny Depp (oooo teeheehee *-drooling-*) was involved.&nbsp; He wanted to play a part in the movie, "Signs", but they were going to make him sign a contract saying that he couldn't say a word of anything that went on there. That was a little freaky, but THEN he had all these quotes and stuff, and it all got really weird, so he said Forget it, and Mel Gibson (hahahahaha he's a dope XD) took the part instead.&nbsp; I was like, "Woah, even Johnny Depp got involved with this!"&nbsp; But I was glad he didn't take the "Signs" part cause I thought that movie sorta sucked....it was ok though, not the greatest.&nbsp; Supposedly, M.Night "died" from drowning.&nbsp; A deer fell through the ice in a river, and M. Night walked out to save it, fell through the ice, and "drowned".&nbsp; His mother then cradled him in her arms and walked into the river, drowning herself as well, as Sci-Fi put it, "Bringing him to his maker in person".&nbsp; So supposedly, M. Night isn't even alive!&nbsp; I think that's a crock, but I don't deny he might have "connections" with spirits or ghosts as some people describe them.&nbsp; I  do  believe in spirits and such, and it  is  possible he might have some connections with them.&nbsp; I guess you never know! ^_^   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        This is my first blog post, so bear with me.&nbsp; I thought it would be a neat idea to start a blog, cause I'm always losing my journals!&nbsp;  I figured it wasn't exactly easy to lose a website :P&nbsp; Anyways, I'll probably be posting in this one a lot.     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just yesterday, my family and I decided to storm chase (yeah, I know, we're crazy).&nbsp; But we always enjoy it.&nbsp; This one was a bit more..."intense".&nbsp; We started driving along behind the squall line to stay outta the real thick stuff.&nbsp; Well, we pulled over to watch the storm going on, and all of a sudden, we start seeing tornado tails dropping from the clouds!!!&nbsp; We started driving again (yeah, like I said, we're crazy, but we wanted to see more of the storm). So we continued driving along, and all of a sudden, the rain started real thick, and we couldn't see anything so we pulled over.&nbsp; That's when things got REEEALLY bad.&nbsp; We saw the wind change direction and then we felt the wind slam against the car.&nbsp; WE GOT CAUGHT IN&nbsp;PART OF A TORNADO!!!&nbsp; It was amazing!&nbsp; Everything seemed to go in slow motion.&nbsp; My heart was beating fast, but felt slow.&nbsp;Everything was white because the hail (ranging from&nbsp;golfball size, to baseball size, to 3 baseballs stuck together size), and and&nbsp;rain was so thick. &nbsp;My sister reached over and grabbed my arm and said, "Risa...are we still on the ground?"&nbsp; I leaned up and nodded saying, "I can still see the road."&nbsp; Then Dad sped down the road away from the tornado and we started driving down a different road.&nbsp; Then I looked out my window and pointed, saying, "Mom...mom..MOM!"&nbsp;cause she wasn't listening.&nbsp; She said, "what?!"&nbsp; I was like, "LOOK!" and we saw another tornado coming down.&nbsp; Mom shouted, "DRIVE!" We drove and drove through the pounding rain and hail until we reached Thompson, where my grandmother lives.&nbsp; We took shelter there until we were sure it was safe to return to home.&nbsp; It was sooo surreal that moment we were caught at the edge of the tornado.&nbsp; It was like something from a movie that you'd never think could happen in real life.&nbsp; It was AWESOME! ^_^

       I've returned from Kentucky and I'm so happy to be home!!  I love Kentucky, and love  being  in Kentucky, but I missed all my cats and my dog and snake and ferrets!  If I could bring them with me to Kentucky, it'd be PERFECT but I don't think they'd like a two day car ride!  I barely survived it (had my younger sister in the car....she can be rather pest-like sometimes).  I'm not going to attempt to tell everything that went on in Kentucky in here yet, but as soon as I find my Kentucky Journal, I'll put it on here ^_^
