         Ashley likes to call people when: -she's peeing -she's pooping -she's sneezing -she's farting  -she's coughing -she's brushing her teeth -she's eating cereal (or let's just say anything in general) -she's singing -she's busy -she's already talking to you on MSN. -she's on the computer -she's dancing -she's jumping -she's outside -she's making dee-doop-bee-bong-ding-dang and then say "haha your writing about me aren't you?"  ASHLEY! how can you expect me not to?!?    Top three things Ashley is famous for:  -Tapping your arm/shoulder to get your attention and then giving you the gesture to wait a minute  -Burping  -never NoT having anything to say.     Hahaha but I luv you anyways :)

      Don't you hate it when people think they can just talk to you about their problems like u really give a fuck what they have on their minds? And they just keep talking and talking and then you finally snap because your so sick and tired of hearing their sob stories. But when you do they say that you don't understand and get all offended. I hate that. They ask for your opinion or say "I don't know what to do" and then you tell them and they freak. - Like get over it. We don't care. Go hang urself please. - If u chose not to hang yourself, then please refrain from telling me your problems. There are obviously more people in the world who have worse problems than you. YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY FUCKED UP PERSON IN THE WORLD. If you think you have the worst problems ever then just go away. cry alone because no one cares. Thanx...  -Asher

        Okay, I'm sure alot of people have met a few of these kinds of people. The people that are really special to you, you hold them close to you, so close like to the point where you get the opportunity to strangle them. People like this I love them to no end.  A "friend" of mine, well it is a very special human being.  It loves it'self; it doesn't care about anyone but it'self; you can tell it your problems but in a matter of 30 seconds, it returns the conversation back to being about it'self and nothing else; it thinks no one is better than it; it thinks it is full of problems and it wants to die, but instead continues to seek attention in telling lies about how it's life is so terrible; it doesn't listen to your advice it just rebuts it with saying it is scared; it has panic attacks over thinking about things; it refuses to take a look around and look deeper into anyone elses' life, just it'self. And concluding, it is very obsessive to a point where it becomes a disorder to the point where it needs rehabilitation. Oh and one last thing, it really thinks you care about what it has to say.   Truthfully said in my mind, I don't care about your emotional self-centerd problems, they only pertain to your own little self centerd self. You become emotionally attached to people who highly dislike you. You constantly tell people you cry all the time and that you need help BUT you don't listen to advice, don't let people help you. and can't take medication and your scared of hospitals, therefore your scared of help. (how can that be?- you should ask yourself sometime) You constantly say you have problems but you don't listen, therefore if you don't listen then people are either:  A) not going to help you.  B) won't even listen to you or  C) just ignore you like you don't even exist.   Choose wisely.  I know everyones starting to choose all the above. So you should: A) Blow up your self centerd world and look around B) Just sit there C) Keep complaining...  *sings* some of these answers, are just like the others...  Choose wisely again! :)        -amanda
