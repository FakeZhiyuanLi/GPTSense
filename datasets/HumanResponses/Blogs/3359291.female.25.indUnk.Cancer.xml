      Hey, me again, so yeah, another weekend come and gone, and I did absolutely nothing that would interest anybody, Friday night, was in bed by midnight, Saturday night was in bed by eleven, how pathetic is that?  Don't answer that question, completely hypothetical, anyways, the only fun thing I did this weekend was another of my bartending courses, man, it's so much fun, I love it, I can't wait until my next class, there was this girl in my class that said I was the best one, I think maybe I'm a natural at this or something, hum, me a natural at making and serving drinks, I thought that I was more of a natural at ordering and drinking drinks, he he, I guess it's ok to have a few weekends where you can be a total loser and not do anything, besides, if I get a job as a bartender, I wont be spending too many weekends at home...on a differnt topic, 26 days until I go home, WOOO HOOO, I'm actually excited about going home, I get to spend my birthday with my family and friends, that's a plus, and I miss everyone tons, hey Grapeman, what are your guy's plans for Canada Day, you should make a trip down to Lethbridge, that would be a really good birthday treat for me, I would be so happy....ok, different topic now, how about those Flames, eh?  What a wicked game last night, man, I so hope the flames win it, Calgary needs this bad, I remember when they were talking about selling the Flames, wish I could be home right now to celebrate with everyone, but everyone here is really excited about the Flames too, don't worry, there is Flames fever here too, it's all anybody talks about, anyways, my hands are getting tired, so I will check in later when something interesting actually happens to me, ok, TTYL

      OH MY GOD, I went out last night with my friend Bert who is going to Europe for 2 months, so I had to party with him for one last time before he leaves, and I had written a midterm yesterday and needed to unwind, however, since I had to work at 8 in the morning I was expecting to be home early to go to sleep and be up for work, well next thing I know is it's 3 in the morning and I'm just getting on my way home, needless to say, I didn't get to sleep until 4am and I told myself that I would call in sick for work, in the entire time I have worked there I having called in sick once, anyways, I didn't call in sick and I was up at 8 and at work at nine, I couldn't afford not to go, but right now I feel like death warmed over, and I going to be hitting the hay extremely early tonight...on that note, TTYL

      Hey, so I mentioned that I had started my bartending course, and it was so much fun, I can't wait until my next class, I met some really cool people and bartending so much fun, I think that I would make a really good bartender, my teacher says I'm a natural...also we got to drink whatever we made...that was fun too...anyways, I'll report more later.

      So here I am, up early again, I went to bed at 11:00pm on a Saturday night so that I could get up early on Sunday and be at the gym by nine, so I'm up at eight and out the door and off to the gym, however, I was unaware that my gym does not open until 9 on Sunday mornings, I never go to the gym that early, anyways, so I turn around come home, drop my stuff and head to Tim Hortons for a coffee and now here I sit, drinking my coffee and writing this down, anyways, your probably wondering why I am up so early to go to the gym, I signed up to take a bartending course which starts today from 1-7pm and if I'm going to go to the gym at all on Sundays I have to go early, so for the next 4 weeks while I'm taking the course I'm not going to be going out on Saturday nights, so I can get enough rest for Sunday, the stupid gym is so important to me, I have to keep my hot bod and right now I'm working with a personal trainer to increase my muscle mass, and holy crap, you should see my arms and legs, their getting so toned I currently have more muscle on my arms than my dad, there is something not right with that, anyways, I gotta go, it's time to leave again.

      I can't believe the Flames made it to the stanley cup finals, how longs has it been since they were last there?  I so wish I was in Alberta right now, if the Flames win the Stanley Cup, it's going to be crazy in Calgary, it's probably already crazy in Calgary...what's it like right now Stace?  This is exciting, I've been watching the playoffs, there is this place here called the Peel Pub where all the students go to drink and I'm going to watch the Stanley Cup finals there and find some of my fellow Albertans and party my ass off....WOOOO HOOOOO

      So I've been listening to the news on the radio today, and they are talking about what is going on in the Gaza Strip with the Isrealis and the Palestinians, boy am I pissed off...I can't believe what is happening, the Isreali army is fire bombing the Gaza Strip and using Helicopter strikes against the Palestinians...so far they have killed 10 people...all of them children and teenagers....what a disgusting mess, and the thing that really really pisses me off is that they are calling the operation, OPERATION RAINBOW....OPERATION RAINBOW???? are you fu@#ing kidding me?  What is this bullshit...I don't understand...urg...the world is going to hell in a hand basket...

      So I've been venturing out into the dating world, but so far nothing seems to be going my way.  And dating in a big city is so much more complicated than in a small town like Lethbridge.  There is this big delicate balance that has to be created when you first start out dating someone, I hate it, it sucks, cuz you have to make sure that you watch what you say or how you act because if you slip into your real self just a little bit the other person will either find your little quirks endearing or it will scare them off, but I'm sorry but I'm not going to pretend that I am anybody but myself...and if the other person doen't like it well f@#$ them.  The reason I say that dating in a big city is so much harder is for 1) it's so hard to meet someone 2) it's so easy to just move onto someone new cuz there are so many more fish out there 3) there are so many options...in a small town it's easier, there isn't as much crap and you take what you can get...I don't know...I'm just not going to bother with it anymore.

      Hey all,  This is my second attempt at posting a blog, I'm still relatively new to this, but here goes, there have been some things that have happened in my life over the last year or so, some good, most bad...jokes.  Anyho, my bestest friend in the whole wide world was just out here visiting me for two weeks, and it was awesome.  We did some clubbing, a whole lot of drinking and even played with a few  boys here and there.  I miss her, but I'll see her again in less than two months, cuz I'm going to be flying back home to visit at the end of June, so everyone be warned....I'm coming back.  I've been trying to keep myself busy, it's been easier these days, considering that the weather has been gorgeous for the last couple of weeks or so, Montreal is beautiful in the spring and summer, I've been attending McGill since January, I'm taking a Master Diploma in General Management.  That's been fun, I like being in school, I'm also, starting next sunday, going to be taking Bartending lessons, I hope to get a job as a bartender cuz I need to make some extra moola.  That pretty much covers that area. Now, I know that you all are curious about my love life.  This has been the most interesting part about my life since I've been here.  I was dating a guy for about 6 months, we started seeing each other right after I got back last summer, oh, did I mention he was 38...what  a nightmare, I have told myself that I am not dating anybody older than 35, he as so boring...I don't know what I was thinking.  I then started seeing this other guy that I met at school, he was nice and everything, but  I never got to see him, so I ended things and he went psycho on me...he freaked out, so I had to block him from  all my emails and my Messenger, so lately I've been seeing this other guy, and he is real sweetheart.  Well, that's about it for now, there are alot of other things that I can drone on about but I'll save it for  future blogs.  TTYL

      Hey,  I hope everyone else is doing much better than I, man am I stressed out, I feel like crap, I haven't been sleeping well, I just have too many things going on, not that it's all bad, I'm just really anxious about stuff, the thing that's been really getting to me the most lately has been my job, I had a break down last week, I was sitting at my desk on the verge of tears...I can't take it anymore, the place is sucking the life right out of me, for those who don't know, I work for a small company that sells bookbinding equipment and supplies over the internet and phone all over the US and Canada, however, the place is run by a man who is in his 60s, who happens to be one of the dumbest people I have ever met, and he has a masters in business from Harvard (George Bush Jr. also graduated from Harvard, so that doesn't say much), anyways, I hate the fucking job, the environment is depressing and dirty and littered with junk and my bosses don't care about overhead or anything, and their annoying and my boss reeks of urine and shit on a daily basis, so I'm just finished, I'm counting down the days until vacation and then I plan to quit on August 1st, when I get back I only have to work there for 3 more weeks On another note, it's now 9 days until I'm home, I'm getting really excited, cuz I have a feeling it's gonna be fun, and I know my girl Ambie will make it fun, I miss her, I miss everybody, I'm not looking forward to actually going back to Lethbridge, but I'll be happy to see everyone again, there are some people I hope I don't see, but ya know, skeletons in the closet and stuff On a third note, I finished my bartending course and graduated, yay, I'm a certified bartender, so I'm gonna be the cause of a many hangovers....YAY :) I get to practice my skills tomorrow night, the school has a night for all the graduates to practice bartending for an entire night and you get to keep your tips, I hope I make alot of tips, cuz I need some extra cash for my trip...so I'll let you guys know how it goes....therefore....TTYL

      Hey all, so there is only 16 more days until I land in good ole Alberta again, I'm not sure exactly how to feel about it, I'm really excited but at the same time there are a few people that I'm not too keen on running into again, and you know, I'm sad that the Flames lost, so now I'm not as excited about going back, jokes.   I also finish up my bartending course this weekend, I'll let you all know how that goes.  Shit, I've been super busy but I can't figure out what I've been doing to be so busy, all I do is work all day, then either I have class or I go to the gym, and I have been getting out out a little more often now, but I don't see my house very much at all, so yeah, not much to report, so I'll TTYL

      Hey, so I'm gathering that most of you watched the game last night, and by all accounts Calgary should have won it, did you see that goal they made that everyone missed, I'm so F%$#ing pissed off by that, Calgary better win it tomorrow night, anyways, I went to another one of my bartending courses today, man I've had a busy F'n weekend, I'm so burnt right now, and it doesn't help that my Bartending teacher Colin thought that I was a light weight in drinking and had me down a glass of Jack Daniel's straight up, I mean a glass that holds 8oz, that's 12 shots of JD and I did it in one shot, everyone was amazed, Colin thought for sure that I would puke but I didn't I got drunk but I kept it down, he says he has never met a chick like me, I don't know what it is, but I hear that alot, anyways....GO FLAMES GO....TTYL

       Hey, I really don't think anybody is reading these but I'm gonna post anyways, so where was I, I was talking about my trip home, so my birthday, my family had a party for me and that was great and then I get back into Lethbridge and start drinking immediately, needless to say, I had puked and passed out before we even made it to the bar...he he, it was probably 6:00pm when I passed out, but once I was up again, the drinking commensed, my birthday was alright, didn't have to spend a dime which is the way it should be, got pretty hammered, it sucked though, cuz Amber and I had to be up at 7:00am the next morning for a 10 hour drive to Sask...that sucked, I slept the whole time...so now Ambie and I are in Sask for the weekend and that was alright, went to the one bar there and pulled a Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie thing, awesome....anyways, the rest of my trip was pretty boring after that...so there isn't anything cool to report...  So there has been a few developments since the last time I posted, so as you all know, I work at this really shitty job and actually had a breakdown a couple of days ago, I just broke down and balled my eyes out, I hate my job that much, anyways, so I made an effort to find another job and it's tough, especially here, cuz not only do I have to worry about not being qualified for a job but I have to worry about the whole language thing as well, I went in for an interview a couple of days ago to be a bartender and the woman actually got pissed off that I couldn't speak french very well...so if you guys don't already know, I really considering moving back to Alberta, don't get my wrong, I really love Montreal, but if it was somewhere else, it would be great but it's not it's just happens to be in Quebec, so my ultimate goal is to move to Vancouver, just like everyone else it seems, there is like this great exodus to Van, it's so weird, anyways, the moving thing is not definate yet, or written in stone but it's looking very possible, I have to figure some things out first, but anyways, I'll keep you all posted about that...also my love life is not going so well, I'm seeing this really amazing guy but I don't really get to spend alot of time with him, he told me he's taking time for himself since his last relationship, and that I have to wait for him until November, but hey, if he really thinks I'm worth it he wont wait until November to make things serious...so he's gonna be history I think, anyways, that's about all that's happening with me, so I'll TTYL

       Ok, so I promised you all some more info on my vacation, well the first thing I did when I got into Lethbridge was go straight to my bestfriend Amber's Place, the first thing she does is hugs me and then hands me a beer.  It was awesome, that first night we went to the Roadhouse, what a shit hole (compared to the Clubs here in Montreal) and I never realized how much of a hole Lethbridge was until I went back (WHAT A HOLE).  Anyways, I got pretty hammered that night, we walked to Humpty's after and I ran into PR10n there and he made fun of my orange pants I was wearing, they are awesome orange pants, anyways, got back to Ambers and crashed.  The next night we went to Blarney Stone and that is when I ran into most of the people I haven't seen for a long time, saw my friend Megan, saw Opie, saw Jeff, saw most of all, Fakir, that made me the most happy, I continue to convince that guy to move here...up hill battle, but I'll win some day...anyways, ok, so Monday guess where we went, you got it, Essies, this stupid little town is so pradictable, all there is to do is go drink your face off, it's so stupid...alright to I'd been in town for 3 days and I drank non stop, at least on Tuesday we decided to take it easy, mostly cuz there is nothing to do on Tuesdays, so Wednesday I went to Waterton with my family, that was awesome I miss the mountains, it was nice for a while, then it rained on us, and my mom had an acid reflux incident and had to go to the hospital in Cardston, other than that it was an alright day, I stayed out in Raymond at my moms place...Thursday, my B-Day...I'm gonna save that for it's own post, so I will inform you all about that later...TTYL

      Hey, so I got home yesterday from my vacation in Alberta, man, there is a lot to report on that, in fact two weeks worth, however, I'm not going to inform you about all of it in one shot, I think that I'll do it over a couple of blogs, I am really glad to be home, I had tons of fun and it was nice to see everybody again.  I'm still trying to recover from everything, man the trip out there was tough I was up at 6:30am and off to the airport, we flew to Toronto and had to wait 3 hours for our connection flight, then it was a really long flight to Calgary and then a long car ride to Lethbridge, but it was good as soon as I got in, the first thing was a big hug from my best friend Amber and then she hands me a beer, that was great, we went out that night, I ran into tons of people I hadn't seen for a long time, and most of them didn't recognize me at first, that was fantastic, I look way better than I did when I lived there, Montreal really agrees with me, anyways, got really hammered, that was only the first day, I actually did quite a bit while there...so I will inform you all later.  TTYL
