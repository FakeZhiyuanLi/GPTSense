      One thing that is becoming a common sight in New York City, my home town, is a group of right-wing Christians preaching hate that is rooted in their interpretation of the Bible. These are the men commonly referred to as "the Black Israelites," the most prominent groups being the 12 Tribes, and the Israelite Church of Universal Practical Knowledge (UPK). These men teach an absurd form of right-wing Christianity that comes off as the Black Nationalist version of the Christian Identity movement.   Their doctrine, at its most basic level, is a spin on the Bible, where the Israelites are the ancestors of modern day African and Latino Americans. These are the chosen people of God, and the other nations are cursed. The main enemy are the Edomites, whom these groups argue are the people today referred to as "white." This quick look into their various cults will show the idiocy behind these claims, and expose these alleged "prophets" as being men who are not at all acquainted with the text they claim to follow (i.e. the Bible).   The claim that the modern day so-called "white man" is Esau is derived from specific interpretions of Obadiah, and other books of the Bible, but rests most strongly on Genesis 25:25. This verse informs us that Esau was "red" at birth, and based on this, the Black Israelite groups conclude that Esau, one of the most hated characters of the Biblical folklore, is the progenitor of caucasians. "The 'white' man isn't really white" they scream. "He's red!" The blood shows through the skin, due to lack of melanin, and thus they have proven Esau was the first white man.   This is the crux of their argument, and like many of their claims, it exposes them as complete novices with regard to Hebrew and the Bible. Indeed, in Genesis 25:25, Esau is referred to as "red," and the word "red" was translated from is the following:      Of course, the 12 Tribers and the UPKers don't know Hebrew, so they don't know this. In fact, they try to down play their inability to speak the original language that their folklore was recorded in by claiming that modern Hebrew is really Yiddish; they have created their own dialect, "Lashawan Kadash," which is a play on the Hebrew "Lashon Kodesh" (Holy Tongue). Rather than referring to the Hebrew text, they rely solely on the King James translation of the Christian scriptures.   Regardless, these monolingual bible thumpers shoot themselves in the foot when they claim that Genesis 25:25 is proof that Esau was white. Elsewhere in their rhetoric, they go on to claim that the tribe of Judah of the Biblical folklore was made up of what are now referred to as "African Americans," or "black" people. Unfortunately, these men don't realize that one of the kings of Judah is also described in the same way that Esau is described in the aforementioned verse from Genesis.   As has already been stated, the Hebrew word that "red," in Genesis 25:25, was translated from is admonee. As any Rabbi will tell you, there is only one other person in the Bible that is described as being admonee (red, ruddy), and that is King David. I will now compare the Hebrew text of 1 Samuel 16:12, and Genesis 25:25.   Genesis 25:25     VaYetse harishon ADMONEE khulo, K'aderet se'ar, va'iqro sh'mo Esav.   "And the first came out RED [admonee], all over like a hairy garment; and they called his name Esau."   1 Samuel 16:12     Va'ishlach vaivi'ehu V'hu ADMONEE im-Y'feh einayim V'tov ro'ee Vayomer YHWH qum M'shachehu ki-zeh hu.   "And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was RUDDY [admonee], and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he."   Now, this proves, beyond a doubt, that the same word is used to describe both Esau and David. The 12tribers and the UPKers may attempt to erect a strawman by ridiculing my transliteration, insinuating that I used a "Yiddish pronunciation," but the text still tells the story. Even if they resort to their "Lashawan Kadash" dialect, both men are described with the same word (in this case, pronounced ahdamawanaya, rather than admonee). David is "ahdamawanaya", and Esau is "ahdamawanaya" as well. Both the 12tribers and the UPKers have tried to escape this fact by staying only with the KJV translation, saying that David was ruddy, and Esau red, and that these are two different descriptions (they claim "ruddy" means young). However, there is no escaping the Hebrew text.   With regard to "Lashawan Kadash," the Black Israelites have created their own dialect, where the only vowels are 'a' (as in "raw") or 'i' (as in "high"), the 'i' sound being derived from ayin, and all other letters taking the 'a' sound. This absurd "Lashawan Kadash" dialect actually hurts the Black Israelites when we consider the name "Adam," which in Hebrew is written the following way:      This word, devoid of its vowels, actually appears in the Hebrew text of the TaNaKh on several occasions meaning "red." In those instances, Hebrew speakers would pronounce it adom, or adum. However, in "Lashawan Kadash" there are no vowels (the pointed text is ignored), and those words have to be pronounced as adam. The first example would be the Hebrew text of Isaiah 63:2. I challenge the Black Israelites to refer to the Hebrew text of Isaiah 63:2, and tell me what word "red" is translated from (in Hebrew, it would be adom, but because of the particular spelling, where the vav is dropped, it is pronounced adam in "Lashawan Kadash"). Here is the Hebrew text:   Isaiah 63:2     One final example is in order to put this nonsense to rest. The Freethought Mecca would like to present the Hebrew text of Zechariah 1:8, which, on two occasions, mentions horses that are red. To help our non Hebrew speakers, we would like to show some of the words. The Hebrew word for horse is soos, and it is written as follows:      Now, on the second line of the text we will present, there will be the words al-soos adom, which means "on a red horse," and will look like the following:      Finally, towards the end of the verse, there is a part about red horses, or soosim adumim, which in Hebrew is written as follows:      That being said, we now present the Hebrew text of Zechariah 1:8, and we would like the Black Israelites to explain why adam is being used as the word for red.      Now again, UPKers and 12tribers will try and erect a strawman by ridiculing the transliteration of these words, erroneously accusing the Freethought Mecca of speaking Yiddish, and spewing nonsense about their "Lashawan Kadash" dialect. Regardless, in their dialect, "horse" would be sawas, and "on a red horse," from Zechariah 1:8, would have to be I-la sawas adam. This would mean that adam does in fact mean red, and would not run smoothly with their claim that "red" is a designation for white people. If Esau's redness means that he was white, then David must also be considered white as well. Any attempt to use a twisted interpretation of the KJV translation of Jeremiah 14:2 to argue otherwise, as many of these types do, would be nothing more than a duplicitous fallacy. If Esau was white, then Adam and David were as well too.     Personally, we consider the Bible to be nothing more than a self contradicting compilation of goat herder camp-fire stories. Regardless, it does not seem that race is ever mentioned in this compilation with regard to skin color. The 12tribers and UPKers may attempt to argue otherwise, but their claims are weak, and saturated with error. With regard to people being described as "red," or "ruddy" (admonee), Rashi, Mizrachi, and other Orthodox commentaries have noted that this has nothing to do with actual skin color, rather this is a reference to an aggressive, or even murderous nature.   It should be noted that we here at the Freethought Mecca are actually quite fond of heterodox Black Nationalist forms of Christianity and Islam (such as the Allah Team, and other five percent nation groups). Christianity and Islam are imperialist religions that have ravaged much of the world, including Africa. Indigenous African culture has essentially been destroyed, and the people have been, for the most part, assimilated. Groups like these are struggling to forge an identity within the confines of a psychological prison built with the bricks of Arabo-Judaic or Judeo-Hellenist mythology. We can appreciate this fact, but an error is still an error, ignorance is still ignorance, and hate is still hate.      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Black racist cult named after it's leader, Yahweh Ben Yahweh (Hebrew for ''God, son of God'') - formerly known as Hulon Mitchell Jr. (Other names for the group included Nation of Israel, Tribe of Judah, Temple of Love, and etcetera).   The Nation of Yahweh hate group bases much of its theology on its interpretation of the Bible. However, since its theology and practices are far outside those of historical, orthodox Christianity, the group is considered to be a cult of Christianity.    Miami's Yahweh Ben Yahweh cult, the most notorious sect of the Black Hebrew Israelites, was implicated in a reign of terror in the 1980s, and has now all but disappeared. But at its height, it controlled an $8 million empire of properties, including a Miami headquarters known as the ''Temple of Love'' and temples in 22 states. It left a track record of horrific violence, including the murders of 14 people.   Its doomsday leader, Oklahoma native Hulon Mitchell Jr. (known as Yahweh Ben Yahweh, Hebrew for ''God, son of God''), is in prison with six other sect members for conspiracy in connection with the murders. Mitchell ordered the slayings of black cult defectors to keep others in line, and the random murders of whites as part of an initiation to a secret ''Brotherhood'' within the temple. The killers, as proof of their deeds, often brought back severed heads and ears to Mitchell.  Rough Waters, 'Stream of Knowledge' Probed by Officials, Southern Poverty Law Center, Intelligence Report, Fall 1997.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Yahweh and 14 members of his Temple of Love church were indicted in 1990. Following a five-month trial in Fort Lauderdale before Senior U.S. District Judge Norman Roettger, Yahweh Ben Yahweh and six of his disciples were convicted of taking part in the racketeering conspiracy that featured 14 murders, two attempted murders, extortion and arson.  At trial, Yahweh was defended by now U.S. Rep. Alcee Hastings, D-Fort Lauderdale.  (...)  The case featured a string of sensational crimes in which victims were beheaded with machetes, shot, stabbed and beaten to death. In some cases, as proof of a kill, the ears of victims were sliced off and presented to Yahweh by the so-called ''death angels'' he dispatched.  ''Between April and October 1986, Yahweh sent his death angels into the Miami community on multiple occasions to kill white people randomly and to commit acts of retribution against blacks who interfered with the Yahweh's sales of products and collection of donations,'' according to a 1996 opinion by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upholding the convictions.  In May 1986, Yahweh's terror came to a predominately African-American neighborhood in Delray Beach when as many as 20 Yahwehs tossed Molotov cocktails through the windows of six homes. Two days earlier, local youths had beaten up several sect members who were preaching door-to-door.  ''Yahweh ordered the arsonists to stand in front of the residences and use their swords and machetes to murder anyone who tried to exit the burning homes,'' the appeals court ruling said.  Yahweh insisted on his innocence and has offered no apology.  Sect leader nears freedom, balks at parole rules, Daily Business Review, July 6, 2001   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   One group called P.E.E.S.S., based in Seguin, Texas, outside San Antonio, produces both a radio show and television show, The Universe of Yahweh, which plays Sunday evenings on the public access channel of at least one South Florida cable outlet. The group also operates the Yahweh Ben Yahweh web page, which argues that the jailed leader is the innocent victim of government persecution and, like Jesus Christ, was betrayed by a Judas follower -- star witness Robert Rozier, a former football player and confessed murderer of seven men, who cut a deal to testify. They did not return calls or e-mail inquiries. Yahweh family promotes its faith, Miami Herald, June 20, 1999   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Yahweh Ben Yahweh, which means "God the Son of God" in Hebrew, is a Black Israelite sect that believes blacks are the lost tribe of Israel and that true Jews and white people are devils.   Ben Yahweh, also known as Hulon Mitchell Jr., and six others were convicted in 1992 of conspiracy for ordering 14 killings of white people and resistant black disciples. Former NFL player, black supremacist charged with 1984 cult, CNN, Mar. 24, 1999   It should be noted that Yahweh Ben Yahweh was released from prison in September, 2001. In addition, the group claims to no longer hate whites:    His followers and family said he and his organization no longer hate whites.   Yahweh Ben Yahweh's daughter, Venita Mitchell, 44, the second-oldest of his four adult children (three women and one man), said her belief that "we are all children of God" -- whites and blacks -- is the current belief of all Yahwehs.  Yahweh cult leader out of prison, finds North Dade home, Miami Herald, Sep. 26, 2001   That said, observers note the group's new focus:    At their Montreal conference last week, attended by about 600 Yahwehs in characteristic white robes and turbans, there was no promise to either die, or kill for Yahweh.   Yet, more than ever before, most Yahwehs cast themselves as a nation of believers at war with nonbelievers, and the old message of self-esteem has been crowded out by one that elevates their leader to ''Grand Master of All, the God of the Universe, the Grand Potentate, the Everlasting Father and the persecuted Messiah.'' The new message also is more stridently jingoistic, including a ''Pledge of Allegiance'' to Yahweh Ben Yahweh.   ''What's different now is that the U.S. is not just a corrupt society in their eyes, it's one that the global nation of Yahwehs is ready to take on. We have become the Infidel,'' said Richard Scruggs, former Yahweh federal prosecutor.   Yet Wendelyn Rush, a Yahweh member and attorney, cautions against demonizing their mission: ''It's not a violent war, it's a war of words,'' she said at an August federal hearing to decide on Yahweh Ben Yahweh's parole restrictions. Followers of Yahweh reemerge in Canada, Miami Herald, Oct. 15, 2001    Background  This background information is part of an Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals report on the appeal of several Nation of Yahweh leaders against their conviction on RICO conspiracy charges:    In 1979, Yahweh and Gaines moved to Miami, Florida, and laid the foundations for a religious cult later to be known as the "Yahwehs" or "Black Hebrew Israelites." Yahweh taught that blacks are the true Jews, that God and Jesus are black, and that he had been chosen by "the Terrible Black God, Yahweh" to lead blacks from years of oppression to the promised land of Israel.  Yahweh's followers were required to give up their legal or slave names and to adopt Hebrew names, all of which had a last name of Israel. Societal norms were discarded as Yahweh established his own laws, which were purportedly based upon the Bible. Yahweh's followers grew, and by late 1980, he had the financial means to buy a building in Miami known as the "Temple of Love." Many of Yahweh's followers chose to be full- time workers who were required to give all of their possessions to the Temple. Businesses were established inside the Temple, including a printery, a grocery store, and a beauty salon.  Between late 1981 and 1982, Yahweh instituted profound changes in the administration of the Yahweh religion. First, Yahweh announced that he was the son of God and renamed himself Yahweh Ben Yahweh (God, the son of God). He encouraged his followers to break from the "immoral world" and to give up their outside jobs and move into the Temple. Clothing changed from street clothes to African apparel and then to white robes and turbans. Yahweh taught his followers to avoid their birth families, because they were not "true" families.  When Yahweh's followers moved into the Temple, families were often separated. Tight security was established at the Temple; all who entered were searched. Yahweh established a trusted group of male bodyguards called the "Circle of Ten" who protected Yahweh and stood guard at all Temple entrances with 5 to 6 foot wooden staffs, swords, or machetes. Yahweh taught that uninvited entrants to the Circle would lose their lives.  Gaines became Yahweh's companion and "right hand man." Among her duties, Gaines collected money and possessions from full- time workers and handled the Temple's finances. Gaines had special privileges, including a bodyguard. Yahweh sought to spread his influence nationally by sending out specially trained and trusted elders to establish satellite temples, distribute Yahweh literature, and spread the "word." Between 1982 and 1985, temples were established by a group of 40 or so elders in several large metropolitan areas in the United States.  Between 1981 and 1984, Yahweh's power and influence grew, as did the Temple's finances. Yahweh demanded total loyalty and almost total control of the members' lives, which he achieved by "teaching against" members who disagreed with or failed to follow his spiritual teachings. Yahweh forced dissidents to stand at meetings and openly face his ridicule. He directed cult members to administer severe beatings to those who violated his rules. Followers feared for their lives if they did something wrong, spoke out against Yahweh, or left the Temple. In an effort to totally control his followers, Yahweh carefully regulated their food, sleep, and medical care. All members were required to work long hours to further the Temple's financial interests. Although Yahweh preached brotherly love, he also directed members to commit murder. Yahweh required that his followers publicly state that they would die and kill for God Yahweh, two requirements that he routinely propounded in teaching sessions, during which the members literally shouted in unison their willingness to do so.  As Yahweh's power and influence continued to grow, his teachings became black supremacist and violently racist. Yahweh prophesied war between the black and white races and called "white America" a country cursed by God Yahweh and harboring God's enemies. Yahweh taught that one day, his group would chase white men, whom he referred to as "white devils," from the face of the earth by killing them. Yahweh referred to God Yahweh as a "Terrible Black God" of war and violence and taught that death to his enemies would be at the hand of his "death angels."  At Yahweh's direction, many murders and attempted murders in the Miami area occurred. One of the most violent members of the group, Robert Rozier ("Rozier")[4], testified at trial that an ultra- secret group called the "Brotherhood" was established within the cult. This group was to perform any task that Yahweh directed, including murder. Yahweh conducted separate meetings for Brotherhood members, which were to be kept secret under penalty of death. Among those present at Brotherhood meetings were Rozier and defendants Grant, Pace, Beasley, Ingraham, Maurice, James, Yahweh, and sometimes Gaines. To become a member of the Brotherhood, one had to kill a white person and bring proof of the kill to Yahweh in the form of a head, an ear, or some other body part. Between April and October 1986, Yahweh sent his death angels into the Miami community on multiple occasions to kill white people randomly and to commit acts of retribution against blacks who interfered with the Yahwehs' sales of products and collection of donations. Yahweh also directed the killings of white people as retribution for 400 years of oppression and for specific acts of alleged police brutality against blacks occurring at the time.  At the trial of this case, Yahweh took the stand and testified in his own behalf. Additionally, Ingraham called Paul George ("George"), a historian, as an expert witness to testify that the Yahweh religion is a true religion.

      Black Hebrew Israelites FAQ (frequently asked questions) What is the religion’s origin?   In discussing the origins of this the Black Hebrews (from this point forward cited as B.H.I.s) I must explain that there are two distinct origins. The actual origin of B. H. I.s stretches back to before the Civil War. In 1896 there was a sect founded in Kansas by William Crowdy. Shortly after that, new congregations sprouted in several major cities, and by the 1980s other sects began to appear.    One sect is the infamous Miami based sect which was started by Yahweh Ben Yahweh, otherwise known by the authorities as Hulon Mitchell, Jr. This sect will be discussed in greater detail later in this article. Other sects include the Commandment Keepers, The Law Keepers, House of Judah, and the African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem (just to list a few). Ben Israel, originally named Ben Carter (from the south side of Chicago), started the latter sect, The Kingdom of Yahweh, around 1967.    Ben Israel impressed upon other blacks the belief that African-Americans descended from the biblical tribe of Judah. He led others to believe that because of this, Israel was the true land of their birthright. He is said to have received a vision in which the angel Gabriel revealed that the time had come for the biblical Israelites among the African-Americans to return to Israel (the promised land) and to establish the kingdom of God on earth. As a result about three hundred and fifty people from Chicago, along with Ben Israel, journeyed to Liberia, West Africa on their way to Israel. In 1969 they made it to Israel and set up what they believe to be the foundation for the kingdom of God.    Unfortunately, despite all the promotion of building the kingdom of God and “righteousness” the B. H. I.s members in Ben Israel’s sect were later engaged in criminal activity. In 1986, Ben Israel and his aide, Prince Asiel Ben Israel were convicted of trafficking stolen passports and securities and forging checks and saving bonds. While in Israel, Ben Israel’s community had a counterpart sect forming in the United States. This sect was being led by Yahweh Ben Yahweh and was called the Nation of Yahweh. Those who followed Yahweh Ben Yahweh viewed him as the Messiah.   Yahweh Ben Yahweh (Hulon Mitchell, Jr.) was born in Oklahoma, 1935. He founded N. O. Y. in 1979. He originally tried to base his teachings on twisting Christian doctrine. In recent years, the N. O. Y. was involved in a large amount of conflict with the people and government of Miami, Florida where it was founded. The N. O. Y. is an offshoot of the sect created by Ben Israel. Members of the N. O. Y. were convicted in 1990 of conspiring to commit RICO (Racketeering Influenced Corrupt Organization statute), and although they were not found guilty of the RICO charge, Yahweh was sentenced to serving an eighteen-year sentence for another crime. In conjunction with the negative view of this sect, Yahweh and his followers are referred to as a “killer cult,” notorious for their violent background.   There are many other branches of B. H. I.s that come from the perverted biblical beliefs and teaching of Ben Israel’s misunderstanding of the Holy Scriptures. In spite of many obvious errors in interpreting the bible, those who practice this religion in any form perceive their history to be exceptionally divine. They believe that the descendants of African American slaves (and the indigenous peoples of America) make up the twelve tribes of Israel. They also believe that their story began in Ur where Abraham was from and had an affinity with Elamite (a people who were the very first Semitic group mentioned in the Bible in Genesis 10:22). Elamites were a dark-skinned people with wooly hair, and based upon this, B. H. I.s assume that Abraham was black and that black people are the original people.   B. H. I.s believe that as a direct result of disobedience to the laws and the commandments of God the Hebrew Israelites were held captive by various nations. They also believe that in 70 C.E. remnants were driven from Jerusalem, by Romans, into various parts of the world, including Africa. They believe that blacks were enslaved and brought to America because of this and that this led to the remnants being spread abroad. This is the main part of their origin, as they perceive it to be.   What are the customs and practices of this religion?   A lot of the customs and practices of B. H. I.s have been handed down from generation to generation or were taken on during processes of “redemption” from the effects of slavery. B. H. I.s also try to live lives founded on the laws in the Pentateuch (the first five books of the Bible). They also attempt to live lives founded on not only the laws of righteousness in the Old Testament but also on customary laws such as: wearing only natural fabrics, maintenance of purification laws for women and the maintenance of a vegan diet void of all animal by-products. The ceremonies/celebrations of the Pentateuch that they ascribe to are: Passover, Shavout (Pentecost), Memorial Blowing of the Trumpets, Yom Kippur, and Succoth. Some also celebrate the Day of Atonement (www.israelite.net).    So, what exactly do they believe?   As I mentioned in the beginning of this article it is difficult to pinpoint one set of doctrinal beliefs for Black Hebrew Israelites. There are too many variations within the cult in regards to beliefs. Basically, there are a lot of sects and because of this the beliefs are all over the place. It is for this reason that I will choose to focus on the unbiblical teachings that totally contradict the essentials of the Christian faith. I chose to do this because this religion uses the Holy Bible (as does Christianity) to allegedly govern itself. The problem is that although it seems as if they believe the Bible, they do not practice, pursue, or promote what God has revealed through it. They take God’s word and add to it, take away from it, or misinterpret it. It is my hope that those who are confused about whether or not this religion is similar to or the same as Christianity will gain a clear understanding that the two are not the same and that the Black Hebrew Israelite religion, in essence, is a cult. It is a contradiction to what the Bible teaches and the essentials of the Christian faith. www.blackapolgetics.com

         Islam has taken root in many urban centers of the United States today and is spreading particularly among young urban African-American men suspicious of White society's promises that have seemed out of their reach. The current crisis did not begin overnight. Spawned by the church's neglect, the movement continued to offer its warnings to an inattentive church until reaching its present proportions. Islam Takes Root in the African-American Community Resentful of White Christians' hypocritical practice of racism and the Black church's unwillingness to overtly challenge it, heterodox Islamic sects such as the Moorish Science Temple arose in the early decades of this century. Although such groups diverged considerably from the Quranic Islam practiced in the Middle East, they provided a cultural bridge to it for their converts. In the 1930s, a white Turk named W. D. Fard began recruiting disciples for his heterodox Islamic sect; his most prominent disciple, who took the name Elijah Muhammad, claimed that Master Fard revealed that he was himself God and made other claims that would outrage most orthodox Muslims.[1] Elijah Muhammad declared that an evil genius, one Mr. Yacub, planned the creation of the white race by breeding the lightest of his 59,999 black followers on the island of Patmos, a process that produced a brown race after 200 years, a red race after 200 more, a yellow race after 200 more, and finally a race of "blonde, pale-skinned, cold-blue-eyed devils, savages, nude and shameless."[2] Malcolm X became the leading spokesman for Elijah Muhammad's cause until a rift between himself and Elijah Muhammad, strengthened by revelations of Elijah's extramarital affairs, led Malcolm to look elsewhere for truth. Not only Malcolm, but Elijah Muhammad's own son, Warith D. Muhammad, recognized the difference between the Nation of Islam and Sunni Islam, and moved toward the latter position. Although traditional Islam lacked a component of urban appeal that the Nation of Islam possessed - anti-white sentiment and a myth to honor it - it provided more integrity and a larger network of allies (and, perhaps of some relevance, financial support), and still functioned as a protest against the racial insensitivities of most U.S. churches. Louis Farrakhan led many of W.D. Muhammad's followers back to the more original views of the Nation of Islam, yet more African-Americans today probably seriously follow Sunni Islam, as represented by W. D. Muhammad and the later Malcolm. Most adherents now hold to Islam out of sincere conviction of its truth; dissatisfaction with other traditional religious options, however, remains a major initial force in commending this religion to inquirers. Charges Against Christianity Muslims have raised many objections to Christianity, for instance, the charge of its collusion with Western imperialism in Africa. Yet Islamic expansionism from the seventh century on was no less colonial than Western imperialism came to be, and Western colonialism finds far less support in Jesus' teaching than Islamic expansionism finds in the Quran. Ancient African kingdoms like the mighty Medieval kingdom of Songhay (which had Islamic influence) were destroyed by Muslim imperialists from the north.[3] Other African kingdoms like Nubia and Ethiopia were forced to stand against Islamic armies for centuries,[4] to defend the Christian minority in Egypt.[5] These were the nearest Christian kingdoms that many Muslims experienced,[6] except for the remnant of Christians in their own territories. North Africa was predominantly Christian long before Muhammad's birth. But one of the most prominent objections made by Black Muslims is that the Christian West participated in slave trade. Although we may question how genuine the Christianity of slave traders was, we cannot deny that professed Christians participated in slave trade. What we can question is whether Muslims are those best suited to raise this objection! Muhammad and his earliest followers did not shrink from the practice of slavery (quite in contrast to Jesus and the disciples);[7] but Muslim slavery, like most other kinds of slavery, was originally not racially based. After the revolt of the Mamelukes [white slaves] in Egypt, however, black slaves became the preferred commodity.[8] Arabs, Berbers, and Persians pioneered the long-distance slave trade,[9] and the Spanish and Portuguese originally purchased Black African slaves from Arab dealers.[10] The first Africans in the British colonies arrived before the Mayflower, and were temporarily indentured servants like many White colonists. In time, however, colonists found African servants easier to exploit than European ones (the latter could appeal to authorities in Europe or, escaping, blend into the local populations). Economic incentives also led to African-American slavery and its racist ideological justification.[11] Whereas Arabs introduced this exploitation, Europeans perfected it.[12] The Arabs had no tortures comparable to the long journeys across the Atlantic with slaves chained side by side for months in dark cargo holds. For every slave brought to the so-called New World, more Africans were brutally murdered in their capture or died en route multiplied millions of human beings raped, butchered, or reduced to the status of animals. In Defense of Christians Yet Christians provided resistance. William Wilberforce and the Clapham Sect, in fervor fueled by the Wesleyan Revival, pushed the abolitionist cause through the British Parliament, leading to the abolition of slavery in the British Empire.[13] The evangelical revival movement fueled the abolitionist cause in the United States as well, and abolitionist revivalists such as Charles Finney and the evangelicals at Oberlin College helped galvanize popular support for abolitionism; others, like the Tappans, defied their culture still more directly by demanding integration.[14] Black Christians in the north contributed still more to the abolitionist cause one may sample Frederick Douglass (an ordained A. M. E. Zion deacon), Sojourner Truth, and the great heroine of the underground railroad, Harriet Tubman.[15] Some Black Christians, in fact, practiced a resistance more vibrant than that of the Nation of Islam. Whatever else we may say of it, slave revolts were led by such figures as Nat Turner, a Baptist preacher; Denmark Vesey, with much A. M. E. support; Gabriel Prosser, envisioning himself as a new Samson; and the White visionary John Brown.[16] The Black minister David Walker called hypocritical White Christians "devils" in 1829, although (unlike the original Nation of Islam) he allowed for exceptions.[17] Islam provides no analogous abolitionist imperative. Just as Britain and France were finally working to shut down the Atlantic slave trade, it was picking up in East Africa, and most of the slaves were being sold to kingdoms in Arabia and the Persian Gulf.[18] The Arabian peninsula in 1962 became the world's final region to officially abolish slavery,[19] yet even afterward Saudi Arabia alone was estimated to contain a quarter of a million slaves.[20] As many as 20 million Pakistanis (mainly Christians and lower-caste Muslims) are now being held in bondage.[21] Arab Muslims in the northern Sudan have been systematically starving the Black African adherents of traditional African religions and Christians in the south;[22] raids have also been taking slaves, a practice Sudan had once abolished.[23] In the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, Arab-Berber Muslims from the north hold possibly over 100,000 Black African slaves from the south;[24] "aside from the shantytowns and a strip of land along the Senegal River, virtually all blacks are slaves and they are more than half the population."[25] One African-American writer specializing in African history thus laments the confusion of many US youth, who "are dropping their white western slave masters' names and adopting, not African, but their Arab and Berber slave masters' names!"[26] Indeed, because "the importation of Black slaves into Islamic lands" over 1200 years may have involved more slaves than the European slave trade did, some African writers have suggested that both the West and the Middle East should pay reparations to Africa.[27] Conclusion Islam has gained many of its converts in the African-American community by pointing to historic weaknesses in professed Christianity, such as Christian participation in the slave trade. While this charge, like most other charges, reflects a very selective reading of the historical evidence, these charges are rendered believable by the state of much of the church in North America. Can inner city Black youth believe a gospel that plainly teaches racial reconciliation when examples of it are nowhere to be found in the inner cities? Articles like this can provide an apologetic on paper, but the real apologetic will be far more costly. Until North American Christians learn to live the gospel of reconciliation they preach, paying any necessary price to bridge the gaps historically formed by White racism, Islam will continue to appear credible by contrast to a Christianity that is often indistinguishable from the rest of North American culture

      BLACK THEOLOGY, BLACK POWER, AND THE BLACK EXPERIENCE(Part Two in a Three-Part Series on Liberation Theology) by Ron Rhodes Between 1517 and 1840 it is estimated that twenty million blacks were captured in Africa, transported to America, and brutally enslaved. The experience of these blacks — and their descendants — serves as the backdrop for understanding contemporary black liberation theology. During slave trading days, blacks were crammed into ships like sardines into a can and brought across the Atlantic. Many died at sea from dysentery, smallpox, and other diseases. "Some starved themselves to death refusing to eat. To prevent this form of suicide, hot coals were applied to the lips to force the slaves to open their mouths to eat."1 Upon arriving on American shores, the slaves — men, women, and children — were forced to work from sunrise to sunset. Even old and ailing slaves were forced to work. The brutality shown to the slaves is among the saddest chapters in American history. Black theologian Anthony Evans tells us that "black women were raped at will by their masters at the threat of death while their husbands could only look on. Families were separated as they were bought and sold like cattle."2 For tax purposes, slaves were counted as property — like domestic animals. Eventually, however, a question arose as to how to count slaves in the nation's population. The Congress solved the problem by passing a bill that authorized the U.S. Census Bureau to count each slave as three-fifths of a person. This Congressional compromise resulted in what one Negro writer of the 1890s called "the 'Inferior Race Theory,' the placing of the Negro somewhere between the barnyard animals and human beings."3 THE CHRISTIANIZATION OF SLAVERY Initially, there was heated resistance to evangelizing among slaves. Black scholar C. Eric Lincoln tells us there were three principal reasons for this: "(1) the hearing of the gospel required time that could be economically productive; (2) slaves gathered together in a religious assembly might become conscious of their own strength and plot insurrections under cover of religious instruction; (3) there was an English tradition of long standing that once a slave became a Christian he could no longer be held a slave."4 In addition, many whites were repulsed at the suggestion that blacks could go to heaven. Morgan Godwyn, a graduate of Oxford University who served in churches in Virginia around 1665, wrote that slavemasters would commonly exclaim, "What, such as they? What, those black dogs be made Christians? What, shall they be like us?"5 Some whites tried to argue that blacks were less than human. Buckener H. Payne, in his book The Negro: What Is His Ethnological blacks are present with us today, they must have been in the ark. There were only eight souls saved in the ark, however, and they are fully accounted for by Noah's family. As one of the beasts in the ark, the black has no soul to be saved."6 So why try to evangelize them? Regardless of such preposterous arguments, missionary work eventually began among the slaves in the early 1700s and many of them became Christians. The brand of Christianity that was preached to them, however, was one that justified slavery. It was argued that Paul and other New Testament writers issued specific instructions for master-slave relations, thus apparently sanctioning the practice. Moreover, a curse of slavery was placed on the "sons of Ham" (Gen. 9:20-27) — who were interpreted to be blacks. Furthermore, slavery was considered a "religious good," for it amounted to importing unsaved heathens to a Christian land where they could hear the gospel and be saved. (However, though Paul gave instructions on master-slave relations, his underlying belief was that slaves should be freed [1 Cor. 7:21]. Moreover, a curse of slavery was placed only on Ham's son, Canaan — whose descendants later occupied Phoenicia and Palestine. They were Caucasians. As for slavery being a "religious good," this seems an absurd claim in view of the cruel, inhuman treatment shown to the slaves.) Most blacks accepted the slave brand of Christianity at face value. Moreover, white missionaries persuaded the blacks that life on earth was insignificant because "obedient servants of God could expect a reward in heaven after death."7 The white interpretation of Christianity effectively divested the slaves of any concern they might have had about their freedom in the present. As more blacks began attending white Christian churches, restrictions in seating, communion services, and property ownership caused many blacks to seek autonomy in their own congregations and ultimately, separate denominations. So, by the mid-1700s, black slaves had begun meeting in private to worship since authentic worship with whites was impossible. There is sufficient historical evidence to conclude that themes later developed by black liberation theologians were present in these early slave meetings in at least a nascent form. For example, God was interpreted by the slaves as a loving Father who would eventually deliver them from slavery just as He had delivered Israel from Egyptian bondage. Jesus was considered both a Savior and an elder brother who was a fellow sufferer. Heaven had a dual implication for black slaves. Yes, it referred to the future life, but it also came to refer to a state of liberation in the present. Because of the risk involved in preaching liberation, the slave learned how to sing liberation in the very presence of his master: "Swing low, sweet chariot (underground railroad — conestoga wagon) Coming for to carry me home (up North to freedom) Swing low (come close to where I am), Sweet chariot Coming for to carry me home. I looked over Jordan (Ohio River — border between North and South) And what did I see, Coming for to carry me home A band of angels (northern emancipators with the underground) coming after me. Coming for to carry me home."8 THE DEVELOPMENT OF BLACK LIBERATIONIST THOUGHT It was not long before slave theology gave rise to black activism. There are many important figures who contributed to the cause of black liberation throughout black history. We can only mention a few here. Nat Turner (1800-1831) was the most notorious slave preacher who ever lived on American soil. Turner's hatred of slavery propelled him to seek freedom by violence. Indeed, Turner killed nearly sixty white people before being captured and hanged in September, 1831. This violent revolt marked the beginning of the black struggle for liberation. Marcus Garvey (1887-1940) is regarded by many as "the apostle of black theology in the United States of America."9 Martin Luther King, Jr., said Garvey "was the first man on a mass scale and level to give millions of Negroes a sense of dignity and destiny, and make the Negro feel he is somebody."10 Garvey was one of the first to speak of seeing God through black "spectacles." Howard Thurman, in his book Jesus and the Disinherited (1949), saw black life paralleling Jesus' life because His poverty identified Him with the poor masses. Thurman also noted that Jesus was a member of a minority group (the Jews) in the midst of a larger and controlling dominant group (the Romans). Thurman thus drew many applications for the black experience from the life of Jesus. Martin Luther King, Jr. (1929-1968) was America's most visible civil rights leader from 1955 until his assassination in April, 1968 in Memphis, Tennessee. Though he cannot be called a formal participant in the black theology movement, he nevertheless roused the conscience of black America to passionate commitment to liberation. King was an advocate of Ghandian nonviolent social change. Through nonviolent suffering, King believed that "blacks would not only liberate themselves from the necessity of bitterness and the feeling of inferiority toward whites, but would also prick the conscience of whites and liberate them from a feeling of superiority."11 To some, King's assassination indicated that nonviolence as a means of liberation had failed and that perhaps a more revolutionary theology was needed. Albert Cleage was one of the more militant black writers of the 1960s. His claim to fame was The Black Messiah, a 1968 collection of sermons in which he set forth his brand of black nationalism. Cleage rejected the Pauline books in the New Testament. He said that — in contrast to the black Messiah — there was a spiritualized Jesus constructed by the apostle Paul who "never knew Jesus and who modified his teaching to conform to the pagan philosophers of the white gentiles....We, as black Christians suffering oppression in a white man's land, do not need the individualistic and other-worldly doctrines of Paul and the white man."12 THE EMERGENCE OF A FORMAL "BLACK THEOLOGY" Over one hundred and thirty years after Nat Turner was hanged, black theology emerged as a formal discipline. Beginning with the "black power" movement in 1966, black clergy in many major denominations began to reassess the relationship of the Christian church to the black community. Black caucuses developed in the Catholic, Presbyterian, and Episcopal churches. "The central thrust of these new groups was to redefine the meaning and role of the church and religion in the lives of black people. Out of this reexamination has come what some have called a 'Black Theology.'"13 For the first time in the history of black religious thought, black clergy (primarily educated, middle-class black clergy) and black theologians began to recognize the need for a completely new "starting point" in theology. They insisted that this starting point must be defined by people at the bottom and not the top of the socioeconomic ladder. So, black theologians began to re-read the Bible through the eyes of their slave grandparents and started to speak of God's solidarity with the oppressed of the earth. The most prolific and sophisticated writer of this new theological movement has been James Cone. No one has matched him either in terms of sheer volume of writing, or in terms of the challenge posed by his books. For this reason, we shall examine his theology in depth. James Cone: Theologian of Black Liberation In assessing the theology of James Cone, it is critical to recognize that he sees black experience as the fundamental starting point for ascertaining theological truth. And his own writings are a reflection of his own "black experience" — that is, the discrimination he suffered while growing up as a child in Bearden, Arkansas. What was it like in Bearden? "It meant attending 'separate but equal' schools, going to the balcony when attending a movie, and drinking water from a 'colored' fountain. It meant refusing to retaliate when called a nigger unless you were prepared to leave town at the precise moment of your rebellion. You had no name except for your first name of 'boy.'"14 Cone concedes that "my theological reflections are inseparable from the Bearden experience....What I write is urged out of my blood."15 Cone says that "it is this common experience among black people in America that Black Theology elevates as the supreme test of truth. To put it simply, Black Theology knows no authority more binding than the experience of oppression itself. This alone must be the ultimate authority in religious matters."16 From the above, one may immediately suspect that Cone has a deficient view of the authority of Scripture. Indeed, his view seems very close to the neo-orthodoxy of Karl Barth, as when Cone writes: "It is true that the Bible is not the revelation of God, only Christ is. But it is an indispensable witness to God's revelation."17 Moreover, "we should not conclude that the Bible is an infallible witness."18 Cone believes the meaning of Scripture is not to be found in the words of Scripture as such, but only in its power to point beyond itself to the reality of God's "revelation," which — in America — takes place experientially in God's liberating work among blacks. Black Theology and Black Power. Based on the preeminence of "black experience," Cone defines theology as "a rational study of the being of God in the world in light of the existential situation of an oppressed community, relating the forces of liberation to the essence of the gospel, which is Jesus Christ."19 Cone's theology asks (and seeks to answer) the question, "What does the Christian gospel have to say to powerless black men whose existence is threatened daily by the insidious tentacles of white power?"20 In answering this pivotal question, Cone emphasizes that there is a very close relationship between black theology and what has been termed "black power." Cone says that black power is a phrase that represents both black freedom and black self-determination "wherein black people no longer view themselves as without human dignity but as men, human beings with the ability to carve out their own destiny."21 Cone says black theology is the religious counterpart of black power. "Black Theology is the theological arm of Black Power, and Black Power is the political arm of Black Theology."22 And, "while Black Power focuses on the political, social, and economic condition of black people, Black Theology puts black identity in a theological context."23 We gain insights about what Cone means by "black theology" and "black power" by understanding what blackness means in his theology. Cone notes two aspects of blackness: the physiological and ontological. In the first sense, "black" indicates a physiological trait. It refers to "a particular black-skinned people in America."24 In the second sense, "black" and "white" relate not to skin pigmentation but to "one's attitude and action toward the liberation of the oppressed black people from white racism."25 Blackness is thus "an ontological symbol for all people who participate in the liberation of man from oppression."26 Seen in this light, "blackness" can be attributed to people who do not have black skin but who do work for liberation. By contrast, "whiteness" in Cone's thought symbolizes the ethnocentric activity of "madmen sick with their own self-concept" and thus blind to that which ails them and oppresses others. Whiteness symbolizes sickness and oppression. White theology is therefore viewed as a theological extension of that sickness and oppression.27 Having established that the black experience is the governing principle in Cone's interpretation of Scripture, it is important to understand how this governing principle has affected his views of specific doctrines. God. Cone bases much of his liberationist theology on God's deliverance of Israel from oppression under the Egyptians. He says that the consistent theme in Israelite prophecy is Yahweh's concern for "the lack of social, economic, and political justice for those who are poor and unwanted in the society."28 This same God, Cone argues, is working for the deliverance of oppressed blacks in twentieth-century America. Because God is helping oppressed blacks and has identified with them, God Himself is spoken of as "black." Black theology's dominant perspective on God is "God in action, delivering the oppressed because of His righteousness. He is to be seen, not in the transcendent way of Greek philosophy, but immanent, among His people."29 God is "immanent" in the sense that He is met in concrete historical situations of liberation. This is very similar to the idea of the immanence of God in process theology. Indeed, process theologian David Ray Griffin, while recognizing important differences between process and black theology, has suggested that "process philosophy supports liberation theologians in locating the reality of God's presence and creative activity in this world."30 Jesus Christ. Cone's intention is to stand in the Chalcedonian tradition in his understanding of Jesus Christ. The Chalcedonian creed (A.D. 451) affirmed that Christ is "truly God and truly man." Cone agrees with this, but adds that the role of Jesus as God-Incarnate was to liberate the oppressed: Jesus Christ "is God himself coming into the very depths of human existence for the sole purpose of striking off the chains of slavery, thereby freeing man from ungodly principalities and powers that hinder his relationship with God."31 One of the more controversial aspects of Cone's Christology is his view that Jesus was (is) black: "The 'raceless' American Christ has a light skin, wavy brown hair, and sometimes — wonder of wonders — blue eyes. For whites to find him with big lips and kinky hair is as offensive as it was for the Pharisees to find him partying with tax-collectors. But whether whites want to hear it or not, Christ is black, baby, with all of the features which are so detestable to white society" (emphasis in original).32 Cone believes it is very important for black people to view Jesus as black: "It's very important because you've got a lot of white images of Christ. In reality, Christ was not white, not European. That's important to the psychic and to the spiritual consciousness of black people who live in a ghetto and in a white society in which their lord and savior looks just like people who victimize them. God is whatever color God needs to be in order to let people know they're not nobodies, they're somebodies."33 For Cone, the Resurrection of the black Jesus — a real event — symbolizes universal freedom for all who are bound. It is not just a future-oriented hope in a heavenly compensation for earthly woes. Rather, it is a hope that focuses on the future in such a way that it prevents blacks from tolerating present inequities.34 This is closely related to Cone's understanding of eschatology (more on this shortly). Sin and Salvation. In Cone's view, sin is "a condition of human existence in which man denies the essence of God's liberating activity as revealed in Jesus Christ."35 In this view, sin is anything that is contrary to the oppressed community or its liberation. Salvation for Cone primarily has to do with earthly reality, not heavenly hopes. "To see the salvation of God is to see this people [i.e., the blacks] rise up against their oppressors, demanding that justice become a reality now and not tomorrow."36 Hence, though Cone often speaks of Jesus as the Liberator, in practical terms he emphasizes the human work of self-liberation among blacks and downplays divine help. The Church. Cone believes the black church has played an instrumental role in the religious and social life of black America. He says the black church was the creation of a black people "whose daily existence was an encounter with the overwhelming and brutalizing reality of white power. For the slaves it was the sole source of identity and the sense of community....The black church became the only sphere of black experience that was free of white power."37 Still, Cone believes that — since the days of slavery — the black church has largely capitulated to the demands of a white racist society. He argues that in order to survive, the black churches have given up their freedom and dignity. After the Civil War, black churches became passive in the struggle for civil rights and freedom while currying favors from the white establishment. This condition, Cone says, has persisted up to the present day, rendering the black church "the lifeless pawn of the status quo."38 Only faithfulness to the "pre-Civil War black church tradition" will issue in "an exclusive identification with black power," Cone believes. He says that a continued emphasis on black power is "the only hope of the black church in America."39 (Though "black power" as a movement faded after the 1960s, the primary emphasis of the movement — the dignity, freedom, and self-determination of black people — has continued in Cone's theological writings. It is this emphasis that Cone says has been missing in many black churches.) Eschatology. Cone rejects what he terms the "white lie" that Christianity is primarily concerned with life in the next world: "If eschatology means that one believes that God is totally uninvolved in the suffering of man because he is preparing them for another world, then black theology is not eschatological. Black theology has hope for this life."40 Cone asks what good there is in golden crowns, slippers, and white robes "if it means that we have to turn our backs on the pain and suffering of our own children? Unless the future can become present, thereby forcing us to make changes in this world, what significance could eschatology have for black people who believe that their self-determination must become a reality now?"41 Revolution and Violence. I would be remiss to close this discussion of James Cone without noting his views on revolution and violence. Cone defines liberation as the "emancipation of black people from white oppression by whatever means black people deem necessary."42 This definition would seem to allow for the use of violence. Cone does not advocate armed revolution against white society. But some violence, he says, seems unavoidable. He points out that "the Christian does not decide between violence and non-violence, evil and good. He decides between the lesser and the greater evil. He must ponder whether revolutionary violence is less or more deplorable than the violence perpetuated by the system."43 Injustice, slave labor, hunger, and exploitation are all violent forms that must be considered against the cost of revolutionary violence. LIBERATION THEOLOGY AND THE BLACK CHURCH We have seen that James Cone has developed a full theology based on a reading of Scripture through the eyeglasses of "blackness." The question is, How influential has black liberation theology been in the life of the black church in America? C. Eric Lincoln and Lawrence H. Mamiya have recently completed a ten-year statistical study of the black church in America. They've published their findings in a hefty volume entitled, The Black Church in the African American Experience (1990). Part of the Lincoln/Mamiya study dealt with black liberation theology: "In our urban questionnaire we asked the pastors of 1,531 urban churches, 'Have you been influenced by any of the authors and thinkers of black liberation theology?'"44 Responses to the urban questionnaire were quite revealing. Only 34.9 percent of urban black clergy said they had been influenced by black liberation theologians as opposed to 65.1 percent who said they had not. Little more than one-third of the black pastors interviewed claimed any influence from this movement! Lincoln and Mamiya discerned that age and education were among the most significant variables in determining clergy responses: Clergy who are forty and under claimed to be more strongly influenced by black liberation theology than those who are older. Education was also very strongly associated with knowledge of black liberation theology. Pastors with a high school and less educational background said that they were minimally influenced by liberation theology, while those with a college education have the most positive views of the movement. The majority of the less educated pastors have neither heard of the movement nor of the names of theologians associated with it. Among educated clergy familiar with the movement, James Cone has the highest name recognition.45 These differences are not that surprising, Lincoln and Mamiya say, since black liberation theology is a relatively recent intellectual movement "occurring largely among the educated elite of the black clergy."46 Another significant variable was found to be denominational affiliation. According to Lincoln and Mamiya, the black denominations with higher educational levels among their clergy — such as the African Methodist Episcopal Church — are the major proponents of liberation theology. "The fact that the Pentecostal ministers of the Church of God in Christ, which has the largest sector of lower-class members among the seven [major black] denominations, have been scarcely influenced by this theological perspective suggests some of the class limitations of this movement."47 This would seem to indicate that the formulators of black liberation theology have not been able to move beyond their middle-class origins, even though black liberationists have sought to do theology from the "bottom up" — that is, from the perspective of the oppressed in American society.48 Based on their nationwide field experience, Lincoln and Mamiya have observed that the majority of black clergy are educated as apprentices — learning "on the job" under the direction of senior clergy. What little academic education they receive is usually at the local Bible school level. Moreover, most of their reading is denominationally oriented. "It is this local level of clergy education," Lincoln and Mamiya suggest, "that the new black liberation theology has thus far failed to penetrate."49 Lincoln and Mamiya close with this warning: "Unless the movement of black liberation theology reaches beyond its present location in an intellectual elite and gives more attention...to a mass education of clergy and laity in the churches, the movement will continue to have minimal influence among its key constituencies."50 Lincoln and Mamiya are probably correct. However, the problems of black liberation theology go much deeper than a simple failure to reach the masses. This I shall make clear in what follows. A CRITIQUE It is difficult for a white person such as myself to critique black theology. As I write, I am mindful of James Cone's conviction that any criticism of black theology by a white theologian will be influenced by white racism and is thus invalid.51 To help disarm this objection, I will draw support for each of my points from one or more black theologians. I want to begin by affirming that black theology has made some important contributions. I will mention only four here. First, black theology has reminded us that theology — if it is going to meet the needs of twentieth century (and beyond) Christians — must find practical expression in society. Second, black theology has reminded us that God is involved with His people in real-life situations. Third, black theology has focused our attention on the need to reach out to others in the body of Christ who are suffering. And fourth, black theology serves as an indictment against the racist views that have been all-too-often (but not always) present among white people. These contributions are important and extremely relevant. Despite these contributions, however, there are some serious problems that must be addressed. As a preface to my criticisms, I want to draw attention to Part One of this series in which I criticized the hermeneutic of Latin American liberation theology. In that article, I pointed out that Latin American theologians have approached Scripture with a preunderstanding that has led them to interpret Scripture with a bias toward the poor. I emphasized that if we are to understand the biblical author's intended meaning, it is imperative that preunderstandings be in harmony with Scripture and subject to correction by it. This same point must be made with reference to black theology. However, since I will not repeat any material from Part One, I urge the reader to review my comments on preunderstandings in that article. "Blackness" and Scripture In my critique of black liberation theology, I will focus my attention on the particular preunderstanding which interprets Scripture through the eyeglasses of "blackness." More specifically, I shall address the question: Is it legitimate to make the black experience the fundamental criterion for interpreting Scripture? Certainly I do not wish to minimize the importance of the black experience. Nor do I want to come across as unsympathetic to the plight of African Americans in a white-dominated society. There can be little doubt that black liberation theologians have a legitimate gripe regarding the treatment of their people throughout American history. But imposing the black experience (or any other experience — including feminist, gay, anti-supernaturalist, New Age, mystic, etc.) onto Scripture robs Scripture of its intrinsic authority and distorts its intended meaning. Theologians who make black experience all-determinative have, in a way, made the same mistake some white racists did during the days of slavery — only in reverse. Just as some whites imposed their "experience" as slavemasters onto Scripture in order to justify slavery, so some blacks have imposed the "black experience" onto Scripture to justify their radical views on liberation. Both positions have erred. For blacks to use such an experience-oriented methodology is to condone the very kind of method used by those who enslaved them. In my thinking, this is self-defeating at best. Black theologian Anthony Evans directly challenges Cone's methodology by arguing that the black experience must be seen as "real but not revelatory, important but not inspired."52 Black writer Tom Skinner agrees and argues that "like any theology, black theology must have a frame of reference.... There are some black theologians who seek to make their frame of reference purely the black experience, but this assumes the black experience is absolutely moral and absolutely just, and that is not the case. There must be a moral frame of reference through which the black experience can be judged."53 That frame of reference must be Scripture. To produce a biblical liberation theology, Scripture — not the "black experience"— must be the supreme authority in matters of faith and practice. By following this approach, a strong biblical case can be constructed against racism — something I would think should be at the very heart of a biblical black theology. The unity of the human race, for example, is a consistent emphasis in Scripture — in terms of creation (Gen. 1:28), the sin problem (Rom. 3:23), God's love for all men (John 3:16), and the scope of salvation (Matt. 28:19). The apostle Paul emphasized mankind's unity in his sermon to the Athenians: "From one man he made every nation of men, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he determined the times set for them and the exact places where they should live" (Acts 17:26). Moreover, Revelation 5:9 tells us that God's redeemed will be from "every tribe and tongue and people and nation." Because of the unity of humanity, there is no place for racial discrimination — white, black, or otherwise — for all men are equal in God's sight. Transcending Culture In Part One, I criticized the hermeneutic of Latin American liberation theology for its inability to develop a culture-transcending theology. Black theology's hermeneutic — with its emphasis on the "black experience" — is open to the same criticism. A passage relevant to this is John 4 where we find Jesus confronting a Samaritan woman. Here Jesus deals with the relationship between truth and culture. The Jews considered the Samaritans an "unclean" mixed breed — with Israelite and Assyrian ancestry. Because of this, the Jews were harshly prejudiced against the Samaritans and discriminated against them. This cultural hostility led the Samaritan woman to ask Jesus: "'You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?' (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans)" (John 4:9). During the ensuing discussion, the woman asked Jesus about which cultural place of worship was valid: Mt. Gerizim where the Samaritans built their temple, or Jerusalem where the Jews built theirs. Anthony Evans alerts us to the significance of Jesus' response: "Jesus does not hesitate to let her know that once you bring God into the picture, the issue is no longer culture, but truth. He informs her that the question is not Mt. Gerizim or Jerusalem, that it is not according to Samaritan tradition or Jewish tradition (v. 21). In fact, He denounces her cultural heritage in relation to worship, for he told her, 'Ye worship ye know not what' (v. 22). When she began to impose her culture on sacred things, Christ invaded her cultural world to tell her she was spiritually ignorant."54 Jesus transcended the whole issue of culture in discussing spiritual issues with the woman. When it came to her relationship with God, the issue moved from her cultural heritage to her heart and the criteria for that relationship was truth. Jesus acknowledged cultural distinctions, but disallowed them when they interfered in any way with truth about God. A principle we can derive from this is: Culture must always take back seat to the truth of God as revealed in Scripture. What does this passage say to the relationship of Scripture to the black experience? Evans answers: "It says that we as black people cannot base our relationship with God, or our understanding of God, on our cultural heritage....Jesus is not asking blacks to become white or whites to become Jews, but he insists that all reflect God's truth as given in Scripture. Where culture does not infringe upon the Word of God, we are free to be what God created us to be, with all the uniqueness that accompanies our cultural heritage. However, the truth from Scripture places limits on our cultural experience."55 Reconciliation: The Better Way A biblical theology of liberation must include an emphasis on reconciliation among men, without which the theology ceases to be Christian (Eph. 2:14ff.). Black liberation theologian DeOtis Roberts (b. 1927), though committed to liberation, agrees with this and insists that black theology must speak of "reconciliation that brings black men together and of reconciliation that brings black and white men together."56 Roberts says "it is my belief that true freedom overcomes estrangement and heals the brokenness between peoples."57 However, Roberts argues, "reconciliation can take place only between equals. It cannot co-exist with a situation of Whites over Blacks."58 Roberts's point is well taken. Reconciliation and racism are birds of a different feather; they never fly together. Genuine reconciliation can come only if people — both black and white — commit to a scriptural view of their brothers of a different color, seeing all people as created in the image of God (Gen. 1:26) and of infinite value to God (1 Cor. 6:20; 1 Pet. 1:18). There is much more that needs to be said on this important issue, but space forbids. As the theological dialogue continues in coming years, I would like to suggest the following goal: Let us all — both black and white — seek to build a body of unified believers who are so committed to the Scriptures and to Christ that the name Christian becomes truly descriptive of who they are, and not the color of their skin.  urlLink www.blackapologetics.com

      .) What are the Nation of Gods and Earths (Five Percent?) The Five Percent began as an offshoot of the NOI (Nation of Islam) back in 1964 by Clarence 13X who was a minister in Mosque no. 7 under the tutelege of Malcolm X. The movement was started because Clarence 13X rejected the notion that Wallace Fard was God Incarnate (see  urlLink NOI ). He began teaching that the black man himself was god. Five Percenters also depart from NOI in their teaching of the  urlLink Supreme Alphabet  and  urlLink Supreme Mathematics , an arcane system devised by Clarence 13X wherein each letter or numeral denotes a concept with an accompanying parable. "A" stands for Allah, "B" is Be or Born, "C" is See and so on. This process is known as "dropping science". Supreme Mathematics - teaches that numbers 0-9 means: 1 - Knowledge2 - Wisdom3 - Understanding4 - Culture/Freedom5 - Power/Refinement6 - Equality7 - God8 - Build/Destroy9 - Born0 - Cipher 2.) Why do they call themselves members of the Nation of Gods and Earths or Five Percenters? Clarence 13X taught that eighty-five percent of the population is made up of ignorant, unlearned and uncivilized people who need to be led (mostly churchgoers). This eighty-five percent are believed to have no "knowledge of self". Ten percent of the population have some knowledge of self [i.e. the real truth], however, they use this knowledge to wield control over the eighty-five percent vs. "liberating" them [most baptist preachers, including Rev. Jesse Jackson are believed to be in this category]. Lastly, he considered the remaining five percent to be those who thought/believed like himself and his followers. The "poor, righteous teachers", the ones who do possess knowledge of themselves, their origins, and the way the world system really is -- and additionally, the way in which the new world order will come about. Their job/mission is to educate the eighty-five percent to what this hidden or veiled knowledge really is. [In the last few years, they have preferred to be called the Nation of Gods and Earths. The men are referred to as "gods" and the women are referred to as "earths"] - I have been informed recently by a member that Allah "The Father" , Clarence 13X, said that after 1967 they would no longer be known as the 5% Nation of Islam, but as Allah's Nation of Gods and Earths. 3.) How did this message spread? This message was delivered as a street rap that mesmerized New York City youth. They won converts by the hundreds. Today the group numbers in the tens of thousands in NYC alone. This message was also well-timed, as the 1960's were obviously a time of great struggle for blacks in America. This was a message [very similar to the black supremacist doctrines of the NOI] that made black youths feel superior in a world where they were viewed as wholly inferior. 4.) How popular is it? Well it is popular among many African-American male youth, especially in poor, urban areas. However, this thinking is also embraced by well off individuals. Its popularity is helped along by many R&amp;B/Hip-Hop artists. Erykah Badu, Nas, Common, Wu-Tang, Busta Rhymes, and countless others have their  urlLink lyrics  laced with 5% doctrine. In addition to using these beliefs in their music some rap artists like Rakim, Big Daddy Kane and Lakim Shabazz have used the 5% flag on their album covers. Their numbers are believed to be in the hundreds of thousands, however they personally claim many more members. The concentration of Five Percenters is believed to be the highest on the East Coast, not coincidentally to be the location of the birth of rap and hip hop music. The major cities that boast the largest African-American populations can be known to have a significant number of Five Percent adherents. These cities include: New York, New Jersey,  urlLink New Haven , Washington D.C.,  urlLink Chicago , Detroit, Philadelphia,  urlLink Cleveland , Baltimore and Atlanta (to name a few). This belief system has been embraced by some internationally as well. 5.) What are the requirements for membership? The requirements of "official" membership in the Five Percent are unclear. They do not have organized affiliation. A Five Percenter will frequently say that they simply came into knowledge of self, or better yet, the "fact" that the "Asiatic Black Man" is God... It is more a way of life and they would shun any reference to them being a "religion". They do refer to "knowledging 120" (120 refers to their lessons which are virtually identical to the  urlLink Supreme Wisdom  originated by Elijah Muhammed and W.D. Fard). This question of whether they have knowledged (mastered/understood) these lessons appears to be rather important because often you will hear them say: "I knowledged 120 in [plug year in here]". In many dialogues or "builds" among themselves, disagreements are usually met with challenges to a member's knowledge of 120. Suffice it to say that this step of absorbing the lessons likely separates the babies from the seasoned, and at the same time can expose a perpetrator. As indicated on a section of their homepage, they appear to really keep up with the rap artists level of  urlLink commitment  to their teachings, regardless of whether or not they pepper their lyrics with their lingo. There are also,  urlLink Parliaments and Schools  that the members attend, which are rallys/meeting places where lessons are distributed and members can listen to speakers and meet others. 6.) Do they have a holy book or some by-laws? NGE/Five Percent concepts are often circulated as lessons. They are made up of the following:  urlLink The Supreme Mathematics   urlLink The Supreme Alphabet  The Student Enrollment (1-10)* The Lost Found Muslim Lesson No.1 (1-14)* English Lesson C-1 (1-36)* The Lost Found Muslim Lesson No.2 (1-40)* The Actual Facts*  urlLink The Solar Facts *Lessons marked with an asterisk can be found here:  urlLink Supreme Wisdom . Additionally there is an emphasis on knowing the history of the Five Percent, having an understanding of the Nation's flag and being aware of Clarence 13X's legacy. Another lesson,  urlLink Teachings for the Civilized , is also of some interest. There is an underground  urlLink newspaper  that is offered by subscription only. I have also discovered a newsletter called The Black 7. You can download a pdf version of it  urlLink here.  (warning: potentially long download depending on your connection). The lessons and paper have a wide circulation in prisons, where the Five Percent have mounted a significant  urlLink outreach  campaign.  urlLink Underground books  are circulated as well. Common terminology that originated with the Five Percent: "Break it down", "droppin' science", "sup G [God]?", "word", "peace", "word is bond", and "represent".

      EFFECTIVE EVANGELISM Witnessing to the Nation of Islam by Jerry L. Buckner Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan called for the Million Man March to take place in Washington, D.C., on October 16, 1995, and black men across America responded. The response was so enthusiastic that not even the march on Washington by the late Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., surpassed the crowds that Farrakhan was able to bring together. Why was the Million Man March so effective? Many saw it as a way the black community could stand together. Moreover, it encouraged black males to stand up and be men in their homes and communities. The official membership of the Nation of Islam has been estimated to be between 19,000 and 30,000. Others have said they have 60,000 across America. Whatever the case, they have far more influence than their numbers would indicate, as the Million Man March demonstrated. The Nation of Islam represents a serious threat to the Christian community. The growing presence of the Nation of Islam and their attacks on essential Christian doctrines make it difficult to continue ignoring them. The black church must awake to the challenge. There have been two problems the black church has faced in rising to this challenge: (1) the lack of evangelism in fulfilling its role to the community and (2) the lack of biblical discipleship for church members. Meanwhile, members of the Nation of Islam have proven themselves to be highly motivated and successful in their outreach efforts in the community. Not only are they encouraging young black males to join the Nation of Islam, but they are also recruiting them from our churches. In addition, they have a strong presence in the jails and prisons. This was how Malcolm X and Mike Tyson were recruited. They are out in the community and on the streets training young black males in their peculiar version of Islam. Should we be afraid of the Islamic threat? No, but we should embrace this opportunity to sharpen our beliefs and strengthen our witness. BASIC BELIEFS Many African-Americans, including some Christians, regard the Nation of Islam as a Christian organization that is a positive motivating factor in the black community. A review of their basic beliefs, however, will demonstrate that the Nation of Islam is one of the fastest-growing American cults. The whole basis of the beliefs or theology of the Nation of Islam is an attempt to answer two major questions: (1) "Who are we as a people?" and (2) "What is sin?" The Nation of Islam denies the essentials of the historic Christian faith. The following list of beliefs includes excerpts from the Nation of Islam’s own writings. Polytheism. The Nation of Islam is a polytheistic religion. Several references in their literature point to a belief in many gods, and there is reference to a council of 24 scientist-gods who write history. One of them acts as God, while the others do the work of getting the future together for the Nation. Black men are themselves referred to as being gods. "You [the black man] are walking around looking for a God to bow to and worship. You are the God!"1 The Gods Are Not Eternal. According to the Nation of Islam, although the spirit of Allah (God) lives on, the gods are not eternal. "We all know that there was a God in the beginning that created all these things and do know that He does not exist today."2 God Is a Man. They teach that Allah "came to us from the Holy City of Mecca, Arabia, in 1930. He used the name of Wallace D. Fard."3 "God is a man and we just cannot make Him other than man, lest we make Him an inferior one; for man’s intelligence has no equal in other than man."4 "Yakub Myth." A basic teaching in their belief system is the "Yakub myth." Yakub was one of the council of 24 black scientist-gods. He rebelled against Allah and the council, causing havoc. He created the white race as a race of devils to strike back at the black race. Elijah Muhammad said that black people are not sinners, but that the white man is at fault for their problems. The Trinity. The Nation of Islam denies the Trinity. "The Christians refer to God as a ‘Mystery’ and a ‘Spirit’ and divide Him into thirds. One part they call the Father, another part the Son, and the third part they call the Holy Ghost — which makes the three, one. This is contrary to both nature and mathematics. The law of mathematics will not allow us to put three into one."5 "Making the Son and the Holy Ghost the equal with the Father is absolutely sinful."6 Deity of Christ. The Nation of Islam rejects the essential Christian doctrine that Jesus is both God and man. Jesus "did not consider himself to be God or a son of God or equal of Him....Jesus was only a man and prophet of Allah."7 In a four-hour videotape of Louis Farrakhan’s 1994 Easter Service, "The Crucifixion of Jesus: The Imprisonment of Minister Farrakhan," Farrakhan discusses the crucifixion and relates it to himself, saying, "I am hanging on the cross right now. I’m on Calvary right now and the more I suffer, the more our people are raised to consciousness....you don’t have to look for Jesus. I represent him. I was born to die for you and I love the thought of dying for you."8 The Holy Spirit. The Nation of Islam denies that the Holy Spirit is God. They view the Spirit as a "spook." The so-called Negroes think of God in terms of something without form (spirit or spook) and they believe that His throne is somewhere in the sky....The teachings of Christianity have put God out of Man into nothing (spirit). Can you imagine God without form but yet interested in our affairs who are the human beings? What glory would an immaterial God get out of a material world? We also learn that a spirit is not self-independent; it is dependent upon air, water and food. Without it, the spirit can have no life. So how can a spirit be God?9 The Bible. Although they do make use of it when it does not contradict their own teachings, the Nation of Islam believes the Bible has been tampered with by the white man. "The Bible is now being called the Poison Book by God Himself, and who can deny that it is not poison?...the Book can’t be recognized as the pure and Holy Word of God."10 Atonement and Salvation. The Nation of Islam rejects the essential Christian doctrines of atonement and salvation. "We know we have a Savior. In 1877 a Savior was born [i.e., Wallace Fard]....A Savior is born, not to save the Jews but to save the poor Negro....A Savior has come to save you from sin, not because you are by nature a sinner but because you have followed a sinner."11 The Human Race. As we’ve seen, the Nation of Islam teaches a racist doctrine that the black race is divine and righteous by nature. They were the creators of the universe, and they are taught they are black gods. Heaven and Hell. Members of the Nation of Islam do not believe in the hereafter, whether it be heaven or hell. "I have no alternative than to tell you that there is not any life beyond the grave. There is no justice in the sweet bye and bye. Immortality is NOW, HERE."12 To the Nation of Islam, heaven and hell are regarded as special conditions here on earth now, not as special places to go after death. "The Christians say, ‘Confess the Lord Jesus Christ or you (who are other than the Christians) will burn in hell forever.’ That hell must not be so hot that one can burn in it forever and never burn up."13 The Nation of Islam teaches other anti-Christian doctrines besides those that have been cited above. But the examples we have considered are certainly among the most significant and should be sufficient to acquaint you with their theology. WITNESSING TO THE NATION OF ISLAM African-American Christians and white Christians have different responsibilities in witnessing to the Nation of Islam. Much can be learned from the Nation of Islam itself. If the church can learn the things that attract people to the Nation of Islam, then they will be better able to witness to those in the group. The success of the Nation of Islam is not so much due to what the they are doing but to what the church has failed to do. The Responsibility of Black Churches. The black church today has been passive and impotent in addressing racism as a sin. The church must address racism in the black community; if this is not done, then many black youths will be lost to the Nation of Islam. The reason why the Nation of Islam is extremely appealing to black men is because they address white racism and have a leader, Louis Farrakhan, who boldly defends black racism. The church must address these issues. The church must develop a strong presence not only in the black community, but also in the jails and prisons — especially ministering to young black men. Jesus warned, "I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me" (Matt. 25:43, NIV). The church must develop economic empowerment programs for the community. The Nation of Islam has a strong economic base and is very good at providing for the have-nots in our society. They have designed a system of economic education and empowerment for the black community. The church can do more than the Nation of Islam in this area, if Christians all work together. The church can develop economic education programs that will have a dynamic effect on the black community. The church needs to be involved in the communities and clean them up. The Nation of Islam emphasizes eating better, avoiding drugs, alcohol, and smoking. They work on cleaning up the ghettos and slums by getting rid of drug pushers, prostitutes, and other negative elements in the community. The church can also do these things and more. The Nation of Islam emphasizes a strong family structure — including fatherhood and black manhood. The church needs to provide mentorship and strong surrogate fatherhood to young black men who are without a good male role model. The church can have Christian black males work with young black males in the community in the areas of developing friendships, providing information, or obtaining jobs while helping them with housing and assisting with their educational activities or endeavors. The church needs to have more youth activities. Much can be done to get youth in the community excited about Christian activities. The Responsibility of White Churches. It is very difficult for white Christians to approach members of the Nation of Islam in an evangelistic way. This is true because of all of the racism that has taken place. As a reaction to white racism, black racism took form. The Nation of Islam’s emergence was a direct response to racism. Nevertheless, even though it is difficult to approach a member of the Nation of Islam, there are things white Christians can do. White Christians need to take an aggressive stance against racism in America. They need to join hands with the black church to fight against any form of racism, because it is a sin. They need to strategically join together in an evangelistic reconciliation, a Christlike endeavor, in order to break down the barriers of racism. They need to worship together — a black church coming together with a white church, even exchanging pulpits. They can join hands as co-laborers to reach people in the inner cities. The white pastor can preach sermons from the pulpit against racism. Every person who comes to the local church must be received with open arms, no matter what color he or she is. The white church needs to work with the black church in developing partnerships around mentorship and surrogate fatherhood to black males in the urban cities. One pilot project in Houston serves as an example of successful mentorship. Several white suburban churches joined some urban black churches in an effort to do something about crime in the black community. Their idea was in direct correlation to the fact that most crimes in the black community were committed by young black males who lacked a positive male role model in their lives. The churches provided substitute fathers for many of the fatherless black youths in the city. Results were astounding. Crimes committed by blacks, especially black youths, dropped dramatically. Having a father image made a significant impact upon these black youths. One thing is certain: We need to develop an agenda for reaching the black community. Don’ts of Witnessing to the Nation of Islam. Don’t try to convince them to get saved through your own strength. Trust the Holy Spirit to convince them to believe in Jesus. If God could save the apostle Paul, He can also save Louis Farrakhan and members of the Nation of Islam. Don’t become hostile with the members of the Nation of Islam. They are not enemies to be conquered. They are fellow human beings for whom Christ died on the cross. Don’t overwhelm them with Scripture. They will not listen if they are overwhelmed. Don’t use a King James Bible because, according to some Muslims, King James himself translated this version and corrupted it. I recommend using the New International Version or the New American Standard Version in witnessing to them. Don’t use a Bible in which you have written notes or made marks. This indicates disrespect for the Word of God to members of the Nation of Islam. Avoid all pictures of God, Jesus, or other biblical personalities as white with blue eyes and blond hair. Don’t use the word "Trinity" because this word often connotes the worship of three gods to the Nation of Islam. You can let them know from the Scriptures that God is indeed one Being, and this one Being exists eternally as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit — three persons. In dealing with the members of the Nation of Islam, remove all offenses except the cross. They view Christian symbols as offensive. Do’s of Witnessing to the Nation of Islam. Remember your greatest weapon in witnessing is prayer. This is true when witnessing to any cultic group. Learn to demonstrate love and patience when witnessing. "By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another" (John 13:35, NIV). Know what you believe and why you believe it regarding the essentials of the historic Christian faith before you even begin witnessing. Know the original even before beginning to attempt to learn about the counterfeit. All Muslim groups are different. Know which Black Muslim group you are witnessing to. Share the uniqueness of Jesus Christ as God manifested in the flesh with the Nation of Islam members. Jesus said, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life: No one comes to the Father except through me" (John 14:6, NIV). Remind those in the Nation of Islam that according to the Koran, "No true prophet of God can lie." If that’s true, since they believe that Jesus is a prophet of God, then Jesus told the truth about being the only truth and way to God. Let the Nation of Islam members know that true righteousness doesn’t come through man’s so-called righteousness, but through the righteousness of Christ’s perfect life imputed as a free gift to those who believe. Elijah Muhammad told his followers, "The greatest hindrance to the truth of our people [members of the Nation of Islam] is the preacher of Christianity."14 My message to you is, Keep on being a hindrance and telling them what is right. Be encouraged! There are many who have come out of the Nation of Islam to become strong Christians in the church. Dr. Jerry L. Buckner has degrees from California Baptist College, Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary, and San Francisco Theological Seminary. He is a pastor, counselor, lecturer, and the host of the Contending for the Faith radio broadcast on KFAX AM 1100 in the San Francisco Bay Area.

      Questions For the Nation of Islam?       Shouldn’t there exist on the part of the Nation of Islam an acknowledgement that there were and still are Christians, black and white, who have vehemently spoken out against slavery and the violence done in the name of Jesus?[1] How do you reconcile the existence of white abolitionists who were outspoken against slavery and helped slaves escape to freedom with the Yacub theory that advances an inherent evil nature on the part of Caucasians? If the bible has been tampered with, revised and rewritten, why does the Nation of Islam quote it so much?[2] On what objective evidence should we accept the meaning of key terms, as defined by Elijah Muhammed? Why is the bible and Christian doctrine misrepresented so severely? In the instances where scripture passages from the bible are used to make a point or refute some theological point, on what basis are these seen as authentic? If white people were created by Yakub (a black scientist-god who accomplished this feat 6,600 years ago), how can whites be blamed for their status as "devils?" Isn't the black man, according to this scenario the author of the very evil that is being lamented? Additionally, wouldn’t this Yacub experiment negate the good nature of black people that the NOI advances? How is the forceful domination of Africa by Muslims explained? Additionally, what about the Christian origins in Africa prior to this domination? How does the Nation of Islam differ from the Ku Klux Klan?

         1.) How did the Nation of Islam begin?The Nation of Islam started in 1930 with the arrival of Wallace Dodd Fard to the black ghettos of Detroit. “Master Fard” as he would become known - within the NOI- was believed to be God incarnate - The following taken from their official  urlLink website “The Honorable Elijah Muhammad identified the Master as being the answer to the one that the world had been expecting for the past 2,000 years under the names Messiah, the second coming of Jesus, the Christ, Jehovah, God, and the Son of Man.” Fard later appointed Elijah “Poole” Muhammad to become the chief minister of Islam. The sect became very popular during a time where blacks needed to feel a sense of identity in a country that had maligned and mistreated them for many years. Malcolm X and then Louis Farrakhan would grow to become the most famous and vocal orators of the Nation of Islam’s message. 2.) What do they believe?This is actually more like a mission statement. The following is also taken from their official  urlLink website  and as printed on the back of every  urlLink Final Call  newspaper: What The Muslims [Nation of Islam] Believe WE BELIEVE in the One God whose proper Name is Allah. WE BELIEVE in the Holy Qur'an and in the Scriptures of all the Prophets of God. WE BELIEVE in the truth of the Bible, but we believe that it has been tampered with and must be reinterpreted so that mankind will not be snared by the falsehoods that have been added to it. WE BELIEVE in Allah's Prophets and the Scriptures they brought to the people. WE BELIEVE in the resurrection of the dead--not in physical resurrection--but in mental resurrection. We believe that the so-called Negroes are most in need of mental resurrection; therefore they will be resurrected first. Furthermore, we believe we are the people of God's choice, as it has been written, that God would choose the rejected and the despised. We can find no other persons fitting this description in these last days more that the so-called Negroes in America. We believe in the resurrection of the righteous. WE BELIEVE in the judgment; we believe this first judgment will take place as God revealed, in America... WE BELIEVE this is the time in history for the separation of the so-called Negroes and the so-called white Americans. We believe the black man should be freed in name as well as in fact. By this we mean that he should be freed from the names imposed upon him by his former slave masters. Names which identified him as being the slave master's slave. We believe that if we are free indeed, we should go in our own people's names--the black people of the Earth. WE BELIEVE in justice for all, whether in God or not; we believe as others, that we are due equal justice as human beings. We believe in equality--as a nation--of equals. We do not believe that we are equal with our slave masters in the status of "freed slaves." We recognize and respect American citizens as independent peoples and we respect their laws which govern this nation. WE BELIEVE that the offer of integration is hypocritical and is made by those who are trying to deceive the black peoples into believing that their 400-year-old open enemies of freedom, justice and equality are, all of a sudden, their "friends." Furthermore, we believe that such deception is intended to prevent black people from realizing that the time in history has arrived for the separation from the whites of this nation. If the white people are truthful about their professed friendship toward the so-called Negro, they can prove it by dividing up America with their slaves. We do not believe that America will ever be able to furnish enough jobs for her own millions of unemployed, in addition to jobs for the 20,000,000 black people as well. WE BELIEVE that we who declare ourselves to be righteous Muslims, should not participate in wars which take the lives of humans. We do not believe this nation should force us to take part in such wars, for we have nothing to gain from it unless America agrees to give us the necessary territory wherein we may have something to fight for. WE BELIEVE our women should be respected and protected as the women of other nationalities are respected and protected. WE BELIEVE that Allah (God) appeared in the Person of Master W. Fard Muhammad, July, 1930; the long-awaited "Messiah" of the Christians and the "Mahdi" of the Muslims. We believe further and lastly that Allah is God and besides HIM there is no god and He will bring about a universal government of peace wherein we all can live in peace together. 3.) Isn't Allah simply Arabic for God?Allah does mean God in Arabic. For example, in an Arabic translated bible you will find that God is interpreted as Allah. However it is important to realize that the CONCEPT of Allah in Nation of Islam doctrine is radically different from the Christian concept/understanding of God. The Allah that is spoken of in the Koran (according to NOI adherents) is actually the person of "Master Fard"! There is no way someone can intelligently say that "Allah"and God can be used interchangeably. Anyone who tries to allege this is simply ignoring the facts. 4.) If the NOI is so obviously different from Historic Christianity then why does Minister Farrakhan quote passages of scripture from the bible?This is a tactic that continues to shroud the NOI's beliefs in secrecy. Historically, during the NOI's beginnings, both Elijah (Poole) Muhammad and Farrakhan relied somewhat heavily upon the bible because they were more familiar with it than the Qur'an's teachings. The bible is still used extensively during Farrakhan's speeches (whenever it does not conflict with their own errant doctrine), and his followers carefully discuss the bible and try to use non-threatening terms when discussing beliefs. It is important for them to align themselves with Christians in order to win and deceive as many of our people as they possibly can. This tactic proved to be very successful during recruitment for the Million Man March that occured in October of 1995. Please note that wherever the bible contradicts NOI doctrine, the bible will then be accused of being tampered with in that particular scripture
