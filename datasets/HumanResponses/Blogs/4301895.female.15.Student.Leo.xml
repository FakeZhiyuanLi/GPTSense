       urlLink    To Dani from Crystal: I didnt really no Dani for a very long time, I met her in a chat room on my birthday. She actually offered me a car for a present. A car, for me, a 15-year-old stranger. She was really nice to me. I didn't exactly know why, but we became fairly close. As close as one could get for knowing a person for such a short time. We were so alike, even though we didn't really know each other. We liked the same things, same cars, we had oekaki in common, and the funniest part was that we had the same bra size. When I think of that it makes me happy that I at least got to know one person on the Earth, who was kind, sweet, and an all around good person before I didn't have the chance to meet anyone like that. I don't think anyone will ever be as nice as she was.  ~A memorial to Danielle~

       urlLink    To Dani from Lisa :  I wonder how it's been with you? In the cold wind, I pondered a little bit. We leaned against a branch and talked, didn't we? My body started to chill, and as the sun was setting, I ended up crying. And as if to protect me, you came and stood silently by my side, didn't you? I felt like your eyes reflect a wondrous world You taught me how to dream and long and such. I told you only a little while ago, even if we get torn apart, I won't forget our dreams, so... ...even though I'm far away from you, I don't want to give up. Even though we've always been rivals. I don't need to hear any news, beloved friend I don't tell anyone else my foremost thoughts We'll meet once more, right, beloved friend I won't forget you, beloved friend =This is Dani with her friend Lisa=  ~A memorial to Danielle~

       urlLink    Silent afternoon Curtains swept up by a gentle breeze Floating memories In hours like these of the days that we share Like an ending summer eclipse Sweet sun pours in from the window And this shadowed room turns into gold Outshinning sorrow In this peace of mind, no apprehensions I've found my own - a bright reflection Something calm and strong, I can't explain it and it's embracing me I'll wake up to the morning sun here comes another day and somehow know everything will be OK. Wind chime, lullabies Calling me into my garden Where we kissed the seeds to grow and to bloom tenderly in the spring Daydreams arise in sunshine's glory Midday repose, a simple story Something calm and strong, I can't explain it and it's embracing me Past the yearning, I learned to temper my sorrow Memories of you, I'll take to tomorrow Coz I am glad I awoke to this calmness You lead me to In this peace of mind, no apprehensions I've found my own - a bright reflection Something calm and strong, I can't explain it and it's embracing me I'll wake up to the morning sun here comes another day and reminisce Love's afternoon repose -By Dani  ~A memorial to Danielle~

       urlLink    Here you are Daylight's star Made out of miracles Perfection Of your own You alone O so incredible Each atom Sings to me "Set me free From chains of the physical." O free me, O free me The mirror melts, I'm somewhere else Inside eternity Where you on Outstretched wings Sing within The Garden of Everything Where memories Call to me Backward dreams? Or phantom reality? Call to me, they call to me And so here we are Lovers of Lost Dimensions Burning supernovas of all sound and sight Every touch, a temptation And for every sense, a sensation Eyes of pure Deep azure Quite unbelievable The sun's daughter You've been made Not to fade Quite inconceivable Each atom sings to me "Set me free From chains of the physical." O free me, O free me A love like ours A starry flower Through seasons and centuries As rivers reach the sea You'll reach me With songs of your symmetry A small boat There will float To far off coasts The Isle of Infinity Come with me, O come with me Here we'll see Love's lost tree Made out of miracles Emotions, crystal leaves To cover me And you in eternity Each atom sings to us Through the blood "Love is a miracle" Sings softly, it sings softly And so here we are Lovers of Lost Dimensions Burning supernovas of all sound and sight Every touch, a temptation And for every sense, a sensation And so here we are Twin stars of brilliant brightness Lanterns lit by life for all the depths of night And every day will return us To arms of the ever eternal And so here we are So far from earthy orbits Burning supernovas of all sound and sight Where every day will return us To arms of the ever eternal    ~A memorial to Danielle~

       urlLink    Once it is lost, there a sorrowful world Will spread out and surely devastate me In the never-ending and transparent darkness Like being on a deserted island, still, I strained my eyes In order to love the one I love, I will go on living There is nothing to be expected in return These muddy emotions that tie down my heart If only I could be free of them Breathing into the sky again today, like a flower I accept like soil into which water goes on being absorbed Being alone by myself doesn't mean defeat but Always wanting to be satisfied, it's useless And I keep hitting a wall Why is it that only by being loved back once they love Can people find happiness With just the feelings for you that my own heart sets free I want to feel joy In order to love the one I love, I will go on living There is nothing to be expected in return These uncalled-for emotions that tie down my heart If only I could be free of them ''Dive'' - By Dani  ~A memorial to Danielle~

       urlLink    The dark night sky separates us to lay bare our hearts as they call out to each other. Cast off your useless trappings. Some things can only be seen when you've lost everything.  Oh wind, I will stand and face you! I will go to the sea of anguish, though bonds cut my chest, and the crushing waves are endless. What does everyone seek by fighting? Does spilled blood cause flowers to bloom? Until the precious tomorrow is in my hands... Until the day we meet... Oh wind, I will stand and face you! I will go and head for the brilliance. Embracing prayer to my heart, I wander the seemingly dark future. Oh wind, I am not afraid! Love is the miracle I have found! It's my joy to believe in you. The storm blows so that we might realize [our] love.	 ''Sea of Miracles'' - By Dani  ~A memorial to Danielle~

       urlLink    Just look this way, will you Don't be so cross, honey bunny Giving me the silent treatment with your brows furrowed like a little kid Not that I find your face to be daunting when you're mad Because it's no lie I love you more than anyone else, honey bunny I haven't the slightest interest at all in any other person It's the same no matter where I am, my heart is right by your side Don't look so, just give me a kiss now and you'll know it right away. We're living in this same city yet there's nothing but nights when we can't see each other Got no time, got no latitude, and got no money either But the antenna in your heart meant to receive the signal of my love Don't let such minor details rust even that   On nights you can't sleep close your eyes, honey bunny And count not the number of sheep but the words of love I gave you One night shouldn't even be close to being long enough I know what your dreams are, and I realize what my dreams are too My mind's about to explode with having to just deal with myself But still, not being able to see you is bad for my health and I almost forget your birthday, really, what's wrong with me Surely, no matter how many times we may miss each other in passing How many times I may not be able to reach you by phone With just one kiss everything can be instantly resolved Even when words aren't enough Even when we can't smile If we can just kiss once, really that's all it takes For the last few minutes you've been talking like you're the only one who's lonely but I wanna cry too We love each other yet for some reason its really tough I wanna cry too I wanna cry too! -By Dani-  ~A memorial to Danielle~

Love is not enough Nothing matters Feeling lost and no where Cold and shivering Like a black morning faded Darkness comes How could things be so wrong There was a time when my love set you free Not very long ago What I would give for one night, today Tell me where to go Love is not enough When love is not enough Tell me Who can I run to? Love is not enough Help me, please To see the truth Love is not enough When love is not enough Tell me Who can I turn to?

Why is it so If within this expanse It is the more beautiful things that break most easily Rescue me  If you are to change into a spirit Take me away with you Unsure of what is to come I let out a voice while crying Please don't leave me here all alone Life is too short and You are truly gone and I want you to embrace me again You were the only angel The wind blows and I don sorrow Like feathers and am sent flying away Air and stars To a land so pure and unknown to anyone Where only such fleeting things gather An undescribable world, a blue and clear light Everything is delicate like glitter and What is truly precious Is unrecognized by anyone and Is small if taken in the hand and Is lost and then fades away Why is it so If within this expanse It is the more beautiful things that break most easily Rescue me  If you are to change into a spirit Take me away with you I dont sorrow Like feathers and am sent flying away Air and stars To a land so pure and unknown to anyone Where only such fleeting things gather	   ~A memorial to Danielle~
