      In the Beginning: My first Blog  Well, here I am. Its 6am in the morning, drunk the last of my booze, and looking for something productive to do.I guess its better than sitting around getting all emotional, which is what usually happens when I get home pissed (or drink by myself for that matter). Yes, I'm a drunken alcoholic... but not really. Anyways..., the topic for today is...loneliness. What is the purpose of loneliness?  Hmmmm... there's a question. Lets see... Being an ex-christian (catholic turned bornagain-revival christian) I was taught that I should never need to feel lonely, as god is always by my side. Yeah sure! Having an invisible omnipotent being look down on me 24/7 is not only pointless and unreassuring, but downright annoying. I mean, having like an authority figure like god, watch you non-stop is kinda scary. Believing that, only left me guilt-ridden and suicidal.  Taking a look at eastern philosophy, life is all lesson. Life deals every person a set of hardships and tribulations that we all must overcome and learn from. All suffering is equal in that a person experiences pain according to their own tolerance. It is a lesson that is unavoidable. Happiness is only one part of life. But to be always happy, means we miss out on every other experience that makes us human. I find this philosophy far easier to swallow. I mean the way the world is today, its easier to accept the belief that: "life was meant to be crap, so accept it and learn from it" rather than "God is up there somewhere watching over us....pray and he'll make it better.." I mean,the first 16 years of my life was spent on my knees praying to this all powerful and gracious god...12 years of it on the rosary, 4 years speaking in tongues. Nevertheless, I've always felt rejected by god. To the point I felt I was inherently evil. Getting back to the subject of loneless. Yes, I do indeed feel very lonely. It is something I do not understand. Socially, I have all the friends I need, whom I've known most of my life, and whom I trust without exception. Family, I have a mother whom I love very much, and loves me unconditionally, being her only child. Grandparents who will sacrifice everything. Three Aunties, whom I consider my second mothers. And five very close cousins whom I consider my brothers and sisters, who at the same time play a part as my best friends and confidantes.  So really there shouldnt be any reason why I should feel lonely. Why am I cursed with this affliction? Could it be because Im single and haven't found my true love? I dont think so. I'm quite rational, I'm only 23 and I have my whole life to find that person. I also very picky, so Im in no rush. And generally I'm not one to wear rose-tinted glasses. Romance is all well and good, but it doesn't put food on the table. Besides love is just a state of mind, a rush of hormones and endorphins in the brain, which is beneficial in the short term, but like heroine, sedates you from the realities of life, at the same time turning you into an addict leaving you with a co-dependent personality. However that being said, sex is good. Everyone has to experience meaningless sex every now and then, but not to often mind you.  Anyways thats my thoughts for now... Im tired and I need sleep. But I'll leave whoever reads my spontaneous ramblings with this one last thing.... Loneliness is a state of mind. No-one needs to ever be lonely, as there is always something you can do about it. If there is one thing that christianity has taught us (and eastern philosophy), is that we have free will. Eastern philosophy says we have the ability to create. I think they kinda touch the same lines. We can do what we want in this world, be it for evil or for good. (though we are reminded that christianity:do unto others as you would have them do to you  eastern:Law of Karma   miscellaneous: What you send out returns threefold/sevenfold   newton:action vs reaction).  Anyways I digress from the topic,loneliness is a state of mind, and its not who we are.Its just another lesson that we must face and overcome. Hard as it may be, I think I've just temporarily overcome it by keeping my mind busy typing away my thoughts. Whose to say it wont come back tomorow? Nevertheless, if it does I know what to do.
