      Freaky... that's the word that I have to used to descible most of the day.   This afternoon when I went to my exam, I totally forgot that my Music Final Take Home Essay has to be handed in by 4:00pm but that's during my Commerce 200 exam... and while I am waiting in line, and exam is going to started in 5 minutes, and I am still trying to figure out what I am going to do... I am freaking out and debating should I go home or not. Try calling Dan (my housemate), but as usual, he didn't pick up the phone. Then luckly there was a taxi outside the building and I rush into it and got home and hand it in then run back to the exam hall... it is so crazy, I am so stresses out in the taxi. I must have yell at the old driver that he need to go faster, like 10 times... So it turn out that I am 10 minutes late for my commerce exam. But the exam was kind of a joke... I am done in like an hour and a half. So I am glad that went okay.    After that I got home and decided that I am going to work on my travel arrangement for the summer. I book my hotel room at VA beach for August, but I am still looking for a roomate to share the room though (the room got 2 beds) Matt, Josh, or anyone that's comming... I also made the reservation on my plane ticket to go to VA beach but I am still waiting and see can I get a free ticket from my aadvantage or Aeroplan. So I guess I will have to wait and see before I confirm my ticket and pay for it... Also I was trying to book the ticket for my brother to go to Iqaluit on Air Canada and apparently a lot of flight was already full... so I am still working on that... bro, I will get you a ticket, I promise! I will just have to work something out with those stupid Air Canada people. As for my ticket back to Hong Kong, I have decided that I want to stop by Louisville to see Matt and at LA to see my Dad and TSGGB (David)... we will see what happen... my ticket was still not book yet but I will do that tomorrow or Friday...   As for chating online goes, I finally discover a good pianoist that I could go get his CD... this is all thanks to Matt recommendation... it is so good... As for other music goes, I am falling in love with John Mayer and Lifehouse... I just can't stop listening... I am kind of tired to all those Canadian musician and those stuff being play on the radio... so finally got something exciting to listen to... thanks to all you CB kids.   So earlier on the night on the 19th (i know it is the 20th now, but i can't stop the clock on this board), I decided to call Merritt and see did he got my e-mail and stuff... it turn out that he never recieved it and I am so nervous when I talk to him man. So I e-mail him again and he reply me and I am so glad that he is really cool with it man... Merritt and Julien were probably the two person who I will have the most difficulty to talk to other then my parents. So I am glad that Merritt is cool with it and I am glad that he finally enjoy his time at Eckerd College man... I know you will be a fine marine geologist... [hum, hum... of course the engineer {me}... will be better at everything... hum]... so now I just have to tell Julien, and then after this, those who is left were my parents man. And they will be the though one but I think I am ready to tell them personally. We will see what happen this summer... Also, I can wait to see Merrit again this Saturday man, haven't seen him for like ages man... it is going to be so much fun to drink together man buddy...    Finally... I am again so f%#k for my exam tomorrow... but hell, these art and science course were like a joke compare to the engineering course... Like I can learn the whole course in like 2 hours... it is rediculously easy... I so should have not gone into engineering at Queen's man... only if I am in commerce or art and sciences then I will actually have a life... hehehe.... LOL....  And way, guys... I am heading back to montreal tonight on the 19th, yeah night train... I love the train, so much better then the bus but of course airplane will be better but no flight from kingston to Montreal... :O( ..... anyway, I will catch you CB guys sometime tomorrow night man, it will be late cause my train won't get there until 11:30 pm... as to the other people, I will still catch you guys online or on the phone or whatever... we will figure that out man, I am sure I will see you guys in the next little while... anyhow I will talk to you guys later man... coolio....

      Today it is pretty good, I have learned that my baja team people know that I am gay and they are cool with it. I am glad and I was even talking about gay stuff with them openly. That's really good and I am glad that we could still talk openly about things. On the other hand I have so much work to do, it is crazy, it is just me... I should have done some of the stuff earlier... but oh well... I am getting prepare for my summer now, booking plane ticket and stuff... yeah i know, again I should have done some of these earlier but oh well... it is me again, I can decided what I wanted to do until like the last minute... I guess my friends always complain to me about that but I just never listen... :O)   Anyhow, I am going to hit the books now... I will try to post again and tell you more about what's going on man... coolio...  Peter

      First, I have decided to switch my daily thought from my web-site to his blogger.com thing! It is easier to maintian and easier to edit. Today, nothing much new have happen to me, except I think I did okay on my Music final. Also, I am still wondering why Merritt has not replying to my e-mail. I hope that he is not too freak out to know that I am gay. I am going to tell Julien and Jennifer about it tomorrow. As for tonight, a lot of people on CB.com seem to be having a bad night and I hope that they will all be okay, especially SPRee, my wishes goes to him. Other then that I finally talk to this guy from my class who look exactly like Matt from CB.com. He is way too cute. I am borrowing his notes tomorrow so we will see can we be friends and chill out... Coolio... That's about it for today. Coolio.

      Alright, I am sorry that I haven't been keeping up with my posting... but I have been busy going to my brother graduation and also I don't have a permanent internet connection at my step-mom house (need to share it with my step-bro), so that's why I am kind of late... but everything is good with me man... right now after all the hassel of help my bro moving everything out from Sedbergh, I have been doing nothing, absolutly nothing at all in Montreal... Oh, did I forgot to tell you guys, I have told Merritt that I am gay just before my bro graduation... that was intense and it felt kind of awkward when I saw him at the closing... but things work out okay and we still talk and everything is cool... also, I met this TA name Rob, he is a pretty cool guy and he stay over at my step mom place for a night and we hang out... he is pretty cute but no, I am not interested, but I am sure that something that I have done must have freak him out (ie: the cocodile). Other then that I am still trying to figure out my plane ticket schedule... my travel agent is very incompetant and can't get the flight that I wanted so I am extremely disappointed... I really want to go see David in LA and also to go see my Dad... and maybe to tell him my secert... ah who know man... we will have to see, but now I am about to go to bed... I just wish that all of you will be happy and things in this world will work out okay for everyone! Coolio... Peter

      Wow... what a week... Canada Day on July 1st was a lot of fun... I went out to the Montreal International Jazz Festival in the afternoon and then went to the Canada Day concert that evening at the Old Port Montreal... after that I saw the firework which was lots of fun... The rest of the week has been really hot so I went out to downtown to shop and chill out. I watch MIB2 last night which I am kind of disappointed, all these new movies all disappointed me... Why can't they made them better??? Anyhow, today I had a fight with my little brother Jacky... he was being a Jerk or more like a stubborn jerk who just assume things too much and only hear part of a conversation and immediately jump to a conclusion. Horrible personality... So that sort of stop all my initative to do anything for him... My brother always believe what he thinks is always right and never really look at things from another perspective... I don't know what to do but freakly I don't care anymore... anyway, today was the 4th July and I hope that all the boardie will have a wonderful day and wonderfull weekend... anyhow, I will drop a line sometimes soon... coolio... sweet sweet...

      Tonight was absolutly boring. I am bore and I am mad at my mom secertary for not being understanding. Yeah, I am pathetic, I talk to my mom secertary more then I talk to my mom. What do you expect, my mom is alway busy and whenever I got on the phone with her, she is too busy to talk and usually hang up in just minutes. I am getting sick of that... but oh well, I guess that's life. On the other hand, I just weight myself tonight and I lost another 2 lbs. So I am very happy about that and I am almost at the weight that I wanted. This morning, I finally paid for my plane ticket to Norfolk, VA. Going to get that on the 8th around 2:30pm and leaving on the 12th... yeah, I know everyone is leaving on the 11th but if I have to leave on the 11th, I will have to leave at 6:30am which mean I will probably have to leave the hotel at like 3:30am in the morning which I am not prepare to do. So I am going to stay for an extra night so that I can leave around 3:00pm on the 12th... Anyway, I hope that it will be good fun at VA beach.. anyway... I am getting tire now... I will try to write more tomorrow... oh, also I really want the new Red Hot Chili Peppers CD... I want it!!!

      Today was alright... but i felt like crap tonight after I have unintentionally made someone mad... totally don't meant to do it... and I hate to think about the fact that I mad someone mad... it just sucks to think about it. I guess sometimes I just got to be more careful and more respectful in what I do. I don't know but it is so hard to understand what is acceptable to some people and what is not. Like to me I treat people as honest and truthful as I possibily can but it just seems that misunderstanding always happen. It always seem like I am the one who is at fault all the time and I am the one who piss everyone off all the time without me doing anything. All I really want was people to be happy and be cool with things... is that really unrealistic for this world. I have no idea. Sometimes I felt like no body really understand me becuase I am always this guy who pray for the ideal situation... but it just seems like it never happen. Take treating people nice for example, sometimes people think I am too nice to be true and they think that I am just trying to used them... do I really have to be an ass hole before everyone realized that I am not one. This world is weird, people tend to be too protective and they don't trust people and that's what I hate about this place. I wish the world is a little bit more ideal and that might made me feel better and live a happier life... anyways... maybe I am suppose to feel like crap all the time... I don't know... this world really sucks sometimes...  Coolio... not so sweet...

      Alright... me and my bro were friends again... isn't that fast... sometimes, I guess I am the big brother, I just have to be cool... and everything will work out in life.... as for other stuff goes, I was trying to fix my step mom friends Mei Ling computer... I really don't understand how she use her computer... and it turn out I have to completely erase everything and reformat hard drive and then reinstall windows... and I have to reinstall all the programs for her and stuff so it turn out to be a day job. There is conflict in her hardware and I have never seen so many blue screen of death for my life. For all the computer that I have fix and reinstall wondows and everything, this is the nastiest one. And it lead me to tell myself that I am never going to fix another computer for those computer incompetent people. Other then that my weekend was as usual, very boring, nothing much exciting is happening in my life. I think I need to join some clubs or something. But I am only going to be here for a few more days. So what should I do? Oh well, I guess I will figure that out tomorrow. Also, I think I am losing my touch on all these board games, I lost my monopoly game last night and I bankrupty and own my step bro 325 dollar monopoly money. I can't believe it... I think I am better in the game risk. :O) Anyhow, coolio... sweet sweet...

Right now, I am excited that I am going to be going to VA beach this coming thursday and finally got a chance to meet a lot of the cb.com boardie... I think it will be amazing... so is there any interesting thing that happen in my life? hum, all the boardie were finally talking on the Livve.com and I mean voice chatting and talking... it was totally fun and I guess it let me put a voice to each boardie... now I just need to put a face to the voice at VA... I don't know, I guess it will be exciting to meet all the boardie at VA but it could also be scary... don't really know what to expect, that's the truth... hopefully everyone will not be that much different from their board personality... anyway, I will let you guys know what's going on later... coolio... sweet sweet...

      It is Christmas day!!! Merry Christmas to you all!  Every year around Christmas time... I always came to a realization on how much the world will be a better place if everyday is christmas? Everyone during this time of the year is so much nicer to each other that it is wonderful! How often will you have people on the street wishing you a happy hoildays? Not that often... and wouldn't it be great if this happens everyday? I think so... :O) Also, if we have Christmas everyday... then we will get presents everyday and that will be way cool also... although one of my friend Matt point out to me that, all of us are in fact recieving gifts everyday, but they might not nescessary materialistic gifts... and I think that's so true also... back to the christmas realization things, the atmosphere during christmas time is so peaceful and loving... it is incredible... last night when i was over at my friends house (my family wasn;t around so my friends parents invite me over to their house), we were watching a Christmas program on the Hostory channel and they were saying how the soldier in WW1 stop fighting during christmas time and how the german and the british soldiers in the front line are actually singing christmas songs together and shaking each other hand and stuff like that... it is wonderful... Christmas is simply a wonderful hoilday for christian and non-christian... it is the time of the year when all of us can get together with family and friends and share our love and joy... it is the time of the year when we can appriciate the accompany of each other and share our year stories... it is absolutly wonderful!  Anyway, I hope that you guys are enjoying yourself in this wonderful hoilday and once again, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!   Best Wishes,   Peter

      Happy New Year! I know I know, we are already 20 days into the new year but oh well! A lot of business plan idea is floating through my mind right now... I almost felt like the old creative me is slowly coming back out of the cage... To tell you the truth, I haven't been that creative since I got to Queen's... donno why, maybe it is because of this enviroment? Donno... I am just kind of happy and excited that I am once again thinking about new business prospect and new ideas! By the way, do you know Microsoft is giving out dividend for the first time in their history!!! What a bunch of gready corporate slaves! As soon as the US government change the policy to give tax relief for people who is earning dividend and to company who is giving divident, Microsoft immediately switch its policy... what a co-incident!!! Anyway, some other people actually predict that Microsoft giving dividend might signal slower growth in the tech sector, hint most company that give dividend were mostly in the slow growing sector! So maybe Microsoft finally noticing the fact that they could only have so so so much of the monopoly (ie:95%) and they will never get all 100% of it! Hum... interesting... we will see how that go... :O)  Alright I am not going to bore you with all these business news that is going to bore the hell out of you... I will talk to you guys later... love ya all!  Cheers,  Peter

       WHY DOESN'T PEOPLE THINK?   Why doesn't people think before they do something? Sometimes it drives me nuts! For example: tonight I discover that my housemate took my laundry out of the dryer and then put it on the floor and mixed it with my other housemate dirty cloths. WHY WHY WHY? Can't people simply think about the fact that clean cloths wasn't suppose to mix with dirty cloths??? Now I have to put up a sign just so that this won't happens again! Sometimes I wonder why doesn't people spend two seconds of their time to just think about what they are doing before they actually do it!!!   Sometimes, thinking a little might actually be good for you... working your brains out a little will improve your situation awareness and your responds time to common problems. I sometimes really wonder, how do we actually think? Afterall, we were just a bunch of H2O and Carbon and some other atom mixed together... so really how do all of these atoms have the ability to think? This is just too weird... If you ever figure it out how do we think then let me know :)  Peter

      It is way cool tonight when I saw Dr Bryant on the discovery channel canada. He was talking about his Niagara Foot and I am so happy to see the foot tester that I have build during my Mech 212 project were being shown on TV (even though it is only a few seconds). It is just so so so cool to see something that I have done is being shown on TV... Way way way cool... Me, Mark and Craig, worked on the foot tester project with Dr. Bryant grad studnet Tara. Originally we were to design only the control panel and then we sort of got drag on to design and build the whole control system, with rely switches and pheumatic swtiches and stuff like that. I remember I still have that report somewhere in my room. That foot tester is sort of the 1st really cool project that I have done at Queen's (since then I have done other cool stuff). So I am just happy to see it on TV. :)  Anyway, If you want to see it, then go to this link:   urlLink http://www.exn.ca/news/video/exn20030224-niagarafoot.asx  Cooli, so check it out. Talk to you all later... cooli  Peter

      The War... everyone is talking about it... so should I... I really don't know what should I react to this rediculous war... I oppose it for the fact that it is not United Nation approved war...  but that's not the worst of it all... the constant propraganda from CNN, is killing me... I think the American public is being brainwash by their admistrations, I really feel bad for them.  As for the weekend... I finally got my IRON RING!!! YAY... :)  Got to go now... but let you guys know more about what happen on Sunday night later... cooli  Peter

      CBC was great... they got a wonderful program tonight on fifth estate... they are talking about the stuff behind the war on Iraq... pretty interesting prospective... I have definitly learned something from it...  SARS... this got blown way out of proportion by the media... this is my prospective anyway... i was in Hong Kong just 2 weeks ago and it is not even close to be as bad as it was being said by the media... it is bad, but not as bad and dangerous... and don't worry, I don't have SARS... I left Hong Kong last Tuesday, so today was the 10th day that I was back in Canada... so if I have SARS, I should have it by now! hahaha...  As for interesting stuff... here is an interesting site that I have visit...  urlLink click here  some pretty interesting perspective on stuff... also click on Gulf War 2 on the right... it is a pretty funny animation that the author had put together...  Finally... I wrote an letter to the Queen's Journal Editor just before I leave for Hong Kong... I was so angry by my fellow Sci'03 (no names included here) when I wrote it, it was not even funny... and I still believe the person involve should be de-bossed... it drive me nuts that Queen's is such a non-queer friendly place... it is so so so bad... I even send a complain to Principle Leggett, he haven't reply yet... it had been 2 weeks, so I am disappointed in him also... overall I am just disappointed... anyway, if you want to read the journal letter, here is the link...  urlLink click here     Anyway, I got to study hard for my exams for the next few weeks... wish me luck... cooli...

      (Sorry that I haven't update this blog for so many months, my life is pretty hactic right now.) First I would like to say, I have been back in Hong Kong for about 3 months now. I liked the city and I sort of liked my job but I wan't that happy and I feel pretty depress since I came in town. I really don't know why is that happening. It was only until tonight that I realized what's wrong with me! Tonight, Mikey, Dave, Stan, John and my friend Chad (not a boardie) have been trying to cheer me up because I was complaining about my love life. I was complaining about how I don't have a boyfriend. I was complaining on how nobody ever loves me and everyone only wants to be my friend. I don't know why I feel that way, but I just do. I thought that's the reason why I am sad and that's the reason why I am kind of depress but it is not.  I am not sad because I don't have a boyfriend, it was more like the fact that I am so far away from all my friends back home. For an example, Chad, a friend that I met from second year of university whom I haven't talk to for ages came online tonight. I immediately got so excited and I felt that I am the happiest person on this planet. Later on that night, a friend Adam from school and a friend Darren from high school also dropped me a line and I became even happier since. I think I am not sad because I don't have a boyfriend (althought that just increases my sadness) but I am sad because I don't get to talk to all my friends back home.  I have been saying I need a bf since I came out, and I have been complaining about my love life but none of these were the real issues. They were just the fuel to a more complex problem. My real problem is that I am not that happy here in Hong Kong. Not because of work, not because of the environment nor was it the culture or the people but it was more like I am bore and I don't know anyone. I want to chat with my friends back home but due to the time difference, it is very difficult. There is no where I can share my daily experience with the most important group of people in my life and that's why I am sad. I donno how can I fix this problem and I don't see there is any easy solutions, I guess I will just have to live with this and do my best to keep in touch. But I think I am strong and I will survive. As time goes, I am sure everything is ok. Hopefull that's true. Anyway, to all my friends, I just want to say I love you guys and girls. MUAH... Ciao. Peter

      Why life is so complicated? Why doesn't anyone love me the way that I wanted them to? I donno... it is too confusing and too complicated... I thought of stop loving and stop caring for anything but what is the point to life if you can't care for anyone? :( so many people that I known are happy couples living their own happy life but why can't I get the same thing? Why is this world so unfair? It is because of me being too idealistic? Is it because I am too picky? Is it because I don't see the people who love me and have to set my aim way above my league? I donno... also, why do people always drive me crazy and doesn't want to give me a straight answer? I try to be truthful and be honest about how I feels... but why can't they do the same? I just want a honest reply... it doesn't matter is it good news or bad news... at least I will know... if I don't get any reply, I donno how I should feel... if there is no reply... there is two possible answer... not interested, go away and I don't even want to be your friends anymore... or it could be: interested, but i am too afraid to say it... to me, it doesn't matter if it is good news or bad news... I will find my way to handle the situations. I might get sad for a few days if it is bad new... and I might be very happy if it is good news but at least it won't makes me feel helpness... it won't makes me feel like I am being ignore... it won't makes me feel like there is no way to obtain a conclusion... so I guess what I am saying is that I just want a truthful answer for everything from everyone... just tell me straight what you think or feels... I might get mad at that moment, but at least I know and I could make my own decision after that... I guess I just hate not to be in control and I hate making inconclusive conclusions... I donno... it is just too complicated... I just wish someone could love me the way that I am willing to love them... and I hope that I will find that person soon... love, peter

      I donno... I felt like such a dork for these past couple of days... I am having a crush on this Brian guy that I met recently... he is cute, sexy and smart.... and I have never fell so weak before... my body were numb because I can't stop thinking about him... but at the same time, I don't want him to think that I am a freak because I do believe that any relationship is a two way things... it can never be forced in one direction. If he shares the same feelings as I do then something could develop... if he doesn't then we will just be friends and nothing will happen. This whole things just bothers me because I haven't dated another guy before. I had one night stand before and what not, but I have never dated another guy. It just makes me really nervous and I did many stupid things that makes me look like a dork. I even called Brian up without knowing what do say... I just totally freeze... I am such a dork... because of this, Brian knows that I am in love with him but I donno does he interest in me or not? I am sick and tired for my horrible love life when everyone that I show remote interests would just wants to be friends. To me, I know that I am a very nice guy, I want my friends to be happy and I want everyone that I know to be happy. But sometimes I do think it is unfair that everyone just wants to be friends. It sucks and it happens so often that I lost confident in myself. I know I am confident in business, I am confident in technical knowledge but I am not in love and relationship.  So this whole thing is really bothering me and I just hopes that I know how Brian feels about me. It doesn't matter if he likes me or not, I just want to know so that I don't have to spend so much time thinking about it and worrying about it. I know I like him and I know that I can love him if he give me a chance but it will never work out if he doesn't share the same feelings as I do. I guess we will just have to wait and see how it goes. Luckily Brian is out of town for a week, so I have some time to calm down. Hopefully, I can be less nervous when I get to hang out with him next time. We will see how it goes. I am crossing my fingers and hoping for the best on this one. Love you guys. Take care. Ciao. Peter

I finally got my first subscribed issues of Advocate which I is very very very cool :O)  As for my love department, nothing happened as usual, but I guess I haven't been paying much attention to it recently neither so I guess that's ok :O)  As for meeting new people in town, got another new friend who happens to be a Canadian which is kind of cool I think :O) As for work, it is busy and crappy as usual... I just don't get any more time on my own... I am constantly working... which is driving me nuts... LOL... Hahaha... I donno... maybe the lack of sex and the over work is driving me crazy... hahaha, maybe I need to go pick someone up in the clubs or something... just kidding... although, for real, I really need to get a message... my body is all stress and in pain... anyway, right now i am trying to work out my plan for chinese new year hoilday... hopefully, i will get to see some friends back home :O) I can't wait!

      As promised yesterday, I am going to post some picture of my china office.  1) Small building on the left is the sample room / Big building on the right is the factory    2) Main Entrance    3) Inside the Sample Room    So what do you think? Looks very clean and sexy right? haha... I swear it is that clean everyday and we didn't clean it just for the picture :)  In the sample room, there's about 120 workers. In the factory next door, there's about 450 workers. Beside this factory, we also have 2 contracted factories that manufacture for my company. Besides the 3 factories, there's many other beadings company and embroidiery company that we need to co-ordinate. It is quite impressive in terms of logistic point of view to make sure everything is running smoothly. We need to make sure each factory has the proper materials at the right time. We also need to make sure all the beadings and embroidiery finish on time for each factory.  In our own company, we used track code to keep track of the production status of each lot of products. At each check point (Material Cutting, Beadings, Embroidiery, 3 different step of Sewing, 3 different step of Ironing, Quality Check, Packing), we will scan the bar code of each lot of products to ensure everything is running smoothly. Most people don't understand how complicate this is. Think about it this way, if something got mixed up, there is no way to figure out which pieces of material is for which dress and for each size unless there is some point of reference. So computer helps a lot and help make things much easier.  Anyway, I am working on a big post right now to summarized my experience so far since I worked in Hong Kong. I will post some pictures of my trip to Italy, France, Dubai, Lebanon, New York, Las Vegas, etc. Hopefully you will find it fun to read. Take care for now. Ciao Ciao.  Peter

      Ah... what a nice day here in China... yes, I am in my china office right now :) I will take some pictures of my office and show you guys in the next few days :) Pretty nice place, especailly in China... you probably won't find a factory in china that is cleaner and more beautiful then mine.... haha, I am not being cocky, but it is true. I have been to so so so many factories here, most of them got horrible working conditions... I really feel bad for the workers in those company. Some people who works for those company make less then USD100/month... I guess that's what we hear about all the time on the news in North America. But not everybody one makes that little money. Some people do make a good salary in Chinese standard, for example, some of the designer in my company could be making around USD2500/month. Of course that's not comparable to North America, but that's a lot of money in China, especially when you can get a meal for less then 25 cents US.  Anyway, it is about time to get back to work. I will post some pictures of my office in the next few days. In the mean time, have a nice day everyone :) Take care. Ciao.  Peter

      Testing this new blog setting...  Haven't make a new post for a while now... everything with me is good. I am now back in Hong Kong with a busy work schedule. Nowadays, I travel to China every Monday morning and return to Hong Kong every thurday afternoon. I spend Friday and the weekend in Hong Kong. Ususally, go out to the bars and the clubs in Hong Kong... pretty expensive to go out in Hong Kong but it is fun though :O) Recently, Rice bar seems like the popular place to be in Hong Kong... I don't understand why, that place is so small that everyone just flood outside on the street... I guess that's something fun to do??? Donno... hahaha... Anyway, I promise that I will post more often if I can... let's wait and see can I keep up or not. Take care everyone, Ciao.  Peter

       urlLink CBC - Canada Votes 2004   Election OH Election... it is election time again... It just gets people going on wonders who will win this election? Will there be a majority government? Will the Liberal lose? Will the opinion poll just be a bunch of jokes that people will vote for Liberal on election date anyway? Nobody will know until it actually happens...   As for voting, I was going to vote, but it is too late now... I didn't send it my ballot as it will not get back to Ottawa in time (for any overseas canadian, they need to mail in their ballot before election day to be counted)... so my vote will not counts... this is the horrible things about Canadian in another country who wanted to vote... it is not fair and they should have a better system of doing this... There's so many Overseas Canadian who will want a say in their government, in Hong Kong alone, there's an estimate of 200,000 Canadians who lives here... so there's a people who never have their say as to who should be their Prime Minister...   To me, I think technology will help... With our lives so connected with the internet anyway, why can't we vote online? If the government think this is not a safe approach... then why can't we vote at the Canadian Consulate around the world instead of mailing in the ballot? This is something the government should look into in future elections...   Anyhow... let's wait and see the results very very soon :O)  Peter oh Peter
