       urlLink    How many times have we heard it said, "Oh, Lord, give me a sign!" Alas, too often the reply is vague and ambiguous: the phone rings at an opportune time, a feather falls from out of the blue, a water stain appears that resembles a religious image. We all want to know if God exists; maybe He just needs a reliable method to let us know He's here.  urlLink  www.yo-god.com    urlLink

      Nothing much so far....i just have&nbsp;to take my camera, and&nbsp;fire away.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since i only got a little camera, i thought i would buy one of those SD memory card, i can only take 10 hi-res pictures at a time before having to give them to my computer, but&nbsp;no i won't take 70 low-low-res pictures like they say on the booklet.  This way i think, &nbsp;i can come up with very good pictures, what i realy like to look at and/or for you to look at.

      Doom 3 is out...after 4 years....long awaited game by many....but not by me, no sirrrry!!!! I've been burned realy hard with Unreal 2, not to be confused with any of the Unreal Tournament franchise. I mean Unreal 2, the sequel of Unreal...the father of all games....My 1st FPS(1st person shooter) Oh man i loved that game....so much!!! I even joined a clan. My name was (LPB)StalkerTheOne.....we were the low ping bastards!!! In those days cable use to rule the Internet, in my part of the neighbourhood....too many porn downloader got the best of me, then DSL came along.....Thank you very much!  -Back to Doom 3 now.......Unreal 2 was a big mistake....wanna know why???? They had the Magnificent idea of putting a so called "plot" into a FPS....what the hell is that?!?!?!?! I always made the comparaison with a porno movie....Is there a "plot" in a porno movie????? NOOOO It also goes for a FPS DAMIT!!!!!!!!!!!!! They destroy a realy good game by adding a plot to it.  Unreal 2 citation. Start citation here----------->" You've managed to land possibly the worst assignment in the most boring sector of the galaxy.That’s right, your patrolling the fringe worlds and as such, you're onlyproblems tend to be pissed off miners and corporation disputes. Until one day,you pick up a distress call……"   --Back to Doom 3...part deux. Well it seems that they did the same evil/awfull/despicable/awfull again thing that they did with Unreal 2...OMG! OMG! I bought Unreal 2 as soon as it came out, i didn't know about any plot at that time. So God and all mankind as my witnesses, I WON'T BUY DOOM 3.....that's what i was saying many months ago....untill........... I read some articles, saw ONE interview on tv with a so called "fan" with a tie and jacket...i mean c'mon man...wear a frikkin t-shirt!!!!!!!! I became very excited after that;-( I did a 2 outta 3 yesterday with my lucky penny to see if Lucky Penny would let me buy the game in peace..........I WON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Did i got the game yesterday????? NOOOOO!!!!!  I got to Wally-Mart this afternoon to get rechageble batteries for the living room remote(i got tired of throwing------>brand  Wally-Mart "game" isle....the sequel. Yup...nothing...no posters, no stickers(so you know it's coming soon)...no card-board standing thingy....last thourough look before i go, with my little 10$ battery pack in my left hand....nout/zilch/nada *sigh* I was looking at a "deluxe edition" of The Sims for 19$+ tax......oh man i gotta get out of here quick.....Hurry man before it's too late...GET OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  End.............or is it?!?!?!?  P.S.(1) I swear, i never played ANY "The Sims" game what so ever. P.S.(2) I didn't go to Stapples, just in case there are still copies of the game over there...i got to resist. P.S.(2.1) I don't play any console game....get it????????
