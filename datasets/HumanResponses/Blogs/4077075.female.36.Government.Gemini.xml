						    Well, I finally unpacked more boxes tonight, out of stuborness b/c Mickey really was freaking out about it.  But I have only a few more boxes and he has many more than I do now.     Tomorrow is the big night w/ the formal dinner w/ for my father's wedding reception - whoredevores at 6:30, seated dinner 7:15 including a harpist.  Mickey doesn't have a sport coat, I don't think he will even wear one at our wedding, which is ok, he can wear whatever he wants, as long as he shows up b/c he is so afraid of being in front of other people, bless his heart.  I know he loves me dearly and wants to spend his life w/ me and Lord knows I will never worry about him being unfaithful (that is probably why he could get by with it, if he ever did it).     They say the three most stressful things you can do in life is moving, getting married or divorced and loosing someone you love - and I will be doing all three w/in four months.  It's getting a little overwhelming at times, but I'm still pretty damn happy.  Just wish i could smoke in my computer room.  I think i will buy an air cleaner for the room and just do it and not discuss it w/ mickey, isn't that awful?  I enjoy smoking so while I write and I have this great novel going and I have to be able to do that!                                                                     Well tomorrow my manhattan sister who works for US magazine will come over and stay - it will be country mouse meets city mouse for sure.  I'm excited about it though b/c I do adore her and she is so bright.  Well I am going to go have a smoke and then go to bed, later.

						    Well, we moved into 'our home' july 17th.&nbsp; I still have a few boxes of crap and I don't know what to do w/ them.&nbsp; Mickey gave me two weeks to get unpacked - he's never moved before, this is his first time living out on his own - he doesn't realize it takes a while to get settled in.   Ah, we get married october 9th.&nbsp; I haven't done a thing yet, but order the cake, and she hasn't gotten back to me with a price, that might not be a good sign. I want a chocolate, chocolate wedding cake and it blew her mind.&nbsp; It's very cold in this basement bedroom - my little aclove room w/ my books, music and computer - my little place in the house. See I was on my own too long, i still need lots of space and privacy.&nbsp; I am set in my ways, yes I reckon that I am.  And I took in a stray puppy, I called Sugarfoot - we are going to find a good home for her, hopefully soon.&nbsp; She is very social and very sweet and cries when she's left alone, but only for a few minutes b/c she then is fast asleep.&nbsp; Well I'm going to take a hot bath and then go to bed.&nbsp; My first blog, I guess it's as exciting as anything else.&nbsp; :)

						   You may or may not believe me. But about a year ago I sat on my bed at Barclay drive w/ my little one, Iddy Biddy, or 'IB', and I said' I don't know how I will ever live w/you next to me, I love you so much" and he said to me laying all there sweet and snuggly, he said to me and I heard in my mind, 'You will never be away from me, unless you choose it. We are all joined together, we are all souls to this greater thing, this more important place, you just aren't evolved enough to feel it... the only seperation you have from others, including me when I go, is in you mind",. and that little doggie said all that to me, believe it or not, he was the sage being. He's right. I'm just not evolved enough and I do miss him. But every now and then I feel him as close as a wind breeze, as if he were in my arms and I know it's only my fault that I can't feel him or others that I miss so much.

						   I never really have anything great to say myself, I just have a good memory to repeat what others say,,, but I will say some quotes here... The first one is from my beloved that I said at the last Miac mtg and I hope was put in the minutes:  The bitter taste of poor quailty lingers long after the price is forgotten ( that is why we got a Kincaid bedroom suite and I better like it b/c we will have it our whole damn life along w/our kids and their grand kids) but I will say if you want to buy nice furniture and can find it here in knoxville, then call Gibsons Store in Andrews North Carolina and price it and they will deliver it for free here and were $500 less than the knoxville stores.   Other quotes: " It is a terrible thing   To be so open:it is as if my heart    Put on a face and walked into the world".. Sylvia Plath       The world will end in peace, because it is a place of war.  When peace has come, what is the purpose of the world?  The world will end in laughter , because it is a place of tears.  Where there is laughter, who can longer weep? In blessing it departs; it will not end as it began.     A Course in Miracles.    urlLink www.acim.org        I never saw the instance of one or two disputants concincing the other by arguement.  Thomas Jefferson      Wheras I formerly believed it to be my bounded duty to call other persons to order, I now admit that I need calling to order myself.  Carl Jung       Sometimes you win, sometimes you loose, sometimes you get rained out.  Satchel Paige       Love until it hurts.  Mother Theresa       Seeing death as the end of life is like seeing the horizon as the end of the ocean.  David Searls.       Even the promiscious feel pain. Warren Beatty       It is one of the most beautiful compensations of this life that no   man can sincerely try to help another without helping himself.  Ralph Waldo Emerson      If the only prayer you ever say in your whole life is thank you, that would suffice.  Meister Eckhart       Doubt is a pain too lonley to know that faith is his twin brother.  Kahil Gibran       What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.  Ralph Waldo Emerson.        From the moment I read my first love story I started to look for you, not knowing how blind that was, lovers don't finally meet, they are in each other all along... Rumi (will be heard at my wedding read by lisa h. )       That's enough for now, quote from Julie

						   My friend Chris went w/ his g/f to a great trip to india and egypt for one month and came back to find his mother in the hospital.  She isn't doing well at all and has been d/c to a skilled unit at a nursing home.  I have known her for years and she is one of the sweetest people I have ever met, she is like a lamb in the world, truly kind and sweet.  I hate to hear she is suffering.  Prayers for sweet Pat.

						   I have to tell everyone, this is the best book to read about the human experience, especially in southern appalachia.   It's all written in letters and she speaks as if she is talking w/you.  One of my favorite places says:  there has got to be one person who is the lover, and this time it was me, and one who is the beloved, which was Honey.  And I will tell you the truth, maybe it's best to be the lover, in some ways.  Because even if it don't work out, your are glad,  You are glad you done it. anyway.

						   Well, tomorrow is mickey's surgery.  He is so anxious, bless his heart.  Everyone at work told him horrible things about, b/c they are like that - they aren't supportive, they like to mess w/ people.  But fortunatley his best friend's father, Dr. Brook, who is a retired dentist, told him dr. Crawley was the BEST and that he wouldn't do it unless he needed it.  Hell, the dr couldn't even see inside his nose it's so messed up, he said 'you would break a nail trying to pick it'.  By this time tomorrow, he'll be a little bloody and I'll keep him doped up and he will be fine in a few days.  I didn't really have much pain w/ my sinus surgery and I had what he's having done plus everything else possible in that area, I got the platinum level of svs for the sinuses, all at a cost of $20 bucks, can you believe that?   Well, after this, he can go back to obsessing about standing up in front of people at the wedding and being afraid, I hate that for him and feel like I'm being one of those demanding brides for some big fancy wedding, but it's really not a big fancy wedding. But he did tell me months ago I could have anything I wanted, now, he's just feeling the anxiety.   I found this cool website called the 'I do foundation'.. it's  urlLink www.idofoundation.org .  and you can link your registry to it  and they get donations for charitable organizations and you can put in there for donations to places as well in leui of gifts and I did that also, yeah!  I'm excited about that.   My new computer, the second one, right out of the box is freaking out already, freezing up and acting all crazy.  I will pay someone to come and fix it for me!! Don't have a lot b/c I tapped us out on the honeymoon and new furniture and wedding, but I we could talk about the fee.  damn thing is brand new.  I don't mind to talk to someone in india named 'tim' really named something else, but jeesh, this is driving me nuts, it's not even three weeks old!   Where is that good karma again?  We had one tv die, the new one go out once, and this is the second computer I've had in a month brand new.  We have tech bad karma for sure, are we over some kind of friggin magnetic shield or what?

						   Well, yesterday I had to stay home b/c I had the mother of all migraines. I guess all my happiness exploded into my brain.  Today I came to work despite nausea and feeling still all funny w/ my brain - everything is too much stimulation and these lights at work are killing me - all this bright floresent light.  But I will make it. Tomorrow we take Mickey in for surgery, at 6:45.  They called from st mary's yesterday and said ' mrs. rogers'.. 'uh, not yet, but go ahead?" 'What?"  'GO ahead this is julie, i'm the one on his list w/ the release' 'Yes, julie rogers, we have instructions for your husband.'  He's nervous.  I told him him, I speak from experience, it will be fine, better than he thought.  I said 'it's what you make of it, if you think it's awful, it will be, if you think it will go well, it will, remember you write your own life'.  Once he gets over this he can worry about the wedding again - one big worry at a time, ha! He won't be able to go back to work until the dr releases him, which will be a few weeks b/c they won't let him do light duty and he can't do the construction work b/c it's too dusty and will raise his blood pressure.  So, he can lay around the house, watch tv, maybe read, for a few weeks.  Adn he has weeks and weeks of sick leave, so he can do this no problem.  Doesn't sound too bad to me.  Maybe he can cook dinner and have it ready for me when I get home! And keep up w/ the dishes and the laundry.  I cancelled w/ the cake lady yesterday due to my immense melon pain, she said she was very happy to hear that b/c strangely enough she had a migraine also!  Might have been the barometric pressure we surmised.  We will meet when she returns from the beach.  Mickey offered to go w/ me.

						   Bless his sweet heart.  I gave him a list of addresses to get tonight, saying it was all he had to do in the planning and he all swelled up and got all upset and I saw all this redness in his face and he said 'all I have to say is 'I DO" right?" and I said, "well you also have to say the part at the ring ceremony when the pastor will say 'I michael rogers take julie ratledge to blah blah blah' and he said 'OH NO that is just extra, I know you don't have to do all that, I said 'Mickey calm down, you will have to do that, but the pastor will tell you every word to say and it's not many, so don't worry, I told you I will get you a xanax'.  I said 'you know it is what you make of it, like you told me about picking the honeymoon, we would have a good time anywhere and you can think of it as this nerve wrecking terrible thing in front of people, or this wonderful thing where you will do wonderfully at and it will just flow naturally, don't be so upset, it will all be fine, and don't forget the xanax i will get for you. Perspective is everything and it's all about the love sweet boy"  my young apprentince ha.   He really did want to get married at the sevierville co-op.

						   Well, things are just coming together so beautifully.  The terrible pessimistic side of me says 'this is too easy',, but it's actually ok if things are that easy, sometimes they work out that, especially if you LET them.  Most importantly, I talked w/ my Dad, Jerry, about letting Jay, my stepdad also walk me to meet mickey , saying 'I have two arms', and he said he was quite fine w/ that!  What a load off, I tell you, I have been worried about that since day one b/c I have to include Jay b/c he is just a great  dad to me for the last fifteen years and so sweet to mom. He is about the sweetest man I have ever known, even though mom says he sometimes has a hard time apologizing, I know he doesn't have to do it very often.  I have a hard time saying sorry also.  I am very very Stuborn.  And I booked our honeymoon, what a load off that is also!! Jeezh, I have belabored that to death, trying to find the best deal for the money, wanting to do something different, then decided I would go w/ recomendations of a place a I knew what to expect and we will go to jamaica at couples swept away,, you can see it at  urlLink www.sweptaway.com .  We will have a great time and I got a place right on the beach, like a little hut on the beach for not much more than the regular room, I am so pleased.  And one less thing to worry about.  And I meet w/ the cake lady who also does flowers tomorrow. Then can you believe one more good thing today?  I called my mechanic who also does home repair to ask about working on my old house and after telling him what I wanted done he asked if I was going to sell or rent and I said "rent' and he said 'OH, I love your house, i want to rent it, the price is right'.. can you believe that, someone I trust that can also do the work and he will do it will if he decides to rent it, and would regardless.  That is just too many miracles for one day. But A Course in Miracles would say 'there is no order in miracles for God to do - they are all the same, great or small".  I am a lucky and blessed gal again.  Where the hell did I get this Kharma?

						   From a favorite book :Illusions by Richard Bach   Every person, all the events of your life   are there because you have drawn them there.    What you choose to do with them is up to you.          The world is your exercise-book, the pages   on which you do your sums.    It is not reality, although you can express reality    there if you wish.    You are also free to write nonsense, or lies, or to tear the pages.          Don't be dismayed at good-byes.    A farewell is necessary before    you can meet again.    And meeting again, after moments or lifetimes,    is certain for those who are friends.         The mark of your ignorance is the depth    of your belief in injustice and tragedy.    What the caterpillar calls the end of the world,    the master calls a butterfly.

						   Well, I am very pleased that a few are reading my blog. :) It's enjoyable just for myself anyways.  I had a nice weekend, the cook out went well - I made lots of food and it was almost all gone.  Mickey's friend from work brought a smoker and did 12 racks of ribs and they were all eaten.  I made cornbread casserole, squash casserole, tomato cucumber salad, fresh fruit, cookies, two kinds of cole slaw and mom brought deviled eggs.  Summer my neice was really sweet and happy as usual.  And we got unexpected housewarming gifts, yeah!  Three bottles of wine and some candles and several plants!  A skunk came by for a bit, but didn't stay long, I guess we weren't good company - maybe we smelled bad.  I got my invitations ordered, I hope they arrive in a few weeks!  My wonderful stepdad is working on what was a small archway, now is like a two room condo gazebo for the wedding.  He is the sweetest man ever.  We are so blessed.  I wish I knew how to link things to this blog, maybe someone will tell me :) hint hint Yesterday I enjoyed sitting on the deck and finished 'sam's letters to jennifer' by james patterson and it was a nice book.  I line dried several loads of clothes and sheets/towels and felt good about that b/c not using the dryer didn't pull  extra power off the grid adding to the pollution from the tva coal power plants that are killing the Smokies- maybe that relieves some guilt from driving mickey's big truck to work each day.  And the crunchy towels really dry well and are like a loufa in a way - mickey said they really remove more dead skin.  He is so funny.  He was very sweet and playful last night and wanted extra cuddle time.  He didnt' sleep well. I think he is more anxious than he is saying about his surgery on thursday.  I went to the receiving of friends for my supervisors grand daughter.  She was only 25, that is really tragic. Peace and prayers be with them as they try to heal and make sense of it all.

						   I just wonder....  Today I saw an old friend, we were so close for such a long time and then drifted apart b/c she had a kid and mostly b/c her life was too dramatic for me and I couldn't deal w/ that, the fights she and her man had all the time were downright putting me down the road after the years. Yelling, screaming, in public, it didn't matter and she's a social worker! But anyway, I had tried to reconnect w/ her recently, b/c even when friendships do change and fall by the wayside, I STILL DON'T LIKE THAT, however necessary that change may be, it still makes me fell all willy inside. Well she acted like she didn't see me and then even acted like she didn't hear me. So even after a brief forced conversation when it was clear she didn't' want to even talk w/ me, I was saddened. Then a bit pissed. So I mentally crossed her name off my wedding list... Why try to be nice when someone clearly doesn't even give a shit and gives half ass false bravado. I've already invited way too many people to the wedding, but I'm sure many won't show, but if they do, that is great. Because I REALLY want to share this special day w/ people that I love around me. I think what I have planned will be really special. I know Mickey will cry and he is worried about that. He cried listening to our wedding song last night, that was so sweet!! I will talk w/ Dr. crawley next week about giving him a script for three xanax for his wedding, surely he won't think that is drug seeking. His surgery is next week on his nose that is so freakishly crooked that even Dr. crawley was freaked out. Well that deer got him back. He killed the deer and now he has surgery.. But it's still not quite an eye for an eye is it? It was a hunting accident where the gun kicked back and the scope broke his nose. I guess that's it's for now, if anyone reads this, please let me know. Love you all, Julie

						   The Guest House  This being human is a guest house. Every morning a new arrival. A joy, a depression, a meanness, some momentary awareness comesas an unexpected visitor.  Welcome and entertain them all! Even if they are a crowd of sorrows, who violently sweep your house empty of its furniture, still, treat each guest honorably. He may be clearing you out for some new delight.  The dark thought, the shame, the malice. meet them at the door laughing and invite them in. Be grateful for whatever comes. because each has been sentas a guide from beyond. -- Jelaluddin Rumi, translation by Coleman Barks

						   It is just so pretty! It's looks like a vintage gown! Well, I met mother at David's Bridal boutique - OMG, I have to tell you, everyone should have to endure this torture (as well as waiting tables for at least six months of their lives). You go in and they ask all these questions - bra size, shoe size, even said 'are you willing to give the name of the groom to us'.. Now what is that all about? "Uh, no it's a secret and he doesn't' know yet, or he's in the federal witness protection program'. 'Uh, do you want my blood type also and the name of my second grade teacher?"  Seriously, then I had one lady, shana who was my personal assistant. I got to know her, or I should say, she got to know me much better than I had wanted - she was all up in my boundaries! She was all in my dressing room, edging my mother out and saw my boobs at least five times. Then they give me this flounce puffy slip to put on and a bra that weighed about 10lbs w/ foam! I get in one of these fluff ball outfits that looks like Disney exploded on my ass and stand on a platform in front of a huge mirror and she starts putting veils on me, even though I say I'm not wearing one - then,, get this, she gets out the Tiara! I'm not kidding! I was scrunching up my face exhibiting the pure excruiation of it all! Someone behind me said 'smile' this is a happy day, ugh! Then after the fourth dress and exhibition of my breasts to my new friend and assistant Shana, I am just about to freak out - my mother is giggling -she went from tears to laughter at my expense! I did like one of the fluffy dresses and of course it was the most expensive in the store $1200. Shana was so close I noticed many times that she had rather refreshing breath. Well, when we left, well I ran, out of the store and went to lunch and mother and I planned the food for the heavy whoredurve buffet, and we went by the hairdresser's next door - Scotty, the effeminate heterosexual, to make an appt for my color and test run hair do two weeks before the wedding. then we went to white lace and satin or something like that and it was a much better experience - but they order the dresses and it takes four months to get one in, unless you can find one of the try on dresses in your size, which I didn't. I wasn't followed around, didn't have someone I didn't know see my rack, and no one forced a freakin tiara on my head! Well I still didn't find anything and was getting discouraged and mother took me back to my car. I thought, well, I'll go by dillards since I am close by, what the hell. And I didn't find anything at first and was about to leave, but my little intuition voice said 'go back to the designer area' and there it was!! It was exactly what I wanted and in my size! I had to get the lady to get it down for me b/c it was on a very high display and she said 'well, we were talking the other day what a beautiful dress this would be for a wedding dress' and I said 'that is my hope also' and she got excited, but not in my boundaries, thankfully! She brought me a few other dresses, but as soon as I tried this one, I knew. It's vintage and flowy and has different cut lengths and is slightly off the shoulder! So I bought it and called mother! She was upset she hadn't been w/ me, but I went straight to her house at her request 'you must keep it here away from Mickey'.. And I tried it on and she just cried!! And her four month old 4 lb miniature poodle grabbed the bottom of it and almost ripped it! It really is beautiful and will look even better when I loose more weight. I'm so excited!! Well, and My friend Linda and I patched up our differences today after a two week hiatus and I have to say that is just one more good thing - that makes me happy and swells my heart. In fact tomorrow we are going to go register for gifts for Mickey and I b/c he has no interest in it. It will be fun!! She also said she would plan a shower for me!! Yeah!! So, it has been a wonderful day, a day of bliss and blessings. I am a lucky gal. I hope I can spread some sunshine to others, that is also another good thing if one can do it. Although being a state employee, esp an inspector, I'm really not supposed to be a ray of sunshine or even have a personality, and esp no sense of humor.  I was once called satan by a program director and I wasn't even being an asshole!!

						   I think the things Mickey and I want, not need, but want and what I want for the wedding are so silly when I think about friends in need, needing things. I Mean, he is the guy saying he is a christian, but I am the one thinking about being spirutial and that to me is more than the church. And knowing other people are in need and we want to buy this bedroom set that cost 3k sounds just crazy to me now. I have talked to him about us living what we both believe, even we don't agree on the fundamentals, we both agree on the teachings of Christ. Of course I am also a Sufi, mostly, and then a buddhist, but always honor the teachings of Jesus b/c he was a master of teachings, I believed the church just so misued them for their own use. I mean, jeesh they made Mary M out to be whore on purpose to take power away from her being the disicple to the disciple and corrected it in 1969, opps, their bad, jeesh. Well, I told Mickey, and he agreed, that after we got these terrible self wishes of material things in our home, then we would have to outreach to others w/ how blessed we are. WE make a good living the two of us and even if I owe a debt back loan to my parents, we can still quit being selfish consumers and give back. This consumership w/ his 3K tv and our bedroom set does make think that we are being total selfish assholes.  And I'm looking at bridal gowns tomorrow and that is exciting. I hope I look pretty b/c I have felt frumpy for a very long time. I have lost 8 lbs and that is good. And my real dad, jerry is sending me a check for half of the wedding expenses now.. it's like lay a way dowry... but I undertand his concerns.   Oh and I'm so proud of my homophob man b/c this week he said I had to invite my fem gay cousin w/ her g/f over to our housewarming/ thanks for helping us move party. He has these ideas about gays, then when he's w/ Amy, he just loves her. He's getting better. I think a lot of it is b/c his best friend is in love w/ him. He was so torn up by us moving in together and getting engaged he moved to asheville. When came over here the weekend we moved, he couldn't even look at me, bless his heart. He so loves him. I'm glad Mickey doesn't read my blogs, he would kill me!  I do love him and can't wait to marry him and continue our life together. That is enough for tonight.  Well I have to go to bed b/c I'm looking at bridal gowns tomorrow w/ my mom, she rocks!!!

						   My dear friend Sande sent me this from one of my favorite dudes the Dalai Lama:  I believe there is an important distinction to be made between religion and spirituality. Religion I take to be concerned with belief in the claims to salvation of one faith tradition or another--an aspect of which is acceptance of some form of meta-physical or philosophical reality, including perhaps an idea of heaven or hell. Connected with this are religious teachings or dogma, ritual, prayers and so on. Spirituality I take to be concerned with those qualities of the human spirit--such as love and compassion, patience, tolerance, forgiveness, contentment, a sense of responsibility, a sense of harmony, which bring happiness to both self and others.  -His Holiness the Dalai Lama

						   Well, I can't type long, Mickles is going to sleep on the couch downstairs b/c I want to stay up and watch tv in bed for a bit tonight.  The ENT, Dr. Crawley said his nose was all messed up like I had been saying, so he's going under the knife in a few weeks and I'll be nurse nightingale.  More later, jules

						   Where is my upcoming weekend? I have too much to do and am freaking out - stuff to do for the wedding. I called another cake maker and left a msg including 'I want a chocolate/chocolate cake, let me know if that freaks you out.',, I'd rather know right away of course. Well, I accidentally left maisy in the bedroom today -Mickey wants all the doors shut to the bedrooms when we aren't here so there is less pet hair on the carpet and so I was good about shutting the door - just left my neurotic cat in there all day who dug up the carpet trying to get out, bless her heart. Mickey talked w/ me nicely about it and was able to cut out the bad carpet and you can't tell. Oh my.. moving, marriage, pets :) gotta love it all.  I got all the pictures from my dad's wedding reception printed out and have them ready to mail out to Ingela, Jerry (dad) and grandmother.  I think I'll have to take this computer back b/c the power button continues to fall off and I've only had a little more than a week, that is depressing, at least I could get a new one and that is a blessing.  I talked w/ a travel agent and hope to hear some estimates on trips.  I caught Mickey smoking downstairs last night, what about that - guess he wouldn't mind an air cleaner so badly, ey? Well we just talked about it out in the garage and he was groovy down w/ it, said actually 'I don't give a shit'..  He's going to an ENT tomorrow at my insistence b/c he has horrible breathing problems (from a hunting accident) and snores like a freight train. I hope it will help him, it's the same Dr who gave me the rootor roter up my nose.  well time for the hot bath and the bed.

						   From the unitarian universalist listserve someone sent out this interesting nugget by Bishop Muzorewahere:  Do It Anyway  People are unreasonable, illogical, and self-centered. Love them anyway.  If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfish ulterior motives. Be kind anyway.  If you are successful, you will win some false friends and true enemies. Succeed anyway.  The good you do today will be forgotten tomorrow. Be good anyway.  Honesty and frankness will make you vulnerable. Be honest and frank anyway.  What you spend years building may be destroyed overnight. Build anyway.  People need help, but may attack you if you try to help them. Help them anyway.  In the final analysis, it is between you and God. It was never between you and them anyway.

						   Well, the weekend came and left leaving full and rich memories and quickly at that with a serious thievery of my sleep hygiene.  Ah, to have just a few more days off would have been grand. Mom called me today 'we have got to get together and plan this wedding'. Seeing as how it is two months and one week away, she is probably onto something. We've found the name of a new cake maker since the last one never called me back. I had also asked her to make a lemon type groom's cake w/ some kind of hunter/fisher theme - well perhaps shaped like a crappie, that may have also blown her mind, but she could have said 'you are crazy, no way' instead of being a string me along cake maker. The puppy kept us up all night, crying, barking and whining (and the our neighbors I'm sure - they have to be so glad we moved in!)  last night. I finally put her in the bed and she went to sleep around four thirty. She was adopted out today, Thank you God. Saturday was an interesting festival of family dysfunction for my dad's wedding reception dinner. It's amazing to have a room of 20 people and it be quiet enough to hear a pin drop - those awkward moments of hour long pregnant pauses in the conversation were excrutiating, not to mention the then forced go around the table and say something nice about my dad and his new wife - talk about being put on the spot. Well fortunately, the wine flowed freely and we had a pack of smokes in the truck for our survival afterwards. Everyone said how handsome mickey was in his shirt/tie - the only guy not wearing a sport coat, but who cared anways. I told them I know he is out of my league, but he doesn't know that, that's what matters. My sister Ingela came to our home afterwards to stay w/ us. We had the most wonderful time talking, chatting, philosophizing until three in the morning! Then up at seven (egads!) to meet my brother, his wife and my beautiful niece Summer at Cracker Barrell, which Ingela loves living in Manhattan and all - and she was amazed at the Walgreen and Superwalmart. S he just purchased a 600 sq foot studio co-op for $240,ooo and I do believe she got a good deal.  Can you imagine?  She loves the city life.  And of course, you can just about get used to anything, good or bad, big or small. Thank you Cathy for reading my blog. I will write you back soon and I enjoy your blog. Knox county schools really suck!  Well, seeing how I got hardly any sleep the last few days, I am cruising my way to a hot bath and then bed! Mickey just found me 'blogging' and he said I probably needed to make more friends or get out more, the whole concept freaked him out, but then he doesn't even know how to turn a computer on, so it's not his thang baby.  But maybe, I stayed down here long enough that he folded the laundry!  Oh, that's just crazy talk....
