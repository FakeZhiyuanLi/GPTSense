       Opponent:  Chris Madden  Score:  1-6; 0-6    Note to self: Retire if you have an injury.   -Match Summary-   So this guy, he's ranked 16 in NorCal, so I think he's pretty good. My return of serve definetly needs some work. He totally hammered me with his lefty kick serve, which was killing me. I swung at air sometimes. He was really good though. I mean he ate my serve alive. My shoulder was killing me so I could only hit seconds. I had some really good rallies though. If my shoulder wasn't hurting, I could've gotten a lot more games off of him. That's a shame. It's easier to not play passive against good people.  - What I learned-       Retire if you have an injury  You need to get your return of serve going

       Opponent:  Kuni Natsuki  Score:  6-2; 6-3  Good match, Nick!  - Match Summary-   I played against the perfect opponent to play against. Average serve, average strokes, average everything. He couldn't hit winners and he hit the perfect balls to hit winners against. I took advantage of his second serve and got a lot of winners off of that, and I got a lot of winners off my serve too. I was serving huge that day. It helped me not play passive. I was in a good rhythm. I threw in some slices during the rally and that screwed him up sometimes. So I kept doing that, and it worked well. I was still a little scared to go for some shots though, and as I neared the end, I got nervous because I thought about how I was going to win. That made me play tight and I got nervous. I was luckily able to fight through it.  - What I Learned-     Find a good rhythm and try to stick with it  Go for shots and the right time  Pay attention to opponent more and what he does and doesn't do well against

       Opponent:  Conor Feeney  Score: 0-6; 0-6     I've played a lot of matches before this one, and I have it in my tennis binder, but all those should just be thrown away because this match was a huge turning point for me.  - Match Summary-   Well, I definetly didn't play my game. Infact, this is the most passive I have ever played in my life. This guy wasn't bad though, it's not like I lost to a pusher. He was ranked pretty high when he was playing 14's.  Basically, I got my fucking assed kicked. I could not get a serve back because my returns suck and when I play passive, I can't get a ground stroke back. Basically, what he did to me was just man-slaughter.  I'm so glad I played this match though, especially because Zoltan came. After the match, he totally hammered into my head to not play passive. He's been telling me that a lot, but I mean after a defeat such as this one, The Feeney Fiasco, I realize that I have really got to start ripping those balls.  - What I Learned-     Not to play passive anymore  Work on returns  Work on match play  ... Work on everything

       Opponent:  Arunsrikrishna Garlapati  Score:  6-2; 3-6; 4-6  Stupid judges don't give defaults for people that are 45 minutes late.   -Match Summary-     First set, I was owning. Ripping returns, ripping winners, ripping the short balls. I was on my way to victory.  Second set I was up 3-1. The slight thought of victory ran through my head, just like it did when I was playing against Kuni.  I tightened up, lost my intensity a little bit, lost a little composure, and started missing my shots. I started double faulting, and my first serve percentage dropped.  Third set I played a little smarter. There were some points where I just thought to myself, "What the fuck?... I hit that!?" And it felt so good. I still remember 2 of my backhand winners. It went something like this.    Serve  Return  Forehand down middle  He returns with forehand down the line, not a really good one though  I hit a sharp backhand angle  He runs it down and hits it back cross court  I rip a backhand down the line and it hits the outside of the baseline corner   That was awesome. And then there was this other point where I hit a forehand cross court and he gets a weak return, high and weak, and I just run up to it, and hit it well on the rise cross court for a winner.  *Shiver*  I lost the third set. I don't know how I lost my serve at 4-4. I was holding up till then fine. I had two games that were 15-40, and I just didn't break! I had too much emotion. When I calmed down in the third set, I played with more of my brains, but I still went for a lot of returns. Serving into the sun is hard, but I adjusted.   -What I Learned-    Stay calm, and play smart  Don't think about the end of the match! Think about NOW  Play strategies  Find balance point

       -Returns-   HUGE Progress! I love kick serves now, unless they have a lot of pace... and go out wide... But other than that I love to return them! I get my raquet on a lot of fast serves too. Not hitting a backhand slice is improving, unless I have to of course, I love my return right now.  - Forehand-   Huge progress. I feel so much more comfortable with my forehand right now. Pace, no pace, short, high, low, it's great. I just don't go for as much as I am able to.  - Backhand-     Solid. Some more topspin would be nice though.  - Serves-   *Shoulder Injury*  - Volleys-     Backhand volley needs some placement work. I need to keep the raquet out infront, but my forehand volley is in good condition.

       Opponent:  Samuel Sergerstorm  Score:  5-7; 4-6  Never have I ever played a 'pusher' this good.  - Match Summary-   I still think I had a little bit of passiveness in my playing today. I didn't go for my shots completely, but I didn't not go for them completely. I was forced to come to net today, and I learned that my volleys during match play aren't that good. I need to work on that. I still can't get over the fact on how good he was at pushing. I tried to push the net a couple of times and either I just missed the easiest volleys, or I'd get lobbed and then start over again from the baseline.  It's funny because only one or two points cost me the match. I missed about six easy volleys... more like six easy put aways. I fought through the passivness though! That was my main goal. It keeps getting better and better.  An important note: I started off bad, down 0-3. But I thought to myself, I'm going for my shots, and I'm missing, but just keep going for them. At 0-3, I broke him because I finally found my range, and I found a good rhythm with it. I'm proud of myself for not stopping to go for my shots.   -What I Learned-      I need to start playing with  strategies   Play without being passive COMPLETELY  Work on volleys during matches  Shot variety  I'm serving well   -Doing this on the internet is so much easier than writing it with a freakin' pen.

       -Returns-   Returns have gotten so much better. Most second serves I try my best to jump on, but I'm so glad that I can return crazy kick serves now. I need to work on my backhand return though. I have so much time to just switch my grip and hit a two handed back hand, but somtimes I just wait until it's too late to switch grips and hit a dinky slice return. So far so good!   -Forehand-   Running forehand is getting to become a nuisance. I either shank it, or net it. Have to work on that. For some reason I can't hit freakin' balls that are just floating. I have to work on that too.  - Backhand-   Ever heard of 'Consistency'?  - Serves-     *Shoulder Injury*  - Volleys-   ... Don't remember :) I think they are okay...

       -Returns-   Backhand return has gotten so much better, crazy better. When I try to put some juice on my returns, it gets pretty inconsistent.   -Backhand-   Backhand is solid. It should pretty much be 100%, but sometimes I'm still missing some easy shots. Technically, I think the only thing I'm doing wrong is I don't bend my knees 20% of the time. I'm very comfortable with my backhand.  - Forehand-   I come off my forehand when I have easy shots. I don't feel comfortable with my forehand. I usually play it safe with my forehand. I need to figure out how to get the solid feeling that I have on my backhand, and get it on my forehand side as well. Man, if I could do that I'd feel so good. I really like my inside out forehand play.  - Serves-   My second serve is coming back now. My first serve is getting some huge pace on it but I need to remember to flatten it out and really snap to get it in the damn box. Stupid box, why couldn't it be bigger.  - Volleys-   I'm feeling a lot more comfortable with my volleys. Sometimes I just drop my wrists, but it doesn't happen too much. My footwork is a lot more active at net.  - Short Balls-   Just MAKE THE DAMN BALL!

       Opponent:  Alan Alvister;  Pablo Schurig  Score:  4-6; 1-6  Open players aren't Gods.   -Match Summary-   Zoltan and I were SO capable of winning that match. I didn't play to my full potential. The first set, we were playing awesome. As the match dragged on, my serve kept getting worse and worse, and it made us lose the first set 6-4. It gets me so angry missing those easy shots. At 15-40, we had double break point and the ball was just floating in the air and I missed the volley. It was so stupid. I'm starting to realize that I cannot miss anything anymore. I have to stop missing 100%. I can't let things like miss timing the ball happen anymore. I have to stroke the ball the same everytime. My strokes are getting better at the disciplinary part of that, but my volleys aren't. My volleys aren't really as extensive as my strokes though.  As the second set dragged on, I kept fucking double faulting! It makes me want to go out and serve a million serves everday now! I'm so angry that I did that! I  have  to start making my serves, especially if it's my second serve. Man, if my serves were in, we would've won for sure! These 'Open' Players aren't even that great.  Every easy volley I miss makes me want to go on a ball machine and hit a million volleys.  I love returning kick serves! I love it more than anything. I don't returning flat serves that much.  - What I Learned-       Hit serves daily  Work on volleys extensively  Make everything to best of ability  Don't miss easy stuff anymore!

       We have somewhat of a rat problem in our house. Everyone in my house have seen the rats, but I haven't--until now.  I was laying on the ground, moving my foot back and fourth, relaxing comfortably. I saw a borderline of black over this box and I caught in the corner of my eye. It disappeared, and I shook my leg again because I thought it was just the reflection of the box.  I sit on the couch now, and then all of the sudden, a rat is staring right at me. I stare back at it for about 5 seconds, and then it runs towards me, and goes under my legs, and under the couch I was sitting on.  I jumped on the couch freaked out, and I swear it felt like I had a broom in my hand with an apron on.   And then I laughed at myself.  Hahaha.

       Life.  If you look up life in the dictionary, you'll get a shit load of definitions.   Call me crazy, but what's this new idea? If you accept everything in life, you'll live happily? Yes... Yes...! Yes! What a brilliant idea!  I'm sure other people have thought of this before. Isn't it weird how some opinions are wrong? When you say, or do, or follow one thing... my gosh this is so confusing. I mean, how can people determine whether something is right or wrong? There are so many ways to do different things and there are so many ways to say different things, how is it possible for someone to disagree. Why can't people accept?   I'm not talking politics. I'm talking about the high school life, where everyone lives and dies by their own decisions.   Say, a guy wears an earing on his left ear. I don't remember where I heard this, but if a guy where's his earing on his left year in some place he's considered gay, but if it's here, he's not? Sorry if I got that wrong, but I mean--  I don't know.  I live my life, really accepting. I accept a lot of things. It took me a long time to figure out how to do it, but eventually I did. I live my life really happily now. If you look at what you have, even if you have nothing, and you accept it, you would really be suprised how much happier you would be.   I've worked SO hard on accepting, that there are only a few things that I cannot except, but still working on--  You know it's funny. Don't critisize me or anything, I'm just saying this from experience. When people say that they can't be accepting because it's too hard; yah, no shit! I mean it really does take time. I hit an all time low in my freshman year once, and I was just like, "Wow, whatever. I don't even care about anything anymore." And who would've thunk it, it made me happier! Now, I'm not saying, saddness is the key to accepting. I've had the idea in my head, or tried to, during that bad phase. I had it in my head for about my year, and I believed in accepting everything even if I didn't. I just had to pretend to believe that I did, and eventually I did! So now I'm super accepting, and super happy.  --But right now, I just can't accept getting over Eryn.   Whatever.   That's a whole 'nother post.

       Today in english--hold on. Let me change the song...   Incubus sounds good.  So today in english, we get our progress reports back. I saw that I had a zero on one of my assignments and then I actually got the paper back, only it said, "Copied paper. 0/22. Looks just like Kim Wongs." Then I was like, "Shit. -_-"  It's kind of funny though because I know that if it were freshman year or eight grade, I would be able to lie. But for some reason, I just couldn't lie. I couldn't say, "Yah, we were working on it together." Or, "Yah, it's coincidence." I think that I'm happy with the way I am now. The way that I accept things. I got the paper back and it was more of a 'well, I cheated and I have to accept the consequences', whereas I would normally freak out and be like, 'must think of an excuse!'   I had to accept the guilt from Kim crying since her grade was bad and all I could say was sorry. But sometimes, facing the music is really what makes me feel good. I'm not saying I don't lie. For some reason, I just can't lie if it's about something that I have done. If someone asks me if their pretty, I'd be like yah you're cute.   I think that it's unfair that I'm saying this because I am blessed with certain things that enable me to. If I was damn ugly, depressed, and whatever, then I couldn't just say that you have to accept yourself. So I guess that when people read this and feel offended(I don't know why), then it's all good. I'm not calling you ugly or anything...  You know, whenever I talk to Janice Stevens, I seriously say something stupid. It's hilarious--(flash back to history class)--  Jordan Meeks is talking about how Hooters opened and Janice said that she wanted to work there, and I said I can see why. But that was just kind of reflex, I didn't take into account her physical features or anything and everyone said I was an idiot because I don't think about what I said. Then she said her full name and I thought it sounded french, and I said, "Are you French or stupid?" Instead of saying 'French or Something'. Hahaha. Ohhhhh god damnit that's so funny.  So yah, I can't lie about things I've done, and I should've just said that because people don't really care about what happens about my day, they just want to know the subjects.

       So I have been playing violin for a long time now--about seven years. Since Zoltan started that new program, I knew I wouldn't be able to do it anymore. I went to lessons today, without my things 20 minutes early. I thought I was 5 minutes early but I wasn't. Eryn was taking her lesson(It was really nice to see her), and I told Mrs. Bret that I had something important to talk about.  Eryn's lessons is over, and then I go inside and talk to her. It's really sad because this past year, Mrs. Bret and I have gotten so close. She's like my counselor. I told her about all my problems and stuff. I told her about my girls problems. She even gives me advice! I'm really going to miss just seeing her and stuff. It sucks a lot because we have, pretty much, a history of 7 years together. She said that it was a real shame because she saw a lot of talent in me, but she said that she respected my choice, like I knew she would. I really hope she invites me to her recitals still. Hopefully Eryn will too.  Seeing Eryn today was really nice. I have a lot of feelings for her. Yes STILL =). It's finally out in the open. Hope she calls me back--  I went to tennis after I talked to Mrs. Bret. It really sucked. I told Zoltan about it, and he said that it's understandable why I'm down, but I can't let that affect my tennis. I was playing well. You see, this is where I got my positive attitude from. I remember when I went through that whole obsession over Ashley, I was really sad playing tennis. I'd get really frustrated and then 2 months later, it's just like, "Nick, block it out." And, finally, I did! It was a break through. And finally, after that happened, I could block out anything. That's why I'm always happpy. I always found the irony in everything, and I always thought it was funny.  I don't know if it was true happiness, or just an act that I was able to put up subconsciously. I'm not going to rethink this stuff again. Fuck that, man.

       I remember when I watched Kill Bill Vol. 2, I could not get over the concept that, that one eyed chick brought up. Something about finally achieving your lifetime goal, do you regret it? Or are you relieved? I'm thinking they meant regret because when you have a lifetime goal, you spend... your life searching for it. Nevermind, I'm sure you guys understand it.  So anyhow.  Life is good.   Even though I will probably get a lot of destructive critisism--  I think that I really want to take my tennis to a serious level. Like, the scholarship level, or pro level. So you're thinking, "What!? Number 5 Varsity?" But I don't know. I've only been playing, for what, a year and five months? Zoltan says I have a lot of potential--(Flash Back)  Zoltan is my tennis coach. It's really interesting how I met him. So you all know about Eryn, yes, Eryn Parker--(Flash Back)  I met Eryn for the first time when I was a good, healthy, seven years old from my first violin recital. I never got to know her until Freshmen year, where we played in the same orchestra together, and getting to know her was probably one of the most awesome things that's ever happened to me. She plays violin, soccer, and tennis.(Other Flash Back)  Well one day, during the summer, I decided to go over to one of Eryn's practice sessions for tennis. Beforehand, she talked about this guy named 'Zoltan' and how it was funny that he had the same name as the guy in 'Dude Where's My Car'. While I'm watching their conditioning part of the practice, he comes up and talks to me. Then he gave me his card. I was like, "Dang, you got a card?" He was like, "Yah."  I go home, talk to my dad about this thing, and then we decide to give it a try, and who would've thought I liked it! It's really funny because you know that one day that I went to watch Eryn play? That was Zoltan's last week working, and if I didn't go, I would've never met him. I mean, this is pretty much the only reason I believe in fate. That's, "Huge!"  So we've been working for about a year now, and--(Re-entering Present)  He also thinks I can make this a huge part of my life.   I've been playing three hours of tennis everyday now that I think about it...   Do I have a life...?  No =)! I mean socially I'm fine. I get along with pretty much everyone I meet. I don't have a problem with anyone, and if they have a problem with me, I really don't care. Infact, I could care less. Infact! I care less, right now!  I think I've finally got that hammered into my head so much, that I just don't care about bad things that happen because they really aren't that bad? I think that if people worked on caring less about drama and how they stand socially, things would be so much easier for them.  But whatever, people live the way they want to.  Do you like how I was talking about tennis and then high school drama?   I like what blogger has done with the place.  It's nice-

       I'm a person who believes that if you have something that you can do that makes you happy, then you should try and pursue that your whole life. But I was thinking, I mean what if whatever makes you happy is a really bad thing?  I mean for me it's tennis, so that's not too bad. But what if it was robbery or something. I've talk to someone and they said that they enjoy sex, and they don't mind all the things that people talk behind their back. I was at a little disagreement, but they said that they enjoy it(duh) so I mean... what can you do?  Well I don't know, kind of a lame post, but you get what I'm trying to say?  I hope?

       Isn't it weird how people can hate people they don't even know. I was looking at Joey R's subprofile, and I checked out the list that was 'fags'. I don't think that he knows half of them. Not like I care or anything, I mean I hate people that I don't even know.  I think even more weird how people can love other people without even knowing them. But then again, that happened to me a lot freshman year too.  I hate how I can't control that.

       Forget the opinions post, this is way better.   Seriously, when I look back a year or two, or three, or four--I just think to myself what a huge waste it was. I mean really! What a huge waste of fourteen years. Now that I think about it, nothing has really mattered at all except for the end of freshman year. That's when things really started to click, and that's finally when I started living life right.  I'm sure you guys can remember Ownagi and that was some pretty lame shiz, huh? Man, when I think about last year, frosh year, I was such a coward. I never stuck up for myself, I was a sad little asian, but things change. Everything changes. You know, before soph. year, grades didn't even matter that much! But hell, I've gone through so many changes in my lifetime.  I'm very confident right now. I'm so excited for next year. I'm going to go into Junior year with no fear or doubt in myself. Even though I walk around high school alone, rarely dreary, I always feel confident. I don't know how, but I do, and that's what I like the best about myself, the best 'change' I've ever picked up.  You know, when I came into high school, I came into it totally oblivious and totally immature. I was not goal oriented at all, and I went on feeding off of everyone's drama. Lets see, now? Now, I feel like I know so much more of... of things that peoeple should just know about on a day to day basis. Now I have tennis! Do you know how good it feels to really have something you're working hard for? I mean spending hours and hours and being completely dedicated. I hope it pays off.  I don't really go around with the crowds so much anymore. I don't remember the last time I haven't stuck by my opinion. It's not really like, "Oh I think this is so cool unless someone cooler than me doesn't think it's cool." To me, now, it just seems like a way that you can conversate with someone better. "What!? No way, that sucks teh cock." And then you become best friends, happily ever after.  That was pretty much all I was going to post about opinions anyway...  I don't know why I'm going to say this really random thing but--  My goal in life is to make my dad proud. Sure I want to make my siblings proud of me, and of course I want my mom to be proud of me, but if I could make my father be really proud of some great accomplishment, then I can die happy.   This post is crazy! All the sentences are hell of out of order. Sorry for being so spontaneous.  Now that I think about opinions, I think that having no opinion is stupid. Talk about another change that took place in me. I remember when I used to say that there are so many outs to everything that thinking that all of them are right in a certain way is the right way to think. No!  Hell no! That's so stupid. At least in my opinion it is. I don't really have respect for people that say they are liberals. I'm going to steer away from talking about politics though because I don't know jack shit about it, but I think that if you have a strong belief, even if you know it's wrong, then you should still believe it.   I don't know what the hell I'm talking about, this post is just getting more and more out of order and sloppy.  -See ya!

       If I could live my life right now with no memories of that past, I think I would be so much happier. I don't really know if that's true because without memories, I'd probably act different or something, but if I could keep my current composure and forget the past, then living life would be a bike ride in the park. Incidentally, I don't know how to ride a bike.  But anyway,  The other night, I was just relaxing, trying to sleep because I stayed up all night playing poker. I hear my brother playing some music and it was from one of these video games that I played a really long time ago. If you were ever a video gamer and you played an RPG game, you would know that if it took you a long time to beat it, say 50 hours or so, then it had some sentimental value to you, especially if it had a shitty ending. But you spend so much time on the game, it just depresses you that it's over, I guess. Then thinking about those RPG games brings me back to those time periods.  You know, we're never going to be able to be kids again. Isn't that weird? I was thinking about my baby cousin who is 2' tall in Kindergarden. I don't remember being 2'  tall  short! I wonder what that was like.   But really, I think the past is the only thing that can truly haunt someone. Did I post about this before!?   I'll post about opinions next time.  -Nick.  P.S. For those people that were at poker last night, and when George asked me if I had the 2's or not and I lied? Sorry for being a hypocrite and posting about not lying and stuff but it was a rushy decision and we're playing for money. When George showed me his cards, I was going to say that I didn't have them and just not show my cards, but I don't know. Money? Sorry George.  -Nick.

       Damn, last night when I was sleeping, I finally thought about something that would be a really good post.   I completely forgot though =(.  So just to keep you guys updated, there will be another one soon. Hopefully it will be good.  -Nick.

       I love those songs that really hold sentimental value. There are probably songs that I love more than ever because whenever I hear them, I just feel like I'm living in a certain time again--or I remember something really special.  That's what's so great about music, you can dive into it and swim your way back out.  I love how Saves The Day feels like the perfect rainy day band for me. I can see myself and my sister driving in her car with the heater on pretty high while the rain is pouring on the windshield, and the windshield wipers are going like crazy. Then At Your Funeral, or See You, or This is Not an Exit would play. I'd feel so happy.  Sugar Ray reminds me of 6th grade. Yah sure, Sugar Ray is a sucky band, but I like them because I always heard them on the way to school in 6th grade. Special to me.  Norah Jones--yes I know a lot of people don't like her either. She reminds me of Eryn though, that's pretty huge for me.  Rancid reminds me of the airport for some reason.   ...  Huh...  Funny...   =) Love me!

       I love signing year books to people I know well. I hate signing year books when people ask me to when I don't know their name. That's kind of weird.  That's my post. I'm getting lazy and when summer comes, I'm going to become even more lazy and this blog is going to die. Sorry guys, I tried to keep posting. =(

       I think Dead Week should be like, a week where there is no school at all. This past week, classes have been so pointless. Sit and talk, watch movies, sign yearbooks, and talk some more.   Hahaha! I just had a flashback. I remember in kindergarden, George Guzman and I were best friends. I was sick for a week, and then I come into class late, and then he runs up to me and hugs me while everyone is sitting now. Thinking about how gay that was now makes me laugh.  I have a tournament tomorrow.  I love you.

       Dreams...   I don't even know where to start. Sometimes they can be great, sometimes they can be scary, sometimes they are everything you want them to be. Zoltan says that dreams are a second reality. I think it's some kind of Toltec belief.  I've had so many dreams about so many different people. I think my 'second reality', says Zoltan, is really good to me. Either that or it's just a tease. Not in a gross way.  I'm sure you've read posts about dreams in my past blogs, like when I'd have a dream just going out with a girl that I used to like or something. Then when you wake up, you realize it was just a dream, and you're like, "What the eff!? Why couldn't that be real!" And then you continually slam your head on your pillow. Then you go slap water on your face, and then go play tennis... Wait. I think this is just me.  Well that is what this morning was like, and that's what every morning is like when I have dreams like those. I'm not talking about those 'wet dreams' or anything, though I must say those are nice too...  Maybe I should just make a blog and just type up every dream I have. That'd be a cool science project. Keep track of that for a while, and test my dreams while I listen to music.   :Sigh:   "So are you going to tell them what the dream is!?"  -No.   "Oh."  - =)

       Hey, it's Nick again. Just decided to drop you a line, I hope you don't mind.    Please, let me tell you about my week.     Okay.       Today was an important day. I've had weird dreams, and I seem to be picking out little messages through everything insignifigant, whether it be poker or something like a road sign at&nbsp;a period of time where I'd be thinking of something important.   &nbsp;

        Wow, are you serious? Look at all this new blogger stuff. I can post in  color,   or I can post like:     This thing     I can even post with this thingy:     Yah, that's pretty cool.    Yup.     Well, anyway.   &nbsp;   For some reason, I act so differently infront of different people. It's not just like, certain people, but just around certain groups of people. Does that make sense?  I act differently around guys, I act differently around girls... Oh, I have an idea.   Wait let me try this  again.   Oops.   I'm not really sure how I 'really' act in the first place.     Sometimes when&nbsp;I go out to hang out with some other people, I think to myself that I should act this way.     OR      I'd act different if other people are around. It's not even the whole peer pressure thing.     &nbsp; It's not like it's a bad thing. I kind of like it. I can live with people for a long time and display a part of me that they wouldn't even think exists...       After that, I could live with others and be completely different, but still be myself.        Wow, you can even post in white!     ^^   So I don't know. I'm taking SAT classes, and I've learned the word 'multifaceted', only because I missed it on a multiple choice test. I want to be aggressive and mean all the time though.  That'd be a cool, solid personality. I guess I'm too influenced by peer pressure cause I shouldn't care and all.    Okay, I'll stop messing around with all the blog tools. I thought it was cool at first, but I bet you when this post comes out, it will be teh sucks. I&nbsp;don't even know if I made any errors because if I'm typing in white, I obviously cannot see.     Bow Chika Bow Bow!

       Do you ever think about what happens to characters in a movie after something really dramatic happens? You know, hero saves the day, or the guy finally does something to win the heart of this chick he barely knows? What happens now?  I don't know, that's such a stupid thing to wonder about.   -World Series of Poker is on TV.  Bye :D

       Last night, I wasn't able to sleep. It was a different kind of not being able to sleep(sound stupid, I know). I mean there are times when I can't sleep because I sleep at 5 in the morning, and then the next night I try sleeping at 9. There are other times when I just toss and turn horribly and that wakes me up, and then I try and think about sleeping to help me sleep, which doesn't. It was really weird though.  I was up until 1. I was really tired, and I was playing Party Poker. I go all in after a long tourney cause I just get tired, lose, and limp into bed. I'm so tired, but I start thinking about summer.  Man, I have grown so far apart from Eryn. I hate it. I seriously fucking hate it. That's like the ONE thing I didn't want to happen. I thought about that last night, and a sudden spurge of waking up just came over me. I was wide awake, and I felt really nervous. I felt like I just got a super bad beat in poker and I started to burn up and sweat. It was a really weird feeling really haha.  It's just pathetic how you can't stop something from happening when you know that a year prior, it's going to happen.  Wow, I just realized this summer was shit. 'this' 'shit'. You can't spell 'shit' without 'this'.

       I don't know if I want summer to end. I kind of want to go back to school. I'm looking forward to Junior year a lot just because I have a good feeling running into it. I bet that's going to change though. Hope not.  I really like the way my summer is running right now. Wake up, play tennis, work out, hang out with some friends, watch a movie and/or play tennis later that night, sleep, wake up and do it again.  Summer is a really weird time for me. I remember last summer, I was really close to Eryn. Lots of things have changed though. We don't even talk anymore and that's kind of sucked a lot. Last summer I used to be a lot different to.  Right now, the weather is really nice. I love it when it's super hot in the morning and you play tennis, and then at night, it totally cools down, but it's still warm enough to just wear shorts and a white T-shirt then chill at the memorial park. That's always nice. I think last time I went there, I fell asleep under the flag pole haha.  That's one of the best parts of summer actually.  I already dropped AP english because I'm too lazy to do the reading and I don't think I'd do well in it anyway. Sorry, that's off the topic of 'Summer'.  Yah, so in the beginning of this summer, there was a lot of poker. I think that's starting to die down a little bit right now. It's always nice to hang out with people though.  ;)
