        What is the limit that a man will take to get into a woman cookie?  Today i have seen the lowest when a girl tells a guy that she only get down with bi-sexual or gay men, so he goes to tell her that he is a gay man just so that he can get that stuff between her legs.  Now i dont know no man that is would stoop that low just to get a piece of pus that is some ol nonsense. Now that leaves me to think he really have some issues going on within himself.

        Today was a pretty good day until I had to watch someone else's kids. I love kids to death but bad ass kids I can do without. Yea I know I should have and could have said no but I didn't. I dislike when I have to help someone especially when it is family and they have a problem and u try to bring them into your world and they find a way to fuk up things, that is y I like to be bymyself then I wouldn't have to worry about that nonsense at all, but when it comes to a point when it the person is starting to deserves u it is time for them to go give them all 5 toes in the butt :)

        CAN YOU FEEL ME? I AM RIGHT HERE WITH A WARM HEART. CAN YOU HOLD ME? I AM RIGHT HERE WITH A LONELY HEART. CAN YOU CHERISH ME? I AM RIGHT HERE WITH A COLORFUL HEART. CAN YOU RESPECT ME? I AM RIGHT HERE WITH A BROKEN HEART. CAN YOU HONOR ME? I AM RIGHT HERE WITH A LOYAL HEART. CAN YOU LOVE ME? I AM RIGHT HERE WITH AN OPEN HEART. CAN YOU SEE ME? I AM JUST A HEART

      GOOD BLACK MEN  "Good Black Men" you know and a few women that need to read it...   Good Black men are indeed all around. We pass them on the streets, in the malls and the halls at work. Most we can`t see because we don`t know what a good man really looks like.  He usually isn`t flashy enough or rich enough to turn our heads. He might not wear a suit or push a Ex. He might not have a "body like Arnold with a Denzel face." But, as you mature, you realize it`s better to find someone who`s got your back than someone who turns your head.   A good man doesn`t agree wholeheartedly with everything you say. He doesn`t just tell you what you want to hear and do the opposite. He doesn`t declare how sensitive, sweet, caring, sincere, yada yada he is (he wont have to because it shows). He has his own opinions and you may clash, but he doesn`t have to degrade you to prove he`s right. He even admits at times to being wrong, especially if you are willing to do the same.  A good man is not going to meet every item on your checklist. He is human with frailties and faults mixed in with all of his wonderful, strong attributes. He needs your love and respect. He needs to feel that you don`t live to "catch" him doing something wrong so you can declare,  "Aha! I knew you were a dog!!"  A good man doesn`t necessarily give you a huge birthday or Valentine`s gift. He shows his love in the ways that are comfortable to him. Don`t judge him by TV standards. No one is living that fairy tale for real. You`ll miss out on your own fairy tale by buying into the myth that our men are no good. It`s just not true.   Black Men, we salute you, and thank you for who you are and all you`ve done.

       Loving you    As gentle as a springtime breeze   Sensual kisses to tease and please   As beautiful as a morning sunrise   Kissing and caressing your caramel thighs   A summers day sticky and hot   Longing to revisit your sensual spot   Sitting at the beach as the waves hit the shore   Crescendos of passion has us begging for more   As I walk barefoot in the morning dew   I can't keep my mind off   LOVING YOU
