      Dear Bish,  Don’t mind if I call you, “Bish?”  Hope that’s not wrong (no pun intended).  The minister in my church keeps going on and on insisting that there is a Trinity and that it’s in the Bible.  I find myself lining up more with what you say in your book, A New Christianity for A New Appetite. Should my pastor cling to this dogmatic doctrine?  Shelby Shelby, OH  Dear Shelby,  You seem to think you are a funny guy.  Please stop.  We can’t all be Steve Martin and it always  amazes me how many people think they have a sense of humor.  Now, to your point.  Your minister, it seems to me, has a great deal of pride.  He makes the common mistake of imposing his interpretation of Scripture on the rest of us.  This, as you say, smacks of dogmatism, but not only that, a simplistic literalism compounded by an arrogance that says how you experience God must be the way he does.  This lack of awareness and education is astonishing in our churches.  I, for example never impose my views in an authoritarian way on my parishioners or my priests. And If I hear of any of them doing it, I put a stop to it immediately and punish the offenders.  How can we presume to know what and who God is? Who am I to say my interpretation of the Scripture is correct or better than anyone else’s?  What hubris!   The trinity is a concept invented by a fourth century church council, not something Jesus, Peter or Paul talked about.  Oh, I know they talked about a Father, a Son and a Holy Spirit, and about these three persons being God, but since the word “trinity” isn’t used I like to say that it isn’t a biblical concept.  Works for me.  What’s important to grasp is your experience of the divine.  This is something, along with your education at a reputable, non-evangelical university, that you can always trust.  I feel the spirit when I do my many good deeds and acts of charity.  I encounter the Son when I am inspired to give a large portion of my paycheck to the needy.  I see a pattern in the flow of history, a presence closer than my breath that speaks of the Father.  This is why I choose a Christian interpretation of the divine.  But do you see me condemning my Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic or Wicca brothers and sisters because they do not encounter the divine the same way.  Hardly!  If your minister continues to insist on this tired, old reading of Christianity, I suggest you find another congregation to worship in.  And by all means purchase my book, The Way I See It: The Death of Objective Logic.  It can be yours for a donation of $49.95.  Annually.  Yours Always, Rong

       Dear Bishop Rong,  I’ve just finished reading Tom Brokaw’s The Greatest Generation. The stories of sacrifice for the benefit of future generations reminded me of Christ’s unselfish sacrifice for us. Several accounts in the book moved me to tears. Being a regular reader of your column, I would love to hear your thoughts on the World War II generation and their Christian example.  Sim South Dakota   Dear Sim,  I’m sure Mr. Brokaw did a wonderful job of storytelling. I certainly have strong emotions for individuals who lived during the difficult times of the 30’s and 40’s, including my own mother and father.  However, I am sure you are not ignorant of the atrocities committed by White European males in this country and elsewhere for centuries. From George Washington’s owning of slaves—I have never even thought about doing such an atrocious thing!—to white settlers’ massacre of innocent, peaceful, Native Americans on their way to steal their lands.  Neither, Sim, should we stoop to solving our disputes with the evils of war. Both the current President and his WWII pilot and Iraq-invading father have chosen to settle their personal disputes with the violent deaths of our young men and women, not to mention thousands of innocent Iraqis. (Do you see a pattern here, or is it just me?).  Perhaps the root of this behavior is the idea of the very event you mention. Many people, like you, Sim, misinterpret the story of the bloody sacrifice that many have portrayed as the focal point of Christianity. Nothing could be further from the truth. Jesus’ message was about peace and life and tolerance. Fortunately, through popular books like  The Da Vinci Code  which take evidence from the recently discovered Nag Hamadi texts, the real story of Jesus is finally coming to the light of day. Jesus, it is now known, probably lived his days out in peace, living with a woman who bore him children. This is not what the winners in history, the calculating writers of the New Testament want you to believe.  As you know, I took part in the Jesus Seminar, which by painstaking scholarly inquiry proved most of the New Testament to not be the sayings of Jesus at all! It is unlikely that these documents, which suppressed the role of women and minorities in the real story of the early church, portray any real event in the life of Jesus at all.  After all, you don't still believe that God created the earth in literal six days, do you? How about Noah's flood? Jonah in the belly of the whale? A vengeful God who destroys people for living out their sexual preference? These ridiculous ideas should be wiped from our memory along with the judgemental attitude they inspire.  So you see, the bloody crucifixion, with its example of violence to solve problems, is an event fabricated by men at some early church council, who decided their version of events was right. Thus, they precluded and destroyed all other views. This bloody event did indeed inspire the World War II generation. It inspired the German Christians and the Anglo Christians to murder each other, not to mention many millions of Jews.  If this historically questionable event inspired your parents or you, your tears should be tears of shame, not piety. I suggest you read my book,  How I know Everything Perfectly and Objectively from a Distance of 2000 Years . Send 69.95 and I will ensure you and parents all get a copy.
