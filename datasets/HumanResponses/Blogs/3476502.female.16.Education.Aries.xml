      Music: Before I'm Dead - Kidneythieves Mood: Happy ***********************  Today, I fixed my curtains so it'll be dark in my room...! It's really helped my room stay cold...! I'm watching Queen of the Damned right now... it's a great movie! I have the Soundtrack playing in the background...! It's at the Concert scene... I like the one before it, it's very emotional!  It's going to rain all night... which I'm glad... I love the rain, it helps me sleep...!  Ugg, my mom found cigarette butts outside on the porch, and she thought it was me for a while, but I didn't want to tell her it was Evans!! Because she would tell his mom and there would be problems! I told her to let me handle it... because she finally forced it out of me... I told her that it would be simpler if I took care of it, so that was I can make up lies and scare him... like it'll shrink his penis!  Hahahaha, I'm funny!  ::hears wind blowing and rain hitting the window:: OOO! IT'S BEGINNING! I HAVE TO GO TO A RAIN SPELL! I'm going to try to make it last a while! w00t!   Love all!!

       Music:  Veridis Quo - Daft Punk  Mood:  too tired to sleep!  *************************************   Blah, I just got done watching 'Grace Under Fire'... doom...  I just smoked about half a pack of cigarettes... -.-... now I'm buzzed... and it's sad because they were Ultra-lights... but that's all my mom smokes! So, that's all I can get my hands on! Lucky me, I get old woman cigarettes...!  I hate trying to loose weight... I'm trying to get thin so I can wear all sorts of gothic clothes without having to look like a fucking retard... right now I wear baggy clothes and stuff... I hate all those fat girls who wear all the tight gothic clothes...! It's gross... and annoying... because only the skinny goths should be allowed to wear the tight nylon pants... >.>...!!!   I think I've been really pissed off lately because I stopped smoking pot... I quit because it turned me into one of those annoying skater kids... >.>... oh how I despise that...! All those skater kids are annoying, and now that it's summer, I don't have to be in the same room with them! I was ignoring all my cool otaku gothic friends to go... ugg... skateboard!!  TO FUCKING SKATEBOARD!! WHAT THE FUCK!?!? I actually let dust form over my anime collection!! I PACKED AWAY MY NEWTYPES AND GOTHIC BEAUTY MAGAZINES!!  I fell into a deep hole of despair that is something that I've despised ever since I hit the 7th grade...!! I would skip skool to go get high... it was terrible... but I'm back to my old self... and I'm glad... my friends are glad I'm back... and I've been apologizing for my 'drifting'...!! I also stopped because I'm trying to get a job...! Barnes and Noble here I come! w00t!  Right now I'm trying to convince Evans (a kid who I've known ever since he was born, and our mom's were/are friends since they were both 13!)to become a raver kid... he's one of those pot head/skater dorks... >.>... it sickens me, because I made him that way... but I think since I'm his role model, he'll follow me... he went from anime lover/goth apprentice to skater kid like I used to be... >.>... it's sad... truly is... I'm still disgusted with my self... that I could cause such a thing to happen!! It's all the  fucking 'Jones' bitch's fault !! I make one common ground that we both like Korn/Marilyn Manson/Slipknot music, and I have to go hang out with her!! ... >.>... I'm so  naive ...!!   *AHEM*  On a happy note! We are in the process of selling our house...! And it's accutally quite fun! I like to be sitting up in my room (my bleek, boring room... my mom made me take down all my posters and such... eh, whatever works)and play with my tarot cards with my death techno playing and Vampire Hunter D playing on my TV...! It's quite funny to see the preppy teens walk around upstairs then walk into my room to see me, this dark goth girl playing with tarot cards... their faces are pricless...!!  DAMMIT!!  I need to wash my hair tomorrow...  STUPID FUCKNIG SUMMER!! I HATE YOU! I HATE YOU SO MUCH!  It's hot and humid and my hair gets all frizzy and flaky... -.-#  CURSE YOU!!

I'd catch a Vulpix and let it evolve into a Ninetails... I'd get all psyhic pokemon... then I'd kick Sabrina's ass(first season) and take over her gym... nah... I wouldn't want to have to deal with a gym... I'd want to go on adventures... but I wouldn't want to do the whole gym battling thing... just go on adventures to be away from home and meet people! w00t...

      Music: I'm with Stupid - Static X Mood: Blah **********************  O.o... I don't know why I feel this way...   I might be able to get some money for some clothes and such... but the thing is... I'd have to go to Austin for a few weeks...! It's for my Aunt Dawn... she'd let me work at her company for a few weeks so I can get some money, because I don't have a car, I can't get a job, and I wont be able to get a car until we sell the house, and who knows how long that'll take!! But if I go, it'll be fun! I think... O.o... ofcourse every time I've been in Austin, I was with my mom, and had to do what they wanted, now I can do what I want...! And her house is so fucking awsome!!!! If I could find the picks I took of it last time I was there, I would post 'em! It is so beautiful! It's a two story Spanish custom! Tile floors everywhere! And it's in the hillcountry of Austin! It's so cool!   I would fly up there probably... that way it would only take 20 minutes...!  Why does my mom insist of opening my blinds and curtains?? "Your room is too dark!!!" so I go and close all the curtains and blinds in the whole house...! I've gotten back into my 'Nocturnal' stages... I've watched the sunset everyday for a week now...! Now it's just boring... >.>... and the crack-heads go outside in the morning, and they scare me....!  I just heard a commercial that sounds just like my childhood:  Mother: Hey, I'm light on cash, can I borrow 5 bucks from your piggy bank? Child: Well, I donno, Mr. Piggy is feeling a bit light! Mother: C'mon! Child: Alright, but sign this loan form... Mother: Alright...  This is how it was when I was a kid, my parents together owe me about 200 dollars... >.>... when I would have a birthday, my grandparents both would give me 50 dollars and my parents would take it and "Put it in the bank for me"... it was spent on alcohol...!   Alright, I'm going to be honest with my self now, I have a extremely strong love for Johnny Depp!! I can't help it! When I watch 'The astronaut's Wife' I was like in a complete state of bliss because his wife was named Jillian, and he kept saying "I love you, Jillian." I'm addicted...!   I think I've shrunken my stomach to the size of a pea.... O.o.... I just tried to eat some Ravioli and I had about 4 bites and I felt like I was going to explode!!! I think it's because I've started drinking 8 bottles of water a day...! YaY for me... O.o...!  There is this ring called the Black Passion Ring, and it's so pretty!! It has a black diamond in it... I want it, but it's probably like 5000 dollars... >.>... slightly out of my price range...!   I'm watching Judge Hatcett... >.>... I'm so glad I've stop smoking pot... so I didn't end up like those kids.... ::shakes fist at Jones for getting me into it::  Well, I'm going to go take a shower... GIA IS A FUCKING AWSOME MOVIE! Doom and it's really sad!

      Music: Veridis Quo - Daft Punk Mood: bored outta my mind and headache **********************  Well, I got bored... so I put some more blue dye in my hair... I found it in one of my drawers in my bathroom... I let it sit for about 4 hours, then washed out the last bits of it, and it left my hair extremely blue for about an hour... then when I blowdryed it, it went to a more milder blue.   I pulled out my skirts and put them on, just because I wanted to...  I look all cool and 'art-sy' right now, I have my bangs hanging down with my hair pulled back in two spiky pigtail-bun thingys, and I'm wearing my oversized black and white striped button shirt with my long bellowing skirt on. Dooom! If I were wearing makeup, I could be an artist.. lol...!  Later today I have to go to my grandparents house for Fathers day... I'll just sit upstairs on the computer all day, while the rest of the cousins play in the pool... unless Marcus and Ethan go... but I hope Ethan doesn't go... because he just talks about weed... and it's annoying. Since I've quit that (3 months so far! Whooo!)shit... maybe Marcus will tell me how he managed to get a STD... >.>... never heard of him having a g/f... O.o... cosmic!  Man... I need cable... I'VE BEEN FORCED TO WATCH FUCKING RETARDED INFOMERCALS ABOUT FACELIFTS AND FOOTSUPPORT! >.>... I'm kind of on edge because, well, it's father's day and well, I havn't seen my father since... January? I think it was Febuary...! Well, I havn't seen/talked/heard from him in a couple of months... and I've been kind of reflecting on what he did to me... he sucks... he never wanted me... he tried to commit suicide after I was born... then he wanted my mom to put me up for adoption... >.>... I found the adoption papers last month... they were all filled out for me to go live at Boys and Girls Harbor till a family took me! My father had signed his name, but my mom didn't... when I asked her, she started crying... he accutally strangled her until she agreed to do it... he's such an asshole... now I know why he used to "forget" to pick me up from elementary skool... I would wait there till 6 at night until my mom would drive up. She would tell me, "Sorry, your father got called out to work." and when we would arrive home, he'd be sitting there on his fat ass drinking a beer... >.>... I have a lot of pint up anger against him... he's the reason why I keep my emotions bottled up until they explode out, sending me into a crying/screaming/shaking rage that causes me to trash my room... thats how I broke my old desk...  I guess when my father realized that he couldn't get rid of me, he decided to put me in every sport known to the Little Leagues... Basketball, Baseball, Softball, Soccer, and Football... well... football didn't work out so well... they wouldn't accept me, on account I was a girl...   Awww damnit!!!! I STAYED UP ALL NIGHT AGAIN!!! >.>... I was going to get some sleep so I can drive over there... ah well... I'll doze off later... or just take an energy pill and sleep when I get there.   Back to my father, because, I donno, I just feel like I should get this out... I went on three family vacations... while the family had about 15... I went camping once, the Schileterban, and to Austin... the rest of them I was sent to my grandmother's, Marie, house while they were gone... it was kind of fun... and that is were I learned how to sew and build things... but it was the fact that he didn't want to bother with me... so he just sent me there... I think he started to realize that I knew what he was doing when my folks split, so he started to become more "loving and caring" even though he could care less... When I found the adoption papers, I had had enough... so I stopped caring until I would explode and just never go back there... and it happened... thank god... I didn't think I could take anymore of him and his b/s! When he was yelling at me that night, the look in his eyes was the same look he would give my mom when he would beat her... so he picked up things and threw them at me... going into his "Blind-rage-"it's your fault I'm the way I am today!"-throwing anything I can get my hands on-you remind me of your mother!" thing...   >.>... he's an ass... he should die... seriously... I wouldn't miss him... it would make my life a little easier... I'm going to go drive down to water and watch the sunrise... I bet it'll be most beautiful to watch that... I need to shave my arms... (Yeah, I shave my arms!)  Well, now you all know the dark sides to my childhood! Hehe, you know, when we move, I hope we can move in the early morning! ^_^! It would be so cool... to watch the sunrise one last time from the dining room window... from the dining room window is the best spot to watch it... come over the trees and fill the dinningroom like liqiud gold... it's beautiful!! Well, I better go and try to get atleast 4 hours of sleep... >.>... or mom will be all prissy... Love all! Don't feel sorry for my childhood, nothing could've helped it...! OH, Matt, when are we gonna go get jobs? I want me some shoes!

She never thinks "Hmmm, maybe my daughter will need some money to start out with, so maybe I should help her get a car, so she can have a job, so she won't live at home all her fucking life!!!!!" NO SHE'LL JUST FUCKING GO "I'LL GO TO FUCKING LAW SKOOL AND FUCK UP THE REST OF MY DAUGHTER'S LIFE, AND CAUSE MY PARENTS TO GIVE ME MONEY, SO MY DAUGHTER CAN'T GET A CAR AND CAN'T GET A JOB, AND SHE'LL BE POOR AND MISRIBLE ALL HER FUCKING LIFE!!!!!AND I CAN'T TAKE HER BECAUSE I'M TOO FUCKING LAZY TO GET MY FAT ASS UP OFF THE FUCKING COUCH TO TAKE HER TO WORK!!!

Brittany and I talked about my relegion(wicca)... she said she thought it was interesting, but too complicated for her to do...!   We did this fainting thing that I used to do all the time... You bend over and breathe really heavy until you feel faint, then you stand up straight real fast and someone has to clinch your mouth and nose shut and make you faint. Then they tell you things and you start seeing it and freak out, or what ever... they told me that I was beating up this girl (Donna) and they said that I tried to get up...! I told them that if I stood up to try and wake me up or run and hide...!  >.>....they woke me up.... but not before I got a few good kicks at the girl...  I'm going to make an anti-emo orginazation... and it's gonna be kickass... they took over Hot Topic... Torrid... they've taken over tv... HATE THEM!! GRRR! *yawn* love all... sleepy!
