       Internet Corruption   So I'm sitting here at work wondering why exactly I am starting a blog.  I mean, I've kept journals in the past, but I've never really had the urge to create something that millions of people could access (okay - make that millions of people = three people).    My whole venture out in Internet world started with me just trying to get to my younger sister's blog because at random times she likes to post things regarding my boyfriend and so I like to keep track to make sure she's not making fun of me too much behind my back (www.myfuturebook.blogspot.com - in case you're interested).  However, blogger.com (being the tricky site that it is) directed me to a log-in page and offered me the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to have my very own weblog.  Not being one to say no to anything, I readily jumped onboard.  Now of course I realize that I didn't  have  to post anything ever, but after going through the design options and coming up with a pretty cool website name, I felt this strong force pushing me to make at least one post.  And thus - the story of how I am now the proud owner of my very own blog without a real purpose behind it.  Therefore, I feel like I need a purpose for this blog (because really...doesn't everything you do need a purpose?).  I have several ideas floating around in my head.  I'll choose something and get back to you on it.  Also, something funny to leave you on.  On my aforementioned sister's site (because yes, I did actually get on it after I signed up on blogger), she has a listing of qualities that she wants in a boyfriend.  Number 3 is (and I quote)..."Must be amusing, but not retarted".  I'm just glad to know that she doesn't want to date a pastry.

        Trials and Tribulations    Since someone  obviously  has no life during these hot, hazy summer months [name starts with a 'B' and ends with an 'eth'] and must post comments that my blog seems to be slightly underused, I have decided once again to leave a sprinkling of my wisdom upon these pages.&nbsp; It must only be a sprinkling though considering the fact that I am at work and thus fear the wrath of my managers if they walk by and see me not doing the projection studies that I am working on.&nbsp; There are only so many times that I can switch from Internet explorer to the software of my choice [that is to say, "actuarial software" (i.e. Excel, Scrubber in the spring, WyVal in the summer)] at the slightest hint of footsteps outside of my cubicle without getting so nervous and jumpy that I wind of being unproductive all day and must just sit in front of my computer playing video games.&nbsp; It's only 10:30!&nbsp; I have to get something done today.  &nbsp;  So I didn't pass my exam this spring.&nbsp; Again.&nbsp; I got a 5.&nbsp; Saying that you got a 5 makes you sound really stupid because it's such a low number.&nbsp; However, on a scale of 10, it's everything.&nbsp; Especially when you know that you were only 1 - 2 correct answers away from pushing you up to a passing grade of 6.&nbsp; I mean, really...how much more does a guy that got a 6 know than me with my 5?&nbsp; He was able to guess at a better letter for those questions than I was?&nbsp; What kind of knowledge is that?&nbsp; I guessed 'B' for Bobby on those questions that I just had no clue on - I'm thinking about going with another letter next time.&nbsp; 'D' has worked well for me before.   So I started writing this post on Friday, got wrapped up in some stuff and never finished.&nbsp; But since Beth decided to write me today to let me know of Moesha's new"rambling" [note - I think that she meant to say "meandering" since obviously she wasn't talking about this fabulous site], I figured that I might as well finalize any thoughts that I had thrown out there and FINALLY publish my second blog ever!&nbsp;   I hope that it was worth the wait.
