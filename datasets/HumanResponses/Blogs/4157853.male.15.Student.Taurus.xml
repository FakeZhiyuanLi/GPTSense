       As I sit here @ my computer I wonder about a lot of things. Why summer goes by soo fast.....Why do I always waste the little amount of summer I have.....and why doesn't anyone appreciate what that time means. I guess It's cuz we just get caught up in the moment. We don't ever think about the future because we expect to "cross that bridge when we get to it". But, everybody doesn't just get that future. Things happen and unfortunately ppl have to die before their time. My pastor told me that everyday is a good day no matter what happens to you, because you were able to wake up and live life that many others could not have. I don't know very much. I'm only 15 short years old, and yet I feel I am cursed with the sorrow of endless ages of war, evil and injustice. I wanna lay back and just be a normal teen....go to parties,be crazy....drink....and live by the seat of my pants. But, Something is telling me to be different, to dream of scientific providence...to dream of Jesus's return..to build toward a heaven we could all grasp. I take a moment's rest and step back from all of this philosophy and prophecy and I think of what I could have done. I could have been a jock....with no brains but natural athletic talent to spare. Maybe a suave devonair pimp with beautiful women hanging from my shoulders and popularity beyond dreams of chess geeks. I could have been a science geek with a 4.5 gpa and a college degree at age 12 but in the end i am and will always be the guy that tried to clone himself (W/O HIS MOTHERS TAMPON OR SEMEN). I guess science like this is what i will do when i finish college. I hope i am the first person to completely clone myself and i hope i go in the record books. In fact i hope i am the first scientist to successfully alter genes and create a super human. Look for me on the news in the next 20 years you might be able to say you once new that guy....the guy that changed science forever.
