      this song POWER! by zhang jing xuan- duan dian   静静地陪你走了好远好远  连眼睛红了都没有发现  听着你说你现在的改变  看着我依然最爱你的笑脸  连这条旧路依然没有改变  以往的每次路过都是晴天  想起我们有过的从前  泪水就一点一点开始蔓延    我转过我的脸　不让你看见  深藏的暗涌已经越来越明显  过完了今天　就不要再见面  我害怕每天醒来想你好几遍    我吻过你的脸　你双手曾在我的双肩  感觉有那么甜　我那么依恋  每当我闭上眼　我总是可以看见  失信的诺言全部都会实现  我吻过你的脸　你已经不在我的身边  虽然你不在我的身边  我还是祝福你过得好一点  短开的感情线　我不要做断点  只想在睡前　再听见你的　蜜语甜言

      It’s going to  be a long story...  Once upon a time, a hairstylist got to know a lady who is sweet and pretty. Sadly she was married to a man that has the occupation of a ship broker, a profession that requires long hours and endless night of entertaining of clients,  that includes bringing clients for sexual activities.  Despite the nocturnal lifestyle, the lady remains true, has very strong faith and trust in her husband.  The hairstylist told her, Wow ... if his girlfriend is half as nice as her, he would have melted. As she told the stylist what she did for her husband, the stylist knows by each word she said this kind of lady is rare, to the brink of extinction…  A couple of months passed by and the lady (referred to as Ling from now onwards) went for her next hair appointment. She was slimmer then before. When the stylist asked her how is her husband and if things are going smoothly for them during the past months. Ling replied in a mild tone that her husband and her are no longer an item anymore... The hairstylist was shocked into silence. Oh my gosh, how could that have happened when they were such a happy couple... Like most stylists, he tried to console the poor damsel. He can see through her facade of putting up a strong front as he can feel the pain resonating from within her.  The stylist tried to dress her hair to the best that of his abilities, hoping that it would make Ling feel better. Ling find that stylist is quite caring and asked for the stylist’s number. The stylist obliged as he thought maybe she just need someone to pour her woes to.  They started to go out more often for coffee, dinner just like what courting couples did. Despite the age difference of seven years old (Ling was 30 and the stylist, 23), they are in love.  As Ling is an air stewardess (kong jie), her stay in Singapore is not regular. The stylist is always with her whenever she needs him. They are like a happily married couple. Ling showered him with love like no other. The stylist feels that he is the happiest man in the world. He feels like a man ...a husband. He never felt this way before in his life and he actually moved in to stay with her (her place with her ex husband) while secretly promising to himself that he would never let Ling be heartbroken again.  Ling is a very caring, faithful person, loving her man to the max. She told Stylist that she will never give others a chance if she got a boyfriend. She will never say no to her man. Stylist is so touched that he again secretly tell himself never ever be unfaithful to Ling...  Stylist was a notorious flirt. He had been called names like jerk, bastard etc. Imagine the kind of love that Ling showered on him to make him to decide on something like those. Stylist is cool and is the type of person that don’t sweet talk a lot and say “I love u … blah blah” because the stylist knew that those words would work magic when it comes out from him. He told himself that he will never leave her as long as she is the same, while taking into consideration her age and how she will look ten to twenty years down the road. The stylist knew this time he is committed to Ling so much that it scares him.  They are so in love, calling each other everyday without fail. The stylist would be always reachable as he has promised Ling that he won’t give her the insecure feeling that her husband used to give her. They were in each others’ minds and hearts all the time. The couple will spend all their time together whenever Ling is in Singapore. Cooking, eating, sleeping, bathing...in other words, they were always together.  Ling’s family consist of her parents and two younger brother. Both brothers are older then the stylist. They were shocked and asked Ling if she is sure she want to go out with him as they feel that he is too young for her. These are the comments by the people that is around Ling.  Stylist know that the odds are stacked against him and he tried to make friends with everyone. He is so much in love with Ling and he tried his best to make friends with her friends and especially her family even though he knew that they viewed him with prejudiced eyes.   Around a year later, Ling moved back to her mother’s place as she wanted to save some money without taking much of stylist’s feelings into consideration. Anyway, stylist loved her and understand that if she don’t rent out her condo, she will probably end up with nothing at the end of 5 years when she sells her condo.  A year and few months later,  her flight stewardess contract was up. Stylist thought that they are finally going to really spend some quality time together as stylist was alone on christmas and new year’s eve. Stylist was looking eagerly forward to it. Meanwhile, Ling continued her career doing car sales.  Things went smoothly until after a year and a half. A heated argument erupted between the two of them until it is so bad that Ling’s mother stepped in and asked them what’s wrong. Stylist just told her in a respectful tone that they can solve their problem by themselves but Ling’s mother persisted. Stylist lost his cool and replied in a firm tone again saying that they can solve their own problem.  Her mother began to make nasty remarks... really nasty things that would make a normal person’s blood boil. Stuff like with your looks and qualifications, surely you can  find a better man then the Stylist...things like that. That was the last straw as Stylist had a really bad day as he was asked to leave from his part time car sales job. Stylist raised his voice, “AUNTIE!! ASK YOUR DAUGHTER IF I BULLIED HER OR NOT!”. Her mother replied. “WHY ARE YOU SHOUTING!!” without realising  that she was the one that was talking loudly all the time. Stylist don’t want to argue anymore because he knew he made a terrible mistake. He shouldn’t have shouted back as he saw that Ling was on the brink of bursting into tears.She was torn between the man she loved and her mother whom she respected. Stylist was too lost to say anything more and left.  Things begin to take a turn for the worst. Suddenly, the whole world seems to be going against Stylist. Ling’s brothers advised her to make use of this chance to end the relationship as they think that he is too young for her. They also said that he is rude and immature. How is he capable of taking care of her... stuff like that. Stylist thought that the brothers already knew that he serious about their sister and after a year and a half of trying to be friends with them. Stylist tried to be as helpful as he could to Ling’s brothers as he knew that since he want to be with Ling, he got to make her family accept him. Stylist felt utterly betrayed as he already feel that he is part of their family.  Ling continued to receive lots of negative comments. Since the day of the heated argument, her family and friends think that Stylist is a rotten guy. I think you guys can imagine the scenario. Everyone is pressurising her to leave Stylist and this made their relationship turn sour. They are arguing almost everyday...  One fine day, Ling told Stylist why don’t they go back to the days when they are just be friends. Stylist was shocked as he didn’t see that coming. He asked her why she is doing this to him and what did he do wrong? Ling began to tell Stylist of how much she actually suffered for the past two years. It is really quite a lot so please, bear with me.  She said that Stylist complained about buying food for her! Because Stylist bought her food back from work and when he reached home he said to Ling that he has to walk quite a distance to buy her food and he is persipiring all over. Is it worth it?(Are you guys getting the message that Stylist is trying to tell Ling?)  Despite her age, Ling is still attractive. She don’t look a day past twenty five years old, so naturally she got a lot of admirers going after her. A guy actually bought her beehoon soup and proceeded to separate the soup and beehoon. Knowing that Ling is a heavy sleeper that need lots of rest, he went to get a slow cooker and actually bought black chicken tonic from those chinese medical hall. Ling was touched by the things the guy did.  She told Stylist that she don’t feel much love from him and she is always the one giving. She didn’t remember that despite being tired after work, Stylist went out of his way to buy her noodles and cook dinner for her (it is all time, sweat and effort) if she want to compare. Guys... just spend some time to think… Which is more time consuming? Cooking tonic or cooking dinner?  Ling is actually complaining now. Stylist was just so devastated and he knew that guy is going to be a threat.  She told Stylist that she felt that he is a good man... Someone that can actually love and take care of her better. Besides, he is more financially stable and mature. He told Ling of his plans of starting a family with her blah blah... GUYS,  WHEN SOMEONE YOU KNOW LESS THEN A MONTH TELL YOU I AM GOING MARRY YOU!!! HOW CAN SUCH A GUY BE TRUSTED?  Well,  guess that you guys know what is the motive of that guy already. The sad thing is, how can Ling forget about the things Stylist had done and sacrifice for her. How can a two year relationship compare with a less then one month thingy.  Stylist felt so lousy. He told Ling that he knows that she is not young anymore and from the start, she knows that he is young. He is twenty three when they started. Now he is twenty five. If age is a major problem, then they shouldn’t have started. But Ling has changed. At the beginning of the relationship, Ling told Stylist that she will never give other guys a chance as she is faithful. What she needs from a man is just sense of security (meaning faithful to her). But Ling had really changed, what she needs now is different. She needs someone that is ready to start a family and is mentally and financially ready.  Stylist have plans on marrying her and have a baby without telling her his plans. He thought that he will tell her when the time comes. It will be a wonderful surprise for he. Stylist is that kind of person that don’t sweet talk much. He is a bit too frank, firm or cool maybe.  Stylist begged Ling for a chance. He told Ling that he don’t mind her changing, but she must give him time to adjust to the changes. He will save up and marry her once she has settled everything with ex-husband. If she like sweet talking, he can do it better then other guys. Ling replied. “Isn’t it too late? How long do you want me to wait for you? I am no longer young... Why do you want to torture yourself...? Stylist said, “BECAUSE I LOVE YOU!!! FOR YOU, I DON’T MIND CHANGING... I JUST WANT TO BE LOVED BY YOU!!!  Stylist loved her so much. Imagine a notorious flirt transforming to a faithful man. What can make a flirt turn over a new leaf and settle down and have a family. After seeing how Stylist begged her, she can’t bear to hurt him anymore.  Stylist is a totally changed person. He knew this time he needed to really wake up... for he knew that the person he loved has changed. He knew that if he is not going do something about it, Ling is going leave him for good. He promise Ling to save like a madman, talk in a more sweet manner... but deep down in Ling, the feeling is no longer that strong ...  Stylist began showering love, lots of love by doing things that he usually won’t bother to do. He actually takes the MRT, (he always go around in a cab) and ate the cheapest food he can find. But things are just different already. Stylist can sense it but he told himself to give her some time to recover. It was their second year anniversary and he made Ling a card saying nice sweet things but things have changed. Stylist didn’t see what he wanted to see. The expression on her face is totally different from what he had seen during the first year anniversary.  The following morning, both got up and prepared to go to work. While on the way, Ling told Stylist, “Ling, (she called Stylist Ling too as it is the short form of darling) the love that I had for you is no longer there... Let’s just end it...  Stylist was devastated... He thought Ling was going to give him a chance, but how to give chance when the feeling was no longer there? Stylist knew he can’t work for that day already. He need someone to talk to. In the end. Stylist went back to Ling’s home and began pouring out his feelings to Ling’s mother.  Eventually, Stylist went home.  Stylist began to cry...thinking what did he did wrong. All the while he is faithful and actually changed for the better... Stylist had already let the whole world know about him and Ling like his friends, ladyfriends and even ex girlfriends... Stylist found the pain in his heart unbearable…  Stylist called Ling and told her, “Although I am is feeling terrible, I don’t blame you as it always take two hands to clap. But if you are going to leave me for that man, do think twice. If you can find happiness with another man, I will give her his blessings because I love you and want you to lead a happy life. I don’t want you to get hurt as I know what a man wants from a lady. Judging by what the man has said and done, I know what is he after... I just hope that you won’t get cheated. I am still holding on to the hope that you would come back to me. I will always be there when you need a listening ear or advise. I will be there for you when you need someone to talk to. Darling… I love you so much...  Sorry guys ... I am not able to carry on anymore... I m worn out by writing this blog as my tears streamed down my face so many times... if you can’t understand what I m saying....it is because you are just reading and not feeling and reading it seriously...

      有多久没见你,以为你在那里.原来就住在我心里,陪伴着我的呼吸.有多远的距离,以为闻不到你的气息,谁知道你背影这么长,回头就看到你.过去让它过,来不及从头喜欢你,白云缠绕着蓝天,如果不能够永远走在一起,也至少给我们怀念的勇气,拥抱的权力,好让你明白,我心动的痕迹.总是想再见你,还试着打探你消息,原来你就住在我身体守护我一生的回忆
