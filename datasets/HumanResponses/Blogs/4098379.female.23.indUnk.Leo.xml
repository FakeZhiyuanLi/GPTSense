       Well, after reading my friend's (Josh's) blog, I decided that this place is a much snazzier blog place than my previous one, and since it was an underdeveloped blog anyway, I decided to start over here.       There's a lot of starting over going on right now for me. As most of you know by now, I am trying to get a divorce from Sean. The court hearing is (hopefully) August 6, as longtime buddies will remember is my birthday. Happy birthday! ;) I feel sad, of course, about my marriage's dissolution, but I really feel that both Sean & I did everything we could to hold it together. So that's something positive about it. There's such a roller coaster of emotions to go through, and I have never been a big fan of roller coasters. It's a learning experience. I'm sure I will be happier for it; I'm sure I already am happier than I was, overall. But I'm still moving through an acceptable time (I feel) of grief. It's very confusing to go through, and very confusing to talk about, but hopefully you all catch my drift. :)      So, I'm facing a new beginning there. Also I am dealing with new job things. I finished up an alternative certification course in order to teach high school English here in Texas (right now I am living in Houston), and am looking for a job in that field now. Even though you hear so much about teacher shortage this and teacher shortage that, I am not having very much success, because I lack so much experience. Unfortuantely, I do not have a spouse making 50 million a year who can support my lifestyle while I substitue teach for a year and *get* experience in the classroom. I have actual bills that have actual due dates, so I need something more steady. I have been working as a real estate assistant for a while now, which is at least interesting every day, but hardly significant, and very aggravating at times. If nothing works out for me with teaching, I can maybe try this thing with a health insurance company, but who knows. Not me!!! I don't like that. Why aren't all my little ducks lined up in their rows? Life is messy, I suppose...      So new beginnings, and also rebuilding. I feel like I'm trying to pick up pieces of a broken china plate. I have few friends here in Houston, but my sister-in-law (and close friend) Paige is helping me meet people. There are lots of nice people here, but no one yet, I feel, like my previous friends have been. So I have been reaching out to old friends, tapping on their windows and saying "Hey, are you still in there? Do you remember me?" For the most part, they have. No one's called the cops on me yet, anyway. :) I am so grateful for the support that you all have given me, too. I'm not used to feeling so needy, and it's pretty embarassing, but I guess everyone needs sometimes.       My family is also a big part of my life. I'll get to see my folks *twice* within a two month period. I haven't done that since I left home. Becky (my cousin) came to visit me last month, and kept me from cutting off my nose to spite my face. She is great stuff. As soon as I develop my pictures from her trip, I 'll post a couple.      Well, this is an incredibly long blog, but hopefully everyone will be caught up now. :) Paige and I are going to a superhero party tonight, and I still don't know who I'm going as! Fun stuff. Very likely I'll have pictures from that as well.      With love,      Susan

       This Week's Poem is one of Rudyard Kipling's. If I were a responsible blogger, I would make sure I'm not violating any copyright laws by posting it here, but I am not responsible. But to give credit where it's due, I will say that Rudyard Kipling wrote it, and not me. Props to John-David for making me think of it:   When Earth's Last Picture is Painted 1892 L'Envoi to "The Seven Seas"  When Earth's last picture is painted and the tubes are twisted and dried, When the oldest colours have faded, and the youngest critic has died, We shall rest, and, faith, we shall need it-- lie down for an aeon or two, Till the Master of All Good Workmen shall put us to work anew. And those that were good shall be happy; they shall sit in a golden chair; They shall splash at a ten-league canvas with brushes of comets' hair. They shall find real saints to draw from -- Magdalene, Peter, and Paul; They shall work for an age at a sitting and never be tired at all!  And only The Master shall praise us, and only The Master shall blame; And no one shall work for money, and no one shall work for fame, But each for the joy of the working, and each, in his separate star, Shall draw the Thing as he see It for the God of Things as They are!     Further props to   urlLink  www.poetryloverspage.com    for having such a detailed library. Check it out!

      e.e. cummings is one of my favorite poets, and this is a poem of his recently discovered by me. It (like all of his poems) requires careful reading, but I like how it feels. Really sad, but hopeful also, like a well-written sonnet with the turn just before the end.  Even if you're not Intrepid Morpheme-Wading Girl, as I am, the poem still has a touching feel.  Enjoy!   )when what hugs stopping earth than silent is   more silent than more than much more is or   total sun oceaning than any this   tear jumping from each most least eye of star      and without was if minus and shall be    immeasurable happenless unnow   shuts more than open could that every tree   or than all life more death begins to grow      end's ending then these dolls of joy and grief   these recent memories of future dream   these perhaps who have lost their shadows if   which did not do the losing spectres mime      until out of not merely not nothing comes   only one snowflake(and we speak our names      Kudos to  urlLink www.americanpoems.com  for providing not only e.e.cummings to any schmoe with the Internet, but also several other superduper poets to schomes &amp; schmoettes alike.

      So, I can't tell you how good a mood I am in. I think this is because (you see, a good mood is a rare enough thing that it requires an explanation :)) I just got back from visiting my family, and because I have been listening to Maroon 5 all day (I guess I'm just another pretty head turned by equally pretty words :)), and because I had an enjoyable drive back from Jacksonville yesterday.  There are many lovely things about the route from Jacksonville to my apartment in Houston. I drive through The Big Thicket, which is a forest area that covers northeast Texas and part of Arkansas in spots, and over several lovely scum-spotted bayous (bayeux?) with herons flying around and whatnot. There was a little bit of rain, which I always like, but, since it was a forever long drive, there was also a fair amount of Big Blue Texas Sky, which is unbeatable, except for maybe a full moon in December rising over Y Mountain in Provo.  My favorite piece of scenery, however, would have to be a feature I call Stripping Motorcyle-Guy. As I'm crusing along 59, dodging semis &amp; ducking cops, I pull up behind a motorcyclist. I can't pass him, because of the stupid semis that are the bane of my driving existence, and of course I can't tailgate him, because he's a motorcycle after all, and that's just asking for a lawsuit. I watch enough TV to know that motorcyclists are just  waiting  for cars to get close enough to them so they can fling themselves under the wheels of unsuspecting motorists, who are merely trying to encourage their fellow road-users to please speed up just a little.  So I'm driving along, and I have nothing better to look at than Motorcycle Man in front of me, since the trucks are fairly nondescript. Motorcycle Man keeps doing odd things with his arms, holding them out to the side, pointing one up in the air or just shaking his open hand at the road below him. (I have since thought that maybe he was shaking cramps out of his hands? Because I think there's something on the motorcycle handles that helps drive them? Like the throttle? Or the steering?) At the time, though, I had no idea what he was doing, and I couldn't decide if he was a)insane, or b)from Europe, or c)an alien bent on world domination. Now, as he's waving his arms around, I notice that his blue shirt starts to flap a little more. Then he waves one of his arms, and it blows halfway off. Then he shakes his other arm, and it starts to blow off entirely, and I realize that NOT ONLY is that shirt possibly going to fly into my windshield and blind me and kill me, but ALSO that he is  driving with his knees!  I didn't think that was possible on a motorcycle, but my suspicions were confirmed when I saw him take  both hands  off of the handles and THEN reach up over his head and pull off his undershirt!  So there we are, me, Dirty Blue Car Chick, and him, Half-Naked Motorcycle Weirdo. And to show you how desperate I am, I think, "Hm, he's got a pretty nice back. I guess there are worse things to look at." So I speed up to get a better look (oh, come one, like you wouldn't), and see,  to my horror , that he is disgustingly ugly! He has sunburned rolls of fat flowing from his beer belly! He has a scraggly beard! And, now, he is entirely pitted with squicky bug corpses! Why are there never hot guys taking off their shirts in front of me when I drive home? Why?! It's only the ugly ones that feel the need to strip, like the Big Girl at the dance wearing a miniskirt and a halter top. I'm not Susie SlimFast myself, but I know it, and you know what I do? I keep my Woman Hips covered! Le Sigh.  So, of course, rather than Hot Half-Naked Motorcycle Man, I get Chubbo Dirtbag Biker to view. But then you know what happened? It started to rain. Crazy Stripping Motorcyclist refused to reclothe (which I guess is understandable), and the last I saw, was left with runny bug bits all over him, and his shirt tucked away in his bag behind him where he couldn't easily get to it. So I suppose there is some justice in this world after all.  So Ciao Y'all,  Susan

      My, my, my, what an eventful past few days I've had. First, to update everyone on my little pest control problem, let me say that while she is The Roach, I am decidedly A Chicken. Nothing good can come of confronting either Punch or The Roach, and something bad (like losing my job) might, so I am just pretending (like Punch) that nothing has happened, and hoping to find a teaching job soonsoonsoon. (Since school starts on Aug 11 in Houston, it needs to be very soon indeed. We shall see.)  Right now I am trying to ignore my "real life" while I visit my family in Arkansas. It's a pleasant fantasy to imagine that I actually live here and I have no other concern than to get up in the morning & read books and maybe write a little, and then spend the evening playing Clue with my family. I just need a little break from GrownUp Land. Good Friend Josh suggests that "sometimes you need to water your roots." My roots are parched, so I am trying to make up for that. I have been terribly, terribly homesick this past week (more so than usual), bursting into tears at the thought of being separated from my family. There's no particular reason for this, though I suspect that increased job stress, upcoming divorce hearings, and birthday all coincididng were factors.  Anyway, so, I've been really looking forward to this chance to go home &amp; relax. I flew out of the office on Wednesday evening and flung my clothes, clean & dirty together, into my trunk, and raced off onto TX Hwy 59 North. I'm feeling good, I'm singing along with Modest Mouse, and then as I hit contruction, I notice that there is a message waiting for me on my cell phone. I won't be going anywhere for a while, so I check it and discover that a school wants to interview me the next day for a teaching position to be filled by that following afternoon (Thursday). I am excited, but also upset because at this point, I just want to go home, I don't care about any stupid job. After much inner debate and discussion with my father, I turn the car around and trudge BACK through construction &amp; into my apartment, alone again for another pointless evening, with the added bonus of needing to find some clean clothes in my trunk that can be made presentable for a job interview.  So, I wake up the next morning, I have clothes, I am more enthused about the school (a great school, one of the best public schools in Houston, and had I received a phone call from them at another time, I would've been bouncing off the walls with excitement.), and I am ready to knock their socks off and get a job. I show up at 8:30 and say, "Here I am," and they say, "Come back at noon," so of course, I do, even though I am delaying my trip (which is very important to me, but, obviously, not to anyone else) by several hours now. I am finally interviewed, and I think I did well, though my memory of it is hazy. They say they'll tell me either way by around 4, so I go back to my apartment and read  The DaVinci Code  while I wait for a phone call which will never come. Or as close to never as you can get by 5 o'clock, at which point I decided a) that  The DaVinci Code  was not terribly exciting or or controversial or even anything I hadn't heard, and what was all the fuss about? and b) that I was leaving town and that was that.  So, I leave a full day later than expected, almost get blown off the road and flooded out in Marshall, TX during a random cloudburst/thunderstorm-of-death, and am forced to buy what must be the most expensive gas in Arkansas in Mandeville at a whopping $1.92/Gal for the unsnazziest grade of gas available. Otherwise, the trip was uneventful.  So, that's the couple of days you missed. Today has been a fairly relaxing day, as I mentioned, but also a little bit odd. I don't really know how to feel right now. Today is my birthday, which is nice, because I get cake & presents, and whenever I don't want to do something, I just have to say, "But it's my birthday," and the discussion's over. My brother (9 years old, remember) paid me this nicest compliment today. He gave me a pretty silver necklace that he picked out himself, and asked me to put it on so that he could see how it looked on me. I did, and he said, "Oh, you look so  beautiful! " This from a nine-year-old boy who likes to pretend to eat his boogers just to gross his older sisters out. So that was really nice, probably the nicest thing I've heard in a long while.  But-- it's my 23rd birthday, and my life is really not where I want it to be. I imagined having a family, or if not a family, then graduate school, and if not graduate school, then obviously on tour promoting my latest best-selling novel. None of these are happening, and are not likely to happen for some time. I'd need at least,  at least , another year just to do graduate school, and that's not taking cost into account. Well, to end the ramble, I like birthdays, but I don't like the little snapshot o' life this particular birthday shows, and I am discouraged about how to change it.  Secondly, I am now officially &amp; legally a free woman. As of around 2 o'clock this afternoon, my divorce was (is?) final. I can do all kinds of wild single things now. Nothing in particular comes to mind, but, um, I'm sure there's something. I guess I could go on a date, or meet people I might potentially go on a date with. I am happy, because I can get on with my life. I am happy, because I gave my marriage my best shot, and it wasn't an entirely negative experience by any means. I am happy, because the only person holding me back now is me.  On the other hand, it's really really sad & terrible. For the past month or so, I've looked back on my marriage and seen nothing but a pitted wasteland filled with billowing mustard gas. Last night, though, I was having an imaginary conversation with someone (the things a person does to stay awake on the road...), and I asked myself, "Well, wasn't there  anything  good about your marriage? Aren't you going to miss  anything  about being married to Sean?" And then I realized that of course there was. There were many beautiful, special things, and those are the things I will miss, and that is why I am sad.  Finally, it's just a little disorienting. Sean &amp; I have been separated for two months now, officially, so you'd think I'd be used to this feeling, but I don't know... When I got married, as soon as the ceremony was over, I immediately felt different. I expected, then, that as soon as my divorce was final, I would feel different again. But that hasn't happened that way. Everything is still the same; the same dull ache, the same itchy eyes, and the same heavy shoulders combined with the familiar heady, giddy, laugh-out-loud, spin-in-a-circle-under-the-sunshine-in-a-green-green-park elation. In other words, I expected peace, and found only more of the opposite.  So there is the very long, likely verbose, sleep-deprived account of my past couple of days. I hope you all are doing well.  Resignedly,  Susan

      So, I have job trauma. I thnk that's a pretty safe assertion. The job I've held for the past little while is ok, but not a career. It's been fun, because everyday there's something different. Let me tell you about something "different" that happened last week...  In our real estate office, there are two agents that I work for, who will be called Punch & Judy (because I will not divulge real names on the Internet and possibly be sued for slander or libel or whatever you call it when it's on the Internet (Is the Internet print media or no? Perhaps potential-law-student Josh could enlighten us?)). So we have Punch &amp; Judy at the top of the list, and then underneath, there are a whole slough of assistants. Myself, Sam the Girl (not her name), & Sam the Boy (not his name, but who dates Sam the Girl) are the main ones. Lately, Punch (my boss) has been calling in another assistant, who I will refer to "affectionately" as The Roach.  The Sams and I are not sure why The Roach showed up as an assistant. Initially, Punch needed help with open houses, and Judy knew The Roach's family, so they called her in for that. Punch paid The Roach and she (The Roach is female) went off, ostensibly to hold the home open for random peole to walk through and stain the carpet, but in actuality, she went and... I don't know, got her nails done or something, but I know she didn't show up to hold the house open! And she kept the $50 check Punch gave her, too.  Well, with this kind of work history, you can see why Punch would want her in the office. Sam the Girl and I are just going along, doing our daily genuflecting Punch-work, wondering "Why is The Roach here? Well, Judy's out of town, so maybe Punch wants extra help, even though there's very little business right now." Sam the Girl feels a little bad for The Roach, since she doesn't really know anyone here in the office, and she doesn't really know how Punch likes things done, and The Roach seems a little overwhelmed by everything. So Sam the Girl has lunch with The Roach , and they talk about work and about Sam the Boy and about The Future and so forth. Everything's fine, right?  Well, Sam the Boy calls Sam the Girl from Hawaii, where he and Judy (his mom) are vacationing. Apparantly, The Roach, in her little roach-y way has been trying to get in good with Punch by spreading lies about Myself &amp; Sam the Girl. While Sam the Girl & I are out  working , The Roach is relaxing in the nice, padded-chair, air-conditioned office, chit-chatting with Punch. "Oh, Punch, I didn't want to say anything at the time, but you wouldn't  believe  what Sam the Girl &amp; Susan are saying about you..." and so forth from there. Punch is paranoid about people talking about her, so she calls Judy at some outrageous hour, like, 3 am Hawaii time, freaking out about the alleged gossip tendencies of Sam the Girl & Myself. Judy, half-awake, tries to defend us "I don't know, Punch, that just doesn't sound like them..." Well, foolishly, Sam the Girl &amp; I are assuaged by this. Judy is defending us. Everything will be ok. And she's only going to be gone anouther 5 days, and then Punch will start acting a little more like a human being again. We're furious, but we're sure that Judy will take care of it when she gets back.  Well, Sam the Girl & I joke with The Receptionist about all the terrible things that we want to do to The Roach-- key her brand new Jeep, cut her brakelines, dye her skin blue while she sleeps, shave her head while she sleeps, poison her, let her take our jobs (the perfect revenge), etc.-- but we're really mostly upset with Punch for believing such nonsense. Sam the Girl &amp; I are not gossips. Well, maybe this makes me one now, but ok. ASIDE from this, we are not gossips, and certainly not at work, and certainly not in REAL ESTATE where people would cut your throat & sell your blood back to you if they could get away with it. And we would especially NEVER EVER say such things to The Roach, who we didn't even know. But for whatever paranoid-delusional reason, Punch has chosen to believe The Roach, and is steadily phasing Sam the Girl &amp; I out. "Oh, you don't need to come in Monday, I'll have The Roach here." "Why don't you two take the afternoon off? The Roach will be here, and you seem so stressed lately." All right, notice to the public: When your boss starts pretending to be nice to you, worry. Since when has Punch ever cared about our stress level? Sam the Girl works even more than I do, and is regularly chewed up and spit out by Punch, and never ever ever ever in the time that I've worked for Punch has our well-being ever really been an issue. (Which is not to say that Punch doesn't care about us, because she does, in her way. When I told her about my upcoming divorce, she gave me a $2/hr. raise, and doubled my hours, and made sympathetic noises. But, really, unless business is going gangbusters, she doesn't care.)  So, the curtains are drawing shut for us. I still have no teaching job, and while I try to be hopeful, I really don't see anything happening by the end of August. I am going to talk to Punch about this ("I have worked with you for over a year, and I enjoy this job. I would not say mean things about you. How could that possibly benefit me?") as soon as she lets me come back to the office. (Likely tomorrow.) I am debating whether or not to speak to The Roach. I probably won't, as she seems to already know that we're on to her. She scurries around with her head down and flees whenever the light turns on. But regardless of who I speak to, or when, the fact remains that I have no job lined up. There is a possiblity that I could get a job working for a health insurance company, or writing content for how-to books, but I really don't want to do either of those things. Oh, well.  I am going out of town later this week, back "home" to Arkansas, so that I can be with my family for my birthday. I resolve not to freak about my job situation further until I return. Hope you all are well, not extremely bored by my very long post. :) If you want something a little more... potentially substantial, you can check out Josh Holt's blog at  urlLink http://www.beforesleep.blogspot.com/ , which details his adventures in Boston. Or, if you're interested in further information about The Roach, you can read more about her and view pictures at  urlLink http://www.doubledtermite.com/roaches.html .  Happy Trails!  Susan
