       A Story    i've got a book of matches i've got a can of kerosene i've got some bright ideas involving you and me  -Alkaline Trio    My wrists hurt. They hurt bad; bad enough to make to make me forget about the blood that randomly drips down my head. I'm dirty and soaked with sweat, but it's a different kind of sweat. The kind that comes straight from your adrenal glands and makes you shake. Rope burn has eaten away the skin on my wrists and the sweat that slowly rolls down my arms reminds me that my nerves are frayed, but good enough to prioritize pain. How... how the fuck did I end up here?  I shift around in the chair nearly tipping over. This room stinks. The smell of untimely demise is the air. That, or the bag of trash rotting in the corner slowly dissolving every one of the hairs in my fucking nose. How do I live in this shithole? It's funny how these things suddenly matter given my current situation.  I have no idea how you got my gangly ass in this chair. It must have been during one of my classic blackouts; the kind that start on Monday and last for a days at a time. I challenge you to find a quicker way to the weekend.  I can't even remember how this drag race into a brick wall started. Was it the bar? Did I pick your feral ass up in a kennel? Shit, are those my teeth on the ground...  So much for not in the face.  Christ I feel like roadkill. I assume I’ve done something wrong that you would have me in this chair tied up and padlocked?! For the love of God,  padlocked?  Maybe it was cheating on you for the umpteenth time. I don’t even know anymore; the blackouts are my carte blanche. This is all your fault anyway. You should know better. Moving into my place, bringing along a truck full of baggage in just two suitcases.  I should have known better.   Nothing worse than throwing two addicts together. Nothing worse than you. I’d rather be doing shots of brake fluid than having to deal another day with your sorry ass. Yet somehow, I have a feeling I’m going to get my wish; sans brake fluid.  And there it is, right against the back of my head. The .45 I kept under the bed by the dirty magazines and an empty bottle of Jim Beam. Not that I tried to hide it very well.  ”You never loved me.”  What the fuck? Of course I never loved you. There was nothing to love. Two sorry holes for souls with a matching lust and appreciation for self-destruction. You brought your ex-boyfriend home and fucked him on my bed for some H. At least I kept my infidelities out of the house. This cleverly translates to, “Whore. Fuck off.”  I let out a pretty good scream when you pistol whipped me on the head, but the real pain came when you circled around and followed up with hit to the right side of my face. I thought my head was imploding, but no, just my teeth splintering and my jaw fracturing. That’s all.  I’m leaned over and I can faithfully say that this is the most pain I’ve ever been in. And now here I am at the quinticessntial point of existence, the end of it. You’re crying and shouting something at me. I’d like to tell you I’ll miss you, but lying isn’t the way I should go. I’ll miss this shithole kitchen I’m about to cover, the burn that Jimmy B leaves as he cascades down my throat, fuck I might even miss the thrill of the chase that got me here, but the shovel that dug me deeper can go back in the shed with the rest of the tools.  I'd like to go out with a line, give you a wink, a sneer, but I can't even breathe and you don't play with your food. You pull the trigger; a deafening pop and the silence of darkness.  From the silent depths of darkness, it comes back crushingly heavy and without warning; an ocean of conciousness drops on you and the sound is deafening. Black subsides to white and slowly you come to a hazy light in this room of your own design. Disoriented at best; the sweat, the blood, the fear and pain all fighting to register at the same time in your cranium. Your chest rattles as you try to breathe from the periodic bouts of crying and pain, the little you remember.   The crulest tricks are the happy endings your mind tries to write from the failures you have created. All you can do is wait to wake up. One thing stands out in this vertiginous shift in reality: The cold, round shape firmly pressed against your head. Your entire life balanced between your temple and the hammer of my .45. Cutting through the static in your ear drums, my parting love in a shouted whisper:  "Just remember baby, I'm fatally yours..."

       Poetry     squad car    kicked out the window  handcuffed and tired of this  made a break for the hills  tired of the way your  weeping will kills.   it doesn't matter.   running from what won't chase me  and still handcuffed to myself;  once a felon, always a felon.  a convicted heartbreaker  and i can't,  i won't turn back.   it doesn't matter.   caught myself  trying to force your hand,  make you say the things  that i want to hear;  words built on the essence of intent.  no more than a scripted idyllic.  no more than the shadows we cast.   it doesn't matter.   because when it matters  it stirs the heart,  brings us to action,  and the cusp of defeat.  a pledge to hang our four chambers on;  fully accepting the danger of piercing that which  we so unforgivingly give up.   i have no time to watch this turn to dust.  i have locks to pick  and to see when it does truly matter.

       A Character Sketch   She makes you breathe in the ethereal. The way she writes of kings and kingdoms in newly-minted mythology and throws around a posh, post-modern femininity. Most of the time, you have no clue as to what she's getting at; accessiblity difficult enough to invoke a light inferiority and question her sobriety.  She crushes on crushes, leaving her crushed by the weight of her expectations regardless of her own checks and inbalances. Her love and optimism are refreshingly new, impenetrable to reality, and surprising to find at this age in life. Her duels with common sense leave their  marks, but she only smiles, understanding, unwavering.  She makes you believe in God and the big picture. You didn't need any help, but it was nice to know someone out there thinks that somebody else is running the show and even though you can't agree on whether the Almighty Button Pusher wears high tops or low tops, you both agree that the A.B.P.  must  have a pretty solid sense of humor, c'mon look at this place.  And when the tree you lean against leans back, shows you the broken branches, wounded and split, those shady leaves doing their best to cover a hard-earned ring, how do you respond? You want to hold her, cradle her; though 'tis difficult to cradle someone who can block your own jumpshot. You hum a few bars and fake it, hoping that the beating of your heart contains the remorse code of an amplified empathy to heal wounds wound tight to the world.  They are the bumps you laugh and sigh over. A friendship built on an engine of validation, fueled by late-night conversations, enlightened and leveraged, flying top down arguing all the way over whose indie music tastes are cooler; only to settle for the radio's "hot hits."  You still don't get her writing. Maybe it's better that way.

       The Beginning of My End   I put this up as an inside joke. My ex-girlfriend made the comment that I should have faked my own death; she was having a hard time with the break up. This got me thinking in the fictional and I figured I'd use this forum to post the short stories and prose that I write. I'm dead, so none of it can be real, right?

       A Story   [Reaching back to a classic. Requested by Michael Joseph Coughlin.]    Fully Loaded   It wasn't so much a death wish as it was a combination of morbid curiosity and impulsiveness. There I was, flying down Route 3 at about 12:45 in the afternoon. I was going 76 miles an hour in the passing lane, when I decided to jerk the wheel sharply to the left into the guardrail. I always told myself if I was going to have a car accident it would be during rush hour, I wanted a 23 car pile-up. I'm not sure why 23, it's just the number that satisfied me best.  It's tough to describe my thought pattern in between the jerk of the steering wheel and the initial impact. Somewhere between instant gratification and realization that this might be the final curtain, I think I wet myself, or maybe it was the bottle of water I keep on the seat. Maybe its top came off.   As the left front fender slammed into the guardrail, it kicked the steering wheel the other way, swinging the back of the car into the guardrail. My head followed the fish-tailing motion; the potential energy of my skull becoming kinentic as my head connected with the driver's side window. The glass shattered sending pieces of it outside, some on the seat, a lot embedded into the top left side of my skull.  The initial pain was searing, a mixture of the grotesque sound of my head thumping the glass, followed closely by the lacerations. Although engrossed with my impending situation, I could vaguely hear the few fellow motorists behind me slam on their brakes. The magic number was not to be mine.  As the car started to veer back over the passing lane, I felt the need to get things back under control, quickly for my sake. My hands were bouncing around, almost floating in the air as the car bucked out of control. I threw my hands on the down beat instead of the up. I hit the wheel incredibly hard with the left hand. Recalling the sound of the last time I broke my finger, the cacophony of breaking bones, was superseded only by my stomach's gymnastic routine with the turn in events. I slammed the wheel so hard that it fish-tailed the entire back end and put the front of the car approximately 167 degrees counterclockwise, almost facing the guardrail. This combined with the speed, and over-compensating steering error on my part sent my 1988, navy blue, four door, Ford Crown Victoria Sedan into what one might call, "a roll-over of comedic proportions."  About half-way through the first roll of the car I figured out what was going on as the sky and the ground took turns in a twisted game of leap frog. It was like the third movement of a symphony, the glass breaking, the sound of metal scraping the pavement, the echoes of "Go with the Flow" coming from my CD player. My car had become a black hole trying to suck itself into nothing. I think my right femur broke as it slammed into the steering wheel when the roof hit the pavement for the first time. Heading into roll number two, the seat belt gave out and I became a meat puppet of fate. The CD player cut out just as Mr. Josh Homme said, "I want something good to die for, to make it beautiful to live, I can go..." I wasn't necessarily inspired so much as relieved that it was not a radio ad for Bob's Discount Furniture as my swan song. All the windows had shattered, the front windshield spider-webbed, and started to peel from the top right corner. When the roof hit the pavement for the second time, I was lying almost flat on the seat. My left hip was the primary contact point of the roof and ground and I don't remember the pain so much as I recall the feeling of bone turning into powder when the flesh/metal/pavement connection was made.   The car slowed and ended tires up in the air into the third roll. Two and a half rolls are the official count for all those concerned about the stats. There was cold air to mix with the warm blood running down my face. The intense shine of the high winter sun bouncing off the pavement, made me squint. I thought I was in bed for a moment and trying to get up. I wiggled the toes on my left foot sending a dump truck worth of pain synapse back to my brain. This alerted me to the fact that I was not dreaming, but I was alive, sort of.   Lying somewhere between Existence and Essence was the ultimate folly for me. The sounds of help on the way, and the way reality would not stop changing color or take a commanding form will really throw one for a loop. Outright fear hit at this point realizing that I was probably going to die, and I came 200 miles short from seeing my lovely sedan cross the 100,000 mile mark just to experiment what it would be like as a giant, metal skipping stone.  The jaws of life are really loud. Even when you can feel yourself fading out from consciousness, That metallic reverberation really resonates off the cold, steel doors. Garbled voices and flashlights, intense pain mixed with medical personnel movement is where the details get a little sketchy. I'm alone and it's dark. I'm in pain but I'm not hurting. Quite honestly I don't know if I'm dead or alive. Maybe this is what I get for being an Existentialist Catholic. I tried to play both sides, and now I don't know what side I'm on. Touche God, touche.

       Old Poetry    snowblind    i woke up cradled next to you,  your wavy-blonde hair woven  into my tactile-deprived hands.  big brown eyes slowly open,  as stretching ensues.   there is half a foot of  snow on the ground.  we took a grade-school chance  and lucked out.  no work,  no class,  no need to leave the safety  of these cotton sheets.   we exchange  morning-breath kisses  and sleep the day away.   lunch rides high  on the waves of my comforter  and the only thing that feels  better justified procrastination,  is the counter-clockwise motion  of my fingers on  the small of your back.   my alarm rings true at 7:32 a.m.  i hear cars on the street as i always do,  and know that the snow has left me hanging.   alone, i roll out of bed.  shower, a change of clothes,  and i’m out the door.  there is consolation snow fall  as i walk to class.   light and wet,  it floats down as a testament  to the millions of ways we could have been.  each as different as the flakes  that mock me  walking towards campus.   cold is a relative feeling,  but not descriptive enough,  for the bed i left unmade,  and without you.

       Poetry    kiddo   there he was bounding along  in the corner of my eye  just a little kid dancing.   up and down the driveway  in lock step  so hot fresh  to the beat  of a beatless drummer.   there i sat  fit to be shirt and tied,  knowing that he couldn’t give  two plastic action figures  of the turkey stuffed into  suit and shoes,  wrapped in pinstripe obligations.   but i could day dream; squeeze my feet  into velcro animal sneakers,  hop up and down my driveway.  6 years old; just a little kid dancing.

       Pick Up the Spare   This January has probably been one of my worst months in recent memory, and this rotten little child of the 12-month calendar is doing its best to go out the way it came in: like pulling a fish hook out of my hand. An entertaining fish hook though, entertaining.  As my brother and I got out of the car at my apartment, I came around the back to notice my license plate was gone. Then came this wonderful exchange:  Me: "Um, did you happen to see the license plate Jon?" Jon: "Nope, me thinks it's gone."  After loading the car with dirty laundy and blazers for the funeral, my brother and I made a quick trip back to my parking spot to find the two screws that held in my license plate on the ground. Joy, somebody stole it, but at least they were kind enough not to take the screws with them. Such noble degenerates around this neighborhood. So here I am without a back plate, and I need to get my butt back to CT. I'm not sure if I should try to fill out a police report, since aforementioned noble degenerate is probably riding around in a pilfered vehicle with my plate on the back, but figure that this is nothing that can't be solved when I get back.  Leaving Boston, on a Friday, at 5 p.m. is... interesting. In the 10 minutes it took me to get out of Boston, I was nearly T-boned trying to make it out of a left turn, and some wonderfully obtuse lady decided not to look in my direction as she just casually pulled out right in front of me to make a left hand turn. It's times like these that I wish when I honked my horn, a giant cartoon-like hand, with giant cartoon-like mallet would pop out of the hood and smash the offending motor vehicle with Looney Tunes accuracy. Sigh, if only life was like the acid trip in my head.  After my best display of assertive driving, Jon-boy and I make it onto I-90 and head home. Traffic, not worth detailing, we all know what its like.  Later on that evening I met up with Bubs and his brother in-law, Jay, to do some bowling. It's Southington, you do what you can. I never knew woodsheds had smoke machines and lights because Jay took me out back and laid me out 10 pin style. Of course he's married and has plenty of time to work on his bowling skills, but I was incredibly bad. I threw 4 straight gutter balls. That's right, 4. After pondering whether I would just wait in the car, I held out and followed up with two mediocre games; hey it's better than sitting at home watching TV.  Isn't it?  Today I was woken up early by my father to go to the DMV to get new plates to replace my stolen one. My father has a cruel sense of humor, dragging my tired ass to the DMV before a funeral, but at least we got new plates. GFG use to be the last 3 letters of my plate. James used them as a neumonic device to remember my car. "All I can think of is 'Good Fucking God,' when I see that," he would say. Those days have passed, but now the last 3 letters are SXE. Those still entwined in tradition may still refer to it as "the batmobile." Those who choose to go in with the new, the Crown Victoria will answer to "sexy."  Today was also the funeral for my Great Uncle Joe. In short, although I hadn't seen him much in the last few years, today was still difficult. It was a nice ceremony. Taps is a sad song. The end.  I finally got my baby back. My lovely flame green custom guitar is now back in my possesion. This combined with previously mentioned amp, will cause me to make sweet music and forget that I'm an idiot for at least a few weeks.   I'm glad this month is done. I'm hoping that February isn't warming up the spanking machine for me. Tonight, I leave to hang with Ms. Curtis. Tomorrow, back up to bean town and the large body of work I need to get done.   Are you afraid of being alone?  (A.P.T. 8:19 p.m.)

       Redemption... Five Cents   Once again, my boy J-Bigs has come through. I erased his quote so I will ad-lib at best. "You need to start fresh." A little spark when off in my brain. I need to jumpstart this dead heap called "Senior Semester." I've dragged too much crap from 2003 with me through the back door. I am starting to make other people crazy let alone the number I've been doing on myself for a couple weeks now. I can't get a handle on the school work that is piling up, plus this nasty ring around the collar stain that just won't give.   Enter: February 6, 2004, Day of Atonement  {Hi-ya!}   I'm not going to call it the bender to end all benders, but I do plan on going out with my boys and making quite the night of it. Blackouts? Quite possibly. Plus, rumor has it that Mr. Coughlin might be in town, and he is always ready to mix it up (read: overdo it). "Why Mark, why?" Time to clean house, and what better way to empty your polluted brain than to scrub off a few brain cells with alcohol. It comes down to hanging with my boys, emptying some bottles, and shedding some skin through a violent hangover that will haunt me all day Saturday.   Could this backfire? Yes, in a total and complete fallout of chaos. Desperate times call for desperate measures, which call for Tequila. If you come, you're in. This is Atonement folks, this isn't ballroom dancing. Though I will probably try to ballroom dance with a wall before the night is over.  Attempting to drag myself up from Pity Lane.  (A.P.T. 11:53 p.m.)

       Blog in the Key of E minor   I haven't done much blogging as of late. Surprisingly enough I'm running out of ways to say how out of it I am. I really don't care a whole lot about much lately other than re-stringing my Gibson Flying V, or logging in more nerd hours into Sword of Mana for my Gameboy. I think I've just burned right out from last semester. 5 classes, 21 hours of work a week, and God knows whatever else I did have finally caught up.   I'm not quite sure if this entry will be my normal inane ramblings or what. I ate 6 Double Stuf Oreos and my pancreas just went into some kind of seizure. It's a little fuzzy around the edges and I'm just letting the words fly up onto the screen.  My Great Uncle Joe shuffled off to the next plane of existence last Thursday. While I was not particularly close to him, I would have like to have known on Thursday, not on Sunday when I called home. "Well, it didn't seem like it was worth calling," said my dear, sweet M.o.m. (Master of micromanagement). No harm, no foul, just odd. So I head back to the behemoth known as Connecticut Friday afternoon for a memorial Saturday. I don't like the fact that these things have become so assembly line for me. There are way too many old people in my family. Well, there used to be.   On a positive note, my custom guitar is finally set up. I will retrieve it from the East Coast Music Mall, plug it into my baby (Mesa amp), and play the wonderful tune of "Flat Out Broke." Oh sweet, I got rent coming up too. Awesome, at least I sound good. I get to hang out with Bubs when I'm home. He and his brother in-law Jay are quite the fun time; and that means a lot when you live in a town like Southington.  On an academic note, I think my Senior Design Project is starting to come together. I'm working on taking several pieces of poetry I've written and really try to express them on paper as if I was speaking them. I hope to create a hardcover book and a time-based piece to accomany it as well. Although, I'm starting to hate my own writing after staring at it for so long. Hopefully this will get done before I can't stand another one of my random metaphors.  I'm up to about 80 minutes of running. I feel like I might just be able to pull off this half-marathon thing. I don't think I'll run a sub-2 hour time like I want, but if my knees don't explode like broken pistons on February 29, I think I will be almost as content. I'm trapped in a catch-22; I'd really like snow, so as not to do an 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. run of studio class, but this same grace-saving snow, would put a crimp in my running plans depending on how well Boston cleans up after itself. Roll the dice baby, let's see what happens.  "Friendship is like the Eucharist, gonna be there every Sunday no matter what you do."  My boy J-bigs chiming in on a topic I had discussed with him. I don't feel like elaborating, but his line is refreshing and reassuring, just like a fresh spritz of Listerine in the eye. Good luck at your new job by the way.   I'm tired of having to learn the hard way.  Well, looks like I painted myself in a corner. Good night folks.  Like a bad star, I'm falling faster, down to her. She's the only, one who knows what it is to burn. -Finch  (A.P.T. 11:51 p.m.)

       Big Hank   I received a note from My Junk, care of Mr. Henry Foster.   Dearest Mark,  I humbly request that from now on, you please refrain from bringing me within close proximity of the anuses of farm animals and young children. I would also beg of you that you no longer try to sever me while intoxicated, sobbing "WHY, GOD, WHY COULDN'T I HAVE BEEN A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN!?!?"  Sincerely, Your Penis   Thank you Mr. Foster, you are a scholar and a gentleman.  (A.P.T. 4:22 p.m.)

       Abridged So I Can Go to Abed   It's like the Sports Center highlights of my weekend.  Kathryn, you are my best friend and I love you dear, but you need to understand that the green Sauconies are the best thing to happen to you since me.  My building was on fire this weekend. Fire is hot.  Sarah is always entertaining. I need to buy more stock in hanging out with Sarah, but it's hard to come by.  I am tired, details will come as the week progresses.  Go fish.

      When will this poetry ever end? Probably after this one.    (Written sometime in Winter of 2002.)  original fruit  working late. which doesn't say much,  considering i am always working late.  i need something to chew on. these rusty nickels will not do. i need some kind of sugar fix.  i hear the candy machine beckon...  late-night scuttle, to a false, but tasty idol. 75 cents for a bag of skittles? do not insult me my large, inanimate friend. yet, there i am walking back to my station, bag of rainbow in hand. voluntary larceny. stupid sugar fix.  as i sit,  i tear the bag open. geez these suckers can bounce. a cascade of tooth decay bounds across table.  i hang over them omnipotently. these skittles, forming a line of random protest between me and satisfaction. i will undermine their bite-size candy union.  i munch on a couple of oranges. pause for a moment and glance upon the candyscape. a large pile of mixed, matched, multiple colors.  i separate flavors into their various tribes. i fear i may be separating loving candy couples. greens who love reds, yellows who canoodle with oranges. it's okay. you'll all end up in the same place. i promise.  i see a yellow who has tried to made a break for it. now it's on a one way trip to my pancreas.  i hate when you coax your way back into my head. appearing in the guise of the weirdest analogies. like God appearing as a burning bush, you now have my attention.  you are my lemon.  one, because green is my favorite color. two, you compliment me. image is nothing,  thirst is everything. and there is nothing like the blunder, of me trying to find my way back to you.  apart, lemon and lime make up for all the other medicore fruit flavors. but the tastebuds celebrate diversity. the rare delicacy of certain combinations, that just feel right.  yet, the aftertaste of rejection, is the price to pay for indulgence. but washing it out was easy, just a swimming pool of listerine.  4 out of 5 dentists recommend staying away from sweets. but one does not,  he's the only one i hear.  for you tasted too good, and i'll never learn, until they pull all the teeth out of my head.   This one is up because Ms. Curtis enjoys my candy metaphors.  (A.P.T. 8:41 p.m.)

       Demands to Supply   Apparently I keep America's bored workforce occupied. I was scolded for lack of recent posts. I hear the people and I return with more poetry.   (Originally written in Spring of 2003, I think.)  backbrace  thinking  wandering aimlessly through my brain, a solid cloud of memory induced amnesia, i always do too much, ...thinking.  at the most inopportune time, attempting to figure out what is sometimes unanswerable. too many trips to the well with a hole in bucket, dear sally. dear sally.  the many ways from sunday,  that i could tear myself into serving size pieces, while running in cirlces. of course it wouldn't be me, if my brain wasn't trying to  out-think itself.  of   yesterday, today, and tomorrow. a puzzle missing pieces, that might not even fit to begin with.  those that slide gently, make the cornerstone sky. drop the hammer frustration, cirlce into square; maximum coefficient of friction. the plateau-like shape my head now assumes, from pressing matters all to often.  yoU  the promise, the lift with the legs only reality. where they line up, and where they fall down. indelibly erasable, memories, grooved and traceable, hoping we are sustainable,  flailing in my awkward grace.   That one is all about taking a simple statement and seeing how much exists in-between the lines. But you knew that.  (A.P.T. 3:11 p.m.)

       Poetic Intermission   After setting the blender in my head to liquify, I figured I would spend the next few days dropping some poems I have written. Some are fresh, some are being re-edited, some are just total stabs in the dark. Once I get my head on straight, I'll be back in all my pretentious fury.   (Originally written in May of 2003)  4-piece set  one night stand. one lamp. one dresser, sans mirror, and you. i need to be more careful  of what i furnish my bedroom with.  when shadows crawl over your skin, accentuate the you from who my thoughts make you out to be, i need to check the door of my fridge, for mental post-it notes i leave.  recall that while wrapped tightly, this pretty package is not mine.  and the things that are hardest to catch, everybody already knows about. and if i believed in feng shui, i'd say you complete my bedroom. yet, unlike the dust in the corners, you are not a permanent fixture.  but, i have a glue gun, and a steely resolve.   More to come.  (A.P.T. 7:26 p.m.)

       Conversations with Spanish Penguins   Hand claps for Zach. He has made subject matter for two postings in a row. You're on fire buddy. The precursor to late-morning display of wit was the 25 minute staring contest I had with the back of my head at 4:27 a.m. I have yet to determine a course of events, if any are necessary. But until then, I can ponder the follicle possibilites!   the mighty m5:  i'm on rogaine.com. i think my life has offically hit rock bottom. i wish i had a dog, because right now someone would probably run him over.  El Pengueeno:  hahahahahaha.  El Pengueeno:  dude you need to get a woman.  the mighty m5:  oh i tried that. then i threw her overboard because i am an idiot.  El Pengueeno:  well what you need to do is start hanging around mental hospitals and find a woman who has minor brain damage and won't mind if you have some of your own issues to work out. she'll just sit quietly in the corner while you figure out your stuff. when your done, you'll just have to wipe away her drool, and viola! instant girlfriend!  the mighty m5:  awesome. zach mangan: probelm solver to the embittered.  El Pengueeno:  hahaha.  El Pengueeno:  that i am.  El Pengueeno:  i think its worth a shot.  the mighty m5:  i'm wondering when i'm gonna hit the karma jack pot. i've dealt with enough crap for the last couple months. i'm entitled to winning the lotto, or finding a brand new corvette with my name on it and some hot babe named tammy in the passenger seat.  El Pengueeno:  hahaha that you are, although lets hope that since we're talking karma, reincarnation hasn't decided to pay you back for being stalin.  the mighty m5:  fair enough.  Man, it's not even noon.  When in doubt, go rip off a 70 minute run.   Pow.  (A.P.T. 11:51 a.m.)

       Even After I Added Several Pounds of Hellman's Mayo, This Post is Still Lacking   So as I glance upon my passages of past writing, I notice a lack of optimism. So I sit here trying to figure out why and realize it's just that time of year for me. If you shift around the letters of mswooding, you get mood swing. simple as that. I'm a lucky bastard, yet I feel the need to be extra hard on myself lately. We'll get to that soon enough.   Weekend Recap:  Saturday night I went out with my boy, Zach, to be his deputy of fun. His girlfriend was meeting the rest of her medical school friends at Felt for a birthday, and I was asked to join the posse. Zach's girl, Marleen, while attractive and highly intelligent, decided that punctuality is for heathens and left me hanging by myself for about 30 minutes in the club. It's cool, she is forgiven, she bought me a drink. Felt was okay, I think it needs a second visit for official approval or disapproval. While waiting for Zach and Co., I surveyed the territory, lots of pretty people, but nobody seemed particularly approachable. Drinks were 8 dollars, combined with eye candy that didn't seem attainable, I sat neutral toward the club.   Marleen found her friends and Zach, Scotty (his roomie), and I ended up chatting most of the evening away. Sad to say, it didn't look like I was going to get myself a hot little Harvard Med. student. It's okay, I'll still marry rich somehow. I was appeased by the enriching conversation shared between Scotty, Zach, and myself, as well as some staring at a few highly attractive women playing pool directly behind us.   The pool table the birthday girl reserved was relinquished somewhere after midnight and I was told we would be going to the Big Easy. The Big Easy is located in the alley on Boylston. That's basically an area I just don't go to because it caters to no one in my demographic (intelligent, reasonably good-looking). I was half-drunk and I was Zach's deputy, so what the hey. I get in there and after taking a hit in the greenbacks by cover and coat check, I was treated to the antithesis of my bar existence. Big dance floor full of mediocre people, horrid drinks, did I mention I hated the people there? Marleen's friend seemed to have fun, so the primary goal was achieved. I was just along as an observer. Zach and I were dying to sell our stock in "Can we look like this is the last place we want to be... ever," when Marleen gave him the go ahead to head on home. Zach was exhausted anyway and after we got to his place he passed out as soon as I walked out the door. The night was entertaining though and I cemented my theory that the alley was not for me.  As a general rule I'm not a dance-club kind of guy. As mentioned before and surmised by this rampant, written babble, words are where I excel. I cannot tell a perspective female about my interests and cares, show my charm and wit, or demonstrate my kung-fu grip on the English language through the off-timed moves of my feet. Likewise, while probably entranced by persepctive females dance moves, I cannot tell if you suck at life, or might be someone worth getting to know. I dance when I'm safely hidden away in solid relationship (if that ever happens again). I use "dance" as a loose term to describe any spastic gyration I emit. Paint me biased, but so be it.   Attention: Clutch underpants and prepare for subject and style change.  Introspected by #22:  I've been trying to figure out what my problem is lately. I am having trouble getting back into the swing of school and I just can't get out of bed. Today I didn't wake up until 2:30 p.m. or so, and while I haven't done that in a while, I still feel like I'm wasting time. I think I have finally grown tired of school. I really like my courses and the work I do, but I just don't feel re-charged and ready to go. I hope I'll lock down soon. Really, who needs a college degree?  This section was long and whiney, so I tried to boil it down to single sentences that may or may not have any relevance from one to the next. This goes best with Metallica's cover of Last Caress as background music and the heater set on Medium for background noise.  For a while I've delt with mild bouts of depression, I think.  It has never been anything serious, and it never lasts too long.  I will assume that is what is making me crazy. I feel like I'm trying to minimize how much I fuck things up lately. I feel like I fuck a lot of things up. Am I trapped in this semi-self-perpetuating cycle of loss? Have I become so deluded as to think I can write semi-self-perpetuating cycle of loss and take myself seriously? No.  Why do I blow up a relationships for nonsensical reasons (Valerie, Deborah)? Because Elvis made me do it. Wouldn't you do what the King of Rock n' Roll told you to? Kimmy wanted poetry. Sorry Kim, maybe next time. I've been pushing on this brick wall for a long time. I thought it would budge. I was wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Not right. Consolation prize? I get to realize how everyone else has been right. How much time I've wasted. I did  build  the wall. Enlightenment can eat me. Fix me. I'm a  urlLink Phillips-Head.  I think.  Trying to regain balance.  No. Pulling balance down to me.  Somebody get some Quality Control on this kid's blog.

       Naked Women are like Free-Range Chicken,  or  You're Right and I'm Left   This blog is being written to Guster  Goldfly , and will be littered with lines from verses as I see fit.   The past has passed, and we cannot take it back (Great Escape).  It's seems that I have run my course in some people's lives lately. Whether they, the situation, or feelings have changed, I am no longer a worthy element in the composition. I would like to remedy the problem, but in either situation, I feel I don't have much of a say. Regardless of how much I'm doing already, I understand the need not to stretch myself too thin. I'm going to make it out of this semester by the skin of my teeth as is. I'm kicking the ball out of my court, have fun.   Honest is easy, fiction is where genius lies (Demons).  So the last few nights I've had trouble sleeping, I keep hearing faint sounds of construction, but have no clue where they are coming from. Today, after getting out of the shower, I figured it out. My Junk has built an elevator. Apparently it's so damn cold, that My Junk is tired of making the trek back into my body for self-preservation. My Junk, having some ingenuity, built a small freight elevator to load everyone up on and move into my body. The only tough part is the sound the motor makes during class, when My Junk deems it warm enough to return to ground zero.   And she looked, like she was not even there (X-ray Eyes).  Valerie came to visit me in the lab Monday. She had scratched her Maroon 5 (new website, tight Flash design, www.maroon5.com) CD and I gladly made her a new one. We chatted for a bit and I was glad to here she was doing well, and was recuperating from her nightmarish tonsil removal. Few people I've met are better than her at dealing with a lot of undeserved bullshit (including my own) in their lives and keep on rolling down that highway.  I've made my bed, and I'm lying in it, but I don't think I could apologize enough.   I am scared of the things upcoming. And I want for the things I don't have.  Cannot stand to be one of many, I'm not what they are (Rocketship).  I live with a sense of urgency. I feel like everyday I get up is one more day than I should have. Where do I get this from? Maybe it's my insane fear of mortality that manifests itself in a mild depression every season. Regardless of short stories, I do not see or plan on an early demise. I just feel like I'm living on borrowed time. Maybe this explains the babbling posts, my need to medicate myself with vast amounts of work, to be everybody's friend, and constant validation that I do something right. I have a need to do everything, and well, I'm going to  do it. Maybe it's the, "I'm 22 and need to get my shit together," and I just have a manic case. I've always felt like one with a loose wire in my head, and nobody's ever disputed it.   Apparently people are reading this babble, and they want to comment on it. If you are so moved by my whining, you can Instant Message me at  the mighty m5 , or you could e-mail me at mswooding@hotmail.com.  Was Colonel Sanders ever really a Colonel?  Easy.

       Fully Loaded   It wasn't so much a death wish as it was a combination of morbid curiosity and impulsiveness. There I was, flying down Route 3 at about 12:45 in the afternoon. I was going 76 miles an hour in the passing lane, when I decided to jerk the wheel sharply to the left into the guardrail. I always told myself if I was going to have a car accident it would be during rush hour, I wanted a 23 car pile-up. I'm not sure why 23, it's just the number that satisfied me best.  It's tough to describe my thought pattern in between the jerk of the steering wheel and the initial impact. Somewhere between instant gratification and realization that this might be the final curtain, I think I wet myself, or maybe it was the bottle of water I keep on the seat. Maybe its top came off.   As the left front fender slammed into the guardrail, it kicked the steering wheel the other way, swinging the back of the car into the guardrail. My head followed the fish-tailing motion; the potential energy of my skull becoming kinentic as my head connected with the driver's side window. The glass shattered sending pieces of it outside, some on the seat, a lot embedded into the top left side of my skull.  The initial pain was searing, a mixture of the grotesque sound of my head thumping the glass, followed closely by the lacerations. Although engrossed with my impending situation, I could vaguely hear the few fellow motorists behind me slam on their brakes. The magic number was not to be mine.  As the car started to veer back over the passing lane, I felt the need to get things back under control, quickly for my sake. My hands were bouncing around, almost floating in the air as the car bucked out of control. I threw my hands on the down beat instead of the up. I hit the wheel incredibly hard with the left hand. Recalling the sound of the last time I broke my finger, the cacophony of breaking bones, was superseded only by my stomach's gymnastic routine with the turn in events. I slammed the wheel so hard that it fish-tailed the entire back end and put the front of the car approximately 167 degrees counterclockwise, almost facing the guardrail. This combined with the speed, and over-compensating steering error on my part sent my 1988, navy blue, four door, Ford Crown Victoria Sedan into what one might call, "a roll-over of comedic  proportions."  About half-way through the first roll of the car I figured out what was going on as the sky and the ground took turns in a twisted game of leap frog. It was like the third movement of a symphony, the glass breaking, the sound of metal scraping the pavement, the echoes of "Go with the Flow" coming from my CD player. My car had become a black hole trying to suck itself into nothing. I think my right femur broke as it slammed into the steering wheel when the roof hit the pavement for the first time. Heading into roll number two, the seat belt gave out and I became a meat puppet of fate. The CD player cut out just as Mr. Josh Homme said, "I want something good to die for, to make it beautiful to live, I can go..." I wasn't necessarily inspired so much as relieved that it was not a radio ad for Bob's Discount Furniture as my swan song. All the windows had shattered, the front windshield spider-webbed, and started to peel from the top right corner. When the roof hit the pavement for the second time, I was lying almost flat on the seat. My left hip was the primary contact point of the roof and ground and I don't remember the pain so much as I recall the feeling of bone turning into powder when the flesh/metal/pavement connection was made.   The car slowed and ended tires up in the air into the third roll. Two and a half rolls are the official count for all those concerned about the stats. There was cold air to mix with the warm blood running down my face. The intense shine of the high winter sun bouncing off the pavement, made me squint. I thought I was in bed for a moment and trying to get up. I wiggled the toes on my left foot sending a dump truck worth of pain synapse back to my brain. This alerted me to the fact that I was not dreaming, but I was alive, sort of.   Lying somewhere between Existence and Essence was the ultimate folly for me. The sounds of help on the way, and the way reality would not stop changing color or take a commanding form will really throw one for a loop. Outright fear hit at this point realizing that I was probably going to die, and I came 200 miles short from seeing my lovely sedan cross the 100,000 mile mark just to experiment what it would be like as a giant, metal skipping stone.  The jaws of life are really loud. Even when you can feel yourself fading out from consciousness, That metallic reverberation really resonates off the cold, steel doors. Garbled voices and flashlights, intense pain mixed with medical personnel movement is where the details get a little sketchy. I'm alone and it's dark. I'm in pain but I'm not hurting. Quite honestly I don't know if I'm dead or alive. Maybe this is what I get for being an Existentialist Catholic. I tried to play both sides, and now I don't know what side I'm on. Touche God, touche.    I like stories. Do you like stories?  That one goes out to B.O.C.  Alternate endings are for weenies.  My melodrama can beat up your melodrama.  The English minor that never got to be.  Song Time:  Say what you will, say what you mean.  No, you could never offend, Your dirty words come out clean. -Incubus  I will now play my Game Boy Advance SP, brush my teeth, and go to bed. Good Night.  (A.P.T. 1:07 a.m.)

       Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Sauconies   I am going for a run, it is 7 degrees at Logan Airport with a -13 feel. Awesome. I hope I don't freeze to death before the half-marathon.  Zen speaks like hammer, Mark is but a nail:  "If you mind is torn between two conflicting desires, the contradiction will destroy you mind's unity and tranquility. Just remember, when you should grab something, grab it; when you should let it go, let it go."  Everybody always asks, "Mark, what is the S. for?" The S. is for Self-Inflicted. This year marks the time to shuffle priorities and cut the slackers. I'm organinzing a corporate take-over of myself this time around; new management is necessary. Complicated? No. Fringe of sanity? Prove it. Life is knocking on my door and I'm going to surprise it with my infamous "One and Done Headlock." Yes the same headlock that ordered a big plate of facial abrasions for Christmas. It's on like Donkey Kong.  I am a love-less romantic. I will be riding the pine for a while, and with Senior Design Project, Animation Capstone, Multimedia Capstone 2 (2:1 odds on the death of me), and Business, Law, and Multimedia, maybe it's not such a bad thing. Workaholism, helping me avoid social situations since September 2003!  You're too late.  Careful with that mic...  (A.P.T. 2:29 p.m.)

       Ba-ba black sheep, have you any wool? Yes sir, yes sir, three bags full.   Who is this sheep? Where does he get his 3 bags of wool? Are they from other sheep? Does he lead a life of treason? Life taxes me once again with unanswered questions.  So I got up late today, that will end soon, whether I like it or not. I decided to take a trip. Why? Well, I have a car and I got gumption, though I took a Tums and the gumption finally dissipated. I hoofed out to Cape Cod to buy some sneakers. Consistently you will find out, I am one step ahead of you. You ask why drive out all that way, for sneakers? Well as mentioned before I had gumption, plus the store I go to has the sneaker I want, the color I want, the size I need for the pontoons I call feet, and they are almost 10 dollars cheaper than anywhere else. It was only an hour drive and the environment needs the poison fumes my 16 year old, navy blue sedan spits out.   After sneakers were successfully apprehended, I walked across the street bought a CD and headed back to the Sedan of Doom. Today felt like the day to try and see how many Massachusettes Interstates I could travel, game on! From Hyannis, Cape Cod I decided I was going to try and find the amp I've been looking for at the Guitar Center in Natick MA. I didn't want to cut back through the other side of Boston, So I figured I'd come up and around over 495 and up 90. Sure it's a little longer, but less traffic always makes me happy. Burning down 495, I decide I'm too cheap for the tolls and decide to head up 95 and over Route 9 to get there, minimize the back-tracking.   I finally reach Guitar Center and waltz on inside. Last time I found the amp I wanted some guy bought the last one right in front of me. Fate was on my side this time, I saw my amp, and no one was near it. Plus I screamed "MINE," and when everybody turned and looked, I licked the amp head several times emphasizing the ownership of the item. I fiddled around with it, and everything worked. I had bought an amp before and had problems when I got home so I was determined to do a rigorous test on this amp head before getting home and being unpleasantly surprised. While fiddling I was being bothered by the mustached sales associate, Marcus, enough that he became my go to guy to put it all together. I found a Mesa 2x12 cabinet to go with the head and dropped it all in front of the register. Holding my breath, the final cost came up; $1,693 and change. Surprisingly the credit card didn't melt, but now I'm officially poor. I have the luck that my parents are paying for half of it as a Christmas gift, but that's still a lot for me to be spending. Oh well, I have a new amp and you don't. Joy.  So it's 5:30 p.m. and I can feel the traffic building on Route 9, I decide to give in and take 90 back, pay the toll and I'm home by 6 p.m. I hook my new baby up and all is right in my world, for 5 minutes at least. There's a nut missing on the back of the cabinet to hold an input in place, but that's something I can fix after a short trip to the hardware store. Always close, never quite on target.  File under:  Mark tries to be healthy, it's just God's perverse sense of humor and taste for the ironic that thwarts him.  I got my blood test back, and all is cool, except that I have a high count of something to do with cholesterol. Awesome. Really freaking awesome. It was suggested that I get a cholesterol screening. Sweet Baby Jesus help me if I have my late Grandfather's heart problems. I mean he only had 2 heart attacks, a quintuple bypass, a stroke and subsequent milder strokes that debilitated him and eventually got the best of him (Backgammon, it's always Backgammon, he never really understood that game to begin with). Don't be surprised if you see a vast change in my diet if the results weren't a fluke. The men in my family have all had inauspicious endings, I'm either going out with a bang young, or in my sleep, healthy at 113, I will settle for no inbetween.  I should probably stop at this point. I came into the Mac lab to do some work which I got most of done. Day two, and I'm already here. This will be a very long, short semester.  Boy George should stop painting his face and deal with the fact that he is not a pretty man.  Will tighten posts in future as to insure maximum punchline with minimum reading time.  Are you still clutching your underpants?  (A.P.T. [Actual Post Time] 11:51 p.m.)

       Taste it again for the first time.   Much like an atom in a particle accelerator, today has moved at a ludicrous rate and is just looking for what part of the wall it wants to hit. But for one and all's pleasure I finally have decided to break out of the cryptic away message, the pandered poetic profiles, and the small time world of Instant Messenger for the tragically hip world of the web log. Though I follow meagerly in the footsteps of the likes of Mr. Coughlin and Ms. Curtis, I shall harness my self-righteousness and use it to become the most laughed at blog on the web. Mark my words, words from Mark will rock your world, or at least make it a little more comfortable to be in your shoes.  Decryption will take time, but I will eventually become comfortable with name-dropping, blowing up spots, and ruining lives. For now I will concentrate on my personal, elemental breakdown.  This isn't worth talking about at this point, at least not to anyone but myself and I. Today marks the end of the end, something I'm still having trouble grasping, although I am lifting firmly with the knees and not with my back. How it still hurts, that clever little, light burn in the back of my throat. That vague, sore taste when things only go the way I don't want them to go. So goes on the on-going battle, and my need to apply dyslexia to all my metaphors.  This site will also go through several visual changes as I figure out the code and teach you heathens the way of the light, the way of design. Move away from the darkness, the Comic Sans, the Times New Roman, and we'll get along just fine.  Heart break, aisle 4, someone get the mop. Stupid kids never learn.  Bed time, more to come, clutch tightly to your underpants.  (I have no idea how this clock operates, this was actually finished at 1:41 a.m.)

       Stand Up   Well, Mark on an upswing is here. I just got up, the sun is out, and I just had some toast with BBQ sauce, because we're out of butter. Let the games begin.  Just when I think I enjoy adjectives too much, along came Ms. Curtis, "Have a wonderful day in spite of things, my darling princess in the pink tutu with fabulously, alternatively shorn brown locks."  File under: No, this isn't a defense mechanism, really.  "We here at  solipsism inc. , understand that Mark is an absolute fruit loop. When we took him under our wing, we did not expect for his brain to collapse in on itself and the several recent postings to occur. We would like to thank the viewer for staying with our fine web log services, but accept no responsibility for content or lack there of."  Time to let the belt out a few notches. Anyone who has been following this digital whirlpool of self-pity has come to realize, I'm a full blown nutcase. We've heard it already, the school, the anxiety, the girl, and the not knowing. I know these aren't foreign concepts to anyone else, I just write about it better than most. At least that's what my ego tells me, and why would he embellish? Rumor has it people are giving up my blog for Lent. That's well and good, just don't gorge yourself on Easter - barring I don't fry my own brain by that point. Stress is a nasty little thing, driving us to worry about the most inane things, like being devoured by Boston's mass transit  urlLink system ; of course, to each their own. I've got mine and you can keep yours.  Inside jokes and incestuous blogs aside, I'm going home to CT this weekend. I need to get at least 100 miles away from school for at least two or three days. I am immensely looking forward to playing some music with my drummer-type friend Chris. I'm not going on any real spring break, since laziness put my back to the wall with projects, but I hope to travel out of state to someplace different next weekend. Maybe Maine, never been there, might as well cross it off the list.  Do you dig?   Butterfly glasses and blown coverage.  Hi Jessica, you are tall and nice, and if you can forgive me for the "whole tank top thing," I guess I can back off on my firey anti-beret propaganda. Well, maybe not.    (A.P.T. 12:37 p.m.)

       My Righteous Indignation   I actually managed to get up today, a feat of strength all by its lonesome. I called Beth Israel to make an appointment to get an MRI on my right knee for the orthopedist, and I managed to get myself a 9:30 p.m. appointment for tonight. After that, I hit the gym and did a bit of a workout, dragging Judas along for a 20 minute stationary bike ride, then returned for a sandwich and some guitar. Have I mentioned I love playing guitar, much, much more that doing any sort of school work lately? There's nothing more disappointing than ripping out "Foxy Lady," by Mr. Hendrix, then sitting down in front of a computer screen for several hours.  I picked up an extra print shift in the lab today. I dealt with sob stories of why I should print someone's file right away, hay-wire files, and things that just didn't want to print, but hot damn, I need the money. Broke, with a captial OKE. That robbed me of precious work time, which I continue to waste as I digitally scribe my adventures.   Valerie was nice enough to join me in my MRI endeavor. I was extra glad that she came when I was told that I should take my earring out, for it might get pulled by the giant magnetic field, or even better, heat up. She gave me a hand getting the damn thing outta my head, and even better, she managed to get it back in. As for the MRI, I got to lie down in this long, narrow tube, and have gigantic magnets run over my crotch and legs for a good 20 minutes. I was all pysched to get my films, but they told me the processor was down, so I'm hoping if I call tomorrow, I can pick them up and see what's making Judas so damn irritable. The next 48 hours are going to suck entirely. I don't even want to think about the work I don't want to do, that needs to be done. Time to hop to, I guess. Gah, responsibilty.  Out of context moment of the day:   nickMALICE:  my mom is a gyno.  nickMALICE:  i know these things.   You know, it was only typed, but "nighty nite baby," just sounds so good from you.   Better the second time around.  (A.P.T. 1:12 a.m.)

       Bi-polarcoaster and Diagnosis: Judas   Friday was my appointment with the orthopedist. Time to finally figure out what was ailing my treacherous right knee, Judas. In some ironic content, I just missed the T to get to his office, because I couldn't run to catch it. Ha, ha, ha... yeah. I made it over to the office at Downtown Crossing and did the whole take off the pants, put on the funny paper mumu, and talk to the doctor, who looks just like Santa Claus, minus the beard, anyway. We go through the pain I've been having for the last 3 weeks, he has me squat down and walk, then stand on my toes and heels. He says that my I.T. band is definitely awry, and I might have a tear in my LCL. I'll need an MRI to really figure it out. Wham, bam, what the mother funkinator?! Within 10 minutes I have a prescription to get an MRI at Beth Israel, and I'm out the door, busted limb and all.   I don't think I need to tell you how thrilled I am about this, we already have a general idea. I called my mother and told her what's up. Next I get, "So, are you finally done running," in a not so comforting, questioning way. You would assume I was robbing armored cars and then turning them over with sheer brute force, or devouring the souls of small children by the tone in my Mother's voice. She rescinded the statement after a respectful diatribe from yours truly. I love you Mom, I wasn't planning on falling apart before my 23rd birthday. Really.  The rest of my weekend was entertaining, but not totally worth detailing, I did some speed drinking on Friday night, then spent an hour on the phone with Valerie going over all sorts of things, not necessarily related to present situation. I was glad to listen. Saturday was academia and then I went out to Cambridge for a little bit to hang with the roomies at one of our new favorite watering holes. Mike and I thought we'd be cheap and catch the last T home, which somehow ended up in a 90 minute debacle to get home. We were ashamed of ourselves, but it only cost us $1.00.  Lately, I've become the essence of a mood swing. I've gone from content and positive, to not content and not very positive. Right now as I type these verbs, nouns and other grammatical potpourri, I've got this ball in me. It sits above my stomach, and below my heart. I'm thinking about naming it the Geometric Definition of Anxiety, or Rupert, and it makes me... come-roaring-out-of-left-field-with-only-one-shoe-on crazy. It's just there and it makes me absolutley eratic in everything I do; except eating cheese. My cheese-eating skill set remains the same, regardless of the status of the Geometric Definition of Anxiety. I do not like being this way, yet I do not know how to get out of this for at least another few weeks. Maybe when mid-terms have passed, my knee is a clearer picture, and if I can make things right with Valerie I  can start to find some peace and normalcy. Until then, I just sit here and try not to get to nauseous from the internal personality shifts.   Dramamine anyone?   I'm entertaining. You've always been  laughtaffable .  (A.P.T. 6:31 p.m.)

       Process   First things first, I'd like to say that I am so hyped for this season of baseball. I still hate the guaranteed salaries, the clubs that won't spend the money for the fans, and the steroid use that hangs over the sport, but I'm pumped for the battle for the AL East. I'm a Yankees fan in Boston, a sin by either side's account. I'm not convinced the Yanks are going to win just because my team acquired A-Rod, but there's gonna be some awesome rumbles between the Sox and the Yanks. Play Ball!   In conversation with Miss Curtis tonight a topic was brought up in which the following question was submitted: "Is this about you?" Jessica's reference was to my current struggle to win back the Heart of Valerie Rausch. I lost it in a bad hand of Black Jack, no really folks, I'll be here all week, anyway. Those who know me, or know how poorly I imply things, have picked up on the basic premise here: I screwed up big time and after a blinding dose of enlightenment, I'm trying to convince her to come back to my weird little world. Now to add to this problem, she is dating someone else, someone stable, who hasn't let her down. Advantage: Not Me.   So I've wiled away much of my passing days writing stories, poems and smaller, less obvious references throughout this digital garbage can, much to the chagrin of my friends, or to be more general, the male demographic of this blog. I'm taking heavy-caliber shots to the chest for my increasingly obvious attempts at the present endeavor of trying recapture the Heart of Valerie Rausch. The ladies have yet to chime because I'm an idiot and have demonstrated idiot-like tendencies mal-aligned with the stereotype of my gender.   Back to the matter at hand. I was getting some objective advice from Miss Curtis. After detailing present situation and all included events, she had several poignant questions to ask me, this one being the most important, "Are you doing this for you, is this just another challenge?" I've always had a competitve nature. It's works in time with my inferiority complex and can rankle other personalites, particularly within the realm of the Visual Arts Department. Just ask my good friend Kevin. We go back all the way to freshman year and there were days he just wanted to slap me upside my oversized melon for being so damn competitive (Grade-based inferiority complex: see 4 years of all-boys Catholic Prep School). Quite the valid question though. Is this about me, trying to do the impossible, coming through in the end?  Hmm.  No.  I say that very matter of factly, and with little thought. It's been a long dusty road to get to this point. I've never based a relationship on whether I could get someone or not. [Although there was one time in high school where there was very attractive girl named Sandra that I always wanted to date. My acquataince of the time, Tim, said there was no way on Earth I'd be able to get a date with her. Well, suffice to say within two weeks I pulled it off and it worked for almost a month, which is forever in high school years. She stopped calling, no surprise.] This isn't about me in that sense. It's about being ready for her, wanting to be with her, finally getting on the same page as her, but being too fucking late, hoping that I'm only fucking late. If anything, at least I have been able to throw open the doors and let the light shine in. I'd been holding onto dead dreams for way too long. Now I want to be with her, treat her like I should have, and have the relationship this was supposed to be. But as said before, I've dug a deep hole to get out of. After what i pulled, the extra mile just isn't long enough lately.   So here I am, faltering between showing her that I want in for the long haul, and trying not to oversaturate the issue. Too much of me is like squeezing ketchup out of a bottle. Everything is going okay, then WHAM! Just like that, you've got your sandwich soaked in processed tomatoes. I'm just like that. A poorly constructed metaphor at the bottom of every bottle.   I  have  successfully added a diligent amount of confusion to her life. In further role-reversal, I'd die to know what she's thinking for once. If there's a secret password, a Physical Challenge, or a certain guitar-oriented chord progression that would put me over the top. I'm being pulled through the mud, and I deserve to be pulled through the mud, skinned knees and all. Everything I do only magnifies the fact that this doesn't have to work out. I'm prepared for that about as much as I can be. Why I'm even going through this reminds me of a quote that my friend Aime stole from her friend Tim.  "Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor..." - Mark Twain  I've been playing it safe for the last few months, trying to dance with fear and doubt, where I'm going to be, what I am going to do, what kind of cardboard box I'm living in. I'm tired of trying to control everything. I would like to make a valid attempt in chilling out and rolling with My Heart in our Oldsmobile 442. If she comes back, he can ride on her lap.  I drastically underestimated her and now I see what could have been, and maybe still be. Several sources of advice suggest she's testing me, making sure I pay the price and see if I turn out to be true. I told my design teacher about something I gave her. He laughed at me and said, "That never works, why do you think we have literature?" He then stepped on his cigarette and walked back into the building. I have no idea how this could turn out. I fear for failure, but that's the price of glory. Acutally the price of glory is the inability of me to find any kind of center as of late. This has made me absolutely crazy. I look normal (tired, bloodshot eyes, half-smile), but my brain is approaching warp capabilities of thinking and my body goes through phases where it is just open and raw, and taking in too much stimuli. Time to up the sedatives. Girls are impossible to read. Impossible. So here I sit, blogging about it instead.    Ready to be a good boyfriend. Picture me like the scene from Ace Ventura where Jim Carrey is sitting on the asylum's hallway couch; pink tutu, hawaiian t-shirt, shorts, and boots. Great big smile on my face, questionably sane, ready to go.   Once again thanks to my fan club, I promise not to freak out like Howard Dean if it doesn't work.   Mr. Kawklyn, with perfect timing as usual, reminding that it's bad, but it could be worse:   sk  Ir ace R 9 x:  so right now on my phone, i have text msgs from one chick who wants me and voicemails from a kiwi and a 26 yr old personal trainer i hooked up with on vday.   flexibledecimal:  right.  Now if you'll excuse me, this has gotten so bad that there are a bunch of emo-kids in thick black-rimmed glasses waiting to be me up outside.  Ooh wee ooh I got beat up by Buddy Holly. Oh Oh and a set of broken bones. I don't care what they say about me anyway, i don't care about that.   Two line breaks and then I usually write a line specific to Valerie right here. "Hi."

       Conduit   I've been listening to Metallica again. Just a certain time frame of Metallica though. I've been in to the  Load  period with, along with  Symphonica  and  Garage Days.  Contrary to the rest of the population and the crap I will take for this, I enjoy a lot of the songs on these albums, in particular No Leaf Clover. A symphony and guitars never sounded so good. Nobody writes a riff like James Hetfield. Yes I was a metal head when I was growing up. Next topic, please.  On a similar note, does anybody understand how good Jimmie's Chicken Shack is? You should have all the records. You don't? Go buy them  urlLink now.   Waiting - off of  Bring Your Own Stereo   Waiting for you  Patiently hoping  Your feelings might change  Breathing for me now  Guess I'm coping  But at least I'm feeling  Don't take it for what you see  'Cause it could be worse  Explosion to fade out  Cut to a girl lying motionless in the sand  Wondering what we're about  Surround now the sound of wings softly pushing air  I want to know how flying feels  As we run with the seasons, you change  While I'm standing here  Waiting for you  All too often we doubt  Something so true  It leaves us naked where we stand  I saw your breath make a cloud  Raining an ocean of your preciousness in my hand  I think I know how dying feels  And if this is all just a dream  What's one more year  Waiting for you  I'm breathing for you  What a price to pay  To want to know how flying feels  You want to know how flying feels  I think I know how dying feels  'Cause I'm still  Waiting for you  Facing that I'm slowly dying here  Waiting for you  Breathing for you  And that's why I'm slowly dying here  Can't you see that's my least of fears    Man, I'd give my right testicle to write like that. Best thing out of Maryland since... what does Maryland have anyway?  I think the half-marathon dream is offically dead. Judas is a total wipeout, averaging a bad tweak every 7 days or so. Luckily I managed to make an orthopedist appointment for Friday to finally get this issue resolved. I am praying I don't need a shot of cortizone to the knee. Pray, pray, pray. I don't think I can get a refund, so I've donated over $100 dollars to two races I never ran. Awesome, simply awesome; I am an involuntary philanthropist. My karmic return? Trouble walking. Joy.  These posts have been been scattered and of light substance at best. I'm working on it people, trying to nudge that quality back up to... Wait a minute. Was this ever a quality blog? Am I trying to rise above the comfort of mediocrity for no good reason? This needs to be looked into.    Three months too long.  I'm easier to read than a picture book.  (A.P.T. 10:52 a.m.)

       Push   I would like to blog and blog and blog, but I think I'll just run a summation until I can sit down and write later in the week.   Jeff came to visit, he's cooler than you.  Valentine's Day was just another Saturday. My lack work and wanting to do work will be unceremonisouly revealed in the next week. Hopefully that will light a fire under my ass to get me moving. Knee Doctor this Friday; stay tuned for diagnosis of Judas Glasses on a girl are hot. I really hope I can make this work. I'm going to be up all night and amazingly bitter tomorrow. Thank you's to my cheering section (Brooke, Noelle), I'm trying.   Difficult situations, hopefully My Heart will prevail. (Step off James, you introverted S.o.B.)  (A.P.T. 12:16 p.m.)

       Cardiac Attest 2: Revenge of the Aorta   Because it's sweeps week here at the good ol' Act, we give you an equally compelling alternate version of the previous story. This is for those in the demographic who yearn for more "oof."   There I was sitting on the bus, smoking my Lucky Strike, unfiltered, like any real man would take it. Some broad behind me was crying over "second-hand smoke," so I turned around and let her know that if she kept it up, my second hand smoke would be the least of her worries. I returned to my original position and got comfortable with my copy of  Catcher in the Rye , it makes a great pillow for my neck.   I was almost settled, when I noticed him. There on the floor, hanging out like nothing was going on, My Heart. "Well I'll be a dirty trombone mouthpiece," I said, as I picked him up. "It's been a while since you made an appearance." My Heart, cooler than necessary flashed me a quick glance, and then resumed nonchalance. I growled, "You got a lot of balls to be stepping back into this town with that attitude."  My Heart skipped town 2 years ago, shafting several local loan sharks over some petty dog racing debts, and by petty dog racing debts, I mean hookers and booze. I spent those last two years sleep deprived, with a few broken bones, and Max, my .357 Smith and Wesson Blessing. Permit you ask? It's right here next to the extra spindle of slugs I keep in my jacket. Thanks for checking anyway. I'd ask My Heart where's he's been, but I already knew.  After skipping Beantown, My Heart thought it was time to clean up his act and get in line. Easy to say and tough to do, for an ex-con with a penchant for Felony Larceny. He'd make due with odd jobs up and down the coast, but the ways of the street would always get the best of him and before you knew it, he'd worn out his welcome and was on to the next town. This cyclical process would repeat itself for the next 17 months, until he had a chance encounter Shaolin Master Quang Chi Smith. My Heart was working in some greasy spoon down in South Jersey, when in walked Shaolin Master Quang Chi Smith. He pulled up a stool and ordered his usual: one raw carrot and the One Pound Steak. The steak was cooked just enough to pass the "crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside" rule. After that Shaolin Master Quang Chi Smith would eat a loaf of bread just to spite all the Atkins diet patrons. Fascinated by the Master's sporadic selection of food, My Heart started a conversation with Shaolin Master Quang Chi Smith and the result would be the exponential increase in the purchase of slugs for my Smith and Wesson Blessing in the following months. But that is a story for another time...   Other News:  Dear Laundry Dryer,  I disapprove your actions of eating $2.50 of money off my laundry card and refusing to fufill bartered goods with a service, if I return to the basement and no one is around, I will be sure to kick and punch you accordingly.   Sincerely,  Mark S.Wooding   Deadlines are starting to creep. Am I nervous, not yet. Am I ignoring the gravity of these deadlines, yes.   I want you back. Awaiting further instructions and a list of demands.  (A.P.T. 10:50 a.m.)

       Check Point   Drunk Mark checking in folks. Everything seems to be in order.   Henry Foster did not care for the My Heart story earlier in today's blog. Fair enough Mr. Foster, but you clicked, you're an enabler. Now, I'm gonna enable myself into bed. Good night.   I usually say something catchy here.  (A.P.T. 1:31 a.m.)

       Cardiac Attest   One day last fall, while waiting to leave South Station on a bus back to Connecticut, I found My Heart. There he was sitting on the floor just barely under the seat in front of me. My Heart was shaped like a ring, his likeness inscribed on the front of this small piece of silver.   I had wondered where My Heart had been. He took off a summer ago looking for answers and reasons he was never meant to find. He did some traveling, some Soul-searching (rumor had it Soul was out partying just outside of Jackson Hole, Wyoming), trying to put heads and tails back together in some way that made sense. I don't know if My Heart found more questions than answers, but he was back, small, and quite travel weary.  I picked up My Heart and put him on my key ring. I take my keys everywhere I go, I might as well take My Heart too. Tired and jet-lagged, he didn't have much to say for a while. I wouldn't call him depressed, but he just couldn't get his act together. I spent a lot of days just going through the motions with him. I even introduced My Heart to Another Heart, maybe get him back in the game. My Heart was interested, but to completely screw it up. He spent most of his days hanging out with the keys, staring off into the sky, space cadet he's always been. Another Heart, upset, moved on. For a while My Heart never knew the difference, he's kind of dense like that. All laid quiet for for some time.  New Year's brought fresh starts, and My Heart puttered on. He kept himself busy with home improvements and other small projects. At least he wasn't eating all the food for nothing now. One day My Heart ran into Another Heart and they chatted for a bit. Not 5 minutes after walking away from the conversation, My Heart tripped over the obvious and blurted out, "Damn, did I really..." I cut him off, "Yes, yes you did. Emphasis on  did . Let's get home, it's your turn to do the dishes."  First it was sleepless nights for My Heart. There he was, lying in bed, staring at the glow in the dark stars attached to my ceiling. As usual he had to get me invovled. "Do you think I should try to talk to her, see how she feels?" "Admire from afar buddy-boy," I snorted in mid-sleep. "You had your chance. I have an 8am class. Go to bed." Of course, that didn't work. "Yeah, but I wasn't ready, you know? I couldn't be what Another Heart wanted then," he said waving his hands, shaking the bed. " I'm watching the clock tick as he rambles on. "Oh I'm sorry, Another Heart should just drop everything, run back to you, and make like you never were an idiot." I sat up; I'm awake, I hate My Heart, and I need a drink of water. My Heart fired back, "Well not like that, I know I've got a lot to pay for, but I think there's something there if I can just..." Tick, tick, tick, ding; I go off, "Life is not a dress rehersal, do you have any clue how back-asswards you are?" "But, I could be so good for Another Heart," he stammered. "That's it, you're on the couch, take Ego with you, I've had with his sheet-stealing antics." I flip over and of course My Heart isn't done. "You're no better, it takes you 20 minutes to get out the door when you say your ready, just ask your friends." "That's nice, enjoy the couch," I turn to catch 5 hours of sleep before class.  (You may ask yourself how does My Heart, a little silver ring, manage to do all theses things? It's the beauty of inconsistent writing folks. This is a blog, Shakespeare is two url's down, just past the goat porn.)  My Heart and I have continued to have these one-sided debates, where I listen and he talks without end. After some of my own thought, I decided to give You My Heart. I have company coming this weekend and need the couch. I figured if anything maybe You could hash it out with him. He means well, he is four chambers of good intent. Keep him on your key chain, that's what he knows best. My Heart's a traveler, good intentions with poor execution.   Still tastes good.

       Sincerely Me   This blog is brought to you by New Found Glory's self-titled album. Tasty.   More excerpts from "Conversations with Wood."   Moai42:  it feels like my teeth are gonna rattle out of my head and beat me until they're overcome by decay.  flexibledecimal:  well that's nice.  Later, that same evening...   Moai42:  because jon plus alcohol equals "hey baby, how  you  doin'?"  flexibledecimal:  great.  flexibledecimal:  you try to hook up with anything. have i taught you nothing?  Moai42:  i remember the first thing you taught me.  Moai42:  "girls are evil."    If the boy ever learns anything from college, let it at least be that.   I tweaked my knee super-A-amazing-number-1-star style again last night. I stood up from my computer chair in my room to leave my apartment and my knee decided it was a good time to go to Defcon 5. It hurt, it still hurts, and I think I'm gonna have to repay a visit to the orthopedist. Excellent, no really, I was hoping Judas would shit the bed on me the exact same time as last year. I truly enjoy spending money on race registrations that I'm not going to run.   Amazing! Schoolwork is actually getting done! I actually accomplished some classwork this week. Pat me on the back. Well nevermind, I took an hour and a half nap in Senior Degree Project. I was tired, so there. I'm finding that I can't really get away with sleeping 4 hours and then try to slug through an 8am-5pm class day. Who knew?  I'm debating having a party Saturday. Valentine's Day approaches I'm not quite sure how I'd like to deal with it yet. That topic gets its own postscript when necessary. I probably shouldn't have a party given my proficiency in deficit spending lately. I've got a $1700 credit card bill coming over the horizon and I have less than $1700 to pay it with. Oh how I love you Mesa Boogie, but hate your cruel, cruel price tag. Why do I keep going out and shelling out large amounts of cash I don't have for booze? Ah yes, I enjoy a spot of inebriation once in a while. Oh well, I see quite a few days of Peanut Butter and Jelly in my near future; and Saltines, lots of Saltines.  I'm a bit scattered tonight, could you tell?   Cool-Jerk.  (A.P.T. 12:44 a.m.)

       Drum Roll   First off, music reviews:  lostprophets,  Start Something : the men from Whales follow up their debut with an excellent sophmore effort. Beginning to end, this disc shows their ability to rock and some pretty well crafted melodies blended in as well. A-  Incubus,  a crow left of the murder : Incubus drops their 5th album and I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. The songs are pretty well crafted and a little tighter than some of the tracks of  Morning View . Overall, there is not a whole lot of rocking. It's not a bad thing persay, but I enjoy the more rocking Incubus ( Make Yourself, Science ). The CD is growing on me, but I still miss the rock. B  Brand New,  Deja Entendu : this was a late pick-up. I caught their video for Sic Transit Gloria on MTV and was impressed by the song and the cinematic representation. The disc fluxuates between rock and some more thoughtful acoustic numbers. They remind of Jimmy Eat World, with a little more intensity. B+  Back to my bedazzling existence.  I spent Sunday trying to put my brain into drive, but the transmission was quite busted. Saturday I defeated the soap scum in the bath tub and cleaned the rest of the apartment, putting the OCD to rest for a little bit. Zach, self-appointed Minister of Fun returned a second night for pizza, beer, and a guitar lesson. (You better be practicing M.o.F., you need it.) After food and fretwork, Zach and I were going to meet my roomies and a couple friends out in Cambridge at a bar called Grafton St. I was getting ready to leave when Valerie (vixen I dated, stopped because I was pre-occupied with being stupid) instant messaged me. She and her friends couldn't get into the club she wanted to go to and they all went to some place she didn't want to. She just wanted to go out to a bar and drink; no crime in my book. I asked her if she wanted to join me and Zach to meet up with my friends and roomies in Cambridge. She liked that idea and we picked her up in Zach's Jetta of Illegal Customizations. He decided he'd done enough drinking lately and would drive. You're a good man Zach Mangan.  We hit Cambridge and met up with my cronies: Kevin and Rebecca (one hot item), Bill, Mike, and Lindsey. Drinks were ordered and we grabbed a table. Nobody had seen Val since we departed ways, so Val and all present parties played catch-up while Zach and I discussed baseball teams we'd vaporize to increase the quality of major league product. I've got vodka and tonic. It's all good as they say.  Val and Rebecca headed off to the bathroom and must have done six laps around Harvard Yard, because they were gone for 35 plus minutes. Actually, they caught up on girl stuff; the making of Kevin and Rebecca dating, the reasons why Val and I weren't together. I don't know if they actually used the bathroom or not, nor do I need to. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Zach and I were still discussing whether we'd keep the Royals, but the Marlins were definitely going, regardless of 2 World Series wins.  The ladies finally returned and the party kept going. At one point Bill and Valerie got into conversation and I could tell the subject became me for a minute or two. I know it's part of catching up, but I was really hoping to avoid any re-hashing of my misguided decisions out while we are all having fun. It was at that point I drained my second vodka and tonic in one fell swoop and decided it was time to get drunk enough to not worry about it. Zach just smirked and classically commented, "Okay buddy."  I returned from the bar to see that my seat was gone, but the one next to Valerie was open. I was told my butt was to be in that chair so I sat accordingly. Valerie and I had just gotten fresh drinks, when everyone wanted to go to the next bar. I didn't drop $7.00 on a vodka and tonic so I could leave it orphaned on a table. I told them we'd be along sooner than later, especially at the rate I was drinking.   So there I am with Valerie, half in the bag, trying to kick my legs over to reach full-bagness. Valerie finds that the deep questions are best asked after 2 sturdy drinks. We talked about us, what happened, and other specifics.   This yielded a few things in my direction:  a large bag of calmly stated "F you's." a similar order of "I'm so mad at you's." a rare situation where Mark finds himself uncomfortable, because she's very right.   Further details are not necessary for you the casual viewer because after another sip of vodka and tonic to go with my "F me's," I got the "mouth full of water." I refer to this term as the pre-cursor to regurgitation. You know, when you're mouth gets filled with saliva instantly, your liver's warning flare that you just screwed up. I turned to Val and said, "We need to go, right now. I'm just going to use the bathroom really quick." I stepped off to the men's room, poised in front of urnial, slighly wobbly. The water in my mouth was only getting worse and I feared losing it in a high-end bar so much that I zipped up, sans relief, grabbed Val, my jacket, and double-timed it outside.  After 2 minutes of frigid, Cambridge air, I went from "classless, college drunk" to "well-dressed, inebriated, young man." I have no idea how, but by the time we got to the line at Red Line, I was fine. I wouldn't put me behind the wheel, but maybe some firey chain saw juggling instead. Conversation continued between the two of us, subdued and stopped by the harsh wind blowing through the corridors of Cambridge. We met my friends over by the Red Line bar. There was quite the line and we all decided we were quite done anyway. Zach dropped Val and me back at her place on campus. While usually praised, Zach's aggressive handling of the poorly engineered turns on the trip home didn't sit well with Val and the ingested Long Island Ice Teas. In the end, everyone made it home okay and I even managed to get up the next day for church. I spent the rest of Sunday sleeping at my computer terminal at school due to the double-stacked nights of drinking. I won't be doing that for a while, I think. I've got quite the load of work building up. Please don't be shocked, this is only the same work I've been avoiding since January and manage to dodge yet again as I write, and write, and write some more. Oh how I miss being over-tired and irritable [bats eyes fondly].  Atonement came a day late and by all accounts and purposes a bit of a surprise. Atonement is a long hard road, deluded by tequila and never really achieved until all offenses are hashed out and accounted for. At least I have a clean apartment and one less reason to avoid work. Cha, cha, cha.   Another vodka and tonic please.   (A.P.T. 1:43 a.m.)

       Atonement... Well He Still Looks Pale to Me   I think I'm trying to master the art of seeing past coincedence. I'm in the elevator and the following floors are hit: 4, 6, 8, 18. My brain, hating to leave even the most common thing alone, tells me that if you add 4, 6, and 8, you get 18. Who cares? Why can't you think about girls, (hm, scratch that) come up with the cure for cancer, or even transcend enlightenment you gelantinous mess? And tell Judas to quit bitching while your at it.  Atonement. At least it's a good idea on paper. I met up with Gabe, special guest, Mr. Coughlin and headed off for the Cactus Club. We grabbed a table, snagged some appetizers and put away some liquor. Other friends joined, and even the Minister of Fun, Zach, came to hang. Stories were swapped, 5 or 6 scorpion bowls were put away, and I was waxed pretty well. I think my tolerance has ratcheted up a notch, I just couldn't get myself over the wall into obliteration, but maybe it's better that way. We hit a house party, got yelled at by an irked neighbor and shuffled over to Zach's for a bit. I had a couple more beers and shuffled home with special guest, Mr. Coughlin. I will say that I was pretty damn drunk at least. I fell asleep sitting up and Ms. Hangover came to visit when I woke up.  Demons put to rest? More so than not. If anything I had quite the time with my boys and we'll probably go out again tonight. It's really up to me to step and knock down the rest of this semester, although having tequila ride shotgun in the side car never hurt. The jerk never wears his helmet though.  I hit the gym, trying to get a bead on how Judas is doing.  I got a brace around him and hung a 7:38 mile on his smarmy ass. He seems all right, but I am going to wait bit before I hit the road again. I've decided that I'm just going to shut up and do this half-marathon. Hopefully my knee will fall off at mile 12 and not mile 2. I'll just have to bite my tongue and tear it up.  If I ever have to sell myself to get married (more likely than not), I will promote my best quality; I'm domesticated. I'm about to shake down the entire apartment. Time to vaccum, dust, and wipe down the living room and kitchen. I'm even going to attack the bathroom. So ladies, if you are highly attractive, expect to gross 6 figures (I'm an art major), and are looking for someone who doesn't mind being a trophy, albeit an OCD trophy, feel free drop me a line.   Some assembly required, not responsible for lapses of mental instability. Offer good until taken.  I moved my guitars and amps around to use the space in the living room a little better. At the rate I'm going I might have to get in touch with Planning & Zoning. Oh wait, I'm broke now. No worries.  The clouds coming in from the west have a death-ship like quality to their shape and movement. Have I ever told you how much I love the weather up here? Right now if I'm not doing the "Augh! Ice!" dance, I'm putting my foot knee deep into an unavoidable puddle. I'm buying a canoe.  Empty space in bed for rent. See qualifications in Paragraph 5 and have at least 2 references.   As long as I have tomorrow.  (A.P.T. 5:21 p.m.)

       Minimal Co-efficient of Friction   Skating. The term to define how I've played this semester so far. How to correct this? Pour as many projects on myself as possible to force productivity. Besides my class load, I have decided to take on some personal projects.  urlLink Laura Glyda Band  had asked me to do a photo shoot for them.  urlLink Brilliant Misstake  has asked me to redesign their website for them. I'm very excited about these projects and hopefully they will get me to come around and pick up the slack with my own work. These two bands are some of the best music the Boston local scene has to offer. I will show disdain in your general direction if you do not check out these links.  I've decided I'm going to try to pick up on my drum skills. "Mark you have drum skills?" Well, I can play a basic beat and have always wanted to see what I could do on a set. "Will you be trading in your ridiculous guitar habit for drums?" No. There is a practice room in Ryder and I think I'm going to try to use it late at night in-between slacking off from work. "What don't you dabble in?" The Black Arts, Architecture, and Spelunking. Maybe Spelunking someday. "Do you always do Q&A with yourself?"  ...Shutup.   Judas, my right knee, is better, but I have no idea what the next few weeks hold in store for me. I really want to do this run. It means a lot to me. If I could get through 10 miles and have Judas hurt through the last 3, I can deal. I don't want to be 4 miles into the race and have my knee absolutely flip out so much that I have to drop out of the race. That would make me particularly unhappy. These next few weeks contain great subplot on this topic.  Atonement is coming. I think the scene will be set at Cactus Club. The players so far: Zach, Gabe and Mr. Coughlin, air-mailed from Utah. I can smell Tequila in the air.  I'm still debating how I'm gonna handle Valentine's Day. A 4-man rush with an outside blitz package, or hang back and play a zone/nickle defense?   A dark blue, sleeve-less T-shirt, with a studded butterfly picture on the front.  It's amazing, the things I can remember.  (A.P.T. 12:10 a.m.)

       Whatever Doesn't Kill Me, Really Annoys Me   "Well, he was wearing a blazer, he was ready for anything."  When we last left our hero, he was off to St. Joe's with Jessica. Releasing me on an all-girls school has comical potential, but I decided to be good, because it was too cold to do anything bad.  I arrived at Kimmy's dorm and had myself a grand old time. Jessica and I were snappish to each other, which turned into an arm wrestling match. Apparently she thinks she won. At no point did she beat me, but I did not put her down in any sort of timely fashion. Sad, but not that sad. You are a wonderful woman, Jessica; deluded, but wonderful. Kim took turns drinking wine and telling me how great wine was. She did both of those a lot that night. Drunk Kimmy is always entertaining, especially the time warp that cripples her reaction time. High comedy.  Sunday I trucked back to Northeastern, narrowly avoiding the speeding ticket that would have ended my life. Thank you jackass in the Cadillac Escalade for driving even faster than I was in the slow lane on I-90. If I had been pulled over, you might as well have blown up the car, because I would never see it again. My parents pay the insurance and I'm on strike 2.  I caught the Super Bowl at my buddy Zach's place. Good times and fun people. Then came the celebrations. These started out with good intention. Then it turned to flipped cars, if not flipped, damaged cars, and one person dead. Good job Northeastern student body and the non-NU idiots who joined in. I'm sorry that a Super Bowl win was not enough to satiate your need to be entertained. Apparently vehicles needed to be flipped. Pride runs deep through me to know that you, the idiot, and I attend the same higher learning institution. Enjoy the charges that may be pressed against you in the near future. Sorry I was unable to join the mob mentality. I'm a dirty little think-for-myself-er.  Today had potential. Beautiful weather, and a big run. Everything went well until my knee decided, "Wait a minute, I'm Mark's knee, I'm not suppose to work." Bam, knee goes into fit of pain. It was a cold, sad, painful walk from Jamaica Pond. I'm not a happy camper. This happened the same time last year and I didn't do the race because of the injury. If this happens again, which it very well could, I'll be out a total of 100 dollars, and very mad at my body for being my body. Right knee, your name is now Judas. Betray  me  with a stride? Jerk.   I hobbled over to my local Megastore to pick up the new Incubus and the new Lostprophets. Reviews will be in shortly, I just expect them to save me from this semester. Here's hoping.   Conversation:   she:  maybe it's just the version of you i get to see, but from what i can tell, you're a little bit in love with all of your friends, and you'll never be un-friendish to the people you've been in love with.  she:  and and and...  me:  and?  she:  and for all the trouble it causes you, you've got a really amazing heart. i wonder sometimes if there's anything or anybody you couldn't forgive.  me:  woo-hoo. blessing and a curse.  she:  no curse.  she:  history is always kind to the open-hearted.  Most of you are going, "She must be on meds." I do not post this because nobody has ever said anything nice about me. I post it because I forget that sometimes I have redeeming qualities, besides being an oxygen thief.  I hope I have some surprises popping in my near future. If not, I'll just have to go make some.   Where's my measuring cup?  This heart beats for you in 6/8 time.  (A.P.T. 1:34 a.m.)

       Commencement   I just picked up my tickets for graduation. I think they price out to approximately $25,000 for each one according to the cost of my education here at Northeastern University. I'm about to delve into some serious print design, but I had a couple thoughts that I wanted to follow until they hit the wall.  Act I  I find it difficult at times  not  to detail everything that goes on in my life. Not so much killing my bamboo plant, what I drank today, or how many days in a row I've worn this pair of pants (3), but the sheer volumes of thought on my relationships, family, friends, and those more intimate. This therapy mechanism has only been around for 3 months or so and I've already found myself not publishing posts that I've written, since further review deemed it as problematic. Posts that should be said to, instead of directed at. It's part of the trap of emerging digital media. It has become so easy to fire off a post, send an e-mail, or type an Instant Message without having to sit face to face with someone. Their words and meanings are dumped into your lap, for you to deal with, without them having to explain it to you. It's easy, too easy. Misinterpretation is only a keystroke away. I love the business here at  solipsism inc.,  but give me a table, beverage, and conversation any day.   Act II  The past is a compass we carry to help understand our future, but sometimes we spend so much time looking at the needle that we get lost anyway. Did I just write that? Is that the best I could do to say, "Hey, use the past as a guide, not a blueprint." Have I become parody? Is this parody of parody?  Man I could use a fresh metaphor. Is there a Subway of grammatical techniques somewhere? Metaphor, wheat bread, no mayo.   I overestimate sometimes. To some, my past and transgressions outweigh my potential. Fair? Depends on who you are. Unfortunately, these eyes only see what they are shown. My understanding is my greatest asset, a liability to be insured for, and a realization that when I push the chips to the middle of the table, I'm usually the only one playing.  Act III  Yes, I just talked about how I operate on open communication and then decided to be cryptic with the accessory of metaphor. Did you expect any less?  (A.P.T. 8:01 p.m.)

       12 Steps   Music you should be listening to: Brand New, Jimmie's Chicken Shack Maroon 5, Spitalfield, Story of the Year  Singles to enjoy: Yellowcard/Ocean Avenue, 311/Love Song, Yeah Yeah Yeahs/Maps  I have spoken, bust some tail to your local record shop and reward you meager music existence with one or all of the above.  Well, this is the first Sunday I haven't felt like total crap. One Sunday that I haven't been watching the clock, minutes going by thinking about things that just make my mind dissolve like two tablets of Alka-Seltzer. I chalk this up to my previous promise to get it together, as well as being very well distracted today. Moving over 6 gigabytes of multimedia work onto another workstation due to the threat of a virus on my present workstation at school will capture my attention forthright and keep it until I have safely backed up said work. This process protects my sanity and other people's lives. If I had found myself in a situation losing a disasterous amount of work without a sufficient backup anywhere, you'd be reading about me in the newspaper, wondering how I could wield a yard stick with such malicious intent and so many casualties.  Tonight was also the night I had my date with the lovely Caramia. We went to Cibo's in the North End for a little Italian dinner. I had a interesting little pasta dish with an egg-based sauce that included bits of bacon and onion; really good. Although I might as well have express mailed a bucket of superglue right to the four chambers of my heart. Regardless, I had a great time and Caramia almost made it throught the whole date with her hair down; luckily for her, I couldn't remember all the words to the Canadian National Anthem. Overall, worth the $30 I spent at the auction.  [couldn't think of a worthwhile segway]  After all these recent events, it's time to sit down and write the full-length ep that has been incubating inside me for almost two years. I'm heading back to CT this weekend to sit down with Chris (drummer extraordinare) and hash out all these melodies and riffs that I've been playing over and over, never really finishing and eventually forgetting. Of course, I have the new challenge of learning how to play guitar  and  sing -  at the same time.  Stay tuned for the hilarious results. Hopefully if all goes well, I'll be able to fulfill my guitar wish list; one of  urlLink these,  and I'm pretty sure I could use one of these bad  urlLink boys.  Regardless, it's time to make the album you can't live without. Inspire me.  I was going to go on about how I couldn't understand how people deal with things so differently, but I'm beat and the dent I put in my work isn't big enough to let me keep writing.

       Inconclusive   Hold on folks, trying to right the ship.  So about a week or so ago I had a dream things would turn out as they did last night. I really wasn't sure how it would go, but I really didn't plan on believing my dream. For the love of God, I've dreamt about giant crabs in loafers chasing me down the beach, why would my subconcious suddenly get serious?  So Val and I sat down and talked last night. I don't plan on telling you much more than that, other than things will remain the way they are. Maybe I screwed myself by forcing her to sit down and talk to me before she seemed particularly ready, but I've eaten out the inside of my head over  urlLink this  (see:  Process ) for the last two months. Yes I realize that date is only a month and a half away, Copernicus, that was just reference material. Before everybody starts feeling bad for me, which apparently I am very good at, let's all remember that I broke her heart first and caused this whole situation. That's probably the toughest part of the whole thing; that I was the starting domino, he is in her life because of me and blah, blah, blah, you all get it by now.   All I can do now is walk away with my pockets full of learned lessons and some helpful hints to anyone who finds themselves in my situation:   1. You're an idiot, Run and hide now, you're only going to make it worse.  2. Things are only as complicated as we make them. I'm really good at making mountains out of anything, mole hills, hand puppets, you name it, I can make a mountain out of it.  3. God I hate it when things end this way. In my head, I am the right choice, and of course, totally objective...  4. Walk away and let it go. I've cornered the market on holding on and feeling bad, it's my market share and I busted my hump to get it. So move on cowboy, move on.   5. Nobody is ever ready, whether they think they are or not, and time is my enemy.  6. Sweet Jesus Almighty, I have the most irrational hatred for the Toyota Tacoma pickup truck.   So I am less than joyous that this has gone the way it has, but I did go all out and give all I could. Trying to right my own follies is insanely difficult. So now I stand here, ready to be the friend I am needed to be.   I'd like to thank T-bone for letting me borrow her jeep today. I didn't want to worry about where I was going to park when I got back from physical therapy and she was nice enough to let me borrow her car, complete with Northeastern Parking Pass. Driving stick was somewhat therapeutic, albeit cramping in traffic on Interstate 93. Judas is getting smacked around in physical therapy, trying to loosen his bitch-ass up. I've got some IT band stretches to do at home and we'll just have to see how it goes.  I'd like to send out an apology to Miss Curtis. I made a less than respectable comment about her which was uncalled for. Now she is being cryptic to me, which is worse than being mad. It's like trying to read a book, blindfolded, upside down, and underwater. Sorry Jessica.  I graduate in a month and a week. Time to get it together and end this collegiate career on top. What does that mean? Like I have a clue, but it's going to be a lot better than it has been and everybody better be wearing protective eye wear. I'm ripping through April like I have a month to live and everything to give.   Clutch your underpants.    You know my name, you've got my number. The choice is yours.  (A.P.T. 7:16 p.m.)

       It's a Dry Wit   My brother hits the nail on the head, square, with a specific driving motion:   Moai42:  you've done a lot, man, but it takes something miraculous to make people think about their own problems.  Then, of course, with Wooding advice, comes unnecessary Wooding wit:   Moai42:  i suggest plagues of increasing intensity  Moai42:  locusts, perhaps, maybe blood from the faucets... but no slaying the firstborn... and you might wanna avoid boils.  Runner up:   bella8982:  there is a street off of route 44 called climax avenue; maybe i'll show it to you sometime.  News and Notes:  Caramia Tontodonato, sexy name, sexy lady. I got the best bargain this side of the Charles River when I bid on that fine piece of hyperactive woman. Sure she can be violently bi-polar, but I couldn't have picked a prettier girl to accidentally bid on.   Real postings to resume upon conclusion of most recent saga.  (A.P.T. 1:26 a.m.)

       Saranity Wrap   Cripes, I am tired. I sleep but I get no rest lately; I think that's the cruelest trick life has had to offer in recent days. I'm finally putting in the time to get some sleep and my brain unloads these intense dreams that leave me exhausted when I wake up. Absolutely cryptic and unnecessary but, I address this to my Cerebrum: The dream you gave me on the night of March 16, 2004, was TOTALLY UNCALLED FOR, you pull that shit again and I'm going to take you outback to the woodshed. Don't mess with me boy-O.  Today was a "run around with head on fire day." I got up and did laundry for most of the morning. I now have boxers again; I was on the verge of executing commando operations. Of course I always have to be running late, so I was scrambling after folding laundry to get out to Quincy to the new physical therapy office for my 2pm appointment. Of course this was compounded by the 6 inches of wet, heavy snow that had my car blocked in. Luckily, I had finally bought a snow shovel, albeit one that will probably snap on me at the most inoportune time. I spent about 10 minutes insanely shoveling all the snow around the batmobile and throwing snow all over the streets of the ghetto where I park my car. So now that my heart rate is about a thousand or so, I finally get in the car and peel out for Quincy.  Physical Therapy was interesting. I got a young physical therapy student who was working with the main therapist. She came in and asked me about all the problems I was having with Judas and she took a bunch of notes while I detailed my Apostolic knee. Then the next phase of the appointment was just like sex; we spent the next 20-30 minutes getting into weird positions while she asked me if it hurt. So it was just like sex, except without the sex, and a 5 dollar co-pay from my health insurance.  It looks like they'll be able to fix me, I'm pretty tight for someone who is only 22. I was never really flexible, but they want me in 3 times a week for the next two weeks to beat the crap out of me, push my flexibility, and hopefully put me back on the right track.  I came back home after fighting the insanity that is driving anywhere in the vicinity of Boston and figured I'd head to the gym. I actually didn't want to go and try to fight the "just out of work" crowd; so while flipping through away messages, I was reminded that my friend Cara was being auctioned off at the Northeastern Student/Athlete Auction for some charity. I figured this could be interesting, and I had never been to one, so I took a shower and slipped on down to campus.   I got to the gym where it was being held and sat down in the bleachers next to my old track buddy, Greg. Things kicked off and the first two athletes went pretty high. A very attractive volleyball girl went for $75 and some crew guy was bought by his girlfriend for $65. After that came Cara. The bidding started slow, I bid at $15 for ha-ha's and then at $30, I figured she'd go for $50 or so like the other two, so like I said, I bid $30, then I turned to my buddy Greg to laugh about it. Then I hear, "$30 going once," and I nervously laugh to Greg. "$30 going twice," I look around the rest of the gym; about 100 people or so, no hands going up. "$30 sold to the last bidder." I just bought my friend Caramia. Riiiiiiight. Well, I laugh with my friend Greg and go down and write a check out to the charity for $30 as she comes over to me. "I thought your ex-boyfriend would be here to buy you." She replies, "Nope, he got caught late at work." "Well this should be a riot," I say to her as I hand my check off to the girl working the desk. At least I got a bargain.  So Caramia and I are suppose to go out to the North End sometime in the next few days; we'll be joining her swim team friend Hannah and the whoever the dude was who won her. It should be fun; don't forget Cara, no Massachusetts accent and you have to wear you hair down for the duration of the date. If you forget to pronounce the letter "R" at anytime during the evening, I will stand up and sing the Canadian National Anthem at maximum decibel for each time you forget. Please remember this and act accordingly.  The final comment on the student athlete story comes from our own angry royalty, Kimmy V. down at St. Joe's College:    bella8982:  i didn't think they actually did those auctions in real life; only on saved by the bell.  And now for our   Cryptic Overtone of the Week:     I can't be in this place much longer. I can't run from it, I can't hide from it. I try not to think about it, but it's like holding my breath: I turn blue and pass out. No more see-saw, let's go play on the swings.  Matthew Raby, in regards to my use of redundancy using the $ sign and the word dollars in my last post: If you call me out for redundancy alone, I will come down to UConn, beat you silly, and leave you in one of the cow fields of Storrs, CT.

       Codicil   Lately I've been wondering if this has all been just one, big, exasperating game, then a voice out of no where shouts, "LOSE ONE TURN." I just cross my arms, roll my eyes, and lean against my giant pewter Top Hat. Then some idiot riding an enormous Iron comes by and picks up $200 dollars just for passing "Go." Fantastic.   I'm off to the local bar, Our House, for 10 cent wings night. I'm forcing myself to go out and have fun and try to get my mind off of being my mind. I doubt it will work for long, but I've got Mr. Chris Siclari with me, and a hankering for beer and wings.  (A.P.T. 8:34 p.m.)

       Ages 21 and Up, 1-2 Players   Two things to start off this post:  1. New Found Glory works best at loud volumes and a stress-fractured heart. 2.  querynine:  talk to me, you convoluted, Catholic mahogany end table.   I've never been summed up so well as part of a living room set.   This weekend was a cavalcade of special guests. Bill's best friend from Wisconsin was coming in to see him and Mike, Kevin, and I were quite excited to have him in from the Mid-West. Steve is an absolute riot, and is as welcome as someone can get around our place. Sometimes we're tempted to see if we can trade him for Bill. Shh, don't tell. I was in the shower sometime around 3pm that afternoon, before Steve came in, when I decided that Kathryn should come up tonight and join the fun. Then I got shampoo in my eyes, anyway. Kathryn is my closest female friend and we go aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaall the way back to the days junior high school. Ladies, if  you look to date me and have a problem with my chick best friend, please file your application elsewhere. She's like a sister to me. Back to the action at hand.  Once the offending shampoo was washed out of my eyes, I finished my shower and gave her a call. "Hey, feel like dropping everything and coming to Boston tonight?" She paused for a moment and answered, "Actually, yes I can, what time do you want me there." This is why my friends rule. So I told Kathryn to be here for about 7pm or so. I went out bought myself a CD (Story of the Year, review coming soon) and covered a lab shift until she showed up and we drove back to my place.   We hung out until about 9pm or so. At that point Mike, Kathryn, and I shot up the street to the Chopping Block to see my friend Meg's band play. The Hooker St. band played for about an hour and was pretty entertaining. They float around the blues/funk/very vague Dave Matthews type feel; more blues/funk than anything else. I would recommend you see them if you like any of those genres. Go, now, I command you.  After that, we decided to meet Bill, Steve, Rebecca, Kevin, Lisa, and Lindsay over at the Red Line out in Cambridge. The place was hopping, but Bill wanted to go some place quieter. We were all finishing drinks when the following exchange occured in real time:  Two girls came up to Kevin and me. One girl, looking directly at me says, "My friend thinks you're cute." I reply innocently, "Me?" "No, your friend." Ah-ha. Well that was fun. Do you always look 90 degrees away from who you're talking to? Nobody liked you and your friend anyway, so, yeah, there ya go; I need another drink.  Shortly after that we moved over to Grendel's Den. We weren't drunk, but we were the loudest people there and fairly obnoxious; but our money's green just like everyone else's! As if that made some sort of difference. Things got a little calmer once we split into two tables. Kathryn and I got to chat for a bit and I got to talk to Mike's friend Lisa who I hadn't seen in a while. None of us were feeling the need to get very drunk so we sipped some brews and coasted down the street of casual conversation.  Side note: Does anybody understand how hot 311's cover of "Love Song" by The Cure is? C'mon people get with it and feel the immense amount of groove that has been stuffed into this song.   We caught a cab out of Cambridge and returned home without major incident. No one got bombed, but we had a really good time nonetheless. Kathryn took off today back to the lower-east end of Connecticut, she's a woman with much to do. I spent today covering two different shifts on the farm, as well as my own, for a grand total of 15 overlapping hours that shall be reward me with a handsome paycheck, handsome being if you doubled it and added two.  I'm heading back home now, for some food and hopefully some sleep. The Geometric Definition of Anxiety is still hanging out with me, so I'll be surprised if I do either very well. So it goes, and so it goes.   (A.P.T. 9:26 p.m.)

       Rodeo    "A man has got to know his limitations."  - Clint Eastwood   "Three majors? Sure, juggling flame-engulfed chainsaws is right up my alley."  - not Clint Eastwood  Stand down America's bored workforce, I have returned to burn up the last few hours of your Friday afternoon with my week in review.   I had some grand plan to get up and attack Monday at full throttle, go to bed early, get up early, hit the gym, conquer a third-world nation, bake a quiche, then conquer your mom. I ended up going to bed late, getting up late, plus it was fairly drab weather outside, so that made me even less apt to pop out of bed. Score another point for Monday, jerk.   Tuesday was engaging. I was supposed to have lunch with a gentleman I had dealt in several past co-op situations who might have some connections to help me find a job when I graduate. Unfortunately, he was running late on a job and we could not meet since I had class shortly thereafter. We're going to try and meet sometime this upcoming week. Since I had no lunch date, that opened up the next 90 minutes to whatever mischief I could think up. My roommate, Mike, had finally written me the check for the accidental demise of my Seagull acoustic, so I figured why not head on down and see if I can replace it.   I took a train down to Mass. Avenue and sauntered into the chain music store that sat in wait nearby. I waltzed over to the acoustic room and saw the one I had played a few weeks before and jokingly thought to myself, "Man, I'd love to trade that in for the one I have." I played around with it for a few minutes and was pretty much sold on it. I went on over to the counter where one of the female sales associates was putzing around. In my head I thought maybe I could go charm a fair amount of the price tag off the guitar, but I forgot I still sounded like garbage from this stupid head cold. I did manage to get 10 dollars knocked off the price, and it wasn't my money anyway. So I was enthralled to have a new acoustic, that sounded better than my old one, and cost a little bit less. I have moved the location of the guitars in my room since the demise of my old acoustic, I'd have to call it one of the few correct decisions I've made thus far in 2004. Back to the present past.   I made my way off to my Multimedia Capstone class. We have this monster project that we are working on as a group and things are looking a little scary with the time versus amount of work left. We split into groups and one of my teachers pulled me aside. She felt that with what they needed of me for this class and the amount of work I'm doing, that I should consider taking an incomplete in one of my other classes to do what needs to be done and keep the remaining shreds of my sanity. I wasn't incensed at this request for consideration, but I will say I was taken back a bit. I am a dual major in Graphic Design and Multimedia Studies with a minor in Animation. We call it the triple threat here because the 6 classes you take for Animation are the same major or minor. So juggling these firey chainsaws of majors has been my thing for 3 years now and I'm in the final meltdown of this monstrosity. I'm taking the 3 senior level classes for all three programs at the same time, with another normal class. It has been a shade shy of suicide to say the least lately. The more I thought about what my teacher had said, it became more evdient that she was somewhat right. I've had to pick my battles each week. I haven't been able to complete all the work required week to week by those 3 classes. I've been wondering more and more often how I was going to make it through finals, and now I finally found an out.  I will try to take an incomplete in my Animation Capstone class to open up space and finish everything else with some degree of sanity. Animation is fun, but it's a sinkhole; you can spend 9 hours working really hard, and still have very little show, it's the nature of the beast. At first, I felt like a bit of a failure, having to finish up something after graduation, but regardless of when it gets done, I'll be the first in the department to accomplish this mess of majors, hopefully this will pay off somewhere down the road. I still graduate and I still walk since I will have completed all my requirements for my dual major in Graphic Design and Multimedia. I need 128 credits to graduate and I have 141, so there's no way I'm not going to get the most expensive piece of paper I have ever held.   I hung out with Valerie and two of her friends from work after dinner. Preliminary results show that I have won all her friends over. What does that mean? I'm not sure, I was going to make some popular/electoral vote joke, but I think I'll just digress.   Later that Tuesday evening, on my way into my room, I put my first dent into my acoustic, about 12 hours after I bought it. I rule.   Wednesday's are just flat out long. I'm always a waste of carbon at the end of Wednesday, I start with class from 8:30am to noon, I spent half of my 1:30 to 5pm class trying to wrangle a deal with my teacher over taking an incomplete, or changing my deadlines of what I will complete. Then there's my 6 to 8pm class and finshing up my 7-11pm workshift that overlaps. Then I go home and weep like a little girl because I'm so tired. Long day, short summation. Just trying to keep you people on your toes.  Thursday was "Mark is a medical mishap" day. I started with a 10:45am opthamology appointment at Mass Eye and Ear Clinic. I have some weird eye pressure or something that makes me more susceptible to Glaucoma. So, once a year I show up to have them get really mad at me since I don't like  anything  touching my eye and have my pupils dilated to the size of dinner plates. Good times, I have 20/10 vision, and I'm good to go until next year. I had to run by butt back to my place and drive on out to Quincy for my first physical therapy appointment for Judas. The hilarity of this situation is my pupils are still monsterous and I'm considering putting on two pairs of sunglasses since it's bright out and my pupils cannot retract to what they should be for a sunny day. I made it out to Quincy without crashing. I'm having a cookie for that.   I got out to Quincy and the place I went to didn't seem like the place my roommate Mike said he worked at. I went through the evaluation and called him afterwards to find out that it was most indeed, the wrong place. So the knee fiasco continues, I called the Orthopedist to change my place of therapy once again, and have an appointment with the right place Thursday and Friday of next week. The knee fiasco will be updated as therapy starts.   I had dinner with Valerie Thursday night. Macaroni and cheese and further examinations of my intent, which were well and good considering the past. I don't have much to say on this, or just don't feel like detailing. She questioned, I answered, the beat goes on.   I ended up at Conor Larkin's later that night. I met my friend Cara there and it was a pretty good time. It wasn't exactly my scene, unless I could buy stock in overweight girls in ill-fitting T-shirts and guys with a muscle to intelligence ratio bordering on evolutionary regression. De-volution if you will. It was mostly Cara and I hanging out and chatting so that was cool.   That brings me to today, Friday March 12. I had a group meeting this morning and slept through the last 20 minutes of it. I even had my teacher hit me and I still wouldn't wake up. Did I mention I rock? Now that I've spent about 90 minutes fulfilling your empty Friday afternoon, I'm going to try to find some lunch and do the whole school work thing. I've been feeling a little less crazy lately. I like that. I don't know what to expect anymore so when I feel good I just try to grab on and ride it until I hit the wall. I see booze and the possibility for a lot of fun this weekend. Time realize the full potential of the next 48 hours.   Next time on  solipsism inc.:  Mark pleas for a job, and marmosets!    The future is no place to place your better days.

       Pop Music and a Cup Full of Juxtaposition    "I guess it made more sense to commit to nothing, keep my options open. And that's suicide. By tiny, tiny increments."   - Rob Gordon  Right before I left for the Squealing Pig Friday night, I got a call from my buddy Dave. He specifically called to let me know that he was watching Nick Hornsby's  High Fidelity  and that he was immediately reminded of me and  solipsism inc.  I was somewhat surprised with this statement, and my roommate Bill had a comment as usual, "Every guy wants to be John Cusack's character from  High Fideilty. " We all love flawed heroes, guys that go out of their way to prove how stupid they can be, but retain the good intention and deep down inside realize they want to get it right. Do I really have that much in common with Rob Gordon, as played by John Cusack? Let's go to the board:  1. Rob's first heartbreak was at 14. I had my first girlfriend at 15, that had no earth-shattering bearing on me. After that it was a fairly steady drought until college. I was socially inept with women for some reason, life of the party, just don't date me.   2. Rob Gordon is a music freak. I line up pretty well with that description. I don't have as much of a reverence for the classics, but I can totally hock the "Yeah man, but do you  feel,  what he's singing?" I live and leak my soul out through music, hence the offensive guitar habit.  3. Rob has a penchant for making lists. ...We'll call this a push.  4. Rob is a 30-year-old music store owner who, through further examination of his past failed relationships, finds himself being kicked and dragged into adulthood. I'm about 7 and a half years younger and hopefully won't end up as a failing music store owner who can't hold a relationship together with super glue and C-clamps.  5. Rob does get a clue after sending himself through an array of self-inflicted mishaps and manages to get Laura back. I'm about half-way there and you will know if I find redemption.   The verdict:  I might have some similar qualities (the ranting, the lunacy, the music, and a flair for the melodramatic), but I'm younger, hopefully a little smarter, and won't be sending myself on a pseudo-cathartic trip of checking up on all my past relationships to make me feel better. I've got  solipsism inc.,  and it won't yell at me.  It's pretty funny that the story takes place in Chicago of all places. Ha... yeah.  I killed one of my bamboo plants, that's sad, and pretty tough to do. I'm going to eat some macaroni and cheese and go to bed early, because my mind is so fried from this head cold, that I'm just misconstruing everything at this point.  Of course you knew this was coming: Top 5 songs of the week:  1. Spin - Lifehouse 2. Okay I Believe You, But My Tommy Gun Don't - Brand New 3. Shiver - Maroon 5 4. I'm Lost Without You - Blink-182 5. Mona Lisa - Guster   I am all you've ever wanted, what all the other boys all promised Sorry I told, I just needed you to know  (A.P.T. 8:33 p.m.)

       Mute, Almost   I wasn't planning on blogging, but Bubs just dropped too many brilliant nuggets of conversation on me to be ignored, First off there was this wonderful update on his ex-girlfriend:   StangGT030:  moved out and getting a divorce. stop.  StangGT030:  no money, no car, no job. stop.  StangGT030:  living with neighbors across from where she grew up. stop.  StangGT030:  now dating a guy that she worked with AT HER HUSBANDS COMPANY. stop.  StangGT030:  guy may get fired. stop.  StangGT030:  guy is 35. stop.  StangGT030:  girl is stupid. duh.  the mighty m5:  mark fell on floor.  the mighty m5:  ouch.  the mighty m5:  i don't even know what to say.  StangGT030:  the women i leave in my wake.  the mighty m5:  lol.  StangGT030:  i want to see that quoted in the blog.  Ask and ye shall receive Bubs. Luckily my best friends step up when I've been stepped on. This head cold is crunching the life out of me, I've pretty much lost my voice if I try to vocalize any louder than soft conversation. Of course I brought this on having to talk all night at the bar last night, but it was fun nonetheless. The usual suspects came out with some special guests. Zach, Scotty, Erica, Bill, Rebecca, Jessica, Valerie, and her friend Lindsay all came out to the Squealing Pig. A good time was had by all and I was especially intrigued by Lindsay's commentary on her relationship. She had a very enlightening Function versus Fulfillment outlook that she talked about for a bit. Then I took a turn trying to get her on my bandwagon with the rest of Val's friends. Ice cream sundaes for all of you who have supported this me throughout this campaign; hopefully in victory, but I'll still foot the bill even in defeat. I promise not to go Howard Dean on you guys either.   Today Jessica and I roamed Boston and Cambridge for a bit, ate some Mexican and watched Annie Hall with Bill. I backed out early to go to bed, but find myself blogging after the highly entertaining conversation with Bubs. School starts up again this week, so the school is for losers propaganda will be revamped for its final run until graduation... that's a scary thought. Enjoy your salads folks, and don't forget to tip your waitress.   Hope is a thing I'm feeling today, though it could be the NyQuil kicking in.   (A.P.T. 1:24 a.m.)

       Ode to Bubs   I forgot to mention this yesterday, but I did remember to call him. My best friend Brandon (Bubs) turned 23, yesterday March 3. Bubs moved into my hometown, two houses down from me almost 9 years ago this year. It was the first time I had somebody my age within spitting distance of my house. Bubs is co-founder of the Unholy Trio, a group of 3 boys (James, Bubs, and myself) who caused about as much trouble as 3 well-raised, parent-fearing children could; but we did break some hearts. Well they did, I wasn't doing much dating in high school (code for: I was a loser), anyway. Brandon is like another brother to me. We've had our moments and pounded on each other on several occasions when tempers have flared; but we'd be playing videogames on the floor of my family room mere hours later. He's the kind of friend you don't have to call often, but when you do, you only need 5 minutes to catch up. Bubs has always been fiercely loyal, owned an insane sense of humor and puts the screws to me when he knows I deserve them. When told him I wanted Val back he smacked me in the head and said, "Told ya." Where can you find support like that, you know what I'm saying? I love you Bubs and hope you actually click on the blog to read this. Happy Birthday.  In local news...  Congratulations to Kathryn, she has just bought her first car. Personally, I think you're lying to me that they gave you any money for your shambles of a Ford Escort. I'm surprised you'd get a paperclip and a dirty piece of string for that over-grown go-kart. Nevertheless, we here at  solipsism inc.  congratulate and will be holding you to letting me drive it once, at least once.   You know you have an interesting away message when you get comments like:   LakiAmai:  what the fuck are you freebasing? (this comes from a man with an "eat babies" buddy icon.)  And of course, the ever popular Jimmy chimes in:   JimCJ5:  oh my  God    Auto response from the mighty m5:  it's 11:09:27 PM and you're running down your buddy list to kill some time at work, bored at home or judging your friends based on their away message or profile. you stumble over to me, see what kind of insanity i could be going on about today. how i'm crazy for her, on the farm, or something m5-ish. maybe you didn't even get down to this part, i couldn't blame you, JimCJ5. how many times can i wrap my situations in fresh semantics? do questions of faith, the puppetry of fate, or the idea of too little too late, versus redemption and the possibilty to really have something with someone belong in this box of code made to tell you where i am or what song i so richly desire to share with you? how i hold onto little tidbits of hope from one day to the next and anxiety is the best weight loss program since voluntary torture. maybe i'm just eating a sandwich.   JimCJ5:  you must chill  the mighty m5:  maybe i  was  just eating a sandwich.  For the record, I wrote the away message and was eating a sandwich as I walked out the door for the farm.  For all those in one of the closer rings of Mark-itude, I appreciate all advice that has come to me lately. Just for the record, asking me to not think, is like asking me to not breathe. I am a Taurus, and I'm gonna drive my head into that brick wall regardless. Although being a day away from a Gemini doesn't help. I love arguing with myself, it's not schizophrenia, it's  astrogloy.   If I could edit all the shots in my head, I could put together the greatest dark comedy you have ever seen. For now, all I can do is write about it.    Hoping I can make the comeback of a lifetime. For now, I sit and wait.   (A.P.T. 1:21 a.m.)

       Table for One, Preferably the Booth in the Corner   First off, I'm quite irritated that I'm typing this again, thank you Internet Explorer for being the blantant, binary whore of executable software. I really wanted to type this entry all over again, thank you for crashing. If I didn't feel like junk right now, I'd be sit here and stew about it longer.   I'm not sure what has caused my sudden feelings of not-so-goodness. I think Boston's sporadic weather change has given me this increasingly sore feeling in the back of my throat. It really took the wind out of me today, so I hope with some mild placebos and sleep I can wake up tomorrow, hit the gym, and do the work.  I'd really like to play my acoustic right now, but my slightly beaten, left-handed Seagull acoustic has taken a sudden and abrupt turn for the worse. My roommate Mike accidentally knocked it over, inflicting a fatal wound upon its wooden being. Mike has obliged to replace it, so hopefully I will be playing a nice new Seagull next week. So long my six-string friend, may you enjoy your next life as a box of toothpicks.  Even in the subconcious, Woodings are obnoxious:   jumpmanjr79:  i just woke up from a dream where your brother was driving an orange camaro like a jackass on sand dunes.   I've been recording a lot of music lately. This possible band venture has got me excited to actually sit down and finish pieces of music that I have started writing. I've got 3 or 4 songs down, now I just need to pen some lyrics. I consider myself a decent writer, but the minute I sit down to scribe something I hope to sing, my brain just shuts down. Apparently an A/B rhyme scheme frightens my cerebrum to no end.   My boy Simz chiming in on the problematic nature of being a graduating senior:   MSimz124:  word, I hear that...  motivation is hard to come by these days.  the mighty m5:  lemme know if you find some, i'll pay top dollar.  MSimz124:  i hear he hangs out by the pier on weekends with his buddies drive and ambition....   haven't seen em in a while, those rat bastards.  the mighty m5:  i smell a stakeout.  And the potential for mischief with my ride:   MSimz124:  you need to get her a siren and light.  the mighty m5:  yeah, and a get out of jail card.  MSimz124:  eh, what's a little hard time between friends?  MSimz124:  besides, never said you had to use the lights and siren....  I was suppose to go to Cantab's open-mic night tonight. I try to get out there every few months and read something I'm working on. That got derailed tonight several reasons, the primary being my lack of good health at the moment. I think I wrote a killer piece of poetry though, now if only I can get up there and read it like I want to before nervousness sets in... cue the vodka and tonics.   The gauge reads  E.  Time for bed.   To estimate is a glorified guess. I want to know.   (A.P.T. 8:51 p.m.)

       Vacate   I'm really tired, so this will be one of those list now, hopefully elaborate later blogs. Hang on tight and expect no relevance from one topic to the next.  -Home was nice, I watched too much TV, ate too much junk, and couldn't figure why I was doing either. -I'm back at school. I don't want to be back.  -I saw Club Dread this weekend, it was marginal, no Super Troopers by a long shot.  -I'm trying to give up profanity for Lent. I'm sucking at it so far. #@!%$#&%. -My friend Chris and I got together to play some music, it went really well. -Do you want my autograph now or later?  I was talking about some topic with my always entertaining roomie Mr. William Smolen. I don't even remember what I was talking about, but he busted out this phrase that fit the situation perfectly, something about "traversing a web of intentional ambiguity." Good gravy, what a fine piece of semantics.  Commentary on the month of March that made me laugh: "March is such a tease month. She's like, 'Hey I'm warm, come, lay outside in the sun; don't bring a coat, open the windows in the car, and don't wear that ugly winter sweater.' But then she gets all mean and two-sided and says, 'Muuu-hahahahaha, I've tricked you and you've tried to go outside without a coat; now it's 10 below and snowy!"  Judas update: No tear, 3-4 weeks of physical therapy twice a week. The race was this last Sunday; we'll call it a push.  I'm toast. Time for bed, right after ambiguous tag lines and the Actual Post Time.   Laying in wait. Glue gun and steely resolve in hand.  (A.P.T. 1:37 a.m.)

       Requiem for Collegiate Academia, in E Flat   Where do I start? With graduation? Poking fun at the University of Connecticut? Red tape? Let's see where this bad boy goes...  I finished. Sort of, kinda, almost. Friday, April 23, 17:00 EST marked the end of my undergraduate career at Northeastern University. The Multimedia Capstone project was presented, critiqued, and received a substantial amount of positive feedback, justifying all the pitfalls my class went through for this project since September. Our class was then treated to dinner and drinks; hot damn, booze on someone else's bill?  Sign me up.   Friday night continued at Gabe's with some more booze and I finally passed out around 3am. I put my head on my pillow with my body in the most contorted position I've ever been in, but it felt  so good.  After I did my best hibernation impersonation, I woke up around 3:30pm, that Saturday. Even with nothing to do, I still manage to be busy; I come from that kind of social club. I was to meet a fine young lady down at UCONN to party with said fine young lady and a few of her friends.  The trip down there was an exercise in futility. To make Mark happy follow these simple rules: 1. Never use MapQuest, it's a pile of garbage. Go with the people who make maps for a  urlLink living.  2. Please check the directions you send someone, wherever you are in the chain of command, just give it a little look. This makes life a little easier when I call lost in the woods of eastern Connecticut. So when I'm told to go straight and I'll see UCONN and instead I end up seveal miles out of the way at some gas station in Willamantic, I'll be a little less confused. Regardless of my tour of the upper-eastern woods of CT, I got there in one piece for Spring Weekend at the bastion of learning known as the University of Connecticut.  During my evening visit, I met a bunch of people and caught up to my brother's friends, Matt and Matt LLC. If you like guys named Matt you can have Frat Matt: hasn't met a beer he won't drink, athletic, enjoys causing trouble, and has a kick-ass pair of Fisher home speakers (Frat Matt is not really in a frat. Some assembly required.); or you can have Phat Matt: hippy-hip, does a pretty good Jesus impersonation, drives a giant speaker on wheels, and actually holds down a day job, though he may not look like it (Do not leave Phat Matt out in the sun. Extra cigarettes not included.).  The big event of the night was X-Lot. Everyone talked about X-Lot, everyone was going to X-Lot. Never being one to miss out on such a grand experience as X-Lot appeared, I felt the need to make an appearance. So I headed on over to X-Lot with Matt and Matt LLC. I arrive at the grand scene of X-Lot; somewhere upwards of 20,000 drunk UCONN students, as well as others had piled into this massive lot. You basically stood around, drank until the cops told you to drop your booze, and avoided being hit by beer bottles. Yes, that's right, not only do you get to stand around, but you also get the chance to be hit by flying empties.   Never, ever,  ever  to be forgotten, the preposterous J.C. also joined in the antics of X-Lot, though she would have much preferred to stay at the house party she was formerly attending. We here at  solpsism inc.  would ilke to say thank J.C. for hanging with us and apologize for any gratuitous displays of affection.   I was told that my skepticism of X-Lot was tempered by my sobriety. If I were hammered, X-Lot and I would be buddy-buddy. Maybe so, but even if I was housed on cheap hooch standing around a lot, avoiding the physics behind a bitch-ass air-to-ground concussion missile does not spell out a good time to me. I've been spoiled by the social scene up here in Beantown. As long as the student body of UCONN enjoys X-Lot, that is all that matters. I'll take my shady house parties on the hill and raise you a pub crawl.  Moving on to the week at hand, I went to Mohegan Sun on Monday night with the Roomie Crew and the always endearing Jimi James. I made a donation of 60-plus dollars to the Native American gambling establishment. It took me 90 minutes to lose the first $20, then only 40 minutes to lose the other 40-plus dollars. I was annoyed, but really can you think you're going to walk into a casino and take them to the cleaners? It's a billion-dollar industry for a reason. We all had a good time and I ate a Krispy Kreme donut on the way out, so the night was a success as far as I was concerned.  [We won't get into my nutritional habits for the last 4 days, not good folks, not good. I'm gonna hit the gym with a resounding  -thud.- ]  Northeastern, the university that made red tape popular, has told me that I can't graduate with an incomplete; even though I was originally told I could and make it up later. Regardless, I'm going to sneak my way around it and get my damn degree this Saturday even if I have to get ninjas involved.  Happy Birthday Miss Fightsback, welcome to old.  Kawklyn's back in town, you've been warned. Hijinx and hooch are in my immediate future.   Taking Back Sunday is to be played at high decibels, and demands you sing along.  Coming soon:  Zee Woman.

       Coupe De Grace   The away message:  start clapping. i demand a standing O for the last 5 years.   The replies:   Moai42:  congratulations, bro. now, go down to the bar and start drinking away that five years of book-learnin'.   jumpmanjr79:  i'm jumpkicking you from left field if you're demanding an ovation...   Skiracer9x:  college. in half a decade. go you.  [i hate you mike.]  The college stint is over, sure I've got an incomplete to knock down, but I'm still getting a degree. Now onto more important questions:   Moai42:  when are you doing to finish that damned doomsday device you started sophomore year? you know the rogue cosmonauts you hired are getting antsy.  flexibledecimal:  you are tired and procrastinating.  Moai42:  oh, well played, mr. bond. well played.  I'm tired and ready for bed. I've had a few drinks at the bar, but I'm going upstairs to party with Gabe and company, can't stop until I can't stand up.  Taking Back Sunday is  so damn good.   (A.P.T. 10:57 p.m.)

       Split Time   Just checking in long enough to state that I am still alive. I have 2 finals to go, both on Friday, and it's all done at 5pm, the last possible time one could finish their collegiate career. I'm beat, I don't really handle the lack of sleep thing too well anymore. I'm going to bed as soon as this is posted to make one final run at this whole mess. When the dust clears, I'll be the one with the catatonic eyes, a kung-fu grip on a cold one, and muttering, "Damn, now what?"  (A.P.T. 10:37 p.m.)

       The Stuff That Legend Is Made Of   I really wasn't planning on posting tonight, but this couldn't be passed up. I don't make my friends say these things, I just watch and listen.   I think I will title this one, "Zen, and the Art of Constricting One's Bowels."   KeviNU33:  a legend has just been born.  flexibledecimal:  enlighten me.  KeviNU33:  i just killed a whole jar of tostitos salsa con queso nacho cheese in just under 4 hours.  flexibledecimal:  that's wrong.  KeviNU33:  i'm debating whether i should put this before or after "knowledgable in Maya" on my resume.  flexibledecimal:  kiss your bowels goodbye.  KeviNU33:  no they'll still be around, but they'll be VERY irritable.  flexibledecimal:  understood.  KeviNU33:  i'm licking the inside of the jar as we speak.  flexibledecimal:  alright, that's it. you're the blog subject of the night.  KeviNU33:  this won't be the first time someone else has written about my bowels.  flexibledecimal:  well damn, i'll be.  KeviNU33:  my bowels have been the topic of many a thesis.  flexibledecimal:  so people become doctors over the topic of your butt cheeks?  KeviNU33:  and one of them was a dentist.  Thank you Kevin, I hope you bronze your intestines for what they are dealing with right now.  This weekend I did nothing, had a guest, and drank; that adds up to be a very good weekend. Now I pay with late nights of work until Friday, which is the end of my academic stint and playland as I know it.  Let's dance.  (A.P.T. 11:06 p.m.)

       Petty, But Not Tom Petty   Holy cow. I go out for a few drinks, come back home, and find that my one misuse of a comma has become a worth topic for posting by Miss Jessica  urlLink Curtis.   Well Miss Curtis, I apologize that my comma was incorrectly used when I quoted you. I apologize that I have obviously wronged you and anyone else who has ever studied the English langauge in the annuls of academia.  Oh wait, I'm not. Until you acclimate yourself with the visual langauge of design, I suggest you step off that soap box that finally puts your frame over six feet, come down, and hang out with the riff-raff. An English major picking on an Art major, it's like kids in wheelchairs fighting. Liberal Arts sadness.  Boozing with  urlLink blood  is fun.  The girl gets the internet back at her house and suddenly the world needs to drop everything and pay attention to my grammatial error.  Yes Catholics hit low and hard. What do you take me for? Some grape-soda drinking Baptist? Ha.  (A.P.T. 2:26 a.m.)

       Miles of Stones   It was a year ago today that I last saw you. Sure we exchanged e-mails for a few months thereafter, but they were icy at best. I don't write this to burn, bury, or elevate, just subjectively objectify the distance one year can put between two people.   Several weeks ago I cleaned out mementos and evidence of what we were. I thumbed through letters and notes, but I never focused on any of the words. I knew if I grabbed onto anything other than the safety of an ambiguous preposition, or an ambivalent verb, I'd be pulled into a past that has no place in the present or my current state of mind. I didn't do it because I was mad, or needed some final, fitting tribute, I guess it was just time. All it had collected were bittersweet memories among the dust.  I spent most of my time trying to figure out why; trying to make heads or tails of it for so long. Now I live with the fact that it's just spare change occaisonally rattling together in the back of my head. I hope you got something out of us, that I left a mark even half the size of the one you left on me.  You were right when you wrote to me that communication couldn't go any further; I understand that now. I hope maybe someday we can talk, joke about the past, maybe even seem friendly. It'd be a shame that all we have to show for the time we spent was this, but when the water runs over the breaks, it doesn't pick and choose what goes out to sea.   I hope life finds you well.

       Focused Dispersion   Okay, so all the thoughts in my head for this post are nigh-impossible to put in any sort of order, so I'm going to use the almighty hyphen (-) to distinguish one from the next, in no apparent order. Awesome.  -On their way home Friday afternoon, Wooding 1 said to Wooding 2, "Shut up and drink the Kool-Aid, I don't have time for your second guessing." To which Wooding 2 replied, "Commit or leave the compound, the mothership is on its way."  -I know we all joke about how Cadbury Cream Eggs are so good that they're addictive, but I'm seriously thinking about checking myself into rehab. My pancreas just did a barrel roll.  -This weekend I perfected my skill of yelling at traffic. As far as I'm concerned nobody can yell at traffic with the unreal expectations of it to magically clear up like I can.  -As of late, it's been said that I have chicken legs. Of course this was brought to my attention and reminded to me by a gentleman with an  urlLink unwieldily  head and another one who I call, "Gomez Adams."  -I received a giant Hershey's Chocolate Bar on Friday night. I thank you and hope you will be there to help me with my pending insulin injections.  -On Monday April 5th, I made a reference to a cartoon in my title. Conglom-O is the company Ed Bighead worked at in  Rocko's Modern Life.  The irreverent Jeff McKay was the first one to chime in with the correct answer and was infliceted with the theme song being stuck in his head because of it; sorry Jeff. Jonboy, you didn't get to answer because I knew you knew the answer, and if I know that you know, and you know that I know you know, then we both know. Got it? Mr. Raby, you answered late, and your prize is me telling everyone how your mom called at 4:30 in the morning last night to see where you were.  -Gregory Santos, you are a toolbelt. That is all.  -I still find the clucking Cadbury bunny to be largely humorous.  -On Saturday I returned to the scene of the crime. I went back to Chris' house for the practice session which wasn't able to materialize last weekend. We have 4 songs, more or less, and they just seem to get better eact time we play them. This could really turn into something, or it could turn into a giant asparagus.   -Yes I said giant asparagus, did I mention I'm overtired?  -I have the most evil week of schoolwork this week. Let's blog about it.   -The Visual Arts Department dinner is Wednesday, I will be drunk and obnoxious, you have been warned.  -Just before Easter Dinner, my dear Grandmother mentioned that a long, looooooong time ago she dated a Dick Wooding. No relation to present family, but the punchline being, Dick Wooding. Say it with me now, Dick Wooding.  -I'm impatiently waiting for  urlLink New Found Glory's  album to drop on May18th.  -Comfortable, surprisingly comfortable. Resilient too.  -So I was up pretty late last night after hanging out in Hartford and then coming home to chat with my brother's friends. Then I get the call at 10am from Brandon wanting to go play football at the park. I just want to go back to sleep but God help me if I close my eyes again, Brandon would be over ripping me out of bed and dragging me from the back of his car to said park. It does not help that it was my idea to play some sort of recreational sport with him, James, and Jay. I'd punch myself in the face if it weren't for my dashing good looks, and by dashing I mean intolerance for pain.  So I manage to lift my body out of bed and walk over to Brandon's house. We get to the park and realize that 2 on 2 football just won't be what we want it to, so we grab some bats and tennis balls out of Jay's car, hop over the Little League field fence, and settle for a little home run derby. First off, I am inept at connecting bat to a softly lobbed tennis ball. I hit several weak grounders that counted as outs. Now batting, Mark "The Liability" Wooding. The rules we had set up was that someone would infield and someone would play outfield. We also cut the field in half as to cut down on the "sprinting like your head is on fire so that you can just miss the incoming tennis ball" factor.   Easily the best part of the whole deal (other than Jay and I whacking Brandon and James 28-12 [I scored maybe 2 of those runs]) was whenever a pop up was hit, it was never a sure thing. Words do not do justice to the humorous site of Brandon, James, or myself getting under these fly tennis balls and having them bounce off our hands due to the miscalculated elasticity of said yellow projectile. Highest of high comedy.   These moments have become our holiday template. I probably won't see James again until May and Brandon and Jay are tough to nail down since they have lives and jobs. So, even though I was falling asleep in the ham I was eating with my family, I was glad I dragged myself out of bed for today's hijinx.  -I went for a run this evening. Just a ten minute test on Judas; my physical therapist suggested it. It went well, I didn't go too fast, but I didn't have any searing pain shooting out of my right knee either. I missed running, but until I had gotten through the first 2 or 3 minutes and achieved my stride, I didn't realize how much I missed it. I could try to tell you about how good it feels, but that all adjective-injected fluff; onto the next topic.   -Isn't this whole blog adjective-injected fluff?  -Kathryn, sorry we didn't get to catch up this Easter, I left early and you were probably embroiled in family proceedings. Hope to hear from you.   -It's baseball season. You should be rejoicing.  -Anybody care to figure out the rest of my life for me? I'll give you a nickel...  -12 days until the ride ends, get in the side car and put on the goggles.   Oof. The pressure in my head has been relieved, for now.  (A.P.T. 1:03 a.m.)

       The Odometer Rolls On    Solipsism Inc.  celebrates 3 months of personal web debauchery today. I started this pile of words figuring that people would be looking for reasons when I finally snapped. It would be something grand, like "The Dreaded Thursday Afternoon Souflle Incident." Alas, or luckily I have managed to keep it together and think the asinine work I post has managed to help me out somehow. I look back to my first postings and more than anything else, I'm glad there is progression. Progression has always been the most important thing to me. We all get mired in matters, scenarios, general funks, and other functions of life, but all I look for in myself is the ability to push ahead; to understand where I've been and linearly evolve as a result of lessons learned. Change, or your readers get boring material.   I hope you, the consumer, have enjoyed the 91 days of self-righteous, overblown rantings. There is much more to come, rumor has it I will graduate and be released into the wild.   Right now I have an all-night farm shift. I'm so excited, I'm not wearing pants. Okay, I am wearing pants, but if I could take them off, that's how excited I'd be. Trust me.  Celebrate and tell a friend. My loose grip on reality, is a 20 minute break from yours.

       Conglom-O   Anyone who can name the cartoon reference in the title will earn my utmost adoration. Sorry Jon, you're family and you know the answer.  I bring this post to you on a short break from "Revenge of the Procrastinated Work." A short film about 800 lbs. of academia wreaking havoc on me due to my repeated neglect. Think Ike and Tina, except I'm Tina and I don't get to fight back. I don't understand it either, but it comes out on April 23 (last day of finals).  Of course we start with the re-cap to the first weekend of  400 Meters to Go:   Friday was a straight shot to Danbury, CT to have my custom built six string tuned up, apparently the neck had bowed a little bit due to Boston's freak weather changes and caused a couple strings to fret out. No fear, it has been tuned up and is ready to rock at a moment's notice. I went out with my buddy Steve later that night and ran into a few other old high school friends at a bar/restaurant in Middletown. It was a decent time, but I wanted to get home being flat-out exhausted; so, after some grappling with Steve for a while he let me drive his truck home and i passed out for about 10 hours into the early afternoon on Saturday.  I woke up to the sound of Miss Curtis wondering what our plans were for the afternoon. I, in all my groggy glory, said that I just wanted to go to the gym and to let me wake up so I can refrain from being a total dick to her. Team Fatass actually followed through and made it down to the gym for the first time this week; go team go. After showering and finding some clean clothes, the J.C. and I went off to the movies and caught Hellboy. It was a decent flick, I wouldn't go running out to see it unless the power of Christ compels you, but it was an okay piece of cinema. The CG was pretty tight and the acting was done well, until certain points where the scripting brought the quality of the acting down a few notches.   I was suppose to make some music with my friend Chris, but he had his drum lesson moved to Saturday, so he was in Boston while I was in Southington. We'll make another attempt this weekend, I think.  Later that Saturday I ventured off to Hartford, CT for a date. It was dinner, conversation, and a very good time. I'm going to apply a rare, "Less is More," rule to this topic. I'd rather not jinx myself. A second date would be nice.  Sunday I busted hump, well actually Jonboy drove all the way back to Boston, I slept like a rock. We unpacked at my place, I drove him back to BU and then I passed out yet again for 3 hours before getting ready for the Darkness concert down in Providence. If you want sheer entertainment, you can't beat the Darkness. I only knew their current single, but the show was a good time, glad I went.   So the weekend was an overall success, and now I get the brunt of consequence with work this week. I ended up taking an 11pm to 7am shfit for a co-worker; he has jury duty this morning, poor bastard. I really need the cash, and well, it'll make me sit here and do work, once I stop typing. I look forward to Easter with the fam this weekend. Jimmy is coming back for the holiday and I haven't seen him since Christmas, so it'll be good to hang out with him and Bubs for an evening.   But first, I have to get through the rest of this week. My schedule is pretty much all over the place at this point. Posts are going to get quite interesting from this point on. Severe sleep deprivation makes me neurotically entertaining.

       Square 1   Those of you fortunate enough not to live in the New England area missed the first day of Monsoon Season. It took me almost a half an hour to paddle down to campus in my canoe during this unholy downpour. City buses don't seem to understand the right of way a canoe commands. I bought a new umbrella to try and keep myself dry from the Monsoon's wrath, but that lasted about 25 minutes before the wind kicked it in; it still works, but now had a delightful bend in the base of it.  It wasn't the way I planned on sailing into April, but here I am.   Welcome to:  400 Meters to Go, the Sprint to Graduation   I've claimed April as my month, I'm going to ride it, and if you ask, I've got the receipt in my pocket. I've made my peace with the last 3 months and refuse to let April go the way of the dinosaur and slowly sink into the pit of "could have been." Instead I aim for the "did, conquered, and 'can you believe we didn't end up in jail'?" Sure the last one might be a little bit of a stretch, but I think I'm good for a potential misdemeanor or two before my time is up at Northeastern University.  Putting cash-based denominations down to back up my ever-running mouth, I present to you the itinerary for the first weekend of  400 Meters to Go:  Going home.   On face value, this seems about as much of a good time as getting stuck to the plastic your grandmother puts on all her furniture. Connecticut is but the starting point; I've got an old friend to catch up to, an entire day of songwriting, and I've even got myself a date on Saturday. Sunday, I'm venturing down to Providence to see the Darkness with the Minister of Fun, Zach Mangan, and the rest of his crew. I figure somewhere along the way, my school work will do itself. I mean it owes me that much.  Screw being content, I demand euphoria, and you bet your sweet ass I'm going to get it.

       In Case of Emergency, Break Dance   I need a 1971 Oldsmobile 442 with the 4-speed manual transmission, custom T-top, and the kind of leather seats that make a PETA activist sweat at night. Cover my dream in a beautiful midnight blue, chrome in all the right places, and pretend gas isn't over 2 dollars a gallon.  I need a custom built Fender Stratocaster. We're talking a Swamp Ash body with a clear coat finish, a flamed-Maple neck with Maple fretboard, 22 Jumbo frets, the large 70's headstock, and a Seymour Duncan Hum-Single-Single pickup configuration encased in a black pickguard with working tremolo.  Actually, what I really need is my new roommate to show up tomorrow, because I don't have enough money to pay for this month's rent in its entirety.  This weekend marked the interstate lane-shift of a summer under construction. My roommates for the last 4 years, Bill and Mike have vacated the premises; Bill for a new job in New York City and Mike for a cheap sublet until he has to start clinical in New York sometime in August. This weekend was a combination of good-byes, packing, and re-arranging what's left of my apartment.  Saturday night Bill, Mike, Kevin, Joe, Lindsay, Lisa, Rebbecca, Kim, and myself all gathered together for dinner at Pho Pasteur on Newbury street as a large going away meal since we're all starting to meander in different directions through this summer and the fall. We are a hilarious group and the night was set up before we even got to the restaurant. Kim and I were walking just in front of Bill and Joe on our way to the restaurant when I felt something suddenly rain on me. Ignoring ironic buildup, the bottomline was some constapated digestive system with wings bombed me much like the IRA was picking off fellow Irishmen in previous decades.  BOOM.  The black Puma jacket which I wore as a second skin was fatally wounded by said bird or multiple bird perpetrators. Bill said to just wash it off at the restaurant, but this jacket was done as far as I was concerned. I got painted like a drive-by and I really didn't want to carry a pooped-on, wet jacket with me for the rest of the night. It had gotten its use, I can buy another, hopefully. If interested the jacket has probably moved from the garbage of the bathroom at Pho Pasteur to a dumpster near said location.  Dinner was interesting; it was a Vietnamese cuisine and anything that didn't appeal to someone's taste buds could be covered in chili sauce. Everything turned out well and pretty cheap to boot; I still ended up using some chili sauce, just for hypothetical purposes.  After dinner we sauntered down to the recently opened Cold Stone Creamery. Their marketing ploy is you pick a flavor of ice cream and then pick from an enormous assortment of toppings that they combine with a state of the art particle accelerator or atom smasher, depending on if you want butterfinger bits or gummi bears. It was good, but almost too sweet; nice ploy though.  As we wallked away from the Creamery, we were all wondering how we were going to get to Ned Devine's at Faneuil Hall. Some of us wanted to walk, some of us wanted to take the T. We were trying to agree on the mode of transportation when all of the sudden the party bus pulled up [party bus being a bus-trolley with lights, smoke, loud dance music, and a driver with no shame]. I kid you not, when I say the timing was eerie at best. Bill takes one look and decides we're going to Faneuil Hall on the party bus. The guy says $20 for all of us and Bill's paying, so we all left our shame in front of P.F. Chang's and got on the party bus, stone cold sober and laughing the entire way there. The driver took the long way to get to our destination, trying to get others to join, but we were the only shameless idiots at 9:00pm at night. It was mind-numbingly stupid, but absolutely hilarious as Bill, Lisa, and Rebecca danced half-assed while those on the street wondered how much crystal meth was consumed by us, the party bus patrons.  Ned Devine's was a decent setting, but cover charge and small drinks had me out of there within the hour. I stopped by my friend Dave's place for his party before heading home. I tried to bring them the joy of landmine, my official drinking game of the summer, but alas, kids and their attention spans these days, that and the basic motor skills of spinning a quarter.  Sunday was chill. A trip to the suburbs for tank tops that weren't wife beaters and then a BBQ at Lisa's place out in Allston summed up Sunday. Team Fatass was in full effect at Lisa's; I ate a hot dog, a cheeseburger, a piece of chicken, some pasta salad, enough tortilla chips and salsa to think about starting a Mexican chain, half a cookie, and some cake. Woot. I will now digest for the rest of June.  Monday morning, Bill was at it bright and early, he and Mike got it all the moving done in less than 2 hours with some help from Kevin and Rebecca a little later. I gave them a small hand, but was left with the task of cleaning up what was left. Shore. Although I do have to say, I lost Bill, but I gained, 5 Abercrombie and Fitch sweaters, an Abercrombie vest, another scarf, a bathing suit, a button down shirt, 2 bottles of cologne, and some random body lotion... don't know about the last one there. Overall, I made out pretty well, I just had to clean the place.  So I spent the rest of Monday dusting my room and rearranging the place for one. I've got my amp and guitars in here now, as well as all my clothing, since Mr. Bill managed to fill the whole damn closet with his many fashionable items. I figured I'd fill the room, but I've got a moat of hardwood floor just sitting in the middle, I'm figuring a rug, or maybe some cardboard boxes to finally work on my fly breakdance moves. If all else fails, I'm going to build a scale replica of Boston and walk into my room like Godzilla and gnaw on the Prudential just like I've always dreamed.  Also this week, I attempt to finish moving all my files so I can reformat my hard drive. I swear this thing is melting from the inside out.  Kathryn, sorry I didn't call you back Thursday night. Food was more important at that moment and I ate too much. I just oozed in to bed after that.   I rock, you roll.  (A.P.T. 12:49 p.m.)

       Are You In, or Are You Out   ...I figured out it was you. Kind of weird to have somebody pop in and out of your meager existence like that. So weird, it got followed up with a nap.  My old friend Joe Paradis was in town this evening and I went to Conor Larkin's with him and two of our friends; good times. So good, I forgot to do the work that was due for this evening. Awesome.  I'm going to Cape Cod tomorrow, well because I can. I'll be hanging out there for a few hours enjoy your day jobs.  Jimbo, too cool to call and wish me and Mikey happy birthday?  Talk is an economy value and sighs of relief are redeemable in CT, MA, ME, NH, and VT.  You should be listening to: Modest Mouse, Bayside, Coheed and Cambria, Alkaline Trio, and Taking Back Sunday.

       Please Keep Hands in Moving Vehicle at All Times   Four days later and 520 miles lit  up on the odometer, I have traveled at least 90% of the area Interstate 84 takes up in CT in this long weekend alone. I returned Thursday evening to gear up for the 3 phases of graduation weekend and the introduction to Kim's family.   That did not  unfurl until Friday afternoon, so I spent Thursday evening with my old friend Dave. He'll get his own post eventually, but in curt summation, it's sad how badly his parents managed to screw him up. I am a firm believer for taking responsibility for your lot in life and Dave has done some things that have really hurt his cause, but if you ever do anything right in your life, don't bail on your kid.  Friday was a late wake-up [which seems to be the norm when I go home] and a ride down to Danbury CT to have a tweak in my guitar setup and talk business with the owner; he's looking for some design, I'm looking for someone to design for. I got out of there at about 5:25pm and had to be on the Berlin turnpike at 6:00pm for  Phase 1  of Kim's family: a surprise birthday for her grandfather. Between traffic and construction in Waterbury [or as Mikey likes to say, the Dirty Water], I'd be lucky if I made it to the restaurant by the time the leaves started changing. 70 minutes later and driving that bordered on the felonious, I made it to the Imperial Buffet and did my best "I'm not a threat to your daughter" impression. This impression includes: etiquette, no sudden movements, hands on the table at all times, and a sturdy handshake. Comes in Vanilla or New Car Smell. Act now.   Phase 1  seemed to go without a hitch and we left the restaurant to catch up with the Impermeable Jeff McKay.  The Impermeable Jeff McKay who cut the 2 feet of hair he's had for almost as long as I have known him.  Looks good Jeff, next thing you know you'll be wearing dockers and swearing by the new ab program in Men's Health; or not. After acquiring the Impermeable One we decided to meet Mr. Kawklyn and his vicarious conduit Jessica M.H. Curtis for some ice cream. The ice cream distributor we originally planned on was closed, so Jeff, Kim, and I waited for Kawklyn and the vicarious conduit. Upon arrival the common Jessica Curtis "hello" had to be eschewed for  several verbal jabs and nice hook to the body. The subject was gas money and me making several key individuals have to pay for gas money, which is funny when the entire story is unraveled in that oh-so humorous, tell it all weekend long, who slashed the tires on my car? ...sort of way. We ended up at Friendly's and everyone rejoiced. Well, everyone rejoiced once Kimmy had gotten the peanut butter cup out of her sundae.  Saturday was  Phase 2  of meeting Kim's family: the graduation party. This was everybody: grandma, aunts, uncles, cousins, friends, pets, vegetables, etc. I didn't expect it be some sort of heralded arrival [although I was late enough that it was plausible], but it was highly entertaining that I was met with a positive reaction and an underlying threat. Everybody seemed to like me and they were all very nice, but it is obvious (toaster in the bathtub obvious) that this girl is the out-and-out favorite in the family. So if I ever want out, faking my personal demise will be taken into heavy consideration. Until then I will be smiling and nodding with the best of them. The party was fun, Jessica M.H. Curtis continued to rail against my OPEC-like policies with gas prices, and grandma reminded me that Kim was her granddaugther, in case I wasn't sure.  Saturday night was chill and I'd be surprised that I didn't fall asleep if it weren't for the 2 hot dogs and 2 cans of Pepsi left hapharzardly in my fridge, calling my name to be devoured right before bed. I am a  genius.   Sunday was the final and chilling phase.  Phase 3  of meeting Kim's family: sitting with Kim's family by myself for the graduation ceremony. It wasn't a bad thing, it was just bordering on overkill. Luckily Brandon's brother in law was there since his sister went back to school for a nursing degree. Scooooore. I've known Jay for a while and the man is as cool as the other side of the pillow. I made the executive decision to sit with Jay and we would try to keep each other awake. The ceremony was nice and the speakers, minus the student speaker, were entertaining. When all was said and done, I had picture time with everyone and then I bailed like hay; I had to be back in Boston for 5pm to meet with a realtor and continue my search for some place to live for the upcoming September.  So I left Hartford to go all the way down to Waterbury and pick up Kawklyn (he wanted a ride to Beantown and was stuck at home), stopped in Southington to gather my worldly possesions, and then cruised back through Hartford up to Boston. Driving like speed was going out of style, I made it back in what might be called a record time to meet up with Gomez "Gabe" Adams and go look at some places with the realtor. We saw a few really cool places, and more likely then not, I will end up in the Allston area right off the B line.  Almost 10 apartments later, Gabe and I had a list and went for some food. Both of us being flat-out exhausted after long weekends, drifted home in a pseudo-fog and I found myself going to bed before midnight for the first time in at least 2 weeks.  The skies just opened up this morning, waking me up right about the time I had to be up anyway. I was still late. I'm always late, oh well.     Other News:   Greg, I got your Oakleys. For a minute there I thought I had a beat-up, old recliner that was also a producer of high-end eye wear.  Don't worry Jessica, I love you too. Shh, don't tell anyone.   (A.P.T. 10:56 a.m.)

       A Meditation on 23   At 8 years old, I realized I wasn't going to live forever. No matter what Catholicism told me.  At 16, I found out I had cancer and my silly little worry became an unavoidable reality for a short eternity. Splayed out on my back from post-op on Thanksgiving Day weekend of 1997, there I was thinking, rolling my eyes in the irony that was sewn into the sheets I laid in and worried in for periods of half of my life.  On the eve of my 23 birthday, I look out my window on this warm, rainy night and reminisce about bringing cup cakes to St. Thomas elementary school for my birthday. That large tupperware container of baked goods was one of the few things that could offset having to put on the gray slacks, white shirt, clip-on plaid tie, and maroon sweater that supplemented my first 6 years of Catholic-oriented education.  As the age odometer clicks, it reminds me how thankful I am for my friends. To the veteran squad: Worm, Kathryn, the Trio, Simz, I've known all of you for 8+ years (Worm wins with 17+ years of service, or chagrin, depending who you ask.). I hope it's been half as entertaining for you as it has been for me. From my larger-than-life girl problems, penchant for being verbose, and random, ill-timed meltdowns, I say thank you; though I still expect a gift.   I continue to live with a sense of urgency. I don't think I'm going to die young, nor do I plan to. May 19th of every year just happens to remind me that time is my enemy and while tomorrow is only a day away, it is a privilege; not a right. Plan for the long-term, be aware of the short-term.   In the 365 days of being 23 that follow, I am going to have one of the most interesting years of my life. There will be business opportunities, travel, and another phase of my life to conquer. Unsolvable variables include love, life, and luck. I am not good with math, but I will show my work.    My success and failure I hold to this:   If I'm in, I'm all in.  Know when to walk away.    emCsilence:  fly lesbian seagull. fly. or happy birthday. whichever.   Skiracer9x:  happy birthday shithead. (ass. happy birthday to you as well [05.18].).  Thank you for the present Kimmy.  (A.P.T. 1:06 a.m.)

       Fuzzy Dice   I am taking a mulligan for May. My posts have been sub-par at best. Just like baseball you're bound to hit your slumps. I'm not mired in one so much as I haven't been able to ride a notion like I usually do. The scene has been relatively quiet since graduation and I don't have much to go on about. Life is decent, I'm working on my portfolio, and Kimmy has been a delightful positive. Since I feel like I'm just racking up word count, I'm taking time off unless the power of Christ compels me otherwise. I assume America's work force will survive without me. Rock on.

       Back Foot Leads to Front   It was 11:24 and I decided to go for a run. The time was right. Lately my posts have been coherent and fairly straight-forward;  no more of that.  Not in this post at least. Pull out the decoder ring from the cereal box and start humming in the key of G sharp.  The counter to a 2.5 hour nap is going for a 3.5+ mile run, I better drop like a freaking rock tonight. There's something strangely ironic about surprise guests and a lack of sunglasses. Team Fatass has hit its stride, therefore the gym has made the list of things to do for Thursday. I was ready to throw people out the windows of the lab so I could get home and run. I haven't been that anxious to hit the pavement in a while. Mikey Wez should not be trusted to parallel park a car. I'm one of the last people on the face of the planet without and i-pod or mp3 player to keep my head ringing while I cruise with my cross-trainers and cavort at a leisurely pace through the streets of Boston. The impending result is a thorough maze of memories and ponderings that excede basic expectations. Things other than "Don't trip. Don't trip. For the love bagels without holes in them, don't trip. Apparently I need to listen to the new John Mayer, somebody should make me a copy. I hope my knee doesn't blow like a kid with a pinwheel and too much time on his little hands. The air smells the same as it did last year; bittersweet and warm. Not that I expect it to change. I wonder when I should get some new running kicks. As of late, I'm taking things a day at a time and everything with a grain of salt. I'm taking charge of the phrase "voluntarily trapped." My birthday is in 7 days, I got to put a party on. Christ raking leaves, my brother better not put on the show he did last time he was at my apartment. I am electric, eclectic, and eccentric; I feel more important than you do. My ego takes 89 octane. I'm so much more than the hype. I put your face right...  there,  and I start to run a little harder. Do I examine all these feelings so I don't get bored and realize that I'm only putting up a 9 minute mile? Heartbreak squared, divided by my own mistakes, set against a null set and suddenly I wonder how I got from Flash's bar all the way over to Trinity Church; did I just fold time and space with a pair of Sauconys and a blue bandana? I don't remember the inbetween.  Kissy kissy. Fix it. This run is the first official, "shirt comes off" run. I needed something to light the path in front of me and my pale white ass was the man for the job. Tension makes it a little more interesting. I'm going to the beach Friday. I took out the earring, it never really stopped being sore. The question is  when  do I get the tattoo? Prime numbers are cool.  (A.P.T. 2:43 a.m.)

       Spectrum   Oh my, it's been an interesting day. It began with apartment hunting. Henry, Gabe, and I went off searching for some possible cheaper housing. I love where I am, love the area, love my room, but paying $925+ a month starting in June (when Bill moves out) is just way too much for someone who has no job yet.  So we sauntered out to Harbor Point over by the JFK stop on the red line. A very nice apartment area set up on the water. We looked at a nice 3 floor apartment with separate bedrooms for each of us. It has some serious potential, particularly price, but I'm having some major separation anxiety even thinking about taking off from my present situation, regardless of substantial cost.  After apartment hunting I came back home and decided to get a haircut. I went to the place I usually go, but sat down with a different guy than the one that usually cuts my hair. That was my first mistake, my second was saying "Chop the top." I've got short hair to begin with. Now I look like I misplaced my fatigues. It'll grow out and what not, but I haven't achieved the hair loss necessary to go with this new length, not yet at least. For some reason the older gentleman who was cutting my hair seemed to think that the cutting motion of the electric clippers alone was not enough to cut my hair; he needed to smack my head with the device as is necessary with pseudo-Marine recruits. All in all, I was a little irked, but fine when I got home. That didn't last too long; I lost it when my shower would not come down to a reasonable temperature, like not scalding. I became so annoyed, I actually started yelling at my shower. It was only 5pm by that point.   [Short intermission for the consumption of 4 hard boiled eggs.]  After yelling at hot water for a good 10 minutes, I finally cleaned up and surveyed the damage done to my head; at least I get to wear my Yankees visor more frequently over the next few weeks. Woot.  Later on, about 7ish, Mr. James "Jimi-James" Jones came by to hang out, bringing the official girlfriend of Jimi-James, Amie Jagielow (Go ahead, pronounce that.). He wondered if we could go for a ride; seemed like a good idea to me. We got into the car and with Greenday "Dookie" as our soundtrack to reminisce by, peeled out in my dirty, but bad ass sedan, and tore off to the west. We ended up driving down to Providence, eating some ice cream, and hanging out in the park on Cogdon St. There was no reason to go down there, but the trip was immensely satisfying and I didn't pay for the ice cream, so once again, woot.  When I dropped Amie and James off at Amie's place, I happened to look over to a window open on the other side of the street. Lo and freaking behold, the endearing Henry Foster was over his new girl's place on St. Stephens. Then, much to my chagrin and the chagrin of my colleagues, there he is, making kissy face with said girl. Hand claps for you Henry Foster. Hand claps and a friendly reminder, pull down the shade,  you are gross.   I've had trouble sleeping lately. I think it has more to do with the change of season and the increase in temperature. There's a lot flying around in this brain tonight. Living situation, how I'm going to pay rent and try to put some sort of food on the table are coming up a little more quickly than I expected. I love pressure, I'd just like a few more weeks off before I have to be in it again.  Sweet Charity.  Hm mmm mmmmm.  (A.P.T. 1:06 a.m.)

       Feedback   Some of the finer points of having an interview find you:   KSwy1719:  good for you. Must be enjoying this you time now.    the mighty m5:  sort of. job interview monday.  KSwy1719:  You looking forward to it?  I love how people are calling YOU, where I'm the opposite and am completely starting to harass companies.  They are going to put my picture up all over Southern CT and ban me from any jobs.  In reference to sincerity and women, my man J-Bigs has the answer as usual:    jsox21:  Just lie to them, it's so much easier.  I had a pretty solid weekend with my homeboys and Zee Woman. A more elaborate summation will occur after the job interview tomorrow. Possible gainful emplyoment? We shall find out...  (A.P.T. 8:46 p.m.)

       Ebb & Flow    sincerity  (n) - The quality or condition of being sincere; genuineness, honesty, and freedom from duplicity.   assumption  (n) - Something taken for granted or accepted as true without proof; a supposition:  a valid assumption.     While careening through the streets of Boston last night, M. T. G. Perona and I got into topics of relationships. Somewhere between blatant disregard for mandated traffic laws and our own general safety, the topic of Valerie came up with the statement, "I sometimes wonder if you enjoy setting yourself up like that."   Apparently, I should have been a theatre major.  I'm not at a loss for words so much as I am for choosing the right ones. There are those out there who don't even know me and think I had some sort of wonderful game going during those 3 months I spent trying to convince Valerie to give me one more chance. Pain is a potent muse for creativity, but I would like to think my life is just as interesting now that  I'm finally in a more positive frame of mind. I did not enjoy the sleepless nights, my loss of appetite, what it did to me, and how it affected my relationships with my friends. I didn't like the giant ball of anxiety that sat in my stomach and took over for days at a time. I did not want to be where I was, but I cared about her and believed in us. Maybe I believed too much.   Does it seem that since it didn't work out, I suddenly went back to being the closest variation of normal?  Before Val, I spent almost a year and a half waiting for someone to come back to me that never did. I couldn't put myself in the same position again, regardless of what had happened. I had spent too long waiting, wanting, and hurting to do it all over again. There is no circuit breaker that kicked over, I had nothing left in the tank. Those days were longer than I'd like to remember.  So here I am with new people in my life and a fistful of lessons. There are days when I wonder what could have happened, but I don't give it much more than a thought; there is too much potential in my present to repeat my past.  I'm sorry for what happened between the two of us, but sincerity is not a game I play. I need the quarters for laundry.  (A.P.T. 11:52 a.m.)

       Drag Racing with Life   So I got a call today from Pearson Publishing Company. They received my resume from my friend Justin and would like me to come in to interview on Monday. They didn't say for what, or what position may be open, so I'm not sure what I'm in for. I am assuming a print design job, though it could be for copy monkey, and that's worth a $150K education.  I see that life is already coming after me, right out of the gate called graduation. I was hoping to take at least 6 weeks off, get my portfolio together, put a website online, infiltrate the highest ranking office of a third world country, install myself through a bloodless coup, and name this country Solipsistia. We'd specialize in gords.  So I will scramble and get my portfolio together. It will lean heavily on the print design and we shall see what happens.   I have been pulled over in 3 states: Connecticut, New York, and now Massachusetts. A Mass State Trooper pulled me over last night because he couldn't see my license plate in my back window, the one put up there because it was stolen last time it was screwed to the trunk. He was suprisingly personable, ran my license and registration, and sent me on my way. Usually the story ends with a speeding ticket, I enjoy alternate endings.  More mayhem to come; published as processed.  (A.P.T. 1:40 a.m.)

       How I'm Already Bored at Home, or 354 Reasons I'll Never Move to New Jersey   So I decided to take a few days after graduation to pay a visit to the eye of excitement, Southington Connecticut. It's like Vegas with no hookers, gambling, or lights, but we do have Hen House BBQ, and that counts for something.   f l a s h b a c k   So when we last left our hero, the Minister of Fun had thrown down the gauntlet for a pub crawl and I was about to take off for the Senior Week Booze Cruise.  Roommate Mikey-Wez and I headed down to the spacious abode of C-Sic and met the stick formerly known as  urlLink Nathan J. Sutton  for a little pre-game action. After a few shots of firewater and an ATM pit stop we got on the school sanctioned buses, transferring us out to the World Trade Center to pick up our fine sailing vessel.  The minute I hit the boat I had two drinks in my hand (they were small) and started milling around catching up to people I knew, those I hadn't seen since I stepped foot on this campus, and those who I thought were taken care of by acts of God. It was a great time and the boat wasn't as crowded as I feared it would be. The booze was plentiful, the weather was great, and everyone seemed to get along.  After the boat returned to port, I ended up at Tia's for a couple more drinks shooting the breeze with my friend who works there and eventually catching a cab home with C-Sic, who was 3 sheets to the wind with his hand skimming the water. I got up Friday with an obnoxious lack of equilibrium. I could walk straight and I wasn't really hungover, but I think just the sheer amount of alcohol that was consumed just left a lingering, vertiginous (gratuitous use of adjectives) effect on me. It gave me a reason to chill out for the day and do laundry that desperately needed to be done.  My parents drove to Boston Friday afternoon for Saturday's graduation. Before we went out to dinner, they came over to our apartment for some wine and cheese that my ever-energetic roommate Bill had devised as a way to get all our parents together; a royal rumble of college tuition philanthropists, if you will. We're high class like that.  So the parents wined, cheesed, and other noun-forced-verbs. After the parent corralling event, I took them out to Cibo in the North End with my brother; this was the restaurant that Caramia, the finest of bi-polar women, took me to when I accidentally bought her in the athlete auction. Dad was a little rough around the edges having to eat later than used to, but the highly entertaining waiter and really good food settled him back to more Wooding-like spirits.  A wonderful foot note to Friday was the voice mail that all the computers down on the farm had been infected with a nasty virus and I to find time to go burn my 4-plus gigs of work onto disc since they were going to reformat all the hard drives. If the existing higher power loves me at all, there will be no loss of files when I put them back onto the hard drive and run a virus scan. Please love me existing higher power.  My brother gave me the entire Far Side Collection as a graduation/birthday gift. It's a two volume, hardcover set and it weighs more than 45lbs. Thank you Jon, you have validated having to beat up all those old women.  I didn't sleep too well the night before graduation. I think it was the warmth of the room as opposed to nerves. I was glad to be done and looking forward to the whole pomp and circumstance part of the program. It was a straight forward graduation and the Jumbotron didn't catch me doing anything embarssing. The Northeastern University class of 2004 graduated and the Fleet Center is still standing. I received my Bachelors in Science and now use it as proof that I'm invincible and to get those hard to reach places when my toothbrush just can't cut it.  I would like to thank the alluring Kim [secretly known as  Zee Woman ] and the ethereal Miss Jessica Curtis for coming to my graduation.  After the ceremony and lunch with the family, I finally burned all of my files down on the farm. After that, I attempted to get myself a short nap before the pub crawl was to commence.   At 8:30 I met up with the Minister of Fun and his crew and kicked off another pub crawl. At bar numero 5, Jessica gave me some jabs to the mid-section over her status as second-tier friend. I had asked 3 of my other friends to go to graduation before I asked her. Of course her feigned anger was justifed, all they had on her were 9-plus years of being my friend. Jessica brought this up just to prod my defense mechanisms and luckily for her she had an audience of Marleen (from now on referred to as "The 'leen" or "Master of the Crossed Arms") and Zach. Never ones to miss giving me crap, The 'leen gave me some Harvard educated sarcasm and Zach bled profusely from his weeping vagina, since I did not even ask him to go. [Note: Minister of Fun, patch up bleeding orifice before I hand over my kingdom to you. Thanks.]  We hit this pub crawl hard and fast, a little too hard and fast. We ran out of gas just after midnight; a lot of us were tired and I have decided to have a little rain check party at my place sometime later in the month. A valiant attempt, but I think I'm done with alcohol for a while. Nothing malicious happened, I'm just a little partied out unless an unavoidable good time comes along.   Today, as mentioned at the beginning, I drove back to Southington. I figured I'd chill out a couple days before I started working on the farm for the summer. I need to seriously lower my threshold for excitement when I come down here.   Since getting home, I've already watched too much TV. The upcoming "Friends" finale has spawned several thousand various "Friends" retrospective programs (with over 85% belonging to VH1); further proof that unless it's Comedy Central, Sports Center or Adult Swim, television is 400 channels of soul-devouring refuse.  Does anybody realize how funny Dave Attell is? Seriously.   Dear hip-hop,  Remember when you use to be cool and innovative? What happened? Is it possible to get some street cred around here? Please put the bling down and step away from the gratuitous booty.  Sincerely,  Confounded White Guy   I'm dying to name some possession of mine  "el bastardo."   Truly a person of class, and that's rare.  The impeccable Jeff McKay:   jumpmanjr79:  wish you were a chick.  flexibledecimal:  right.  flexibledecimal:  my 5 o'clock shadow disconcerting?  jumpmanjr79:  slighty.  jumpmanjr79:  how'd the graduation go?  flexibledecimal:  it's all said and done.  flexibledecimal:  now i'm in the "scratching my butt" phase of lilfe.  jumpmanjr79:  it's a good time and place.  jumpmanjr79:  very soul cleansing.  17 days until my birthday. I'll be a prime number this year.  Reason #32: I need New Jersey like badgers need hats.  (A.P.T. 1:46 a.m.)

       A I, IV, V Progression   Posting in the morning. Wow. I never do that. I can barely get out of bed and feed myself before noon, and here I am typing away like I actually have something to say.  I spent two days in Cape Cod with my family this weekend. I orginally noted this as a peninsula but since the Army Corps of Engineers had the balls to drill through the whole damn thing, it technically is an island. An island  full  of old people... and Canadiens. Sunday I managed to get to the beach and relax for a bit, I even went for a run later that day and still managed not to torch my skin a nice fire engine red color. I'm so proud of me. For now.  I was in touch with my old roommate Bill this weekend. The cable and power bills were in his name before he left. I thought I had taken all necessary measures to switch the names on the bills and make sure they came to me, but apparently they were still getting forwarded to Bill down in New York. Embracing the irrational and the accidental, Bill cancelled the cable, then called me; he also managed to throw out the power bill. I figure he will be here sometime Wednesday afternoon to set my apartment on fire and shove gum in my door lock. He means well. I'll just keep telling myself that as I bump into things in the dark.  Today could be, hopefully, the last physical therapy appointment. I'm still an inflexible pile of granite, but I'm much better than I was before. Judas seems to work, I'll just never be a half-marathoner or what not. Not much more to that than dealing and thinking about triathalons. Of course I swim like a manatee: a slow paddle with a "run me over with a boat" look on my face. Regardless, I hope this is the last day, it's tough to get out to Quincy without a car.  I'm still looking for a blog layout that makes me happy. I'm trying to cut my teeth on HTML and CSS coding, as well as stealing code from others and manipulating it as I see fit. This is the curse of the graphic designer. Fix it until it looks right. I was working on a project Friday and was almost done. Then I finished 2 hours later after running through an entirely new batch of designs. I think I found the perfect fit for my vaguely O.C.D.-ish complex.  Still more congratulations go out to my best bud, Brandon. He completed the final round of testing for the FBI and is  in.  He just needs to put the application in and training and what not will start sometime soon. Rock on Bubs.  My life has been picking up some serious speed lately. Things are moving and shaking, but not quite ready to be posted. An adventure is unfolding and ambiguity is the first ten steps. It's why I've been so tired and put up only snack-size posts. It's coming around though, it is coming around.  Good luck on your first day of work Mike. Try not to eat the lab samples. Rumor has it they frown upon that kind of thing.  (A.P.T. 10:28 a.m.)

       But Wait, There's More...   So the last 3 posts could probably be condensed into my usual writing length. I've either been running around or too tired to actually get all my thoughts onto the web in one sitting.   I hope everybody remembered to wish their dad a Happy Father's Day. I called mine yesterday and we chatted for a little bit. If I had money I'd get him something nice, considering he's been the buffer between me and my mother for a number of years. I get along with my mom fine, but the times we don't, he's stepped in and kept me from losing my shit and making that situation much worse.  Also, Saturday June 19 marked the 23rd birthday of the venerable Kathryn Swiatek. This woman has been one of my closest friends for over a decade now and I have never been happier to have her presence in my life. She is the toughest person I know and have better had an awesome weekend or there's gonna be some ass-kicking. We're going to her friend's wedding July 2nd, so if the appropriate awesomeness of the birthday weekend has not been achieved, then God help the wedding party. Those things are usually open bar, right?  Maybe it's time to put some clothes on and start this week up.  (A.P.T. 11:33 a.m.)

       ~Fin~   I'm toast; slightly burnt, lightly buttered, but too tired to jam. I went for a 40 minute run today and I'm feeling it. My legs are burnt, my knees are on the verge of revolt and I am gonna hit the pillow with a solid right hook to the body sound. Good times. Good times.  For the record, I dropped my own, dear brother from my links because it seems he's too cool to update. When he decides to come down and hang with the masses I'll put him back into the side.  I suddenly got productive at 8:19pm last night. I started by doing some much needed laundry and then proceded to clean the bathroom. Kim played it safe, chilled on the couch, and watched me run around the apartment exercising neuroses; though she did manage to finish her pint of double standard.   After all was said, done, and clean we joined Lisa M. and some of her friends over at the Squealing Pig for a couple drinks. We met some new people, told some stories and came upon the realization that Lisa is a table-hitting racist. Apparently, I hit the table too hard trying to emphasize a point and she was quick to give me a hard time. But when her friend hit the table with  both hands,  she didn't seem to notice or mind. I know what's up now.  Recent outlook on life: Regardless, I will not stop and ask for directions.  I'm beat and don't feel like typing anymore.  (A.P.T. 12:41 a.m.)

       Double Stop   Six months and a chunk ago, this mess vaporized at the guilty Catholic url, actofcontrition.blogspot.com. Never one to leave well enough alone, I thought it was a nice time to visually revise the graphical content of this, this stuttering rant. As a designer you're always looking for feedback, so I ask you to tell me if it's any harder or easier to read with the new pristine color scheme. If enough of you find it harder to read with the black background and white text, I'll go back to the drawing board and find some sort of visual middle ground for the all of us.  We've barely ventured into this weekend and I've already beat the girlfriend with package of socks. They were 100% cotton; she'll be okay.  I spent most of the time changing the visual elements, so content for today is slim. I'll be sure to update on more fashionable beatings and everything else according to me.

       Worn with Pride   Today was kind of whack-assed. I stayed up until 4am last night helping the students in Time-based Design finish their projects that were due today. I didn't make it to class until 9:30am; about an hour and a half late. I acquired about 4.5 hours of sleep and nomrally that would be enough for me, but I think I used up most of my nine lives during my 5 year multi-major battle. With the shower running, I was sitting on the edge of the toilet with my head in my hands flat out exhausted. I felt like a shell, barely half there. Suffice to say as soon as class was finished, I got home and laid down for about 5 hours.  I woke up around 4:30; rested but sporting a nice headache and some neck pain. No idea why. Maybe I should stop sleeping in the cripser drawer of the fridge.  I've been trying to get myself to work on song-writing for about 30 minutes a day. I can write music no problem, I've got hours and hours of music I've written on acoustic and electric guitar. I am having a hard time writing song lyrics though. This is ironically humorous to me since I write prose all the time and have gone to several open mics in Cambridge to read what I've written. It all starts to unravel when I try to put any sort of melody behind what I write since I seem to have a subsonic vocal range and have a lot of work to do to stretch that range out. I've reached a point where it doesn't matter much, I just need to do it and refine it. And refine that. Then refine what's been finely refined. I definitely have enough material, I just need to close in on some concepts. This should be good.  To finish this evening. I'm pissed. Pissed for being pissed. There's nothing I can do about it and I can't forget about it either. Whatever. Swear to some higher being, I could use one of those neural thingies from the movie Men in Black right about now. Maybe I'm just overtired.   Makes sense in a very matter of fact way:   JimCJ5:  i'm older than i've ever been and now i'm even older.   The finishing move of fringe-lunacy:   jumpmanjr79:  i like your burger.  jumpmanjr79:  it tells me things.   Spilled coffee.  (A.P.T. 12:36 a.m.)

       Submerged Fruit   First off, Spongebob Squarepants the movie hits theaters in November. I will most likely be taking a day off from work to see this brilliantly creative piece of work. As if that wasn't the best news of the week, along comes real life items!  Bubs, best friend and avid bowler, is going to be an uncle. Hot damn! His older sister and brother in-law got one on the way, which led to this flurry of text messaging:   not me:  Guess who is going to be an uncle.  me:  Whoa. No fucking way.  not me:  Yes way. Just found out.  me:  Congratulations.  not me:  I just punched Jay (brother in-law).  me:  Ha. That's going in the blog.  As if that wasn't enough to keep Bubs busy, he also got word that the FBI wants him to go down to Alexandria Virginia and do a final round of testing to see if they want to hire him as an agent. This will be a nice change from being an overpriced babysitter at his current place of employment.  But wait, there's more! I love exclamation points!   Aaaaaand, S. Kevin Longo, longtime friend, occasional nuisance, has secured a job with Entertainment Weekly. Holy carnivorous bicycles! Rock on Kevin. He is not doing layout directly for the magazine, but he will be a primary designer for any and all of the work they need for the EW after-parties they throw. You lucky, lucky bastard. That's okay, I'm successfully unemployed. Eat it.  On a less than happy note, Ralph Wiley, writer for ESPN's Page 2 passed away suddenly today. He was only 52 and a brilliant writer who brought more than just a sports angle to his writing. His writings will be missed.  On a stupid note, I managed to accidentally flick some toothpaste in my eye last night. Let me tell you how much a particle of Crest Whitening can burn. For several moments I was quite confident that my eye was liquifying. This led to the was flailing around my bathroom while flinging water into my eye. [Dear Jesus, you have an odd sense of humor. Your Disciple, New Lack of Depth Perception]. I'm still alive, my sight's fine, and I have a refreshing white glow around my left iris. I know you were all terribly worried.  I feel like I've got a lot of justice to deal out. I'm just not sure how or when.  (A.P.T. 10:06 p.m.)

       Phase II   Apparently  solipsism inc.  gets around like your mom and a roll of quarters. Slowly working its way up and down the coast, we have confirmation that  solipsism inc.  has landed in Florida. Welcome aboard you oversized, geriatric peninsula. Next up: monochromatic uniforms.  Once again I have failed to run on Sunday. I've been trying for several weeks to add a third run to my week as to settle into a more balanced running schedule. I came close, real close today. I was planning on running after helping my friend Lisa move some furniture. This seemingly easy task turned into a 3-plus hour excursion of trying to find our way to some obscure part of Somerville, working with oversized, fancy particleboard-based desk and a non-oversized Saturn.  Lisa, usually one of the well-prepared, pulled some half-assed map off of Yahoo maps. I have said this once before: use  urlLink Rand McNally,  they make maps for a living. They are a map compnay.  They have a store in Boston.  I will start disowning you one by one if you insist on mediocre directions.  Among other things this weekend, I lost the batmobile. Jonboy has taken it from me since he actually has a job for the summer. The words coming out of his mouth said something like, "I'm going to put a new stereo in." That's cool. The function button on the present one is broken, but it will still work with a little finagling. Apparently he is going to consult with the brain trust of Taylor "I'm the drunk kid you want to punch." Gibson and "Frat" Matt Raby (still available ladies). If you do decide to replace my beloved 4 channel x 35W Clarion, be sure to replace it with  a detachable-face radio.  The only thing worth stealing in that car is the stereo, and the gum I sometimes leave in the glove compartment. Now if this radio is purchased, and you park in a less than reputable neighborhood, remove the damn stereo face Jon, and take it with you. Having the detachable-face radio is no good if you do not do your part and take the thing with you when you park in shady places. If they take the car, fine. At least enjoy the moral victory of having the stereo face in hand. We'll frame it and mount it based purely on principle.   In other news, the girlfriend visited this weekend. While attractive and demure, she did manage to miss:  1. The man dressed in woman's clothing  in church.  2. The twenty-something with his cheek pierced, and ear lobes stretched at least an inch. (Hole in face though, wtf?) 3. The Berklee student get up from being hit by a car and walk away. (He wasn't mowed down or anything, but still...)  This prompts me to question how good the show is that's going on in her head. Maybe that's best left unanswered.  This weekend's music is brought to you by Switchfoot, Bayside, and Dave Matthews' solo effort. All you DMB fans out ther who don't like Some Devil need to get over yourselves and hunker down with this phenomenal effort. Plus the thing is well-designed. Make like white on rice. Go.  By the by, I'm rooting for the Pistons in the NBA finals, who just went up 3 games to 1 on the Lakers. Larry Brown is a phenomenal coach who should get his what's due to him.   be a ship in a bottle, set sail.  (A.P.T. 12:18 p.m.)

       [Social] Life Preserver   After a significant day of traveling, I came home about 7:30pm to a social vaccum for Friday evening. I was a little tired, but was hoping to go out and do a little something on this fairly temperate night. I checked my digital message board to find the Minister of Fun [Zach Mangan] had inquired to my whereabouts. I gave him a call and found that he was on his way to the Lynnwood Grill with Mr. Scotty Don't and Erica. I was hungry and this sounded right up my alley so I traversed across the Fens and met the trio for dinner and drinks.  I don't think I could have had a more on the money night. Dinner and drinks led to ice cream and a field trip to Castle Island. We ran around like idiots and finished the night off by getting lost somewhere out in Meford or Malden... somewhere out there, anyway. I went out, had fun, and I was in by midnight to get some sleep.   I've actually been productive today at work, up until this point. The girlfriend has come in for a visit and Jonboy is on his way to take my car back to Connecticut. Captain Atombomb finally got a job and now I lose my car for the summer. Not a total loss, but a nice comfort while I had it. I get it back in two months so I'll just bide my time.  Posts have been in short supply lately, I'll try to pick up over the next few weeks. I've always got something to say, sometimes I just don't have the time or freedom of anonymity to write it.  (A.P.T. 3:52 p.m.)

       Vicious Syndication   I did a lot of running around yesterday. When I arrived, home I flipped on the TV for some Adult Swim but soon decided it was time to crash. I was lying in bed just starting to fall asleep, when I had an  utter fucking meltdown.  My brain went haywire. Suddenly all these things I thought I had in check were suddenly raging out of control. Nomrally I can bypass this, realize it's 1:37a.m., know that it's nothing that can be fixed at this moment, relax, and figure it out when I get up. My think-tank had returned the receipt on that product of thinking and was going to worry about all these things until something gave way to exhaustion.  1:37a.m.         2:23a.m.      3:40a.m. (Debating if I could call in a U.N. peace-keeping force to put a rubber bullet to my cranium.)     5:37a.m.    7:10a.m.   7:13a.m.  7:26a.m.  Time to TA my Time-Based Design class. I get up and realize I'm trapped in Edward Norton's universe circa  Fight Club.  Tired, but don't want to nap; awake, but I can't really function. A joyous time.   During the latter half of class I go use the bathroom and come back to everyone freaking out. Apparently there was some miscommunication between the teacher and the students. He's a new instructor and they have troulbe understanding what he wants. He wasn't particuarly clear and there was another piece to the assignment that they didn't know about. Instead of being rational, I hear things like, "What is with this guy? I can't stand him." Which is a really good way to go about it and get things done. Why bother trying to get on the same page when you can throw your hands up in the air and stamp your feet? So at 10:50a.m. I stood on a desk and put the mutinous squad back into some sort of line. A little bit of "Shut up and do it," and some "I'm here to help just ask for it," seemed to get most of the ruffled feathers back in line. I bleed for these kids. I mean it. I was switching some hardware out for one student and slit my wrist on the metal carriage of the Mac under the desk.   Now I'm trying to figure out if I want to go running or take a nap. Just as long as I don't drop narcolepsy style at a major intersection.  I still don't have anything figured out.  (A.P.T. 12:32 p.m.)

       Tempermentally Yours   Hm, I'm a little perturbed. I've got a bunch of paperwork and bills to work with. Nothing particularly new, other than it's all in my name since Bill left and I've got to rearrange some present cable plans and such. I do not need 157 channels of HBO. I most certainly do not need Oprah's oxygen network, though I fear I cannot get rid of it.  My PC is rotting from the inside. The video card is imploding on itself and making my screen contrast in different places. It's a Gateway and it's 5 years old, making it way, waaaaaaaaaay past its presumed lifespan. I'm hoping to pick up a friend's used Mac. Does anybody understand how good OS X is? I still like PC's, but I'll take what I can get before I have moo-cow soup with the current home-computing setup.  I couldn't get the router to work today so I hit the reset button on the back of the box. Apparently the reset button also works as a cyanide tablet. I hit the button and it never came back. No lights, no functioning LCD at all; I put the deathblow on it. I am running directly out of the cable modem, which is fine for the moment, but the new roommate will eventually want some internet connection of his own. So I get to drop $50 or so on a new one. Awesome. Piece of junk couldn't last 3 more months?  The new roommate is a pleasantly mannered gentleman from the Albany area. This should work out fine. If not, I still have the ice cream scoop and box of sandwich bags.  (A.P.T. 1:32 a.m.)

       Upgrade   So I purchased a new computer. Just the tower, I've already got a monitor that works. I just needed a simple home PC, of course that means deleting all sorts of useless shit that comes with Microsoft XP Home Edition. I spent more time deleting crap I didn't need than setting up and transferring files from the old holding tank to the new one.  Along with this new personal computer comes thanks to the parental units for helping out and the official code red for lack of monetary funds. I'm heading towards the poor side of town on an express bus, but at least I've got smaller, faster pc to show for it.  I'm still fiddling with the drivers for the monitor and should have gone to bed at least an hour ago. Team Fatass needs to go to the gym tomorrow as well. Sheet.  Coming soon:  Music reviews: With special rant artist Jeff "Tater Salad" McKay.  Can he bring the "ruckus?"   Intrigue:  JimCJ5:  she's playing with fire.  Who raises the Irishman's ire?   Love:  querynine  you are the best.  Can it follow a five-year plan?   Pain: I've been biting my tongue like nobody's business.  Will this weenie cave?   And the crippling fear of hygine:  querynine:  ack! bathtub!  What is she hiding?   Stay tuned as the world turns and I try to make really big waves in my little bathtub.

       Drilled Bits   I'm tired and figured I'd just throw down the random thoughts that have been popping into my oversized skull during the last few days.  I'm thinking I might try to convince my parents to split a new hard drive with me, I can hear my Gateway weezing at night.  I need to start taking vitamins.  You reach a point where you get tired of chalking up a friend's being lame as "Well that's just them being them." No that's them being lame. Stop it.  I have to say all the security with the DNC makes me aware that something  can  happen. I'm still going to roam my city regardless, just more aware.  Gabe moved in today; things just got a little more cramped. Welcome to my humble abode Gomez.  I think my knees are a front for my impending bad back.  Sharp pains in my head have returned. They make me a little wary and will be mentioned upon seeing a doctor at the end of next month.  I heard some kid make the dumbest statement today a girl, "Of course you're a Republican, your parents pay for everything." Regardless of party affiliation, I'm pretty sure he's enrolled at the same private institution she is and I'm pretty sure he's not paying all $35,000 out of his own pocket either.  Jens is the funniest Swede I know. Maybe someday the Norse gods will reward him with the ability to grow facial hair.  Life never gives you exactly what you want, but you never have to settle.  I need to get me some of that Zach Mangan "Take it or Leave it" Backbone. I hear side effects include severe car audio addiction... I can handle that.  When spelling errs, make your own culture:   jumpmanjr79:  you psanish man you.  the mighty m5:  psanish eh?  jumpmanjr79:  like spanish, but oilier.  jumpmanjr79:  and taller.  the mighty m5:  damn psanish.  jumpmanjr79:  Psain doesn't have a king, more like a buncha guys who decree thigns by saying "that feels good" or "that hurts my (blank)."  Wooding/Mangan 2008:   emCsilence:  i think we should run 4 years from now on the platform of a porsche in every driveway and a hot babe in every bedroom. we can make it work cause we can import women from eastern europe and other poor countries with smoking hot women. it would be great. we get hot foreign women and they get to live outside of poverty. we can have a whole interview process and everything.  the mighty m5:  brilliant!  emCsilence:  i think so.  Lori, shoot me an IM. I'd like to catch up to you sometime at the Pig.

       Grass Roots Movement    I shot back to the 'Cut this weekend to catch up with some people I hadn't seen in 5 years. It was good to be back more so than usual. As little as there can be in Connecticut, I did grow up there and spent many a summer biking, swimming, and enjoying all those sunny days. Though I have no intention of returning on a permanent basis until at least 30.   Before I got back to CT, I hit a house party Friday night with my friends Nate and Chris off at the end of the diving board of Huntington Ave. Offending by not offending, I got into the party and was damn near suffocated by a lot people trying way too hard. I felt like I was the official sponsor of "the man" dressed in my shorts, polo shirt, and name brand sneakers. Regardless of sticking out by not sticking out, it was a fun time and I met a girl named "Jules" (nee: Julie), which brings us to this sidebar brought to you by Jeff McKay:    What kind of home life is it where the people named you either:  A) a nickname already  B) a plural noun form  C) a measurement of energy    Hm...   Regardless of the taken nomenclature she was nice to talk to and kind enough to accidentally drop her beer onto my shorts and everything else that followed below. I just shrugged and was lucky dry off pretty quickly given the inferno-like temperature of the party. She got my number and I shuffled off home having looked like I contracted Malaria from aformentioned inferno-like party.   Satruday morning I joined Ms. Curtis and her rogue group of elite soldiers in the fight against boredom and did some kayaking down the Farmington River. Though it was cloudy and I was shaking off "3-hour bus ride" residual, it was a really nice trip down the 5 miles of river we fought tooth and nail (read: cruised comfortably) and ended up having a pseudo race at the end. [Craig, if you ever happen across this post, I want a clean shot at you. No more of your significant other holding up your sorry behind.]   I touched base at home, caught some dinner with my family and circled the wagons to head off to a psuedo reunion. My friend Christy had put together a reunion for the all girls Catholic school and asked me if I wanted to come along (I having been to an all boys Catholic school.  Gasp. What? That explains so much...   Details another time.) I had no idea how this was going to turn out so I called on fellow A.B.C.S graduate DJ Jazzy Jeff Miazga and we played the "I'll go if you'll go game." So we suited up and rolled out.   It turned out to be a pretty good time at Harbor Park in Middletown, CT. Points lost for Guiness being served in a plastic cup (no fucking couth), but a lot of the girls there were ones I knew and hadn't seen in a long time. Both my prom dates were there and I ended up chatting with one for most of the evening with Jeff. Other interesting notes include one girl who I've known since freshman year still remains one of the hottest girls I have ever known. Get a pedestal out, put her on it, take 3 steps back, wrap your hand against your chin like you're smart and  admire .   A rasberry goes out to one known individual of that evening and the many unknown who got in their car and drove home way past the legal limit. What the fuck are you thinking? Take a look around at your friends, you know who they are. If you won't miss them when they're gone, then skip on down to the next paragraph. Wise up fuckers. Nobody's perfect, but dish the keys or get a ride.   All and all, it was a good night, and like all good nights they end at some greasy diner. Glad I could roll with those guys, numbers were exchanged, hope we actually call each other.   I finally caught the Bourne Supremacy (missed it Friday) with Bubs and a couple of free passes (see: Jeff McKay rules) on Sunday. Good flick; highly recommended. Then I hung out at Bubs' apartment and watched Red Sox actually play like they cared. I'm still fairly confident the Yankess will take the East; damn I love baseball.   Now I'm off to finally finish that class I've been talking about for months now and avoid most of the city now that the DNC has invaded for the week.    Music of the Moment:   Bayside  Sirens and Condolences:  I am officially the last kid on the emo bus, but for some reason nobody seems to know about these guys. The CD is phenomenal, melodic and rocking. The singer's voice is a little different than what I've heard from this genre. The lyrics are amazing, but if you post them anywhere your friends will be very concerned about your mental health. Bottomline: A, go get it. Now.   Single for the week:   Alterbridge - Open your Eyes: Creed, Part Deux. All the original memebers minus Captain Ego Pants. New singer with all the vocals and none of the ego. You might even forgive them for past transgressions like, "Arms Wide Open." Rawk.

       urlLink      How the West Was Won.   urlLink      Above you find out what happens when you do some last minute shopping for a hastily thrown together party. Hey, if you're gonna look like an idiot, look like an idiot who knows what he's doing.   Since major life-changing annoucement I have been accordingly lazy. I am just trying to soak up my waning free time before I'm pulled into the "real world" and forced to finally live up to the monkier "adult."   I hit the beach yesterday with Mr. Stick Figure and we came close to spending almost as much time in the car as on the beach. I wanted to get far away from Boston and figured, if I left right after rush hour, we could make it to the National Seashore on Cape Cod in under 90 minutes. That positive thinking lasted about 15 minutes as we squandered half an hour with an accident taking up two lanes of 93 South. Once past the minor but splayed out accident, the sailing was smooth and the beach was quite nice. I put on sun screen in hopes of not having to fulfill the call ahead I made to the burn units of several local hospitals. We snoozed, conversed in the difficulties of hitting on girls at the beach with their family, and realized why Nate will never be a QB and I will never play WR as we threw a football back and forth.   Then at about 2:30pm some wierd ass/haze fog started to roll in and dropped the air temp by a very discernable number of degrees. At that point we decided to bail and grab some late lunch. After a 20 minute err in direction, Nate was ready to eat the door handles, but we got the to penultimate of greasy food joints on the Cape and proceded to knock 5 years off our tickers.   Fat and sassy, we cruised around the Cape for a bit then proceded back to home, city home. Later that evening I showered and threw on the nice sneakers (I'm like Mr. Rogers or something) and shuffled down to Tia's for my friend Linsey's birthday. Birthday wishes were wished and then I ended up on Boylston with Mr. Stick Figure yet again, doing a tour of several bars on the street.   I ended up drunk with tequila being the main suspect; don't worry teq, I still love you. I made it home in one piece and there was no booting of any sorts, but tequila + tomato sauce + trying to sleep made my stomach and angry sentinel of the night. Take  that  you vital organ you.   I need to finish my soup and shoot out to the movies. Rumor has it there are CT adventures this weekend. Tune in Monday to see if I left the state in one piece.

       Defining Moments of Existence     there's only so many chances  that you'll get to do something  that's this important   now i'd rather sink than swim   -Bayside     We talk. We talk a lot. Far more than we ever do anything. We spend our lives talking, about what we'd like to do, where we want to be, how we're unhappy where we are, or who we are with. How often do we really do something about the busted points in our lives? Beside moments of extreme duress, how often do we look around, take invoice and make a change?   Half-assed relationships, a job over a career; we flinch at the thought of pulling the trigger and starting new. Risk is tough. It's hard to step out of what you know and take a chance on something that could fail or not be as good as what you had.   I've always wanted to think of myself as someone who's ready to put the money down, take the risk, and get it done. I've reached a point where I know that I run my mouth; go ahead, call me out. I've always had this strange feeling that I'm operating on an abbreviated timline anyway. I understand and plan for the long haul, but there's a sense of urgency to how I live. I know nothing will ever be perfect; that self-doubt and being unhappy come and go with the ebb and flow.   The thing for me is that if there is something I can change or do to get me to a better place, to accomplish a goal, or take me someplace new, I need to do it. Knowing full well I will roll snake eyes from time to time, I'd rather be out there putting my junk on the chopping block, than wondering "what if" as I shoot crumpled balls of paper across my cubicle.  I say all this because I'm taking the biggest risk in my life as we speak. Along with my two associates, James and Amie, we are starting a business.   I'm not talking about intangible ideas or some scribbles on paper; I'm talking about a website, business cards, incoproation, market research, trademarks being made, and property being bought. We know there's a draft in here, because that's our junk on the chopping block. It's happening, it's been happening since May when James and I started shooting ideas at each other.    It's on.    We're an integrated media company and we're launching in 4-6 weeks. This is it. I understand the risk, but I'm only setting sights for success.   I also understand that I am priveliged and lucky to be able to do this. I have two parents who worked extremely hard to pay for my college education. Now I'm about to take the 6 figures they just spent and head for the high stakes Black Jack. I spent 5 years in college busting my ass; I'm hungry, delusional, and it's time to get to work.   I'll post the link when the website is finished.   A new phase in life, and a new blog template, time to wipe the board clean and put some fresh writing on these walls.

       Hodge Podge    Monday decided to go full out with a cloudy, overcast day covering my dear city in a muggy, wool-like blanket. Big post coming in the next day or two, I figured I'd clean some house and cleanse the palate so that it comes with the punch I hope it has.   Did some more design work for the laura glyda  urlLink band.  Do yourself a favor and be one of the cool kids to get to know them before they blow up.    Various collected moments of love and brilliance:    Realization that Bubs (of all people) and the mJc ran the beer pong table for at least 8 games:    JimCJ5:  man, first i find out that there are, in fact, no radioactive monsters or giant robots in japan.   JimCJ5:  now this.   Thoughts on the consumption of the raw liver of some large, angry-angling fish:    JimCJ5:  good old fashioned nightmare fuel, man.   It's all supply and demand:    querynine:  i always love you, but sometimes i love you more than others.   Also during business hours, there was some chat of practicality versus passion resolving little but what we take to our graves and a sizeable number of BBQ-ed wings were consumed. This will guarantee a fun Tuesday morning.   File under: You got served   Today I was given a stern talking to, told what's up, bitched out, whatever you want to call it on Instant Messenger (jewel of our generation). After being told what my deal was, I was then "blocked," thereby defaulting the last word to said plantiff.   At times the hard part about the blog is the ability for it to become an acerbic forum to openly set fire to various individuals and turn situations into a tit for tat foodfight. The beauty of the digital transfer of language is the save, copy, and paste function. I will walk a fine line and attempt to tactfully handle this matter. I don't know if this is what you want plantiff, but you thought about that when you let loose on me, right?   I am sorry for the hurt I've put on the third party in question. At no point in time have I decided to thump my chest for actions that have occurred recently, though I understand there is an amount of anger and culpability that are the consequences of my actions.   Unfortunately, plantiff, you did not seem to be concerned about having an open dialogue at any time during today's "conversation." You resorted to name-calling, "expert" assumptions, and had made up your mind, regardless of any defense I might have given you.   In conclusion, you overstepped your bounds, made a joke of dealing with cancer, and did nothing to help remedy an already delicate situation. I hope you feel better having satisfied any personal vendettas. After some deep thought, I have decided to remain a "snobbish prick" and wish you the best on your future endeavors.   -defendant    It's an oddly quiet night on the street where I live. A stillness I have rarely seen.

       Enlighten the Grasshopper   The Minister of Fun. The Sundance Kid. Z-Money Mags.  Mr. Zach Mangan.  As of several days ago, Mr. Mangan has been released back into the wild ending a 4-year stint on the Injured Reserve. He has asked me to help him get back into the swing of the single scene and make an eventual return to the dating game, once he completes the requisite paperwork and some deep mediation. I, who recently eschewed yet another steady relationship, whole-heartedly agreed to help the man who once dumped me face first onto a cobbled brick sidewalk.  Upon first thought I didn't think I should be the one doling out advice, given that I tend to gravitate towards steady relationships. Through further inspection, I think I've been turning a blind eye to my subconcious. In review of my track record, I've turned into a certifiable, danger! moving parts, do not operate under fatigue, heart-breaking machine. Maybe the dating scene is the shallow end of the pool I should be wading in until I figure out what I want.  After getting smacked around and causing my own fair share of damage, it's time to slap on the cross trainers and get in this game. I need a little sociological challenge. I'm already on my way to infuriating an entire gender, why half-ass it?   Cue introduction and a little violin pleaaaaaaaaaaase.   "Ladies. How are you?"   Sundance, let me know when you're all done transcendental-ing. We'll go leisure suit shopping.

       Swatting Zee Stride    I ran a 5 mile race, what the fuck did you do today?   I figured if I'm gonna blog about it, I might as well follow through and actually do said scenario. I did the Jim Kane Sugar Bowl 5 Miler. It's a run to Castle Island and back. Blatantly ignoring my physical therapist's advice, I decided to take Judas for a romp and see what I could actaully do.   I clocked in unofficially at 44:04. I took 22:32 on the front 2.5 and cut off a small chunk of time to do 21:31 on the return; just under a 9 minute mile. I was hoping to clock in closer to 40 minutes, but I'll deal with it and live down the fact that your grandmother probably passed me at some point. I got a free massage right after crossing the finish in hopes of not having some frisky lower back pain tomorrow and after that, I stretched and prayed I'd be able to walk. I'm thinking it's gonna be okay, and I shall keep my milage to a minimum for the next week or so. The only thing that really seems to be off is that my intestines feel as if they are in utter disarray.   Ow.     It seems like blogger has updated their posting device, I might actually be able to have the correct time read at the bottom finally.   Tune in next time for  "The Return of Z-Money Mags; Lessons in Being Single."    Pow. I'm going to bed.    Assistance always welcome:   jumpmanjr79:  evil?   jumpmanjr79:  need lessons?   jumpmanjr79:  or a witty sidekick?

JimCJ5:  i worked up until the day before i left.   JimCJ5:  then i moved.   JimCJ5:  then i got drunk.   JimCJ5:  then i packed.   JimCJ5:  then i flew to the opposite end of the world.   JimCJ5:  not an excuse.   JimCJ5:  just an anatomy of poor planning.   JimCJ5:  anyhow, japan is good.   JimCJ5:  more to follow...   And let's not forget Kojak:    Skiracer9x:  do you want to kill yourself?   Skiracer9x:  i've got an especially dull spoon you could use.   Skiracer9x:  it might require some mashing and scraping to break the skin, but itll get the job done.   Skiracer9x:  (that my friend, is worth a post.)   I need a belt for all these tools.   Going to MacWorld tomorrow. Whoa ladies, easy now. We all know you want a hot piece of this MacWorld Action, but I've only got one ticket. Sorry.   (A.P.T. 12:52 a.m.)

       The Inherent Dangers of Free-lance Design    GyroVibo:  thanks dood.  flexibledecimal:  sorry bout that bud.  flexibledecimal:  pic came in larger than i expected before.  flexibledecimal:  my bad.  flexibledecimal:  and such.  GyroVibo:  no worries.  GyroVibo:  just dont let it happen again or i will come to your house and i will cut you.  flexibledecimal:  awesome.  GyroVibo:  i thought so.  You too can enjoy the thrills of doing design and threats to your very being. Come join us, the few, the font-fixated, graphic designers.  So today was a paperwork day, sifting, shredding and shuddering at what was due and overdue. The cable fiasco, part deux, sent me Bill's final invoice, where I was charged a whopping $326 and some change. It was also due on July 9th, maybe I should start opening these things when I get them... hm... nah.  I made my umpteenth phonecall to RCN; I just wanted to figure out what was running the bill that high. So after some discussion I came out of the phonecall with a $15 credit and  I have no idea why.  Why mess with what you can't understand. Well exceptions to women and religion, but I shall leave the cable bill be.  I think I might add comments to the blog. I've been wary as to what sort of mess I might be getting myself into, but at the same time I'm curious what you the consumer have to say.  I'm trapped down on the farm until 9:30pm. To kill some time I'm now going to go outside and read my book. Yes, that's right, I'm actually reading a book for fun. It's been about 7 years since I did that, I'm a visual guy, cut me some slack. It's called the House of Leaves and it's pretty good so far, I'll start a page tally to keep my ass going.  Proving I'm literate: pg. 26  (A.P.T. 6:51 p.m.)

       Standing KO   I had to strip down to my boxers before I could get this one started. It sounds like I'm serious or something close to, but I'm wearing my Halloween pumpkin boxers, so maybe not.  The title of this blog comes from the idea that the self is the only thing that can be known and verified. I only know me, therefore I can only verify me. It's just a small idea in the greater annuls of multiple philosphies I try to apply to my existence. This entire concept was blown to bits Friday given that  something  had to be out there to ram me up the ass the long way with the incredibly irritating small things in life. It's not the little things that kill, they maim and poke; killing would be too easy.  I was in Connecticut for a doctor's appointment for late Friday afternoon and the trip from Boston to Southington wasn't bad. I got my blood test done and I even visited my friend Darren who's had a long, rough and tumble summer recovering from sugery and a complication or two. After that I had to head to Waterbury to get to my 4:30 doctor's appointment. The problem was the entire state of Connecticut was going in the same direction, compounded by construction and compounded by everybody trying to take the backroads at the same time. I should have just walked. Really, I kid you not. I fought traffic all the way there and traffic all the way back. Insanely frustrating.  On my way home I stopped at a little cottage we have on a lake in Wolcott to try and get some perspective and not cause a severe accident. I arrived and my cousin and aunt were out there. That was fine until the golden retriever puppy/not quite adult dog came out from the water and decided that jumping on me and the only clean clothes I had was the most awesome idea a golden retriever puppy/not quite adult dog could ever have. Truly, never a better idea had been had until that point.  I'm not quite sure where wanting to boot a golden retriever puts me on the list to eternal damnation, but I have a feeling it's slightly above beating up old people, but below having a van and some candy. At no point did I actually try to harm the dog, I just thought about it more than I was breathing on the way home.  Given my template for an awesome mood, I was more than a swell child at dinner. For once I was sarcastic with my mother and she didn't deserve it. [Bad kid alert, get the van and the candy.] Keeping me from a good mood was the fact that I had to take a bus back to Boston, though I did manage to wash and dry the shorts before departure.   [Sidenote: I'm having some monster deja vu.]  The bus was one step beyond fiasco, uber-fiasco you might say. The 8:15pm bus to Boston didn't exist, even though the website said it did, so I sat with my parents until 9pm for the 9:15pm bus. I get on, they take off, and then I'm told the bus won't be leaving for at least a half an hour due to the New York buses being stuck in traffic. Sweet, sanitary Moses, just please get me to Boston. We finally leave at 9:50pm and we have the slowest driver  ever.  We passed one vehicle the entire way. We were passed by another Peter Pan bus (Isn't that a slap in the face? What are the unwritten bus driver rules?); it felt like we were going backwards. I sat there debating if I should claw at my own face or chew on the double A batteries in my CD player and see what happens. It was the most ridiculous combination of stupid things in life that really shouldn't matter but will not be ignored when grouped together in short bursts of time.  I finally,  finally  got off the bus at South Station. All I wanted was a drink. Get me some alcohol or I will start taking hostages. I found a cab, avoiding the last T song and dance, and hauled butt to Boylston. I got out at Dalton/Boylston and called the one man who comes through more often than double quilted toilet paper, Zach Mangan,  Minister of Fun.  He was at the Pour House, praise Jeebus. I had my backpack and cross trainers dangling from said backpack and entered the beautiful house of booze. I ranted (really?) and downed beer faster than I ever had. I don't know how alcohol can't fix everything, because it kept me from a monumental meltdown. Many thanks to Scotty, Erica, Jim, and Zach for hanging with yours truly and putting up with my frayed ass.  Tonight was a little more sane. I gave the Minister of Fun another call and we decided to head over to Big Hank's BBQ in Cambridge. Mr. Coughlin came along and it was very nice to hang with Mikey. He's such a nice friend. Well, he's a total ass and that's really why we hang. We had some under-cooked meet and Pabst Blue Ribbon, truly a fine and blessed meal.  Lately I've been called many a name. Among other things, I was called a cad tonight. Time was actually taken to dial my number up and let me know of this new nomenclature; from left field no less. So it goes. Then I stroked my long, handlebar mustache calculating my next nefarious move. Mwah-hahahahahaha... anyway.  I'm hoping to go to the beach tomorrow and continue my ever-expanding campaign to ruin lives in various and sordid ways.  Jimbo, you're an ass for not calling me before you left for Japan. Ass.  Shootaround is almost over, finish up.   Now if you'll excuse me, I have golden retrievers to boot for personal amusement.  (A.P.T. 1:57 a.m.)

       Cable Fiasco: The Almost Final Chapter   I woke my butt up just before 8am today just to move myself to the living room and flop on the couch for 2 hours and 39 minutes. The goal of this exercise was to be close enough to the door to hear the cable guy knock and get all this stupid utility crap settled. I wallowed around on the thermonuclear couch half-asleep, half-awake, inducing some really awkward neck pain that decided it would hang out for most of the day.   But the man did come, flip a couple switches, and my internet is back; though I think the TV Bill left me is now broken. We shall now take a moment to observe...   Bill's Good Intentions, Poor Follow Through:   -cancelled cable -threw away power bill -left me a tv that has had an untimely death  Oh well. [real shrugging action]  I went for an absolutely awesome run last night. It was beautiful out, the temperature was just right and my knee is still attached. I even pushed the pace on the second half. Now obviously with all this positive reaction from my body,  I should go run a 5 mile race.  That's right folks, laughing in the face of conventional wisdom and hoping my mom doesn't drop my sorry ass from the medical plan, I'm going to enter a 5 mile race to Castle Island July 15th and Sweet Lord Baby Jesus, I hope I come through in one piece. I will be stretching fanatically between now and next Thursday and will be looking for the finest in prosthetic legs given that Judas bails and never comes back.  I've almost got this damn blog template right where I want it.  Almost.   So about a week ago I tried way too hard to be introspective (all the cool kids were doing it) and dug deep only to give post to some poorly abused material. Some of you even got to read it or parts of it, pending attention span. I took it down, a rarity that I don't leave something up, and I was amazed at how much thinking I could do without acutally thinking. I went on and on about what I've dragged out over and over, and it didn't do me much good. Though it did bring me to another avenue of thought. So instead of reckoning, or analyzing what really shouldn't matter anymore, I'm just gonna put it down and walk away.   Easier said than done you whiney little bitch!   I suppose. Many an argument could be made for my failure to ever really improve. We shall find out sooner than later. How much of my own hype can I truly consume? Lots, apparently.  I'm one rent check away from Poorsville. That sucks.  (A.P.T. 8:30 p.m.)

       The Static State of Dynamic   I forgot to mention the end; or is the beginning of the cable debacle, or am I in the midst?   Anyway.  I missed the cable guy and they finally shut off my cable which includes my cable internet. This means I'm not online for a few more days. They say they'll be coming Thursday between 8-11am, maybe I can finally get this done. I'm only going to be living there for another 6 weeks.  The joys of living in New England are perfectly summed up in this weekend. Beautiful sunny weather throughout the weekend, and then it looks like we turned into Scotland, complete with fog and misty rain on Monday. So cool.  I'm really glad to be back in town, for some reason I have a better schedule here than I do at home. I was up some ridicuously late times every night I was home. I wasn't even doing anything cool, it's Connecticut.  In running news, I've now done two runs without taping my knee. Things seem so far so good, but I'm still a little nervous and skeptical of Judas. I'm thinking I might take up Yoga once I get settled into my new place in September.  As ambiguosly mentioned before, big things are coming, and they are getting closer by the day. Maybe I'll finally start growing up a little bit by the time I meet everything head on.

       Box of Sharp Objects   Another late rising gave way to continued laziness. I mulled around the house and caught Speederman 2 with the illiterate Jeff McKay. After being throughly summer-blockbustered we took off for Wolcott to join my family for a 4th of July picnic on Lake Hitchcock. Taking a page out of my fat, American, capitalist-bastard book, Jeff and I hit for the BBQ cycle after some intense water-treading.  One hot-dog, two burgers, and a steak later Jeff and I contemplated the joy of the food chain and planted our over-stuffed butts in some chairs on the porch. I made some random comment towards my father about the nice $500 dollar watch from an ex-girlfriend and my mom shot back about how "I don't ask your father about any of his jewelery and he doesn't ask about all the things in my jewel box that he didn't get me..."   "...except for the diamond, I gave that back."    Holy mother what?!   Already delirious from the BBQ marathon, I was preparing to vacate the premises after such startling info, then she got on some topic on how Jeff (25) and I (23) had both used the same bassinet at our respective times of new born life. At this point in time Jeff and I rose and speedily vacated the lot after my parents proceded to warp reality. Thank you, please come again.  Apparently my mom has some answers i need question.  And how else do you wrap up the birthday of our country? With 3.5 hours of Mario Kart. Jeff, Brandon, and I swore our way through the game and called it a night. I finish this and head for bed. Tomorrow brings a much welcomed return to Beantown and work on a possible pitch.   Other news:   Welcome back Jonboy, update or perish.  Nice shot.  (A.P.T. 2:23 a.m.)

       Wedding Residual   So, it's Saturday 10:23pm and here I am sitting at home in Connecticut all because  Jeff McKay can't read.  We were supposed to go see Spiderman 2 tonight, but Jeff thought the movie stopped showing at 9pm and why wouldn't it? It's only a summer blockbuster. He missed the other, later times since they were not shown in chronological order, but that's cool Jeff. Sitting in my parents house late on a Saturday night is so much fun, I almost fell asleep. Much love to you Skinny JMc. Moving on...  I arrived at the Wooding stronghold at 5:20 something after tearing ass down 84, 91, and 691 trying to get home in time for the 5:30pm rehersal dinner. Kathryn's friend Jen was getting married and I was invited along. I threw my brother out of the car, made a quick change and the tore ass back up 84 towards Plainville. I got there at 5:50pm and was figuring on getting bitched out big time by Kathryn.  Nobody there.  Apparently, communication got crossed and I was supposed to be at the church for 5:30. Oops. I'm not part of the wedding party, I'm just the Maid of Honor's date, so it wasn't a big deal. I was early for dinner; it was at 6:30pm. I still got bitched at anyways and Kathryn made me promise that I would show up at the church 30 minutes early for the wedding. Fine.  Friday was a rough day but a good night. I threw on the suit and dressed the part. Before I went out the door I added the 2 disposable cameras Kathryn had left me which added 10lbs. to my jacket and made me feel nice and cool in the heat. [Read again for added sarcasm.] I got my butt to the church 30 minutes early only to stand around and stare at all the people I didn't know. Awkward and fun; let's do it again sometime. My friend Christie's mom and brother finally showed up and I had someone I knew to hang out with. After that we sat down and got ready to maritally rumble.  We waited for about 10 minutes and then the holy shindig took off. Everyone looked good and Jennifer, the bride looked amazing. Of course, if I were said bride, I damn well better look better than everyone else. You hear me? [Smashes glass storms off.]  After the wedding we hauled off to a beautiful place out in nigh-East Bejeezus. The hall had a lake view and the weather was beautiful, perfect for the pictures they took. More importantly the had an  open mother-trucking bar.    ...And the vodka and tonics flowed freely for all of the night, until they closed down at 11:30...  The food was very good and Kathryn made it through her speech without crying or slurring any words. I had an excellent time and was even bold enough to dance several times throughout the evening. Everybody was leaving and Kathryn and I sat down to wait for my brother to pick us up since we were drinking. Unfortunately my brother went to another similar place that was also in Wolcott. I didn't know Wolcott cornered the market on "reception halls over the water." So one by one, everyone left. Then all the employees left. Kathryn and I sat for a good 30 minutes as Jon tried to find his way to this place, which was not easy to find. At least we got to spend some quality time shooting the sheet in the parking lot, though the curb did a number on our butts after sitting so long.   Jonboy finally showed up and we made our way back home. We were about 5 minutes away from home when none other than Southington's finest threw on the red and blue's to pull us over. Apparently they felt that Jonboy had not come to a complete stop and ran his license and registration. It took them 10 minutes to figure out what they were going to do with him and he got away with a warning which he is in the process of framing. He has a long way to go before he catches up to my 4 pulled overs and 2 speeding ticekts, but I beleive in him. There was going to be a much longer suburban cop rant, but I just wanted to get home.  T'was a good night and I didn't get up until 1pm today. Now Team Fatass has to go eat everything in the house since he's got nothing else to do.  (A.P.T. 11:02 p.m.)

       You've Been Warned   James, Brandon, Mike and I will be gathering together tonight. The last time this happened:  Brandon ran around my apartment with his pants down.  Mike singlehandedly found the cure for rising problem of vehicular malnutrition (onion rings).  James and I decided Sharpie is a great medium and Mike's back is a great canvas when said parties are all drunk.  75% of are single. All of us are unstable. I smell a trip to the ER.

       Synopsisize   I've developed an eye twitch as of late, so this post is going to be short.  Kathryn had a BBQ this weekend. It was very nice and her new boy gets my approval. The drive down there is still mind-numbing though.  This week is full of the little things in life. Hopefully I can take their wiener-dog like annoyance.  I'm probably going to stay away from the blog this week, unless major events warrant otherwise. This eye twitch needs to go away.

       Week in Review   What happened this week? Where'd it go? I can't keep track of anything anymore. Though I do know Mr. James McLaughlin turned 23 on August 1st, joining the rest of us in prime-numberdom. For whatever reason Jimbo hates celebrating his birthday, so I'll just post about it instead.  The lovely Kathryn finally quit her soul-sucking job. She has left for a better position at Pfizer. Congratulations sweetie, luck, love and a whole lotta "you'll be most excellent" heading on out towards south-eastern CT.  I'm slowly learning what drives people to law school.   MSimz124:  yeah...  i figure there's no math on the LSAT, i'm in.  flexibledecimal:  so law school? last i knew you wanted to bust bones.  MSimz124:  yeah, you know, whatever.  i don't really care what i do. hell, i don't even know what i wanna do.  MSimz124:  i just figure that i'd do well in law school. why not go for it?  flexibledecimal:  you do love to argue.  MSimz124:  oh hell no, i will not ever, EVER, step foot in a courtroom.  flexibledecimal:  no?  MSimz124:  i'd just use my degree to leverage some sort of cushy white collar sort of job, where i am underworked and overpaid, probably pertaining very little to law, and more to... holding my ass.  MSimz124:  well, thats the preliminary plan anyway.  flexibledecimal:  damn. wish i had thought of that.  You think we kid, but Zach and I further plan our run for public office, and it all starts on the technological advancements of women's underwear:   Mr. Zach:  yeah especially now with padded, invisible ones, and all those ones that can lift and separate. i mean, at any given time you're running a 50-50 shot at letting out something less than advertised or removing a lode bearing structure.  Mr. Me:  i say we file a class action lawsuit.  Mr. Zach:  i think we should.  Mr. Zach:  although, we'd have to hear about girls complaining that they're shooting in the dark completely.  Mr. Zach:  my soultion to that is just make everyone wear ID cards while in singles situations.  Mr. Me:  lol.  Mr. Zach:  guys get penis size, diagrams if baldness runs in the family, job, salary and 3 most annoying traits on theirs.  Mr. Zach:  girls get actual breast size, number of guys slept with, 3 most annoying habits, a picture of what their mother looks like at 50, if any mental instabilities run in their family, and greatest sexual talent on theirs.  Mr. Zach:  it would make the whole thing a lot easier.  Mr. Zach:  i'm telling you we should run for office.  Mr. Zach:  you be the shining good looks human relations guy and i'll make the nasty policies behind closed doors.  Mr. Zach:  it would work wonderfully.  Mr. Zach:  we could organize a pageant and come up with our "duchess of hot."  Mr. Me:  awesome.  I'm telling you people, art and design are just a front, anyway.  Thanks again to T-Bone for letting me hang with her in Gloucester on Tuesday. I had a wonderful time hanging with you and Babs on the beach.  Noted this week: The girls playing intramural volleyball. Hmm...  I will now attempt a productive Friday.  Stand back.

       urlLink     Honk-Honk, Pompous Theory Coming Through  &nbsp; urlLink     Last time I was home my grandmother showed me a bunch of pictures she found while cleaning up around her house. I thought this one was pretty cool. I've got another one that I'm working on for a story. Sadly, the one of my grandmother and her bowling team didn't make it. Sorry ladies of the lanes.  I thought I'd wax the philosophical for a paragraph or two; it's lost a little luster and since it  is  convertible weather, why not get put a little elbow in for some shine?  The title of this blog is based on the idea that the self is the only thing that can be known or verified. It's a little extreme, but I like the vein of the idea (and the word just sounds so cool, soul-ip-siz-him, rad man).  In this tumble, tuck, and roll we call life, I've operated on the idea that I'm running my portion of the program. I was dropped into this section of the timeline and I'm the one making and breaking myself at different junctures. I've been told by cohorts that it's an illusion of control, that for them, there is a larger force pushing buttons bigger than I. I disagreeably concur.  I think that there is a higher power running the show (God, Yahweh, Allah, Ernest P. Worrell, etc.), but for the most part h.p. leaves us to our own devices and throws down a little divine intervention to keep it interesting. I don't think at any point during the flight said higher power has told us what movie we're going to watch, when we can move about the cabin, nor how many bags of roasted peanuts we can eat.  It's what life is for me. I have God to thank for putting me here, giving me this car for the ride. He makes himself known here and there, fiddling with the radio (very big NPR fan), sticking His head out the window, and what not, but I'm the one driving. At points of duress He'll throw out some suggestions, but I'm the one aiming this four-wheeled metaphor at brick walls and multi-colored horizons.  I just don't feel like or am unwilling to relent to the idea that things are pre-determined; that I move because it's part of an already choreographed routine. That is not to say I can control everything. Life is its own variable in this experiment. The times of free-fall, where I'm just tumbling and one decision only seems to steepen the ride down reminds me that I only have so much control. But, I believe when situations call for repsonse, I make the call, not someone with their hand up my butt talking for me.  Maybe that's why "everything happens for a reason" bothers me. I just feel like we aren't listening to ourselves, just shelving personal consequence. But what do I know?   Everything.  Bwah-hahahaha. [2:1 odds I get hit by a car for that one.]

       Music Review Showdown   This week we've got several entries and guest help from Jeff "Tater Salad" McKay. Let's kick this piece.  Taking Back Sunday,  Tell All Your Friends, Where You Want To Be   I figured I'd do a reivew of the old album since I was the last kid on the block to get it and give a new review as well. First off, "Tater Salad":   I've been not comparing the 2 TBS albums, because there's no point. The first one buries the second by a lot. But i rationalize it by saying the bands aren't the same, cuz that one major guy left; Taking Back Sunday version 1.4. I don't understand why you need help "since they have a two singer setup, kinda." Does that mean you wanted to do a two reviewer setup kinda? And you're an ass for not letting me give  TAYF  an A+. There's only half of one song that I could do without, and it's way wrong to review them if you've never seen them. Holy shit was that a show. It's where I want to be, punkbitch.   Ladies and gentlemen, "Tater Salad" has spoken.   Tell All Your Friends  is Taking Back Sunday's first major effort and at first listen, sounds loose and raw. These traits turn out to be the defining characteristic behind this powerful music. An infinite amount of passion and raw energy shoved into 10 well-crafted songs with lyrics that take control and make you sing along. Fast or slow, TBS goes for a gut punch every time as each song's climatic moment makes it mark and engrains itself into your life. A, your life is incomplete without this album.  On 07.27  Where You Want To Be  was released with a significant line-up change. The guitarist who was half of the vocals and the bassist left among assumed creative differences. So there was some trepidation among the TBS ranks over how this new album would sound with the major change. After a few listens you're hooked once again. Something like taste it again for the first time. The work is tighter and more focused, but still has that same passion and lyrical content found in the first record. The new guys fit right in and make themselves known, without messing with the chemistry. Jeff is right you just can't compare the two, both are phenomenal efforts. A, if you don't have either, you have failed at life.  Silverstein,  When Broken Is Easily Fixed   Floating over to the screamo direction of things, Silverstein invokes some comparisons to Finch and a little bit of The Used. There's an intense amount of contrast between his singing and screaming and I'm curious to see how he holds up live. Solid effort, still feeling it out. B, better than average and great for releasing tension.  Breaking Benjamin,  We Are Not Alone   The last of the nu-metal/rock genre that I really listen to, BB's second release is another solid piece of work from the band though I feel the first album had a little more variety. Still a good rock album and will hook you when you're not looking. B, one of the last bands standing from the nu-metal/rock arena.  Los Lonely Boys, (self-titled)  This was my risk taker. I took a chance on what these guys had to offer and it's still a mixed bag. On one hand there are a chunk of interesting blues-laden songs full of hot "Tejas" tone that make you groove. On the other hand there are some played out light pop songs that make me want to run into things head first. B-, wonderfully frustrating, but more than half of it is good.  Go, respond to these reviews accordingly.

       We Will Always Party Hard   So my weekend was here a minute ago, but now it's an hour into Monday and I've called off the search party. I had some fun, but it went in a fast-moving manor.  Friday, I was lame. Stayed in, set up new computer. Whatever, I'm poor.  Saturday was the last Dispatch show and I feared the future of this country with my cohorts Jessica and Mikey and their cohorts Bryan and Jana. The special (in the hit on the head sort of way) hippie-Abercrombie contingent (thousands of smelly youth) showed us that it's all gonna burn to the ground when these kids suddenly realize they've grown up and have been missing the joys of personal hygine for so long.  All in all it was good show and we used our average height of 6 feet to impose, oppress, and keep our spot by the fence. Jessica ate some small teenage girl after she thought she could just smoosh in between our heinously elitist crew. After devouring the girl, Jessica smiled and I apologized to her horrified friends, "Sorry, she gets like that when you use bad grammar."  Mike and I bailed after we entered hour 3 of the Dispatch show. I was tired and wanted a shower and some food. After cleaning up we went over to Borders Cafe in Cambridge to meet Jessica and friends. The Queen of Navigation managed to take Mike's directions and  do the exact opposite.  I'd continue to rail, but I fear being stung by the bee claw. Thanks to the advent of cell phones she managed to find the place and we all had yee-ha fun Mexican and I was the last one to finish eating since I couldn't shut the fuck up for whatever reason. It was one of those nights when I just decided to pretend I could be the life of the Mexican-oriented restaurant table.  We went back to Jessica's. I planned to grab my coat and umbrella I left in the vortex of her car and go home. Mikey wanted to hit the bars and as usual, Mikey got me to go. We hung at Grafton Street in Cambridge, had some beers, and discussed the positive ramifications of the increased percentage of short skirts and pleated skirts that have taken over the fashion scene. During our engrossing conversation, I got a call from stick figure Nate Sutton who alerted me to a house party. I was yawning all the way through my 3rd beer, but when you're with Mikey, you can drink through anything.   We got out of Grafton Street and told said stick figure we would make a special guest appearence on Mission Hill. A pitstop and short shuffle later, we were wandering around John G.'s apartment and drinking warm beer. Dee-licious.  We set up shop on the beer pong table since no one was around and enticed a girl and some guy to finish their previous game. They were heartily vanquished and our next challenge came from Nate and some girl he was prancing around with. I leaned over to beer pong veterean and winner in 10 of his last 11 overall games, Michael Joseph Coughlin and said, "Mikey, we need to put him down." It was for Nate's own good. There's no way he'll be able to leave here with his ego and the girl if he wins. He just won't fit out the door.  Nate was vanquished, Mikey and I went home, yelled at music videos and went to be at 4am. All made possible by two guys in the waning twilight of their collegiate careers. Woot.  Today was gray and humid and I just tried to straighten out the place since Gabe and the vast amount of stuff he owns moved in. At 5pm the sky magically cleared and I decided to try to do my favorite run, out to Jamica Pond. For whatever reason, it felt perfect to be outside and running at that exact time. All variables were just right, the heat, the sun, the right amount of wind, all of it was just really relaxing and made me forget about a lot of the things I've been devoting stress towards lately. Just as important, my knee didn't blow up.  Time to pass out.
