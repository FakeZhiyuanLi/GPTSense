      Ok, so I quit my job with a wireless company not to be mentioned here back at the end of March, beginning of April (one month shy of being vested.. maybe I should have waited...) and I did it before I had another job. Why? Cause I'm such a great freakin' commodity! That's why!  But here I am, three months later and still no job. Blaugh. So I applied at Best Buy a week ago because I need something.. Anything. Not that Best Buy is something to look down on. That's actually not what I'm saying at all. I just wanted to get something on campus at the Uni so I don't have to drive all over town and whatnot. Gas is expensive these days. So I didn't get a call back, and I tried calling them a few times to see what is happening. There is only one guy in charge of hiring, and apparently he went to the College World Series. (For those not in the know, UT went to the finals and lost to a very capable Fullerton team. Props to those guys. Oh, and we were sore losers and didn't accept our second place trophy, but whatever...) So he didn't return my calls and whatnot. I was thinking, wtf, they said I had it as long as the drug screen came back, and there is no reason it shouldn't... ahem. So anyhow, that was weird.. When I found out that the guy was out of town it was a relief cause I knew they were just lollygagging.  Blammo! I'm wanted again! This state job that my wife is doing asked me to come in for an interview today. I went in and it seems that I have it wrapped up if I want it. The only problems with that job is that I have to train for a month and that means missing second semester of summer session. That would put me back in terms of graduating, or at least make it more challenging. Plus that might get me in trouble since I'm supposed to recieve financial aid and already accepted a grant based on my taking nine hours over the summer. I could take some crap classes, but would I want to do that? It would be such a waste. arrrggghh! Maybe I could do both? Working forty hours a week again and all? But I suppose I could quit Best Buy after I get a nice discount on some good stuff like a plasma tv or whatever.. who knows...  But it sure is nice to be wanted again!

      Lying. As children we learn the black and white that lying is bad. But also as children we are introduced to the white lie. It's ok because it's a little white lie. It won't hurt anyone. It's no big deal to tell this lie, but the other lies are bad. So eventually we learn to look into this hypocrisy and decide what is an acceptable lie and what isn't. And we begin to believe that we can pick and choose when lying is alright. And we do.  But it never is. Now of course there are things that we do to be polite. Like if someone asks you if they look good in an outfit. This is something that you do to be polite. Honestly though, if it is a matter of opinion it is hard to call it lying. Yes, the opinion expressed can be different than what is thought, but the significance is on the effort to shade things in a way as to not injure. But when we do this with the facts it is never a good idea.  When we lie and say that something did or did not happen, this is a terrible situation. For one, because it creates a false world. To keep up with the lie, you have to remember the lie you told. Then anything that comes up later must be altered to fit that lie. Then any comments about any of it must be altered to keep the lie world intact. There is never a good time to tell someone that you lied to them. This comes off as an attempt at giving up before the act was discovered. Even if it doesn't, you are just smacking that person in the face and telling them that you lied to them.  We shouldn't hurt the people we love. So instead of looking for an easy way out at the moment to not hurt them (or really to not cause a problem for ourselves) we should just tell the truth. It may hurt to say and to hear, but it is better than living in a lie. It is better than risking more than before.

      I must confess that I am a packrat. I have moved stuff around with me since at least graduation from high school. I know, technically it is longer than that, but I'm going to count the start there. Since I started living under my own roofs that made it more permanent. I need help. I need to stop being sentimental and say "hey, there is no way I will ever want this again" and throw it away. Someone send me to Dr. Phil or put me on one of those TLC shows where they make you throw stuff out. That's all I have to say. Help, puhleeze...

      Ok, I got myself into trouble. Not because I did anything. Because of what I don't normally do. My wife got mad at some of my posts because she thinks it means I have regrets about the past. And I guess I do. Just not the same way she thinks.  Ok, so there are lots of things I would change about the past, but that doesn't mean I would change the present. Or the future.  So I would have changed things I would have done. I would have done something or said something. I would have seized the day. I would have been a better me. Hell, I would have tried out for the high school basketball team and maybe not played soccer if I could do it all over again. But I didn't mention that. And that wouldn't get me in trouble. Well maybe it would b/c she was complaining about the Kobe thing and how no woman would get married to a basketball player unless they expected that type of stuff... oops, off subject  Ok, so I'm in trouble since I am saying that I wished things were different then. Yes. Who wants to remember screwing up the situation that was at that point good? No one. Who remembers clearly? Not most. I must say I wear rose colored glasses more than most. I like to romanticize the past. One of the posts that surely got me in trouble, now that I think about it, was a lie. I said that I wished I said what she wanted to hear so she wouldn't leave me. But I remember that same night I was thinking I would break up with her. And I cried. It was so devastating to have someone tell ME for the first time that they didn't want me anymore. I'm self centered that way. But really, I do miss the person and the friendship that they shared with me. And the idiosyncrasies too. We are packages, not fruit to be picked through and just the good parts taken and the rest left in the supermarket for someone else to decide if it's good enough for.  Anyhow, I just want to say that I am happy with my life. Well most of it. The things I would change would not change who I am or where I am now. Just the little details. Like Back To The Future? Maybe I would just feel better about my past and knowing I didn't screw someone over, or didn't do the wrong thing would just make me feel better about my life now. Not that I feel bad. Or should. Well maybe for a few things. Ok, transmission over.

      Ok, I'm just going to leave this out there...  What would you do if you had a friendship that was tainted? And then it was destroyed by the tainting. You thought that the tainting could be removed but you weren't sure. And the friend was estranged. There was a "mutual agreement" to never speak to each other again because of the problems. If you thought that  it could repaired, but maybe not one hundred percent, would it be worth it?  Is anything worth it?  The hardest part would be swallowing pride and saying that you could have been wrong. Leaving yourself open to the other person saying that you are not worth the effort. Possibly being harmed when the whole thing could have been avoided.   Is this stupid?  Or am I just stupid. There are times when I think so, but i don't want to believe it's true. I want to be smart. Too smart. I want to be smart about every decision and not allow emotions or heart to rule the day. I stay shackled. That's no way to live. My people have been freed, and now it time to free me. My people also built the railroads of this country, so maybe I should make tracks from your heart to mine. Not a valentine. A bridge of friendship. Connecting the quickly changing people that we become. Do we want to be apart of each other's futures? I can't speak for you, and wouldn't know the answer unless I take a risk. It's the trust game.

      Ok, if you chat you are familiar with this phrase. Age / Sex / Location. To me it just means that you are shallow and want to hook up with someone. Why shallow? Some make the argument that it is a gateway to knowing who you are conversing with and will open up all types of conversations.  I say WRONG.  This is merely a way of someone finding out if you are worth talking to. Judging books by their covers. I don't always dismiss people because they are younger or older. Not right away anyhow. If I have a conversation for like ten minutes and realize we have nothing in common or they are not the type of person that is interesting to talk to then that is when I decide not to talk to them. Not because they are a certain age, sex or live in a certain location.  Maybe if we use this approach towards our daily lives this world would be better. For example, if instead of judging someone before you have talked to them, or on the very first thing that happens with them, maybe you should leave the first impression very open to possibilities and fill in the probabilities after knowing them a little better.  So if you meet someone online that refuses A/S/L, you just might be talking to me.

      They say that getting older is getting wiser. For some this is true. For some, you know what mistakes certain actions are and still you are compelled to do them. Why? Is it just human nature? Are we perpetuated towards certain behaviors even though we know the consequences and penalties? I don't have anything in particular in mind at this point, but it seems that I get older and dumber. I know that certain things are not good for me or would not be good for the life I'd like to live, but yet I somehow still think fondly of such things. Maybe I'm just a goof.

      For so long now summer has been in ways a huge dissapointment. When you were a kid, you got to run around with your friends and play and do whatever you wanted. Maybe if you got lucky then you went on some awesome vacation. From about middle school on, I was placed in a summer engineering program. Basically it took these inner city Chicago youth and made them do science and math and other scholastic activities instead of, oh I dunno, going shooting people or stealing or whatnot. It was interesting I suppose, but for what it's worth I can't say I wouldn't have rather spent the time sitting on a couch watching tv or playing a video game. Time moves on and still my summers are spent in school.. but that isn't what I wanted to talk about.  Baseball sucks. Let's face it, you only have one person that is making a play at a time. Sure everyone else can play a position and predict what is going to happen next to help with the plays, but it is one person at a time doing something. One person throws the ball while nine people scratch their arses. Well I guess the ninth doesn't scratch too long because he needs to pay attention to the ball enough to swing or not. Then if he hits it, generally it only goes towards one person. So that person tries to catch. Maybe a teammate runs over there too just in case he sux and doesn't catch it. Then there is a throw and a catch. Boooring. Who pays these people all this much money to play a million games a season that nobody cares about? Blaugh.  We made this big push to see all of this arena football on tv, why not put the NBDL on tv too? That would be good summer entertainment. If you ask any kid what sport they are going to be playing over summer most of them would say basketball anyhow. Well some would say soccer and some would say football, and the less talented kids would say baseball... but most would say basketball. No I don't have scientific proof to back this up, and I'm not going to invest any money to do so. But if you want to prove me wrong then conduct your own survey.  So I say, forget calling baseball players the boys of summer, they are just fodder to fill time, like all these crappy re-runs and lame summer shows we have to watch. And I'm out...

      What does it take to be happy with yourself? With the things that you've done? Why is this so hard to come by for so many? Whose approval is neccessary to make it seem like your life has had meaning and was justified?  Some turn to religion. God or proper deity will say that you lived life properly and you deserve praise in the afterlife. How ridiculous is that? I mean that would have to be some strange detachment of mind. Heaven. How can you feel that a concept like this exists? Let's say there are two people that are equally faithful to the virtues that would get them into a heaven. One of the people can't stand the other person, just because their personalities don't match. The other person loves to be around the first person, because of what the first person is like, or their image or whatever. How can both of these people be in heaven? I suppose a simple answer would be that while the one person likes being around the other, it is not mandatory for their happiness so they can just see other people. But I feel that for it to truly be heaven it would have to mean that you get to see all the people that made you happy (as they become available) and meet new people that would give you positive experiences.  Some turn to their parents. "If I can make my parents happy and proud of me then I must have done a good job." Well, for the most part a parent will be right about what a child should do most of the time, but often they are not correct. A resilient child may take a failure and turn it into a success, but that doesn't mean that the parent didn't choose incorrectly. To live life by someone else's guidlines is absurd.  Where does that leave us? You have to be happy with yourself. Nothing else. It's not about money. Unless you only enjoy money, or only enjoy possessions. It's not about appearance, unless that's all you care about. It's not about anything superficial, but that you can be happy with what you are doing, what you have done, and what you will do.   So are you happy?

      Until recently (thank gawd) I have felt like I don't have any current friends and only old friends. I am a poor social person (not that I can't talk to people, just can't really make lasting bonds with total strangers in a "hey come over for a dinner party" or "let's go get drunk this weekend" kind of way.) I suppose that is because I ended up spending so much time in front of the tv as a kid and not enough time interacting with other people. Anyhow, I get a friend and I like to hold on to them forever. But no one seems to hold on as tight as I do. Why is that?  So here is a little synopsis of some of my friends and how they are gone, and maybe never going to return. Names removed for my protection, but if they are reading they will probably be able to figure out who I'm talking about. Or is this "you're so vain, you probably think this song is about you..."  So you're back in a living situation you might not have wanted to be in. The plans you made got interrupted by someone else's happiness and you got sent packing. But wtf? You still have a much better job than you've ever had and you should be able to do with your life what you want. So why aren't you? I don't know if you are or aren't. Phone disconnected. Other line, I've left messages that go unreturned. E-mails go off into space with no mention of receipt. Sometimes I sensed something in the way you talked to me or looked at me. Is it jealousy? Because you think I got something you won't get? Or is it that you're upset that you think I don't have the time for you? Because if I don't have time these days, what do I have? Anyhow, I think you are the least severe of the problem friendships and I'm sure you will return. But little birdie, for now I'm going to let you go and see if you come back...  You are the worst off. I can't say what I really meant way back whenever because I'm too proud. I can't say what you want to hear, because I fear that thing is nothing. I know you have your own situation and it is ginger, so I should backdafuggup and leave you alone. Shouldn't I? Who knows, because for people that started off being so honest and sincere we have done everything to keep what we really think and feel guarded and as transparent as the water in the beaches around my hometown of Galveston. That's murky at best. So why bother? Truth be told, it would cause more problems than solve them to be friends with you again. It would bring too many bad memories back for too many people and the insinuations and lingering questions of those outside the friendship would most likely strain it or tear it apart again. The human heart is perverse that way. I miss you. Maybe most of all. But not the way things ended up. Not the last attempts and nothingness. I miss the before. Perhaps it is just fantasy and is not possible anymore. But I can dream, can't I?  You were so much more than just a friend. I did things the wrong way with you from the very start. I couldn't control what I wanted and people got hurt. What's more, did you ever really trust me? You wanted me to drop everything and live like you. I wanted to do it so madly, but that would be a different person, and I am too rooted to be a leaf floating down the river. The words you most wanted to hear to let you know that it was allright would never spring from my lips. If it were to end, it should not have been like this. I now know that my answer for you was yes, and that your subtle hints were pleas for me to acknowledge what you hoped was true. It was true and I was too stupid to know it. Of course I can never have those precious moments back and never have the opportunity to see what might have been. You were one of the most inspirational people to me that I've met before, and you were also the only person to make me cry the way you did. I hope that I never made you cry that way, despite the sad messages you left on my answering machine those times.  I never got the chance to know you the way I would have liked. Distance is an enemy if you let it be one. I feel I got to know you in an ethereal way. Facial expressions and body language tell half the story, and intonations were lacking the way we communicated. Once I toyed with your emotions for fun, because I didn't think you cared and I guess because I wanted to know what was underneath. I told you that I told her that I loved you. I chickened out at the last minute of this perverse joke and told you that I loved you like a friend and she would have to understand. She said she did, and you were welcomed back. Was it ever the same? Perhaps you wanted something. Perhaps if the situation were different I would have to. And my perhaps is not a fifty fifty, but a veil to protect me in case your perhaps is the inverse of mine. Inverted emotion is no way to behave, but I was happy with any role that I could have in your world "I want a bit part in your life, a walk on would be fine, I just want a bit part in your life..."  You were the most difficult to want to be friends with. The things you did to me were like some cruel hoax, for your amusement. Am I Pip? And who would be your Miss Havesham? Well I never fully understood, but I think I know why it couldn't have been. I somehow enjoyed your personality despite it's flaws and longed for time spent at your side. You were quite the interesting one, and I don't think I would have removed you even if it took away all the problems. Evened out, you were worth it, but of course you without the problems would have been nice too. Blaugh, I know I will never see you again, and that is alright. I know it is ok with you.

      I don't know what is wrong, but ever since I can remember I have had a hard time going to sleep. Just the little things will wake me up. Sometimes I am right on the very edge of falling asleep and I decide my arm or something else is uncomfortable and I need to shift. This movement wakes me up as if I was just preparing to sleep. I don't understand it.  Sometimes it is even worse and I start the "non sleep cycle". You don't get enough sleep at night so you are tired all day. You take a nap because you are so tired. You sleep too long because your body is trying to catch up on sleep. When it is time to go to sleep you are not sleepy. You stay up too late, don't get enough sleep and are tired all day...  Maybe one day I will figure it out and get regular sleep each and every night. For now, it seems to be out of reach...

      Have you ever been pretty good at something and then not done it for a long time? Have you ever gone back to that thing and realised you weren't very good at it, or even *gasp!* close to bad at it? Or maybe you were worse than the first time you started (is that possible?) because this time you know what you can accomplish and your mind still has that as a firm belief but your skills are just not there..  Well for me, it is spinning. If you are still confused that is DJing. Taking to turntables and a mixer and vinyl recordings of your favorite tracks and mixing them together to form a continuous sound. The perfect blend of beats and vocals and emotions. Yes, the emotions can be peaked by properly inserting or removing or blending it all together. Even changing the tempo or style of music.   Well, the skills are gone. I try to practice, but I don't get around to it as much as I would like to. So I have to make time, to find time. Where will it come from? If I'm smart, I'll just turn off the television that I use like a blankie when I'm tired. Usually if I don't have any energy I just sit and veg in front of the telly, but this is not good for me. If I'm working on a skill (even one that is not very useful...) then it will sharpen my mind and increase my productivity. And my quality of life. So I need to work on it.. motivation is neccessary... and I must fight the dark forces. It is time to practice!  The only downside is once I get good again I will allow myself to purchase rekkids. Have you ever priced the wax? It is crazy.. but that is the price of being underground. Since it is not mass produced (well not like other music) there are less being purchased. So of course to make a profit you have to charge more. I understand and am not mad about that.. I just wish I had a tree of money! But don't we all. And a skill tree also. That would be nice. Where am I going with this? I don't know. I think I will go practice.

      Energy. We all need it. We all want it. Most of us can't get enough of it. How do you come up with more energy? Well there is the easy method of taking some outside substance geared at giving you energy. Like caffeine. Most people start their day with coffee, have a cup in the middle, or like a cup before bed. Like "pep pills". These are mostly for people that are trying to diet by getting their bodies into a state where it is going to burn a lot of calories because they will have energy to run around doing whatever. Or truckers. Next time it is late at night and you are driving around (or heck, in the middle of the day for that matter) think about how much sleep that 18 wheeler driver has had before you cut him off or ride next to him. It's probably not a good idea. Then there are the illegals for quick energy.. well I suppose some are legal, so let's just lump it into a medication group. This would include the pep pills I guess, but I mean stronger things. So if it is legal it would probably require a prescription. These are probably the scariest ones (think "Requiem for a Dream"). If they are illegal, either you are experimenting or are way past that. And if this is the case you should watch out. I don't know if they are gateway drugs, because usually they are not the first stop, but once you are on something I think it would be hard to prevent that something from turning into everything. Now the legals are probably the most dangerous. We have a false sense of security because the government has told us that they are ok. How many times has there been some wonder product on the market only to be taken off later because it causes heart attacks or strokes or "sexual side effects". Well I don't know if they take them off the market for that, but it is funny how almost all medications have sexual side effects... I suppose that is how the viagra and cialis people make their money. That and horny middle to late age people. So here we are taking our government approved medications and wondering why the medication stops working. It's because it's a crutch. And too much of anything becomes less satisfactory (see law of diminishing returns.) What happens now? We need to get something stronger. So back to the doctor. He is happy to oblige. Why? Because we don't have doctors anymore, we have PPOs and other acronyms that don't think of us as people, but numbers. They have to see x number of people within y amount of time. Otherwise the insurance companies will frown or they might get a talking to from their head physician or the person in charge at the clinic that they work at. With five minutes at best of their time, they just want to know what you want and what they need to do to get you out of the examination room. So they prescribe you whatever you want. They make it nice and legal by explaining any side effects or questions you have, but really don't care what happens to you.  So where does that leave us? To get energy, you have to go to the naturals. Excercise. How many of us do this enough? We need to get off our couches and out to an environment that will make us feel comforatble with expending some energy. This may be your living room, the local hike trials, or a fancy gym. Whatever it is, we need to go do it. We need to treat ourselves as the fragile containers that we are and not machines that get external energy whenever we need and not worry about the consequences. If you were modifying a car and you decided to add nitrous oxide for extra energy you would be a fool not to know about the potential dangers and to take precautions for them. You would reinforce your engine, change out your gaskets, get a higher performance fuel pump, whatever it took to make sure you didn't blow up your car's engine. Because that would be expensive. So why wouldn't you want to take care of your body's engine? If you insist on the external energy then you still need the exercise to make sure you are fit enough to handle it. Oh, who am I kidding.. I think I'm going to go watch some more tv...

      Blaugh! I just looked at a zillion web pages of import cars with the mods that I want done (and a lot that have crazy crap that makes me suppress the gag reflex...) So now I'm sitting here fantasizing about what will happen to my car next.   So minor things that I have done were stripping the interior out (I was planning to color everything, but the first thing that got colored only turned out ok, so maybe this will have to be done professionally), replacing the crappy supposed to be performance exhaust with and obx racing exhaust, rear disc brake conversion, and simple stuff like with the intake and plugs / wires. Oh, well I guess stuff like stereo stuff (had to because people are theives..) and different seats (91s which didn't fit, and racing seats which ended up being too uncomfortable for daily use).  At the very least, I need the power of a b18c1 or a b18c5 (honda geek speak for much better engine). That would come close to doubling the horsepower I have in my puny little 110hp crx si engine. Hopefully that would be enough to plaster a grin across my face. There is the possibility that I might want to turbo or do other crazy modifications in the future.. but hey, let's take baby steps first. There is also the lure of the new ka20 engines, but they are expensive and who knows how long I can keep an '88 on the road...  I also want to do lots of things like convert the front end to a civic '00 face and maybe get the interior redone.  These are itches, and I either need some topical cream or enough expendable income that I can do it!  Ok, enough of that. Please continue with your regularly scheduled broadcast.

      Mindset.. sleepy cause I woke up after only four or five hours of sleep for no reason.. well I'm a pretty heavy sleeper so there was probably some reason but I don't know what. I'm also kinda chill cause I'm listening to Black Eyed Peas and it is hard to not feel kinda chill when you're coolin' out to tha peas. Blah cubed.  Ok, multi-rant now... all about AIM. Ok, so we're corporate america and we don't do anything for free. The best we do is make it look free and either send you advertising out the wazoo or we do something like give it free for a little while and then start to charge for stuff. I know this. I am used to it. I was seriously thinking about shelling out the twenty bucks to get AIM for pdas when I did another search online. Turns out there is a way to get AIM for free for the pda. It's not something that someone downloaded from AIM and is now illegally sharing. It's not some 3rd party program that someone created to allow you to chat. It's not even the schtupid icq for pdas (I did download it but I can't get it to work... schtupid schtupid...) What is it? It's the older version of AIM for pdas that I downloaded from the UK site. For freakin' free! See in europe they do things a lot differently when it comes to pdas and cell phones. They would prolly rip AIM a new one if they tried to charge for the program. On my only trip to Europe, in France I was amazed to learn that even on prepaid cards for a cell phone you get unlimited incoming minutes. No matter if you are calling from a home phone or a cell phone you pay to call another cell. Interesting. So a cheap person can dial someone's # and hang up after a couple of rings and then they will call him back and he doesn't use a single minute. And with the ease of unlocking phones (I downloaded some programs to unlock any nokia and most others can be done at a shop) you could really pick two plans where maybe one has unlimited night time and one has a huge amount of daytime. Whatever.. this is a serious tangent so I'm just going to abort now and get back to what I was talking about.  Ok, so I'm weird and I have three screennames for no real reason. I mean, it's not like I have different people in the different lists, they are all the same people. I just sign on to different ones to.. I don't even know myself why I do it. But anyhow, with this AIM program I downloaded, the buddy list feature is we todd did. Fah real. Fah really real? Fah rizzle. No doubt. It won't download your current buddy list from AIM like if you were on another computer using quickbuddy or something.. you have to retype your list. What makes it worse is that it won't save it unless you delete your entire buddy list and retype it from the pda. That sux. I am sure the $20 version is nicer, b/c from what I've seen of it online it looks more updated from this version. But hey, I'm broke as a joke and the twenty means a lot more in my wallet than spent on my pda.   You know what? This is going way out of the way, but I have to say, I really love my pda. There are some things that are quirky that I would change, but overall I really get good use out of it. It's a sony clie ux-50. It has wi-fi, bluetooth, ir, mp3, camera, video camera, memory stick and all the standard pda / pim features. blah cubed. No more gushing about an electronic device.  blue squadron leader out

      Ok, so my first degree was in Radio Television Film, and I concentrated in sound engineering. The main reason I didn't pursue this is because I see it as two forks in the road with their fair share of pitfalls.   On one hand, you can work at an independent studio. You get to work with all types of ambitious bands full of interesting ideas and unconventional styles. The work is exciting because you don't have to hear the same type of music or even use the same techniques from band to band. You have to have the entire arsenal available for any given band that may come along. The downsides would be once you finally get an opportunity to engineer instead of whatever other entry level position you started at you have to build your own client base. With independent bands they hardly ever stay together for more than two or three recordings, the pay is not great, and you can forget comforts such as health / dental or retirement unless you take care of them yourself.  On the other hand, you can work at a mega giant like Sony. You get all the creature comforts once you pay your dues, but the music is not as fullfilling. Usually with mainstream recording studios you get typecast and work on the same types of music repetitively. Unless you are lucky enough to feel passionate about this type of music then the work is not as rewarding. Since I don't listen to the radio (I don't like very much of what is out there) this is probably not going to be the route for me.  Not to mention the prima donna effect. If you end up being a big engineer and are in demand that usually means working with the top talent. Since they are top talent  they are usually prima donnas, or tempermental artists. If you are supposed to record and they are not feeling up to it they may take one day's session and the next day they may feel "inspired" and decide to keep the session going an extra ten hours. It's not so easy to plan for these types of situations...  Anyhow, so the whole point of this post (before a typical rant) was how I love independent music (indie). Now it is hard for me to say this, because I've been burned before. I am just now coming to realize the business of it all.  So the first time it happened to me was with "alternative rock". It was an alternative to the mainstream sounds and was supposed to allow you to listen to something different and fresh. It was billed as the little guys against the big major label rock. It was really just subdivisions of the major labels releasing artists in discretely engineered ways to make them sound like not as much effort was put into recording the music when in fact just as much effort was placed on the recording.  They just didn't use the cheese from the previous big group: the hair bands. There were no gongs, no orchestra swells, hardly any additional instruments at all. Whatever the musicians played typically is what they played for every song. Usually a guitarist just played one guitar, not like the hair bands who would keep a treasure chest of 10 guitars just for the look of the different guitars. (Yeah, there was probably some difference, but who could hear it?)  So this was refreshing. Even though these were mass produced and mass distributed artists, they had the feel of "my very own band". It was special to know of that band that no one else knew. It was exciting to "spread the gospel" and tell everyone in sight about all of the bands that they would have never heard about if it weren't for you. Well this all sounds very familiar when I start talking about my love of indie rock.  The labels different now. Usually it is a local label that didn't want to be a corporate entity and just wanted to put out their friends' music. Now they may not have the best of equipment (and often that is the point of these labels) but they really care about the music. Sometimes the music is intentionally sounding poor. Instead of putting a mic on every tom and cymbal, often they are recorded with just two mics for the whole drum set to give a stereo recording. This is not a good way to give a full, rich sound but is a great way to announce that you ARE different from mainstream recordings and it really is DIY. The funniest thing about saying DIY is that do it yourself started with punk rock. This was the ultimate anti-corporate music in it's infancy, but now the pop punk, ska punk, punk-ska, 3rd wave ska, whatever other category you want to come up with are corporate just like everything else. So you really have no true independence of music becuase when you get too big the big companies come calling to take away all your idols. And who's to blame a band for accepting money for their music? Isn't that what anyone puts out music for? I know some bands say they would never do it, but if you believe that, then why would they ask anyone to pay for their music at all? In this day and age of digital reproduction, they could easily make a recording, have a digital version that anyone could make a copy of and distribute at will. Even if they wanted to only produce on vinyl (because of course that is more indie than a cd) they could sell the records for what it cost to produce them.  Since these are usually produced by friends in small studios or even someone's living room there is not a large amount of money involved with the production.  Vinyl is a very expensive media since it is not as in demand and the costs to reproduce them are higher. Even if you didn't make money, and even lost some money on the records, these are still very expensive. So basically, once you start making any profit at all from recordings, why would you ever have a cap where you say "this is too much money to make from music"? You can always approach the music the same way as before, but it is true that money changes everything. If you are working 12 hours a day to pay rent and then you write a couple of songs in your spare time you're hungrier than if you have a few hundred thousand in the bank and you sit around waiting for your muse to inspire you. So basically if you really want to be indie you should never make any money off of your music and give your music for free as well as your performances. You should leave only an auditory legacy and nothing that anyone could ever point to and say "man, he sold out..." Ah, to appease the fickle fans. Who says that if you stay true to the indie ideology that your fans will stay interested long enough for you to make even a meager life out of it. And maybe that is the point of indie.   Well anyhow, as a hobby I have gotten interested in recording again. Super indie style. Never will anything be produced, or distributed for profit. Never will a dollar be made from t-shirt sales of my bands or any kind of paraphenalia. Why? Because I  plan on just recording my personal experiments and my friends bands. Once they get good enough to want to start making money off of their music they can find a great indie engineer and producer.  Did you honestly read that whole rant? Wow, you should get a free download or t-shirt commemorating the occasion.  Special note: Parts of this were written while watching the finale to WBs Superstar USA. I didn't want to watch it, but last week I was forced to watch the second to last episode and the virus caught ahold of me and now I'm the zombie for the humiliation of these poor souls. How can William Hung have infiltrated this country in such a strange manner? Ok, over and out!

      Well, I'm chatting to no one again just to put things in perspective out of my head... Which is really still in my head but makes me feel better? I suppose... Therapy? Hmm.. many people I've known in the past  said that maybe I should seek some.. Anyhow.  So I was circumventing a flaw in this free trial offer by using each of my e-mails (current and old ones) to get free downloads of maps when I came across an interesting e-mail.  My sister sent an e-mail to me. Now, just in case some random stranger is reading this I will do a courtesy background fill-in. So after my mother passed away in Nov 1999 my sister lied to us about the life insurance. She kept saying that she hadn't heard back from the company while she was amassing tons of new furniture, a new car, a new big screen television as well as paying off all of her old debts. Of course the truth was only revealed when my other sister and I were telling her that we were going to call the insurance company to find out why they had not sent the check. Only at this point when the truth would be revealed anyhow did she tell us that she had recieved the check and had used the money. Now with the pain of death, I had not drawn all the conclusions neccessary to realize how my sister was taking advantage of the situation until this point. Now her rationale was that her name was the only one on the policy so she was going to use the money as a way out of her own debt and start fresh.  Hmm.. me thinks I've been hoodwinked and bamboozled. So from this time on I broke contact with her as I felt no need to have such decietful relationships. On a later occassion when my family was in town for my wedding. For those of you who have never been married, weddings are usually a hectic occassion where you don't get to see anyone as much as you would like to and you run around getting things done until the last minute until you are ready to collapse from exhaustion. Well, the wedding night helps with the exhaustion... Ramble aside, there was a small window of opportunity that we could have lunch with my father and some more of my family that we set aside among doing other things. She was invited to the wedding (as a gesture of rebirth of familial bonds) and she didn't show up because (long story short) she is a moron that can't keep a one year old car operating properly. She knew when we wanted to meet, and was told two hours before hand when we were going to meet. Although we drove nearly an hour out of the way to be closer to where she was and told her before hand when to be there, she managed to show up an hour and a half late. So instead of being able to catch up with my family over food, I sit outside in my car, sweating and fuming about how she had destroyed something else that I would have cherished (list too long to mention all of it, including crashing my very first car two weeks after I got it, as well as not letting my mother help replace the car with her own... this of course was due to her dependence on my mother, my father and anyone else that she could.)  Background excerpt ends - rant #2 over. Now to where all that was leading...  So I checked my old e-mail to get the codes and saw that I had an e-mail from my dear sister. So the message was basically to forgive and forget, let bygones be bygones and to start fresh. Can I do this? Can I put proverbial neosporin on my wounds of the soul for a blemish free surface to my heart? Can I allow myself to be open and vulnerable? Can I fully let go with the risk of more destructive behaviors right around the corner? I don't know if I can, but I did allow the opportunity by responding. So now I'm reliving all the pain and confusion and irritation and .. and.. rrrrrrgh! So that is the end of this rant.

      This is so stupid. I have a test tommorrow in a class which I can't afford a book.. so what am I doing? I'm listening to streams from nycjungle.com and creating a blog. I have to go to the library after work (if you can call it that) so I can look at the old edition of the book I need. Yay. I'm sure this blog will not feature many posts.. but oh well..   Hey, by the by.. a lot of my old pics got wiped out from a comp crash. If anyone I know has pics of me or people I want to have pics of please send them to me.   Oh yeah, so if any strangers come across this and want to chat, feel free to post here or find me on AIM, sikboiatx.  Out.

      Ok, so I was stocking the shelves with various cds and music dvds when&nbsp;a thought came over me. If you knew that people only went to see you as a joke and they were all laughing at you, none of them appreciated what you did for "quality work", then would you still do it? I think I was looking at some hair band dvd first when I was thinking about it. The thought was cemented later when I was stocking William Hung cds.   Ok, for those of you that don't know, William Hung is the guy from last season's American Idol. He is the "She Bang" guy that sings really bad, dances really bad, and proudly proclaims "I have no formal training in singing or dancing". Well no $#!t sherlock, it didn't take Mattlock to figure that one out.   So this guy gets a cd deal, has played many talk shows, even played the halftime of many of the NBA games this past season and playoffs. He is a serious flash in the pan, but making really good money considering he didn't even finish his performance for the screening of American Idol. Hell, he was so popular that the WB created a show to find the next person like him. Superstar USA. Gawd. That show was so sick, but after watching the second to last show I had to watch the final to see what happened.. and I will always live with that shame.   So my question to myself is, if I knew that people were only buying my cd (and geez, why&nbsp;do so many people buy his crappy cd?...), and watching me perform, and all of this stuff, would I keep doing it as the butt of a joke?   Ya know, I think I probably would. Hey, he gets to live the life of a rockstar, travel around, perform, record, get treated like royalty, and not have to worry about the downside. I mean, there is a downside, but you're prepared for it. You know that the public will get tired of you. You know that you will be criticized for not singing well. You know that people are going to make fun of you. Heck, that's about all you're going to get. But it may lead to something else. You could get into acting and be a great bit player and make a great life like that. You could offshoot into so many interesting things that it's hard to see why you wouldn't want to get your 15 minutes and then some...

      Ok, so I converted it and ran the a/c. At first it was successful. Then it was warm air. The pressure went down. So I recharged. It worked. Then it went dry. There is a leak somewhere. I put some dye marked freon in. It worked. Stayed working longer. But it still stopped working. At least since I have the UV dye in the system I should be able to track it down and figure out what is the problem. But for now, I'm in the Texas heat with no a/c. That is ok for now, but come August, I better have it working. blaugh.

      Ok, so on Tuesday we went to play some basketball. My knee still felt great. I was chasing Reggie Miller all around the court, through multiple picks each time. The knee felt good. Unfortunately not everyone knows how to throw a legal pick. Moving screens each and every time. At least one person if not more. One of the illegals screens put a knee in the back of mine just as I was sliding over. Crrcckk. Knee did not appreciate this. The knee was ginger but alright for the rest of the night, but very sore the next day. So now there is at least another week off from doing anything and then we will take a look. The positive is that it seems to be healing instead of staying exactly the same. Time off is what injuries need. Here's hoping that it gets better soon.

      Ok, so today Garett came over to play some music. We used to be in a band with Adam just after high school called Penguin. It was a punk band (well I guess pop punk) consisting of Geeb's Billy Jo styled vocals, Adams Metallica influenced solos and NOFX influenced riffs, and my sporadic and ever changing drum lines. Ever changing meaning that each time the songs were played there was no guarantee that the same fills would be played. So since the days of Penguin were long gone, we decided to do these covers to get the creative juices flowing and also to get used to playing together again. We decided to play Major Tom by Peter Schilling. It actually went pretty well. Garett learned it pretty fast (from what we could hear on a sample online) and we meshed pretty well on it. Of course this is considering that neither of us have played in a few months at least. Well I think Geeb played earlier this week in anticipation of we were going to do. Later on Chris brought his bass. One day he will learn to play it. Heh. But it was good just to have another influence. So this is where the day goes horribly wrong. We were taking a break and decided to fix the loose knobs on Chris's bass. Garett took off the pick guard and tightened the knobs onto the bass. So far so good. I suppose he was feeling good about&nbsp;himself because he decided to try and fix a short in his guitar. So he opened it all up and was goofing around. He somehow yanked a wire out of place. Luckily I had a sodering iron and some soder. So the guitar was put back together, unlike Humpty Dumpty.&nbsp; The incident effectively killed the music for the night, but now there are talks of learning new songs and playing again sometime soon. This is god news.. very good news indeed.

      OK, so as I have stated prior, I have multiple jobs now. So I was going from training at one job to work at the other job the other day. For the training I'm allowed to wear flip flops. These are my foot attire of choice for the summer months in Texas. If you don't understand, then just come here in any shoes anything less than running shoe breathable and you will understand why. Even running shoes get to be stiffling on your feet if you are not able to take them off for the entire day here. So I went to change into my work uniform for my other job. I had the pants. I had the shirt. I had the socks. I didn't have the shoes. Where were my shoes? I left my shoes at home. So it's fifteen minutes until work time. Anyone who knows me knows that shoes are a hard to decide item. I didn't have time to go home and get them, so I did the next best thing. I went to the academy next door (a sports and outdoors retailer) and went shopping for shoes. There were some really cheap canvas shoes like the&nbsp;old school vans except a much cheaper&nbsp;version. That might&nbsp;have been ok. I thought about it and decided I wanted something that I would want to wear normally.&nbsp;After much deliberation (quickly) I ended up purchasing some basketball shoes. Since it was raining by the time I left the store, I went into work in my flip flops and changed inside. Since I am so picky about shoes, I decided that I ma return them. Even after wearing them. Because I'm cheap. Ridiculously cheap. But that doesn't make me a bad person. So I suppose I will try and do that tommorrow I guess.. Or maybe I will just decide to keep a second pair of basketball shoes.

Mmm mm good.   I know mere likes bread and anything carb related.. so maybe it has rubbed off on me. Or has the latent biscuit love layed low until I could truly appreciate it?   Or am I just a little to dorky about a freaking wad of dough? Hmm... you decdide...

      Ok, so for those that don't know, to the right is a little area that you don't have to be a member of blogspot to comment on. You can remain anonymous. Or make up a random framp arse name that you want to be known as.  That's cool, that's what it's known for. Here is my response, which is redundant because it can be viewed to the right...  Flowbie Dear Hugo.. what, no way to comment directly to you? That is not what I say at all. Maybe some. And I know lots of indie people address being in best buy as selling out. Not me. I'm happy for their success. What am I moaning about? Not being able to go to their shows. You don't have to be a huge commercial success to make going to the show not as fun. NOFX is a band that I will probably love forever, but I will never go to another show of theirs. For one the crowds are too rowdy for my aging body. Secondly I just don't want to be at a show of 300 or so people. It is too big. I like the intimate shows. So I might muster the energy and stamina to fight a Sleater-Kinney show, but there is no way I'm going to do battle with crowds larger than that. It's too much. I perfer smaller crowds, and seeing Ben Kweller and Death Cab for Cutie at a 500+ person crowd kinda sux. Just my view. So I like to lord the fact that I know about cool bands that no one else knows. And yeah, I play them for everyone I know, but these are people that I deem worthy of knowing, not just flavor of the month poser jerks.. whatever.. maybe I will write more as a post.  So does that clarify it? I don't care if there are a million poseurs, it just makes it harder to go to the shows where the band is actually a really good band that I like and everyone else knows about them. I don't want to fight huge crowds to listen to music. heck, no one really puts on a "show" anymore anyhow (Go Aquabats!) so might as well just listen to the cd if there are going to be a million people at the show. My days of leaving the show in a sweat soaked t-shirt are long gone. My days of mortal kombat in the pits will never return. I'm almost (not quite...) to the point where I am going to want to sit in (gasp) assigned seating to see shows. But I'll leave that for when I'm listening to Ravi Shankar vs Zampir and his panflute... rock out! Anyhow, the biscuits I've been eating are going to my head.. must stop typing...

      Oh, joyous occassion! So I was hanging out with Chris this weekend (actually not playing video games... how strange...) We were just sitting around watching tv like a couple of high schoolers when he gets the bright idea to go shoot some hoops. Now I am running on 1.5 hours of sleep (thanks to Need For Speed Underground and needing to be at a lame meeting at 7 am.. blaugh) and have a little queeziness from eating a little more than half of a large bag of beef jerky (guess who ate the rest. heh..) So the idea was to go to a local court and just shoot around. I'm wearing cargo shorts, my work shoes (low tops, bad for the ankles, these have never even been laced tight) and my calvin and hobbes t-shirt (which I would not have chosen to sweat in, but hey it's ok...) Anyone who knows me knows that I like to wear the proper gear for the proper sport. This is definitely not how I would have chosen to go shooting. We get to the court and there are a bunch of people there. So we're shooting around. Next thing I know someone is asking if we want to run threes. Now bear in mind I don't have my knee brace, am not wearing anything to prevent another injury to my recovering mcl, and have not done anything athletic for about two months to rest the knee so it can heal. Some thing got in my head and I said sure. The first game I matched up on one of those speed guys and he got a few layups on me. Same story in the second game. My shooting is ok, but not great. My knee is holding up. Good stuff. Third game, there are more people and we repick so we have fours, and somehow we get the tall guy that just showed up. Not as tall as me, but since we already had the second tallest, we are dwarfing the other team. I shot horribly in this game, but I was getting kinda Rodman on the glass at times and my team was picking up my slack so no worries. Last game (cause after all I didn't want to play until I hurt my knee) something changed. I was blaming my poor shooting (even little four footers) on my lack of legs. I didn't have it. No lift and no quickness. Something changed a few points into the game. I went MJ in his prime. Kobe in the third and fourth quarters. Stevie Franchise when the pressure is on. I guess I should throw in McGrady since he is our new acquisition. I don't know what happened, but I was just getting the ball and letting it fly. Hitting. Curl off a screen, turnaround, net. Man in my face, didn't matter. Seriously, after one of my shots someone said "now you have to sign the ball". About that time my lack of any activity in two months caught up to me and I let my team carry the offensive load for the rest of that game.  But it was great to feel like an NBA player, getting triple teamed whenever I touched the ball and passing it off to my open team mates.  Good stuff. So the story is that I think my knee is almost healed. It was only mildly sore after playing, and I didn't even feel it that much the next day.  good stuff.

      Ok, so "Hugo" made a comment on my blog. Interesting. It's definitely a valid view point. I'm glad that it is becoming more of a dialogue on the blog. Interesting. My only complaint is that there is not direct way to converse with this Hugo. I can only write on my blog a reply and maybe Hugo will return or maybe he won't. I guess i don't like not being able to respond. I know most people don't use ICQ, so maybe if it lets you then you can put in an AIM / AOL membername or at least your own blog that I can go to and sned a direct comment. Anyhow, no matter what I am really excited that someone other than people I know in flesh have read my blog and not completely pooped on it. Yay. Ok, Fear Factor is on and somebody is about to fall off a cab in midair in the rain. Hmm...

      So we're at the rock show and a band is on stage that we can't hear very well so we are goofin' to ourselves (and apparently irritating some couple that was near us, but that is another story that I won't go into...) and we decided that we needed to make up a word. After a few attempts I offered FRAMP. Yeah, we should just start saying framp. We can go into malls and just start using it and see what happens. This is an amusing prank and also a great psychology experiment. We had to decide what it meant. We decided it could be something negative. Leave it wide open. So you can use it as an adjective, verb or pronoun.. whatever you want.  &nbsp; Man, this food is so framp. I think I'm going to hurl.. We went on an on about ways to use framp. Don became enamoured with ways to market framp, like t-shirts and stuff like that. Some of the ideas for shirts included "(upside down spanish question mark) framp?", "framp yo mamma", "framp happens", and "you're so framp". A late entry that doesn't really make sense in context of the term but made us all laugh nonetheless was "framp like ya know". At first Chris was saying fram until we realized and told him the&nbsp;correct word. "Like Peter FRAMPton?" Yeah, exactly.&nbsp; So we had so much fun goofin' with framp that I think it will be in my head for a while. &nbsp; Especially after my experimentation. I decided to just say it to random people and see what they thought. To date I have said it to four completely different people. Not one person so far has questioned framp. The closest I got was from someone (who shall remain nameless, but fairly evident) that knows every word I use and when I am saying something strange. Now this isn't like when I was saying jenky all the time. That is a real word that is used by the.. umm.. english? Canadians? Oh, well someone really uses it and it's a fun word to say. But I threw out framp to describe something and what was this persons reaction? "Did you say spramp?" The thought was&nbsp;about the phrase that Jack made up on Will &amp; Grace. Now thinking of a made up word from a tv show should have tipped off the fact that I was just making something up. So when I responded that I said framp not spramp,&nbsp;it was &nbsp;just acknowledged it and moved on. I tried again later and still no reply. So next time you want a fun experiment try using it. If you don't, you're so framp.

      Ok, so I went to see some bands recently. They were Green Circles, Honorary Title, the Prids and either Foxtrot or Voxtrot... I'm confused on the name apparently. So Honorary Title was decided were a group that were good for relaxing, taking a bubble bath, or laying your woman down by the fire. If your woman is a little bit skanky and likes lyrics like "I can taste the cigarette smoke on your tongue while we're swapping spit..." They were second up and were just two people from New York, a mullet tuffed&nbsp;guitarist and his sometimes keyboard companion. (I guess it's ok to have a mullet and still be cool if you're from NY but not cool in any way if you're from NJ. That was the group consensus.) &nbsp;I would have liked to hear a drummer and better EQ.. about all I could hear was the vocals and that prompted the framp incident (to be discussed in it's entirety later). &nbsp; The first band we saw (and unfortunately walked in on during their performance) was Green Circles. I'm not sure, but I think they are a local band.&nbsp; They were really good, and almost did enough to be "the band of the night". This title was tied and later outright taken away. More details later.&nbsp; They were very upbeat and peppy. I think only one song did not meet my approval, and it wasn't so much that I disliked it as it wasn't something that made me happy to be hearing it. So it was ok I guess. Great indie pop that had some touches of the eighties (imagine Chris swooning to this part... domo arigato Mr Roboto.. err, not quite...) The lead guitarist had so much energy that he had to be a freak of nature or on some supplemental narcotic.&nbsp; He had this quirky dance style that was later mocked by someone in the audience, but hey, it takes guts to dance in public let alone onstage... Good show. &nbsp; Third band was the Prids. I think they were from Oregon. The bassist was a fire fingered gal who Don likened to an Amazon that he would not want to meet in a dark alley. Jerk move dancer with plenty of energy and even more talent. The lead guitarist had a kidna bleach blond mohak / high crew cut that would be something you would see in a fighting video game or in some anime... Once again the EQ was suspect b/c I couldn't really hear the vox very well. The band itself was great. I really enjoyed their performance. I would like to hear some of their recorded info to find out what they noramally sound like. I bet it is much better and probably something that you would want to hear a lot. &nbsp; The final band was Foxtrot or Voxtrot.. I dunno.. I'll have to clarify later... You have to appreciate any band that has one person that only plays tambourine and occassional vox. And like any Austin band (including Green Circles) they like to change guitars and sometimes switch people around on instruments. Heck, if you live down the street why not bring every guitar you own, right? Gotta show of f the collection. You also have to talk a lot in between songs and have clever inside jokes that you have to be cool enough to get or pretty much just know the band. Blaugh. But seriously, this band was worth the price of admission alone (in this case it was $5 and well worth it). They were introduced to us (our group of people, not the show) as a kinda Belle and Sebastian band. That they were not. Unless B&amp;S were super happy and on speed and didn't feel like ranging as much. Now that is no insult to Oxtrot, b/c B&amp;S is a super group and no one is going to be exactly like them... or even close. But they were very good in their own way. They got everyone in the crowd rocking. I even stood up off of my bench to passively nod my way through their songs. It was a great vibe for a local show and it was definitely something to look forward to again. If they are coming to your city you should check them out. Just because I said so. And they are so not framp.

      Ok, so I haven't written in a while. Why? The answer is simple.  Need For Speed: Underground.  What is that you may ask? It's a tuner video game where you get to choose a car, make modifications to the appearance and the performance and get points for how well you race as well as how you look. Interesting, no? &nbsp; So anyone who knows me knows that I once had a substance abuse problem with Tokyo Extreme Racer Zero. I would play for hours and hours. Lose sleep.&nbsp; Miss meals. Ignore loved ones. Live for the game. &nbsp; I recently joined gamefly, a game rental version of netflix that had a free trial period. I ordered Tokyo Extreme Racer Three and NFS:U at the same time. Somehow I got Underground first and have been playing it since. I did take two days off this weekend and did not play at all. Didn't even turn the PS2 on for a movie or anything.  &nbsp; But now the smack is calling to my veins, and I will dive deep into the abyss of Underground... until I beat it. And heck, I'm only half way there. I don't even own a Skyline yet. I could trade for a Supra, but somehow my turbo / nitrous RSX is performing as well as I could want, except my drag launches are not as fast as I'd like. Oh well, we'll get to that later... &nbsp; Anyhow, I thought I would write a little before I get back to it so I have some new material to chronicle what I've been doing. Enjoy.

      So as I have seen before, a music that I enjoy is being commercialized and will soon lose what made it good. Indie music is being coopted. Many indie bands have recently been sighted at Best Buy (and I'm sure other stores too) for purchse. Not just a couple of cds on the shelves where you have to dig to find them. Large displays on feature walls and endcaps where it states that the store or the industry or both are trying to make indie big business and turn a profit from it. Hrumph.   What does this mean? That means bands will come out with the intention of sounding indie and maybe even indie radio stations. On one hand it is good. I wouldn't mind flipping on the radio to something other than the college station and hearing indie. Truth is I don't listen to the radio because there is not much that I want to hear there. If I had the opportunity to listen to indie on the radio I might be more inclined. But there is the downfall. Once something gets too big it has to restructure or reinvent itself. And it will lose the values that got it to where it is today.   What will happen? Well, people on the mainstream level will either not catch on or will abandon it at some point. Then when the crest has fallen, the wave of bands trying to sound indie will fall out. Most of the bands that were indie to begin with will have either been overlooked in the surge or have gotten more popular, but inevitably they will change styles to create something new that was more what they were trying to do with the escence of indie. And like "Alternative Rock" preceding it, and others as well, indie will die as we know it. Maybe it is good for music. To keep things stirring and changing. I'm just sad to see the beginning of the end.

      So if you're looking at the times on these recent blogs, they are very late / early. I stayed up too late again and had to be at work too early and then got home and took a nap. That always screws me up because now I'm not able to sleep and I have to be up too early again tommorrow. Maybe I can hit myself with a mallet and wake up in four hours to go to work. Maybe I will one day learn from my past lessons and not make these mistakes again. Maybe...

      So Geeb tells me that his mom wants to look at my blog. I didn't even ask the context. How did she know about it? Well obviously Geeb told her about it, but in what way did he bring it up? What piqued her interest enough to see it for herself? Is she going to find anything worthwile here? Hmmm...  But when Geeb told me that she asked I said "sure that's fine" and then went into my ramblings about how there is nothing important here anyhow. Then Garett said "well if it's nothing important you wouldn't waste your time on it. You don't just put effort into something lacking any value" or something like that. The memory is not so good these days. Anyhow, I guess after that conversation I thought about it later.   why is this important to me? Because I find it easier to talk with a keyboard than with my vocal chords. It's been like that for a while. When I first started college and found out about the internet (geez.. that was a long time ago...) I soon discovered chat rooms and IM. I began looking for people worth talking to and forged what I like to think were very strong relationships. Yeah, I even met a few of them along the way. It was great. I guess because no one is looking you in the face you can type whatever you want. You have a built in protection. If you say too much and are too vulnerable, who cares? This isn't someone that is going to use it against you. This is someone whose only purpose as far as your symbiotic relationship goes is to be your friend. I know someone can be your friend in real life, but it's just different. When you interact with someone in the real world things change. You get to read into things. You get to assume things. With text on a screen you have to clarify. Are you being sarcastic? Was that a joke? Sometimes it is silly to say things like thar in real life and you just have to guess what someone meant. Other things also make it hard to talk to peaople. Well, for me anyhow. So talking to people online was so much easier. It's just easy to confide in people when you don't really know them. Sort of like going into a confessional booth. You have complete anonymity. You can use it as you choose. It was like a spiritual cleansing talking to people.  What does chatting have to do with this blog? Well, I don't meet people online like I used to. And the ones that I do meet are usually kids. Ok, not like little kids.. but high schoolers or young college kids. We aren't the same people. I guess people like me don't really chat online much. Too busy with the real world and real jobs and whatever. So since I don't get to talk to people online as much, I talk to myself. And anyone else that wants to listen.   Blogs are like a little diary. I get to take a though that is in my head and get it out. I get to craft it with words and throw out a few details of it to create an image. It's never complete, nor would I want it to be. Then I can forget about it. But if I want to know what I was thinking about, then I can go back and see. It's nice. Some people think that I say things to get a rise or to make something happen. This is the exact opposite. Instead of making something happen, I just want to leave things how they were. In my mind. At one point in time. Not necessarily now, just some place in the past...

      Ok, for those of you that don't know (which would have included me yesterday), r-132a is a coolant used in newer automotive a/c systems. It is much cheaper to buy than r-12, which older cars have. It is also not an ozone depleted substance like r-12.  why do I know this? Because my a/c is not blowing cold air. One day when I was killing time in Targer, I saw this kit to convert your a/c. Wait, first I saw the refrigerant to recharge the system so you can have cold air. i was getting all kinds of questions in my mind about if this was safe to do or not. I had always heard before that you have to have an authorized mechanic work on your a/c and everything. So I was really skeptical. After reading several of the cans I found a kit and decided to open it up and read more about it. I guess this is common because the employee that started stocking the shelf near me didn't say anything about me rifling through the box looking at the instructions and whatnot. The instructions are simple and straight forward. The procedure is ridiculously simple. Or so it seems. Everything that I do it beyond easy. Just like the enclosed video states (yeah, they are "super high tech" with a little video to watch and all...) The part in the video that isn't mentioned in the manual (which is crucial to not screw up your system...) is that it has to be evacuated. The video describes this as an easy proceedure that most mechanics will do for free since the r-12 is very expensive and they get to keep it.   Armed with this knowledge (oh yeah, I bought the kit after talking with my local honda dealer for a little bit on the phone.. fast forward... shww shww shwww...) and a phone book, I called around to see where I could go to get the r-12 out and the cold air back into my car for summer. Texas + Summer = Hot. I usually don't use the a/c except for late July and August, but no harm in getting started early. Everyone I talked to wanted to charge goofy amounts ranging from $30-90. Ridiculous. One mechanic even tried to tell me that it was a very intensive process that would take a few hours and that is why the cost was so high. I know something is fishy about this guy because he said the cost was 120. When I mentioned that I just wanted evacuation and not a recharge his price only went down 30. The high cost in this scenario is the r-12, not the labor. Don't you hate when someone tries to get over on you? So anyhow, I did find one place that said no charge, but their "a/c guy" is not in until Monday. If I wait until then I might as well go to the shpo that I trust because they do a/c work too. And I have to go there for the accord (see other post).  Anyhow, this is step one of the process. I guess I will update on what happens next.

      Ok, so Jim sends me this  urlLink link  in an IM. I didn't know what it was and I opened it while Mere was sitting here. Needless to say she was not amused. The site is definitely bizarre. I don't know if i'm offended or just think it's funny. I'm kind of middle of the road. I don't know why I'm even encouraging it. Maybe to see what other people think? If you're not a member and you want to let me know what you think, use the doodle board on the right hand side of this page to let me know. I'm curious. Answer the question: Is Jim  perve or just finding humor on the net?             urlLink ">

      Rrrr.. So there is a problem that is now semi-major but it could have been avoided all along. There was a problem a while back where one of the lugs on the accord wheel came loose and it was causing the others to be loose also. We figured it out before we lost a wheel, which was good. We were on a trip to Houston at the time so it was bad. Still, no damage had been done at this point. We needed to get a new lug because the one went awol, but those are a couple of bucks so no bid deal. Still. Here is where the kicker comes. I don't drive the car and I don't really remember these things unless I am reminded about it or have made an explicit point to do something about it.  So lots of time goes by and I am riding with Mere and am reminded that the wheel is not completely on because it is making lots of noise. And Mere is driving at least 70 on it in a 65 area. If you know your wheel isn't on very well, would you speed on it? Rrrr... I have a set of rims that I used to have on the accord but took off because the tires are too expensive and one of the rims is slightly bent. I told Mere that I would put those on until we could get the lug and then she wouldn't have to worry about losing a wheel or something (the rims take different lugs so I had all of those...) When I go to remove the loose wheel, I run into an obstacle. The bolt snaps. Ouch. So now a couple of dollar problem means replacing the entire hub. I don't know how much it's going to cost, but this is something that I'm going to let the mechanic do instead of myself just for time constraints and tool availability. And I think I'm too upset about it for now.   Why am I upset? I guess because sometimes it feels like I am doing the maintenance on two vehicles instead of just one. I have to change all the oils and filters and fix whatever is wrong on them or make the decision to get whatever repaired. The problem is that I am not in one of the cars that often, and some of the things I don't know unless I am told about. Like I need to know ahead of time that in a day or so the oil needs to be changed. Not when it is past due a few hundred miles. I need to know that the break pads are wearing out before they are to the point that they are starting to cut grooves in the rotors. Blaugh.  And how do you never know how much gas you have? I check my gauge religiously. I know I want to fill up at about half a tank, so when I am closing in on 200 miles for the trip odometer then I start making mental notes. "If I drive another 40 miles then I'm going to get gas". Then when the forty miles is up I get gas. Unless it's an inconvenience and then I make a note that I'm going to do it later. I don't constantly end up at the bottom of a tank of gas and not realize it until the empty warning flashes. What's more, she should be paying attention to this since there are some mechanical problems now. I think it is something to do with the fuel line. I don't believe the fuel pump is working correctly and is causing the engine to stall at times. Not to the point where it dies, but where it is in a jerky acceleration. It doesn't do this on a full tank of gas, but does when it is lower than half a tank very frequently. So it stands to reason that you are doing yourself a favor by making sure you have at least half a tank of gas. Not to mention you get better gas mileage on the top half of the tank to my experience. It might even be the dent in the oil pan is causing oil starvation. I want to replace that too. Then once again I'm in the repairing two cars at once kind of thing.  It's not that I think Mere does these things on purpose or anything like that. It's just that these things are annoying to me. I have a view on cars and how I think they should be treated and maintained. I don't like to see any car not maintained to those levels, especially one of mine.   I think Mere is going to get a new car in a few months so that would be the end of that problem. She will have a maintenance schedule and she will have to take it in or void her warranty. That will make her more aware. Also a professional will have to do it so I can just concentrate on one car. We'll see how that works out.

      There is nothing more American than mowing your lawn. Why? Let's look at other countries. Western Europe is so old that people live on top of each other. Most are in apartments from what I've seen, and the ones that aren't are in the country where I guess their cows or livestock handles the grass responsibilities. Africa has plains, where you would rather not go out onto because of the wild animals and it's mostly dusty from what I've seen. Asia has either the vast rice fields or the technological jungles from what the media tells me. Australia has desert like areas and Russia and the caps have snow. Lots of snow. South America has rainforest (which of course is very American to cut it down, ridding the world of possible cures and whatnot.) So there is nothing that says American like having a huge lawn to care for and show the world your skills at keeping a "little piece of nature" for your very own.  There is nothing more Texan than having to cut it every weekend or every other weekend during the summer. As a kid I guess I complained a little but I didn't have much else to do so I really didn't mind. Now it seems to sneak up faster than I am ready for it. Maybe I'm just too old. It was warm out today and I had to drink a gatorade when I finished. You have to keep hydrated in these warm Texas summers. So to all you other countries that don't worry about keeping a piece of well landscaped nature of your own... why would you want to? Go to a nature preserve, not your front lawn. My lawn has weeds and ants that I can't get rid of. I don't even like to go out there when it is freshly cut because our neighborhood has mosquitoes and bees / wasps. Why would you want to spend time out there? I'm trying not to find out if I'm allergic to these things. You know? So anyhow, enjoy your freedom from the rigors of maintenance. To all that have to do this, want to do my lawn also?

      I'm all for celebrating and partying and enjoying time with friends, but some people go too far. We live in a cul-de-sac and our neighbors decided to have like a partial block party. So all the parking spaces on the street were full before we left our house to go see the fireworks (this is around 6 and I can only assume that they had already started drinking at this point.) We thought, annoying but no big deal. We go to watch the fireworks and come home. They now have the street barricaded at the turnaround part of the street and are using the street as their launching grounds. There are more cars than ever and they are parking the cars on the grass all over the street. Best part yet, someone decided to park right in front of our driveway so we can't get inside. Classic.   After ten minutes of hunting for the person that owned the car someone is fumbling for keys and coming to move their car. Of course they are drunk out of their mind. They open the car with the keys only to have the alarm go off while they are inside. It takes them a few minutes to shut off the alarm. (Geez, you just press the button on the keypad...) Then I thought they were going to ram the car in front of them, but they didn't. Much to my dismay I didn't get to witness some idiotic accident damaging some of the partiers property.  So we went inside and watched a movie. By the way, we got home at about ten at night. So the movie is over and it is two in the morning. They still have music blaring. They are still yelling loud. They are still shooting fireworks. My only guess is that someone lost a finger that night because the kids were running around the street throwing them at each other when I got home. Maybe I'm too old, but you have to respect the fact that some people have to work and some people have to get some rest. After midnight you just have to turn the music down and move most of the party inside. This is not true if it is a college party (you keep it going as long as possible and don't stop until the cops come). But in a suburban neighborhood, people move there to get away from annoying people and loud kids. Hmph. Maybe I'll start hitching my pants up to my stomach and shaking my fist at everyone, but that's just how I feel now.

      Ok, so I haven't really even been near a computer in July. Until today. It has been a nice change of pace I must say. I didn't stare at random artifacts and information for no reason other than entertainment. I actually interacted with real, live, reach-out-and-touch people. Woo hoo! Better than that, I got to hang out with an old friend that moved away, an old friend and family that didn't move away (I did), and my cousins and a bazillion other not-quite relatives.   Ok, so for the fourth of July weekend we went out of town. First we visited with an old friend who happened to be an old boss. It was nice to catch up. I think she misses being in tha ATX b/c where she lives the mentality is a lot different. Not as open thinkers. Not as different from person to person. Not as open as far as what you can buy and where you can go to get it. But hey, this is Texas, so what do you expect?  We got to hang out with my friend and his wife and kids. Kids are fun. As long as you can give them back. I like to play with the kids and get them really excited and crazy. Then their parents get to get them back in control. Ha ha. I don't know why, but throwing kids is really fun. I think it is because you get to pretend you have super human strength or something. Why do kids keep their mouths open when going into the pool? I don't know. I worked up quite a sweat throwing kids around the back yard. I think that is the most excercise I have had in months. Dang mcl!  My cousins were in town for a baby shower for my not really cousin. It's funny how family works. You don't have to be related blood wise to start calling someone your family. That can be great. You just get to pretend the bond is stronger than it is and then like magic... it is stronger. I missed out on actual family ties growing up because we moved away from the family when I was an infant. It is nice to feel that bonding that I usually only felt when going back to the bay here in TX. I wish I could do things like that more often. I would also like to hang out with family in the bay more often. Oh well, time and money is all I need to do that.  Ok, that is all I'm going to write for now... hope you had some time off this past weekend and enjoyed it.

      Ok, so I was going to leave it alone, but they are just bothering me now...  I just got a call from an HEB asking which seats are better. WTF? You have  a map to look at and you can zoom in on individual seats, not to mention that you can see where the stage is and where they are in relation to each other.  So my calm answer is "if you put in the number of tickets and price level the system will automatically select the best seats for you."  Now the reply is, "so which seats are better?" I just told you. Didn't I just freaking tell you? Still calm. Restate info in a way that seller should understand. "So which seats are better in row..."  Are you serious? Are you freaking serious? "Do you want me to pull up a map and tell you definitively which seats are better?" I asked her this. Her response? "Well I just want to know which are better."  Load the armament, I have a few morons to meet up with.

      Ok, so one of my jobs is to help HEBs with ticket selling issues and other things. I don't work this job very much so I don't get all of the info very quickly. So today I go into that job and get a surprise.  That HEB lied to me!  I got a call last time I worked about refunding a ticket. It was a valid reason to refund the tickets. I had them check the tickets to make sure that the ticket was sold at their location. They said it was. The normal refund process wasn't working and I made a mistake and didn't see that the event was open so I thought it was closed. I told them that if it was closed then they would need to contact when upper staff was there to refund the tickets.  That guy freaking lied to me!  When he said that they checked the tickets, and I told him where to look, he didn't check or he didn't make sure that the seller was one from his location.  So I get a mass e-mail talking about how we are able to help with refunds and whatnot. So they lied when they called back too! I'm sure the story was much more "this worker didn't help me" than "sorry, my guy is a liar and a moron too..."  But whatever. I know the story and this job is crap anyhow. So screw you lying HEB customer service guy! Blaugh!

      Ok, so I have listened to the new Palomar a few times through.. and the verdict? It's good! I really like it. But in a different way. The vocals are geared more towards being smoothe than the quirky vocals of previous albums. The guitar riffs are geared more towards being discernable than being indie awe inspired. The instrumentation was diverse as opposed to being consistent. So it is with changes like this that it feels like a whole new band. It's a turning point in their sound, but yet it is not better or worse. It's just.. different. I like the old cds. I like the new cd. It's just good stuff.

      Ok, so I got the new palomar. Pleased? Yeah. Super stoked? Not really.  Why? They changed their sound. Now after a few listens, maybe I will think the new sound is better. But I was all excited about hearing a newer / different version of the sound that they had before. They straightened out some of the jenky riffs and smoothed out the sound engineering. It's nearly pop now. Not that that is bad. Sure, I like some pop. I actually prefer a pop sound of indie music. It's just that I wasn't ready for them to change.  I can't really write a review of the cd yet, b/c I only listened to it once in the car on the way to and from work, driving around town... maybe I will start doing that. I don't know why, cause if you know me you probably know the same cds I do, and if not then you probably don't care about them. Anyhow, it's a thought.  So no persecution of the almost MTV friendly new album until I listen to it thoroughly and have a better base to make an opinion with.

      So, I have the new Palomar, and it comes out on Aug. 25th. I was pretty happy and didn't even need to listen to any tracks before purchasing because I have been pretty durn pleased with their albums to date. (And yes, you know you're not a southerner if you paused at durn. You know you're from the deep south if you didn't realize there was anything out of the ordinary with that statement until I pointed it out.) So I got an e-mail to pre order and get it before the official release date. I thought about it and decided that it was a good investment.  So I waited with baited breath and it finally showed up snail mail. I was pretty excited.  Then it dawned on me. I'm excited for what? Because I get to have the cd nearly 3 weeks before anyone can have it? Am I lording this over lesser people that have to wait for the store date? Or don't even know who they are?  I'm excited about the privelage to purchase. How weird is that? I guess we get excited whenever we feel special. Whenever we feel that we get to do something that not everyone else does or when we know what other people don't know it gives us something to feel happy about. I guess. It could be knowing how good something is before everyone else does... it could be doing something in a way that makes it easier for you to do or more fun than other people realize... or changing something to make it better. It's all sorta tied together. So nevermind why, I feel special and good about being able to buy this cd before other people. And isn't our happiness all that matters?

      Ok, so I am filling in for JP on the softball team. I'm sure I'll be in the outfield. Previously I have had problems judging long fly balls so I think I'm going to *gasp* wear glasses to play. I think that will help. Well some cleats would do wonders instead of trying not to slide in running shoes. But hey, I'm only playing one game. So whatever.  I have a blister on my inside thumb from going to the batting cages. I need to get some batting gloves so I don't reinjure it during the game. I think I was hitting pretty well for most of the practice though. My little cajun would be proud I think.  Another in park home run in store? I don't know... but I'm going to try and get on base every time. I've never struck out and I don't plan on doing it now. No pop ups and no long flies. Just good solid grounders me thinks.  Maybe I will have mere's fam take some pics so you can see how well the team does. Or maybe that is just too much. We'll see.

      Rrrrgh.. Getting confused with all the schedules and different start and stop times. Was supposed to be at work at 6 but thought it was 7 like weekends so I came home for just an hour of sitting here. What a waste of gas. Blaugh.  And it is going to get much worse because I will be working three jobs (one of them full time) while starting school at the end of the month. I will be happy when I get to go to my part time schedule. Blaugh. Squared. Times infinity.

      This is completely unrelated to the other post, but there just aren't enough reasons to use the word HO in a post.  So, I'm in training for the state job and the worst part is here. Not for me personally, but for sitting around waiting for everyone else to catch up. There is nothing wrong with not knowing things like alt+tab which is a wonderful shortcut. There is nothing wrong with not knowing a lot of things. But when you double click everything instead of single clicking and can't follow along with a screen at the front of the room (or the freaking written directions in front of you for that matter...) then you need to go take a remedial computer course. Now if you've never had a computer I guess that is a viable excuse. But not really because every job these days requires some computer use. Ok, maybe not like cleaning or cooking or something. But even then it is a good idea to know how to use stuff.  So what did I spend my time doing today? In between doing stuff (basically the times when I was forced to wait..) I discussed Chris Mihm and the Lakers, Shaq and the Heat, the Rockets (going deep into the playoffs in 'o5 baby!), and Quincy Carter getting cut (thith thuckth!). I also made a failed attempt at a bat signal (the light wouldn't go through the scotch tape) and then another larger open air version of the signal (didn't get a chance to try it out yet, but I'm sure I will have time to do that tommorrow..)  All I can say is.. get on my level, HO!

      Ok, I had to write this one down before I went to bed b/c I will forget. Now bear in mind it is not nearly as funny without me doing the voices, but it is still funny written down. Or so I think.  Ok, once again, working at BB stocking cds and whatnot when this younger kinda goofy looking white guy comes and asks for help with a song. So one of the funniest parts of the story is talking to this guy. Now bear in mind his grandfather or whoever his guardian is that kept checking in on him looked like an old white diary farmer. That made it funny too. Because rap is the new rock. Oooh, I need to do a post about that to explain what I mean. Look for that one later. But anyhow, since rap is the new rock I guess it is popular enough that this kid likes it. He told me he watches BET a lot. Well at least someone does. I can't say that.. lot's of people do, but not me. I don't have cable.    Now the first thing he said is "do you know that song that says 'you could never get on my level.. HO..'"  Now at first I was awestruck. I mean, I have never had anybody come up to me like that and say something that caught me offguard. Maybe it was because I didn't expect anything like that coming from this fairly young white guy. He looked, hmm.. how do you say, blandly suburbian. By the second time he repeated the song lyric and from talking to him I came to realize that this young man had mild retardation. Now that isn't what makes the song funny. It's just the picture of this kid liking this song. And someone yelling "ho" at me in a way that I couldn't possibly get mad at them for. And the way he said it. haha. I couldn't figure it out at first because I guess he listens to the unedited version and the only time I hear it is on the radio. But then I remembered more of it... so now in my head all I can hear is "you can never ever, ever ever, get on my level.. what.. get on my level.. what.." and from the 'what' I'm thinking this has to be lil John. No one else would say what so much. So I'm looking through his albums trying to find what song it might be. So I'm searching by song titles trying to find "get on my level" or "never ever".. Finally I just said, you know what, it's probably on the Trillville Kings of Crunk cd.. so I pulled that one up and while I looked through the album there it was.. the Neva Eva track.. mission accomplished. Hilarity ensued. In my mind at least.  Then he also said "I have a twenty, two fives and two ones. Can I get another cd?" So I was thinking what else this guy might like. I asked him if he liked anything else or just rap. He pretty much just likes rap, so I was thinking of what our specials are. Juvenile's cd Juve the Great was on sale, so I played that for him to. "In My Life" was all he needed to hear and he was hooked. That part wasn't very funny at all...     Ok, I don't think this is coming out as funny as when I told mere.. and I'm sleepy. So I should rest some.. but when you read this and then listen to a rap station, just try and keep that out of your head now... "you can neva eva, neva eva, get on my leval, WHAT, get on my level, WHAT..."

      Ok, I don't really remember my rants by the time I get to the computer these days. So this is where I want help from you. I want you to post your ideas for topics that I can discuss or just email them to me. Then I will try to write about all of them. That will be my challenge. You will be my muse. Unless you are a moron. Then perhaps you can be my idiot savant.  Help my blog fly higher than an eagle. You can be the wind under my wings.

      Ok, so I think that I finally found out why there is water leaking into my car on rainy days. You see, fixing an old car with very little time is like how a poor fisherman fixes a boat. You find one hole, you patch it. You take it out the next day to see if the problem is solved. You leak again the next day, you try to find another hole and patch it.  So I have done a few repairs and leak patching to try and solve the problem. I've even cleared some drain tubes and other options that should have fixed the problem.  Today I think I found the culprit. The only problem is that I need to get some materials to fix the problem. I either need to get the factory seals for the tail lights or go and get something similar, which I think can be found at fabric stores. And yes, I have spent some time in fabric stores prior. That doesn't make me a nancy boy. That makes me a rennaissance man.  So I guess there is an update needed on that one as well.

      Ok, so I was thinking that since I don't have time to make new posts and whatnot that I will try to make posts at least on Wednesdays. Why Wednesdays? It's an arbitrary day. That way all of my comment posting friends can just expect there to be new stuff on Wednesday night or at least Thursday at some point. So you don't have to leave comments about how I'm lacking in posts. There ya have it. Wednesday New Releases. True Dat.

      Ok, so I was writing another post and mentioned height. It dawned on me that I need to address something very serious in our culture. Men and women need to stop lying about their heights. I'm 6'2". No need to lie about it. I would like to be taller, but I'm not. What bothers me is when someone that isn't even 6' even tells me that I'm not my height b/c they are my height. No frickin' way. People lie to themselves so much that they don't even know their own height. People will measure themselves with their shoes on, thick soled of course, and then round up to the next inch to use as what they call their height. I take my height from going to the doctor, taking off my shoes, keeping my back and neck as straight as possible, and letting a professional tell me how tall I am. Same height since the ninth grade. No changes. You're just shorter than you think you are.

      Ok, so I'm working an 8 hour shift at Best Buy and I'm working like normal.. Now since I'm 6'2" (or higher b/c people lie.. see * below) I am not used to people much taller than me. I was surprised to see someone towering over me in the rap section. I walked over to see if he needed help.. and I was shocked to see it was Chris Mihm. Ok, so no one outside of NBA fans (prolly not too many of them) and UT Basketball fans (a lot since he went to hs here and played college ball here) would recognize him. They would be thinking that there was just some tall guy in their store. So anyhow, he didn't want any help and I said something stupid like "are you ready for another great season?" At the time I said it I was still trying to remember the details.. cause my brain takes vacations when I work at BB. For some reason the fact that he graduated like four years ago eluded me and when I said it I was thinking college. Right after I said it I remembered he went pro early a long time ago (I thought he needed another year, but what do I know). He said something about heading out to LA. That probably also helped trigger my memory of him not being a college guy anymore. I just looked at the NBA page to see he is now a Laker. Hmm, do I cheer for him or against him? Decisions, decisions. I guess since the Lakers imploded I can cheer for him.. And plus his NBA career so far has been pretty limited and a role player mostly. Which is good. Work ethic will take you a long way.  I guess more important than meeting someone semi-famous was how I reacted. I always thought I would treat them like a normal person and not treat them any differently. I helped him find cds just like anyone else (He likes Lil Scrappy and Trillville and lots of other rap stuff.. he owns Talib Kweli and likes Blackstar and stuff like that...)  So I'm not one of those moron lame-os that rushes over to people and make them feel like they wished they didn't leave the house. I am super laid back treat 'em normal guy. And I rule.  *I was going to put a footnote in this post, but I will just make a whole new post titled "*"

      Geez.. so I had a book a long time about about html coding. Apparently none of it stuck with me. I wanted to put a link into that post about Jon, and it took me forever to figure out. There is a little blogger help that I went into. It had some "cut and paste" stuff that you can just put into your blog. That stuff was not working. I guess it was user error. But wtf, it was not how I wanted to do it. I tried modifying their stuff so it would work the way I wanted it to, but not luck. So I ended up just opening the code on a page, hunting through it for some code that looked right, changing it to what I wanted, and test driving it on that post. It worked in the testing stages, so I hope it still works when someone wants to see it. Pooh. Maybe I should have just called Geeb.

      Here is a   urlLink link  to some pics of Jon and friends. Jon is my cousin, and the one in the green civic hatch. You can see pics of him, his girlfriend and his engine bay there..  It was at an rx7 meet somewhere out in cali...  Jon got dusted by the convertible rx-7. He blames it on having two passengers while the convertible had just the driver... Hmm.. sounds reasonable. But what would the outcome have been if he didn't? Like how many licks to get to the center of a tootsie pop, we may never know.  Enjoy the eye candy...

      Ok, for those that don't know, that is the famous ending to the Dave Chappel Show. Why does that apply to me? Because I'm doing what the rich guys do.. putting money towards my future!  I opened my very first IRA today (well one that wasn't set up by an employer or something like that.) Actually I only did it b/c an IRA that I had with a former employer had to be rolled over or cashed. There were penalties involved with cashing it and no fees to open an IRA. Since I am not hurting for money now (what with the three jobs and all) I decided that I could just roll it over. It wasn't much, but maybe in time it will grow.. I guess I have to contribute to it to make it grow.. whatever.  So now I have a little chunk of change that I will probably just leave alone forever and it will be like a pleasant surprise. One day I will open it and say "wow, it grew all by itself"... or maybe not. I am no financial genius. But anyhow, I have one.. and I'm rich.

      Ok, so I went to have the a/c looked at.. again. The leak causes all of my precious r134a to leak out of the car and into the atmosphere. Now, before you get all greenpeace on me, r134a is supposed to be non harmful to the ozone and all.. That is why any joe schmoe can buy it. And it is cheap. But not if you have to refill it every day.  Ok, so they put the car up on the rack to take a look at it and all... There is a seal that is leaking. I'm thinking, good news.. just a seal. But then it gets worse. Much worse. Turns out that my car has an a/c part infamous for getting rusty and trapping leaves in a pool underneath it. I guess that is what happened. The parts alone would be about 360. With labor and all it would be about 600. RRRrrrr..  So, it's already August, and I've already dealt with most of it. It will be really hard to keep going in August and the beginning of September without it, but I just didn't want to spend that much on it right now. So I'm going to sweat instead. Good trade off? Probably not. But I don't have to go to the spa to use a sauna. I just need to hit rush hour traffic and let the pounds melt away. Blaugh.

      Ok, so this past weekend was Marshal's bachelor party weekend... I was quite surprised to find out. I got a message from Adam on my phone when I got out of work Friday night. If you know Adam then this was quite a surprise to me because Adam has been working in France for over a year now. So I went over to the bar they were hanging out and and had a few drinks. Ok, a lot of drinks. And a few shots. In a short period of time. But hey, you have 2.50 Long Island Iced Teas and a designated driver as well as a short time before you have to leave, then you might as well take care of business. And then I went to the Voxtrot show, as we had been planning to do prior to learning about the festivities. And drank a little. But I don't do that stuff all the time, so I'm not an alcoholic or anything.  Saturday it started as more of the same. This time, more shots (a lot more shots) and more drinks (about the same.. which was still a large amount). Feeling good at this point might be an understatement, but let's leave it at that. Feeling good. Then we entered the surreal. The bachelor party moved to a .. ahem.. gentlemen's club called "Perfect 10". Umm.. dunno about that, but let's just agree and move along. Somebody knew somebody and we got in free. Which I am guessing would normally be a hard thing to do. Or maybe not. So, there is this huge room of chairs and naked people walking around. Kind of like a poor man's Playboy Mansion. And of course everyone takes turns buying the groom lapdances. Unless his fiancee is reading this. Which she wouldn't. But if she is, we just stayed at the bars. Or something. Back to the point, afterwards I talked to a few random people about their experiences because I had never been to one before. It seems that there are a ton of moron guys out there that will go to one of these places and spend like 4 -600 in  a single night. And brag about it. And possibly do it again. Why? How sad is life that you would end up spending that much money on a stripper? Is it filling some void in your life? If so, I would need to find a less expensive vice. Even if you are making pretty good money, that is probably a weeks salary. Unless you are making very good money and above.. which I'm not. So my frame of reference is limited. But anyhow, that is way too much to spend on something that frivolous. The only thing that I can think of is that the clients think that they have some connection with the entertainers. They think that they are soul mates because they are so interested in them and spending so much time with them. Here is a public service announcement to anyone who believes this:  You are a customer. The dancers are just there to make money and you are an ATM to them as far as they are concerned. They are only thinking of how they can take the money out of your pocket and put it in theirs. Well I guess not pocket, because they don't have any. Or if they do I didn't see any. But maybe I wasn't looking for them. So anyhow, the sooner you realise that there is no bond, no connection, no specialness to you except that you have money that they want the sooner you will be able to let go of this craziness. Then you can start to build a real relationship with someone. Then you can truly experience a real human relationship. But of course it will take more effort to some someone naked. You have to take the good with the bad.

      Ok, so some wise acre told me that I am lazy and need to update my blog. Yeah yeah.. so I do.. but not 'cause I'm lazy. Here is an update on my day to day activities. I work. I eat. I sleep... well not so much with the sleeping. Three jobs. What is wrong with me? Tommorrow I get the discount at Best Buy so I could just go on a shopping spree and then quit. Or I could just not work at the ERC, but the work is so easy usually and it actually pays more than BB. And the state job is pretty great so far but it may only be temporary unless a fulltime position opens up. Decisions decisions.  I am freaking tired. I need to go back to school to take a break from all this work.
