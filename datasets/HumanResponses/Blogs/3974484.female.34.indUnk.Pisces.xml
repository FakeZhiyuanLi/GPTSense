      Just got back from a spur-of-the-moment trip to Jersey.  As my intrepid husband flings himself into the insanity that is the Democratic National Convention, I figured there was no use in staying home by myself when I could easily impose on my family to entertain me.  Naturally I visited  urlLink The Wooly Monmouth,  and later that evening had drinks and dinner with Dori, Gary, and my mom.  Dori mentioned that if we wanted to, we could raid her stash of scrap yarn at their house.  Well say no more... we were there in a flash, and suddenly I'm the proud owner of two shopping bags full of yummy yarn.  Hey, stop your smirking.... this is a big deal for someone who would've needed two or three years to accumulate so many scraps.  My first order of business with my new-found treasure is to see if I can make a funky, multi-textured scarf like the one I fell in love with at  urlLink Knitter's Dream,  a wonderful yarn shop here in Harrisburg.

       	 		 		 Having mastered the art of the I-cord (yes folks, I figured it out.  Definitely was overthinking it.  Definitely.), I now pause for a moment to reflect on projects past.  With a lot of finishing help from Dori of  urlLink Wooly Monmouth  fame, I made this poncho from the Rowan summer catalogue using their Cotton Braid yarn.  I modeled it for Joan and Tammy, two of my very favorite gal-pals, and they RAVED about it!  Definitely makes me feel better about things after the I-cord incident.   Definitely.  		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink poncho detail 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink The Accidental Knitter .

       	 		 		 This kind!  Here's a detail pic of my current project:  a tank top from the Spring/Summer 2004 issue of Vogue Knitting.  I'm up to the point where I'm supposed to make a 4" I-cord on each side, but I just can't figure out how to knit it.  I've tried following a couple of different explanations... no luck.  I must be overthinking this.  Why else would they call it an Idiot Cord???  Don't answer that. 		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink Color detail 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink The Accidental Knitter .

      I know what you're thinking.  You're thinking, "An Accidental Knitter?  What, did she pick up a couple of sticks and a ball of yarn one day, twirl them around and suddenly create a pair of socks?"  Sadly, no.  But I think you could say that it's in my blood.  I come from a family of knitters.  Both of my grandmothers (and their mothers and grandmothers, no doubt), my mother, my aunt, my stepmother, my sister-in-law... even my brother, all learned this craft to one extent or another.  And I knew I'd join the ranks someday, but always put it off due to a busy schedule, other hobbies, too much work, too little money.  The journey began on May 22, 2004.  After months of planning and hard work, my sister-in-law Dori opened her  urlLink yarn shop  in Red Bank, NJ.  I wouldn't have missed this event for the world, so I drove in from Pennsylvania to join the festivities.  And as I sat at her beautiful antique table surrounded by cubbies of yarn, I suddenly found myself learning to cast on... then how to create knit stitches... then deciding between making a scarf or a belt... "... and how would you like to pay for that today?"  Two months and six projects later, I have seen the light and then some.  My ancestors would be proud.  So come along with me on my journey to learn about all things knitting.  Perhaps someday, those socks will appear!

      What a strange week.  My routine was really thrown off with John at the DNC all week, and to make matters worse, work is really getting to me.  Stress city.  But... now that John has made his triumphant return, things are looking up.  Sadly, I still have to deal with work, but we finally scheduled our VACATION, which certainly gives us something to look forward to.    So, back to my tank top (MUST complete before we leave):  the knitting is finished!  Just have to sew it together and, *gulp*, block it.  This will be the first garment I've blocked, and I'm praying to the knitting goddesses that all goes well and that it actually fits me afterwards.  Stay tuned... !  Meanwhile, I've started a keyhole scarf for my friend Tammy.  It's the same as the one shown in Debbie Stoller's very wonderul book  urlLink "Stitch 'N Bitch:  The Knitter's Handbook" .  It doesn't look like much yet, but very soon I'll be posting the finished product.  This scarf is warm, practical, and incredibly fun to knit... I just hope Tammy likes it as much as I do!
