      Ok so right now I'm sitting at work I have to be here till 7pm and it's 1:40. I have taken about 4 phone calls. I'm slept for about 20 mins. I think it's safe to say I'm completely board. So I thought what not a better time to make a blog. I know there are LOTS of people out in the cyberworld that have nothing else to do also.  ABOUT ME Well my name is Stephanie. I from Fortville, Indiana a small town about 20mins northeast of Indianapolis, a one stop-light town. lol We have 4 gas stations though. And 4 places to Drink =) there's a DQ and a Subway but that's just about it. The best place to eat is The Dinner, and my Favorite place to Drink is called The Pub it's next to The Dinner lol. Ok so I graduated from Mt. Vernon High School in Fortville, in December 96 and shortly moved in with my then boyfriend Ryan. We where off and on I moved out a few times. Till this pass January I left then moved to New Port Richey, Fl in March 04.  Life with Ryan.... I met Ryan from a phone chat line back in 96 me and my best friend deter had called just to mess with people and there was two guys on named mike and Ryan so we decide we had to talk to them. We hit it off and all decided we had to meet. So Dedra and I drove to BeechGrove on the SouthSide of Indianapolis to meet them. Ryan and I where together for 7yrs off and on. There's not the time to talk about everything that went wrong. Maybe it was that I had cheated on him a few times or that he never seem to keep a job. or he is a spoiled rich kid. But we did have some good times. And I have some great friends now. I left him like I said on his 30th birthday and moved to a friends house. I do miss him and our dog Mini. I hear he's finishing up school and doing good.  Over the 7 years i was with or not with Ryan I had been with a few other that i'd like to talk about. One Being my x best friend kathy's brother, and that's why we are not friends anymore. Don't EVER date your best friends brother!!! bad bad news. Then another was My best friend Todd, I cheated on Ryan with Todd. It kinda just happened one time, we had a very short "thing" and we aren't friends anymore If I could go back I'd not have done that. He was a good friend other than the whole using me thing. or maybe i'm better off with out him. There was Charlie I met him during my time that I went to the goldbrick tavern alot. he the only guy i've ever taken home from the bar. lol err taken back to my cuz's house. Another one I cheated on Ryan with. Charlie is a drunk and I am glad that we aren't together. He lives near me now and I have talked to him but that's all cuz he's still the same. somethings I guess never change... there were more guys but nothing worth talking about.  On to Ed. I met ed at the pub in fortville when I was 22 he was 37 I wasn't with Ryan at this time. Ed is the first guy I think I ever truly loved. I would have done anything for this man. Not many of my friends like Ed but I didn't care. We where together for about 9mons then decied just to date. this went on for about 3 year total I was with Ryan a little during this time. Ed broke my heart when his best friends girlfriend set him up on a date april 03 he pretty much quite calling me broken hearted I went back to Ryan. Ed got married this past July. we still talk from time to time. and i'm starting to get over him. And as before there where more guys after and during this time. Some like Tim, Wes, Chris, And Bubba are worth talking about.  Ok so now I'm with John, he's great. I met him online. We are just starting out in our relationship. I haven't cheated on him or intend to. I don't believe once a cheater always a cheater. Yea I have been with my share of men. He doesn't know quite how many. He's only been with 2 others beside me. he's only a few months older than me.  So now theres alot that's happend since i've moved here i'm homesick and i'm sure you hear about everything that happends to me here in NPR. I have a new job and a new man. I'm sure Theres alot of fun times ahead. Here's to my NEW life. I time to start over. I came here to change. And I got off on the wrong foot. But I came here to better myself and that's what I'm going to do.....  till next time, I'm sure it will not be long.......  Stephanie
