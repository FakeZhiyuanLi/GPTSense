              Artist :        Celine Dion          Title :        That The Way It Is          Hmm, yeah I can read your mind And I know your story I see what you're going through, yeah It's an uphill climb And I'm feeling sorry But I know it will come to you, yeah And don't surrender 'cause you can win In this thing called love  1 - When you want it the most There's no easy way out When you're ready to go And your heart's left in doubt Don't give up on your faith Love comes to those who believe it And that's the way it is  When you question me For a simple answer I don't know what to say, no But it's plain to see If you stick together You're gonna find the way, yeah So don't surrender 'cause you can win In this thing called love  Repeat 1  That's the way it is When life is empty with no tomorrow And loneliness starts to call (Loneliness starts to call) Baby don't worry forget your sorrow 'Cause love's gonna conquer it all, yeah  Repeat 1(2x)  That's the way it is (That's the way it is) That's the way it is (That's the way it is) Don't give up on your faith (Don't give up on your faith) Love comes to those who believe it And that's the way it is (oh)
