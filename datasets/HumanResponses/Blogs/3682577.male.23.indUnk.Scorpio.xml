      A pretty busy weekend. Worked on paper. Closer to figuring out what it's about. Which is good, since I want to turn it in by Thursday.  Also, I did end up going to that John Kerry house party. It left me feeling ambivalent and agitated. Obviously, Kerry's not Bush, which is just about decisive in his favor. I'd vote for a turkey sandwich instead of Bush. I hate turkey. The whole vegetarian thing. But then, Kerry doesn't exactly make me want to dance Democratic or anything either. The fact that when I got to the party (party here pretty loosely defined, by the way, since it was basically just a sedate get together at somebody's apartment. The high point was when this guy with a phenomenal combination of retina-destroyingly white legs and scandalously short shorts walked in. He was wearing this great shirt that said, "This is your brain: [picture of brain]...This is your brain at 0.99999999999999c: [picture of brain compressed into sliver]." That guy was awesome!), anyway, when I got to the party, there was this ridiculous campaign promotional DVD playing. One of those dispiriting propaganda things, with dramatic low angle handheld shots of Kerry speechifying, gesturing out to an absent crowd, intercut with him playing the guitar, intercut with footage of him back in 'Nam, cruising the Mekong or something. Just establishment politics at its nadir. Bush being somehow below the bottom. The fact that Kerry's DVD was apparently narrated by that guy from Moviefone didn't help his case: "For an uninspiring, dithering, up to his eyeballs in dirty ketchup money candidate, Press one!"  Maybe it's the Critical Theory courses I took this year (which, full disclosure, I absolutely do not claim to understand at all), but this is not what we need. Not to disregard the real differences between them, but I feel less and less like alternating between two elite and elitist parties, which somehow both seem inimical to theory and practice, is the answer to our social, political, global problems. I'm allowed to write sentences like that in blogspace.  Right, but so dilemma. Since I do sort of feel obligated to cast an effective vote against Bush, that is, to vote for Kerry. Rationale being, a partial solution is still in part a solution; and with stakes so apocalyptically high, just about anyone but Bush would be better (Turkey Sandwich, I'm looking in your direction). So what we're up against here: perpetuating a patently unjust system v. the real necessity of regime change. A Hobson's Choice, I guess. Blughckhx.  All right, enough political platitudinizing. Sorry about that.  Anyway, I ran the Race to the Taste Race last Sunday. That's a 5k run through downtown Chicago and along the lakefront, kicking off the annual Taste of Chicago Festival. I haven't actually got to the Taste yet (later this week, I will), but the Race was a lot of fun. Just a really beautiful day, and a nice way to start a Sunday morning. Plus also, I did better than I expected. Finished in just about 25 minutes, which I think works out to a smidgeridoo over 8 minutes per mile. That's faster than I could do just a few months ago. Looks like all that not eating pizza is finally paying off.  I can see why runners get kind of addicted to it too. It's a great feeling to just run around outside, and to be able to cross the finish line.  Hey also, I won something in a raffle! They entered all the runners in a postrace contest, and I won a gift certificate to an Italian Restaurant. I never win stuff in raffles, ever since I had my naive hopes viciously crushed at age like six or something, when I was dead certain I was going to win that Nintendo set. I didn't. Never again!, I vowed. Maybe this certificate to (ugh) Scoozi! is a sign of things to come.  And now, back to work.

      So, I did manage to get to outdoor yoga this thursday past. It was clear and warm and beautiful in the morning, with a nice breeze to keep you cool. Definitely something I want to continue doing. Though it was a bit strange to marvel at an upside-down view of the lake. I'll get used to it.  Now to work for a few hours on the History of Absence, then maybe to a house party for John Kerry.  But first, some more tea.

      Why did I start this blog? What convinced me this was a good idea? I don't like sharing! Whatever. Onwards and upwards and sidewayswards. I turn upside-down into inside-out.  I got up pretty early today, around 6:30am. I really loathe getting up early. It's anathema to me, you could say. Particularly because that's supposed to be one of the perks of the student lifestyle, right? Ability to set own schedule, thereby avoiding the false necessity of the daily grind (the whole evasion-of-real-world-responsibilities- -in-guise-of-ongoing-search-for-enlightenment thing that's supposedly everyone's real reason for going to grad school).  So I got up early today, to go to early morning outdoor yoga. One of the instructors of the Yoga Club (of which I am a part-time member) is holding extra sessions out by the Point. That's where Hyde Park juts into the lake. A very pretty area, with trees and a grassy little field and rocky ledges from which to watch the surf. The contrast of views is interesting: look north, and you can see skyscrapers, the famous Chicago skyline. Look south, and it's much flatter, less affluent, and way more industrial, culminating in one of those nondescript (to me) factories that's constantly pumping out vaguely toxic-looking smoke (cf. White Noise, which you should be reading now instead of this). But anyway, literary pretensions and Chicago's social geography aside, the Point is just a really nice place to be outside in the summer. Seemed worth getting up for.  Malevolent clouds in the sky from the moment I wake up. Still, I hadn't heard that class was cancelled or anything, so I started walking over, hoping for the best. It starts drizzling a little about halfway there, but I soldier on. Why, after months in Chicago, this seemed like a rational course of action, I do not know. And of course, like a block and a half away from destination, it starts raining really hard. I turn back, getting pretty wet. Needlessly wet, since I've got an umbrella but, inexplicably, I choose never to take it with me anywhere. I get to the apartment. Rain stops a minute later.  Not to squeeze too much semantic juice out of this, of course. Rain probably doesn't care all that much, whatever I do. Unless I'm building some kind of diabolical weather control machine or something. But they don't let you do that until after you pass your orals. And anyway, yoga in the mud and cold doesn't sound all that appealing.  Next early morning session is this Thursday. Forecast calls for scattered thunderstorms. Whatever. What with all the paper-writing I'm supposed to be doing this summer, I'm determined to be outside whenever possible. Maybe I'll bring my umbrella this time.  I should probably do some actual work now.   I like yogurt.

      Really, there's a bunch of other stuff I should be doing. Work on the too many papers due too soon. Cleaning (alarmingly necessary at this point). More research. Listening to music I haven't listened to. Figuring out the future. Stuff like that.  But whatever. Executive decision has been made. I'll join the blog crew instead.  So what am I doing? Here in Chicago, theoretically completing M.A. degree in History. Theoretically, because I'll actually have to finish my thesis for this, which seems more and more like a Sisyphean effort.  Incidentally, anyone in the know (the Chicognoscenti, I guess) will tell you that the moniker "The Windy City" actually derives from the rich tradition of blowhard politicians here. Which, fine and everything. But come on! Chicago's really damn windy. As in like meteorological phenomenon, radically leaning over to walk, daily tornado watch terms. As in like all the stuff on my window sill just got blown over terms. Crap.  Anyway, point is is that I'm here in Chicago for a few more months, finishing papers and, hopefully, doing other non-staring-at-Microsoft-Word-type activities. And as best I can, I'll document it for public (who?) consumption right here on this blog. Thanks.

      One week. Under one week.  That's how long I have to finish my work. Everything must be turned in by this coming Friday. Then I am done. It will be grandiferiquent. Acious.  Meanwhile, my place now looks like a scene out of Gummo. Only with more Theories of Communicative Action and Riesen chocolates. It's awful, I have to tiptoe around One-Dimensional Man, The Life of an Unknown and Negative Dialectics just to like reach my kitchen (which, not even going to describe it). This seems just way too symbolic to even contemplate. I have too many bags.  The worst is my bathroom though. It's not like a Biohazard site or anything. But for whatever reason, the hot water knob has stopped working in my shower. I can spin the damn thing until I get angry (this does not take long in the pre-shower mornings), but to no avail. All I can get to come out is this mind-shattering, scrotum-tightening ice water. Taking a shower is sort of like being hooked up to that life-draining machine from The Princess Bride. But I still need to be clean, right? So right now, my stopgap solution is to stand in the shower, pull back the curtain, lean over to the nearby sink and kind of throw warm water at myself, intermittently scrubbing myself with the sliver of cheap-ass soap I have left, trying not to slip to my death, trying not to think about my hair, trying not to think about Georges Bataille, all the while getting water all over the floor. As a means of hygiene, this works about as well as you'd imagine. I think I might have to brave a shower tomorrow. Of course, I should probably just, you know, talk to the building manager and get him to fix it.  My form of subversion: I've managed to smuggle the phrase "gigantic burgers" into my Habermas paper. Tremble, Academia, Tremble!  Cucumbers.

      The end is in sight. At least academically: by the end of this month, I must turn in my last two papers. One on the treatment of analytic philosophy in Marcuse and Habermas (*WARNING* To anyone who thinks it's a good idea to write about stuff like this, in fact it's not). And, at long last, my M.A. thesis, which is on Theory and Practice in the Collège de Sociologie. Sorta. I think. And....HEY, look over there!  [runs aways, trailing in his wake a few fluttering pages bestuffed with nonsensical ramblings on Durkheimianism and Georges Bataille]  Anyway...I do like the stuff I'm working on, of course. But it'll be good to finally get it over with.  Better get back to work.

      Finished. I turned in my thesis last Friday. I have now completed my M.A. degree. This is weird. Huhn.  It's been a pretty focused year, in a kind of unfocused way. That doesn't make any sense. It's taken me a damn long time to finish the thesis, having put it aside numerous times throughout the year. But I do think this last paper is - appropriately - a culmination of what I've learned here in Chicago. At least in some ways. Whether that actually shows up in the paper, or is just a figment of my Bataille besotted brain, I don't know.  Anyway, it's strange. Finishing papers has sort of been my guiding principle for the past I don't know how long.  Now what do I do?  I can explore Chicago without feeling like I'm shirking my duties as a Grad Student. That's good. Actually, I've started to do this a little already. I went to the Venetian Night on Saturday. That's one of the big annual events here. People decorate their boats in lights and themes and stuff and sail them along the lakefront, which is thronged with everyone else. Big fireworks display afterwards. This year's theme: Broadway musicals. This is fine of course, except for the like 14 boats about Grease, which, you can just imagine my enthusiasm. Best sight of the night: the two separate boats dedicated to the Shriners. According to a  banner on one of the Boats, "It's not a parade without the Shriners!" Meanwhile they're dancing around in surgical scrubs and little fez hats. Admittedly, I was mainly amused by visions of them launching those funny little cars into the drink while that last irritating song from Grease recedes in the background. The one that goes "Chang-Chang-Changgity-Chang-Walla-Walla-Kazaam-von-Cupcake." You know the one I'm talking about.  Incidentally, I do think there's something a little strange about these tribute phenomena (as in, why a floating Broadway revue?) I think it might have something to do with reference. Can't quite put my finger on it at the moment.  Whatever. I'm finished. Topics like the above become leisure now.  Might spend a weekend in Madison at some point. Seems like a neat place.  I just ate an entire mango. I think I'm pregnant.

      Here is a fun game you can play while cranking through the last putrescent vestiges of the Fountainhead. 1. Give yourself an interesting megalomaniacal moniker. For example, let's use the Ultra Supreme Perfect Being on Earth. 2. Introduce this name into normal everyday things that people do.  We obtain such gems as... "The Ultra Supreme Perfect Being on Earth is having a chicken sandwich for lunch." "The Ultra Supreme Perfect Being on Earth just checked his rearview mirror before changing lanes; this is the perfect way to change lanes." Some people enjoy poop, so we have "The Ultra Supreme Perfect Being on Earth is now pooping in a hotel bathroom."  If you mix instant coffee with instant hot cocoa, the result is a good result.  What's the story with Don DeLillo? I just read Cosmopolis. I was significantly less impressed by this work than by, say, Cryptonomicon. In fact, Cosmopolis sounded very much like the book that Kivistik would write about the Information Superhighway. Thoughts?

      So, before yesterday the best news story I'd ever heard on NPR was on late at night (around midnight) when they play BBC selections from all over the world. There was this story from Germany. Here was the story: It seems a man had a life long desire to kill and eat a person. Just any person would do. He made it into his forties or fifties as a normal work-a-day German. At that point, he started to advertise this desire on various web services. He got a series of applicants. He corresponded with them. More than one of them came out to his house (he lived outside of the city) for a meal and an "interview," leaving completely unharmed when they turned out not to be completely sure of their decisions. Don't worry though, the story has a happy ending. Eventually, he found a man who passed all his test. They eat dinner together. Had wine. Then, our hero calmly killed the man with a knife. He stabbed him in the chest. I like to picture this part something like that scene near the end of Saving Private Ryan with the hand to hand combat. He then, proceeded to eat part of his guest, saving him for later. How do I know all this? How did it end up on the BBC? He was being tried for murder and his defense was that it was a mercy killing, on a level with assisted suicide -- a punishment, in Germany, which, apparently, only carries a small monetary fine, as opposed to the life jail sentence associated with murder -- and the defense submitted a video tape of the whole endeavor. I don't remember what the verdict turned out to be (you can read about it  urlLink here  if you want to know, but I'll warn you that the print version strips away the folksy charm that the BBC radio version had and that I've been trying to impart here), but it wasn't the full sentence for murder. At the time, I just thought that this was so great because it's such a moral quandry. Was what this man did wrong? If so, how wrong? Is it akin to not helping a suicidal person who comes across your path, or of hunting down a victim to murder? Should it even be illegal?  Anyway, yesterday, I heard a totally unrelated story (except for the fact that I think it also took place in Germany) that might surpass the German cannibal for pure weirdness. Apparently, scientists in Germany have discovered a gene that controls the point when muscle growth stops. Or, more acurately, they discovered a gene that (if you have both copies, it's recessive), makes it so that you don't generate the hormone that tells your muscles to stop growing. They discovered this because of. . .an incredibly strong baby. A super baby. This baby has the gene from both parents and so no hormone inhibits the growth of its muscles. It (he?) is four years old and can lift eight pounds with each arm. Picture a baby, or a little kid, with lots of muscles.  Anyway, in school I think part of the reason we listened to NPR 23 hours a day was because if you listen enough, eventually you hear it wander out past the edge of sensible reality into areas like these. You can always tell its happening because of the audible delight in the voices of the program hosts. I remember lying in bed late at night and laughing listening to an hour long program about "caravans" (campers) on the BBC. It just went on and on into all of this rediculous detail about caravan culture and sales and trends.   I guess hearing the story about the super baby with lots of muscles made me nostalgic for those moments. Half of the fun of them is sharing.

        I don't know if you guys have seen this yet, but the Supreme Court just handed down a decision that blocks the Child Online Protection Act from taking effect.  This act would have required sites containing "objectionable material" to use age verification before allowing users access to said material.  The Supreme Court said, in a 5-4 split, that this was too restrictive, and it wasn't clear that the onus of protecting children from porn needed to be on the webmasters, rather than on the individual users.  This seems like a relatively "liberal" decision, so it makes sense that among the majority were Ginsburg, Souter, and Stevens (pretty consistent liberals), and Kennedy (probably the most liberal conservative on the court).  But I think that it is funny that the majority in a case about preserving easy access to pornography was rounded out by...wait for it...Clarence Thomas.

      There seemed to be a sad lack of fat jokes and friend-hatred on this blog, so let it me known that I am here, ready once again to fill the role of whipping boy and general pool noodle target.  It's pretty great that I have another thing to do not-work with, since I seemed to be spending too much time with my license generation.  I will be out of here in a minute to go catch some Beaver action (sadly, a minor league baseball game), but I just wanted to make my presence known on this hip and with-it new blog.

      Man, I am way behind on my gamecube skillz. Do you know that I have neither finished Zelda, nor even played MarioKart? This is shameful. I write this while not working on papers.  Cameron, why on earth are you continuing this deathmarch through the shitmonster? I doubt it's going to pick up around like page 600 or so. And anyway, if I recall correctly, the Objectivist Club is annoyingly present at Berkeley. They can probably tell you how it ends. And then yammer on about how if everyone just listened to the white man, everything would be peachy keen, or something like that.  Also, Chuck and Buck had flaws. Therefore, it totally sucked. And I reserve my right to vituperate stuff that totally sucks. Though I do actually like Mike White otherwise.  Yogurt + Raisins + Total = Tasty. Odwalla Lime Quencher = Gross

      I'm not listed as one of the contributors to this blog yet, so I was just trying to see if publishing a post would rectify that.  I'm hungry.  It's about time to make that tofu in caramel sauce.  Cameron, from whence came the expression "raving shit-monster?"  It sounds like something I'd say; I'm just blanking on the context.  Or is that information too sensitive to disclose in such a public forum?

      Not all of you already know this about me, so I felt I should share. It's true. Ayn Rand sucks my ass. With syrup. Lapping it up with those sickly, scrawny cracker lips of hers.  Btw I'm trapped now somewhere in The Fountainhead. Nearer the end, thankfully. A more apt title of this "raving shit-monster" (thank you, Will, for that turn of phrase) would be something like "A Study of the Mating Habits of Ubermenschen in their Natural Habitat" or perhaps "The Ubermenschen Fuck, Too!" Some others that I have considered include "Fuck Nature!... Huh? Fuck You, Too!" and "My Piss-Poor Philosphical System Also Produces 'Raving Shit Monsters' in Literature!"  For some time now, a sci-fi/fantasy author by the name of Patricia Morrison-Kennealy has had the distinguished honor of nibbling my black asshole with Mensa-tested cracker lips. But now, a challenger has come, the challenge laid, and White Womanhood has found a new, and far greater, Syrupy-Ass Sucker.

      Will, since I assume you're pretty busy on the tour, I'll take on the whiny Laker fan role for a moment. It seems Vlade Divac has signed on as the Lakers new center. I have to say, I'm a little conflicted about this. On the one hand, Vlade is a true center (a rarity these days) and a terrific passer. Seems like a good addition to the team. On the other hand, he's also sort of a douchebag. What to think then? A real quandary.  Hope the tour's going well.

      Does anyone recall at time when we used to be able to distinguish between atomic (i.e. fission) bombs and "nuclear" (i.e. fusion) weapons? I have no special knowledge here, but I find it hard to believe that Iraq/Iran/North Korea are on the verge of producing fusion-based weapons, as it took the US and USSR an extra 15 years or more to figure that out even after the A-bomb dealio. For that matter, I think Pakistan and India are still working with atomic weapons. I think the distinction is as important as, say, the difference between a 5 megaton and 40 megaton explosion.  By the way, has anyone heard from Lt. Mikey recently?

      This cracked me up so hard I had to share it; for no particular reason, I was jerking around on iMDB and came across the page on American Pie.&nbsp; The featured review, the one that appears at the top as selected by iMDB staff, was the work of a Jack Christal-Gattanella, of New Jersey.&nbsp; And this is how it begins: &nbsp; "American Pie is a teenage comedy that works on a level and then does not on conservative levels. And that can be summed up by one word as does not not work for conservatives- Pie." &nbsp; OK, so, what have we learned?

      So the latest in Laker developments is that we've re-signed Kobe (which is quite a blessing, considering what we fucking sacrificed to placate his court-bound ass), and then we promptly lost Derek Fisher to the Warriors.&nbsp; That's how unrestricted free agency works.&nbsp; They made him an offer of $37 million over 6 years and he said yes.&nbsp; I'm really, really going to miss him. &nbsp; I guess the role of sports analyst (or, more specifically, whiny Lakers fan with breaking news) on this blog has gone to me.&nbsp; I'm happy to take it; I'm often without Norwegian public sex act stories or revelations about the origins of Jim O'Rourke songs.&nbsp; And any political treatises I might offer would doubtless echo the many already put forth. &nbsp; Also, we're leaving for tour in fourteen hours.&nbsp; It's rather ungoddamnedbelievable that this is actually upon us.&nbsp; And Jen should be home in about twenty minutes, so that's another reason to be happy.&nbsp; I expect I'll see every one of you FPS-ites in the next six weeks!&nbsp; Especially Cary and Greg.

      It looks like we can kiss Shaq goodbye.  Trading season doesn't officially open until Wednesday, but apparently all parties have agreed to a trade that will send that fucking obese ingrate to Miami in exchange for Lamar Odom, Caron Butler, Brian Grant, and a draft pick.  Those guys can produce in the middle, right?  Nothing to worry about?  I would be weeping over this turn of events if not for Shaq's irredeemably callous attitude toward the Laker organization and the entire city of Los Angeles, which erupted so suddenly after our loss in the Finals.  Guy's an asshole.  He's burning every bridge.  Fuck him.  Let the mosquitoes have him.

      A couple of Norwegian music fans face court action after they stripped off and had sex onstage during a rock concert.  Tommy Hol Ellingsen, 28, and his girlfriend Leona Johansson, 21, say  they did it to help save the rain forest. Public sex  is illegal in Norway.  According to Norwegian TV’s Nettavisen, the pair  are members of an organisation called Fuck For  Forest which is dedicated to having sex in public places in order to save the environment.  During a show for Norwegian band  Cumshots on Tuesday, the pair walked onstage, asked ‘How far  are you willing to go to save the world?’, took their clothes off and got jiggy with it.  The band continued to play as the couple had full intercourse.  Police fined the couple £850 each but they are refusing to pay and now face a full court case.  "It is ridiculous that we are prosecuted and  sentenced on a moral basis at the same time as Norway is in the war against Iraq," said Ellingsen.  The last time the couple staged a public sex act, they raised $10,000 for their environmental aims.  However, no environmental group was willing to accept the donation.

      Many of you may, like me, love the song "Women of the World" "by" Jim O'Rourke. I put "by" in quotes because it turns out that it's a cover. I am, right now, listening to the weird  urlLink orginal  courtesy of this cool  urlLink music blog  in and about Potland. The song turns out to be by someone(s) named Linda Hirst and Ivor Cutler (who?). Weird. Weird. Weird. O'Rourke's version is still a billion times better, but it's like finding out that In My Life was written by some Tin Pan Alley wonk you'd never heard of.  In other news, I made a new friend today: a new co-worker who plays the harp, has a dog, a cat, and two chickens, and lives in an old storefront into the walk-in refrigerator (no longer operational) of which she plumbed a bathtub (I'm not really sure about the verb conjugation in that sentence, but can we really be sure of anything in this topsy-turvy world?). Neat to meet new people and have them turn out to be weird and interesting instead of boring and lame.

      Did you guys realize that all boy animals have penises, and all girl animals have vaginas?  Isn't that funny?  Sorry not have contribued to the larger dialogue lately.  As those of you who have been reading Blogging Open Martin (the At Dusk blog), we've been quite busy up in Portworld these days.  Our new record is out (Heights), our festival is happening this weekend (PDXPOP Now!), and our crosscountry tour begins in just under two weeks.  This is all really exciting.  The busiest 6 months, for sure, since I graduated.  But I'm feeling pretty damn good about things right now.  I think we all are.  Especially the Iraqis and Sudanese.   Those guys are party friggin animals.  So what do you guys all think about Edwards as the pick?  I think it was the right choice for Kerry, but - without knowing as much as I'd like to about him - I wish Richardson hadn't been so quick to bow out.  But I'm hopeful about that stuff, too.  What's new with you guys.  Cameron, to allay your fears, I (we all) read your blog, as well as yours Tyson.  If you all started blogs, I'd wager we'd read those to.  Speaking of which, this brings us to the issue of "lost alumni."  Who knows what's up with these folks?:  Mike  Mikey Bernie Sam Ben  I don't know and I'd like to.  Meri, for the record, is gallavanting around Norway right now, leading a wilderness trip.  We'll meet up with her in CT on tour in August.  She will then move down to SF for UCSF to become MDMD.  She's having fun I'm sure, and has a lot to be excited about.  So who of you do we get to see when we're on tour?  The itinerary is still developing, but you can see what we've got on the webpage (and I'll post it here, too).  Also, if any of you feel beneficent, we'd love to be able to sleep on your floor if we come through where you live (excepting LA, where we'll sleep in our own goddamned beds, thank you very much).  Except, Cameron, I think we're just missing you in the bay, no?  Anyhow, I hope you're all well.  Speak here!  Speak now!  Be here now!  Give strangers blowjobs!

      USA Today online lead off their people section with, "Funk musician George Clinton has pleaded no contest to two misdemeanor drug paraphernalia charges." Pull me up a chair.  How come Reid never says anything?

      Alan Keyes must be--and bar-none, including P. Diddy, Cash Money Mob/Mafia (whatever), and all the other strapping black fuckers who make a point of showing off the refrigerator contents and the bedroom where "the magic happens," "the shit goes down," etc--the single most ridiculous, pathetic creature I am actually aware of. My opinion may turn tomorrow, but I wouldn't count on it. This is a putz who is somehow physically capable of claiming, on national broadcasts, that race had nothing to do with the Republican party selecting him to run against Obama. What kind of crazy-monkey-talk is that? Even Hastert had trouble keeping a straight face when asked about this, claiming something like "he wasn't actually there" when the decision was made. Remarkably, Keyes also claimed that he was chosen because of the unique set of skills that he brings to the challenge, which included the  ability  to take the race issue off the table--but that has nothing to do with being black. (I refer the reader to my published views of Objectivistic crazy-monkey-talk.) Subsequently, Keyes first salvo against Obama took the form of  urlLink "likening [Obama's] pro-choice stand on abortion to a 'slaveholder's position.'"  Whaaa? I have all sorts of sick images of crayola "flesh" colored ass-invading dildos running around in my head.   Okay, I'm just vituperating for the sake of it. I like "crazy-monkey-talk" though.

      Has anyone else seen Garden State? Here is a movie with definite flaws, but I think I still really liked it.
