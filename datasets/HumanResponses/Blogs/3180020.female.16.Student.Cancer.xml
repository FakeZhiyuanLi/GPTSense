      Today was quite fun...I made an 84 on Coach Rhodes history test! which is rather astonishing! Jessi's gonna get in really really big trouble for something that didn't happen! I hope everything works out! If another person tells me I looked cute today, Ill kill 'em! lol, not really! but it does kinda get old! not really I just thought id say that for no reason in general....I love it when people say things they dont mean. Its so childish and stupid and I really dont feel like playing those games anymore! so.....ttyl

      Today was great! I didn't have to deal with much of anything.  I slept really really good in first block, and I feel bad for Coach Rhodes b/c he tries so hard, but over half the class sleeps everyday! Im so ready to be out of school.  Im so ready to be gone for the entire month of June! I cant wait!!! Its gonna suck that Im going to be gone when christa goes to the air force academy and its gonna suck that Im going to be gone on my 16th birthday, but it will be well worth it! I HOPE!  hah.....the band banquets coming up.....Im not sure if I want to ask someone or go by myself for the first time! :( :S....oh well...Who cares! I have to get my letters of recommendation from Mr. Day and Mrs. Shelton tomorrow! Im nervous about my application. I really hope everything goes well, and I get in!! Well, Im supposed to be watching nate-man! If you have a comment, you can email it to me at....valerie_w_06@yahoo.com            Thanks

      I've spent almost the entire day with Christa helping her make posters for the democracy elections. I've come to the realize that Im really going to miss her when she goes off to school. She didn't get accepted into the Naval Academy. Her next choices are The Air Force Academy or LSU. The Air Force Academy is in Colorado, and LSU is in Louisiana. In case you didn't realize it, both of those are really far away. Im really sad about her leaving. Im applying to go to a summer course at Dauphin Island and its from June 6-July 2. My birthday is June 28, and Christa leaves for the Air Force Academy on the 26, and that might be the last time I get to see her for a year! :( Things at my house are very hectic. Im thinking about quiting band and getting a job. I also wanna quit so that I can take some business classes! Everything in my life is very very up in the air at the moment. The guy I've liked for 2 years finally likes me and Im not really sure that's what I want anymore. I know I dont need to say yes at this moment, and so does he. But now Im beginning to think that maybe its not what I need ever. I know I love him and I always will, but Im not so sure he's what I want! He's worried about me b/c he knows somethings wrong, and if he's worried about me now, he would for sure be worried if we were to date!  He knows somethings up and it upsets him that he doesn't know what, but I dont wanna tell him everything yet b/c I dont wanna break his heart like everyone else he's dated.  Im really really confused and Im scared he's not going to wait on me much longer, and I cant say I blame him.  :S DRAMA....that's all my life consists of. Me and Jessi got into it last night over a stupid boy, and I honestly never thought we would get into it over him. Im really sorry Jess, and I know I over reacted to something, but I dont wanna think Im being replaced by someone you hardly even know. I know that's not how it is, and I realize that now! FORGIVE ME FOR BEING STUPID AND SELF CENTERED! I love you girly!

      "The Reason"  Hoobastank  I'm not a perfect person There's many things I wish I didn't do But I continue learning I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you  I'm sorry that I hurt you It's something I must live with everyday And all the pain I put you through I wish that I could take it all away And be the one who catches all your tears Thats why i need you to hear  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is You  I'm not a perfect person I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you  I've found a reason to show A side of me you didn't know A reason for all that I do And the reason is you  I used to think that song said it all, but Im learning that my feelings change, and that what I want is not always what I need!        Me and Jessi got up at around 10 to call *you*, but you were already gone.  We came downstairs and ate some cereal.  The best drink that's legal for me right now is probably the milk from after eating frosted flakes! ITS SO YUMMY! lol  I took a shower and got ready for pictures.  They sucked b/c we didn't match, and mom worked so hard to get us to.  I was supposed to spend the night with Jessi, but she chose to do something with Dusty instead.  I love how quickly things change. :(  I haven't talked to anyone today and Im feeling a little left out.  oh well.  I took a nap outside today and read a lot in the book Friday Night Lights.  Its really good! I love it because its about high school football (which is one of my passions) Im kinda tired and bored so Ill talk to yall later! Luvs yo!

      Boys are confusing....1st block...sat on my ass and listen to coach rhodes which is always a treat.  2nd block...sat on my ass and watched dawson's creek with *someone*.  3rd block...sat on my ass and watched people climb the gay ass rock wall, and did a lil bit of spanish.  4th block...sat on my ass with jessi and played cards and talked to a hottie! ;) *right jess* then I hung out in the parking lot and talked to cody and matthew for a lil while.  Cretia brought me home and we chilled here for a little while, then she left to go to some where. lol. then will came over and we hung out...cought up on some things, learned some new things about stuff.  then momma, daddy, me and nate left to go get jessi.  then we went to eat at mudcreek with will and chase.  lmao "yeah man, dude" lmao! me and jessi came home and went to the square with cretia. we hung out there for a lil while and then we went to the bowling alley to meet dusty! we went and got a movie, then came to my house and watched it till bout 12:15 and then he left...jessi's upstairs in the bed, and Im wondering what the hell everyone's doing! not everyone, just a couple someones in particular. I talked to mack tonight and I really miss him, but Im not gonna do that to myself anymore! Its time for me to stop being the nice one.  I cant let him run all over me anymore like he used to!  to *you*...Im really getting fed up with you saying shit all the time about only wanting to hook up, and about fuckin me over and shit. Im not mad about it at all, but I guess you could say Im scared this is all payback for before! I understand why you would want to do that, but I also dont  understand how you could if the things you say are true.  I just needa know what's going on in your head and you wont let me in on it!     Im really gonna go to bed now b/c I have to call and wake *you* up at 10:30 and Im tired as hell as it is.  I hope this isn't a game for you! I really do hope its not! Yall stay cool! I would say leave a comment again, but Im not sure if anybody reads this, and you cant leave a comment yet cause I dont have a thing for that!

      People amaze me...      Im not really sure why *you* want me, but I know you do...so.... you should tell me why you want me! and that might things a 'lil bit easier! anyway....I had a really good day. In first block we did absolutely nothing, 2nd block Mrs. Shelton was gone, and I got to see *you*, 3rd block I have spanish. That is the only class I got a progress report for, and I have a B in there! That sucks major ass, but Im in such a "good mood" right now, I could really care less. I got to sleep out in the sunshine with jess in 4th block today!*love ya girl*  I almost threw up and that sucks.  Im still feeling really sick, but I guess its just nerves, or *something* Lacretia brought me home and from there....well, Ill just say interesting!  I kinda watched switched.  Dont ask me what happened b/c I really dont know!  I watched MXC on Spike television! I love that show...its so freakin hillarious! Its one of the funniest shows I've ever watched.  It makes me kinda sad though cause me and josh used to watch it together, but we dont really talk on the phone that much anymore! :(      I hope things are gettin better for me.  It seems as though when I get what I've wanted for so long, it doesn't seem as important to me anymore.  Im enjoying how things are playing out though.  Shout outs for today....um...Jessi *cause you like him* Dusty *cause you're awesome and Im pumped about "yall"* Cody *cause you kick some major ass* Brandy * cause you make things understandable* love to all yall...post a comment

      wow...sleeping is a vital part of life and I can NOT do it.  My body gets physically tired at like 12, but I finish talking to people on here and then get to bed around 1 or 2, and not matter how physically tired I am, I cant get to sleep.  My mind is going 100 mph and thoughts are just flying through my head...analyzing situations that I would like to happen. Thinking about things that didn't go to well in the day I am trying to end.  Thinking about the past and how I messed up.  Thinking about christa and how much Im gonna miss her, and how she's gonna be pushed to the limit and there's nothing I can do about it.  Thinking about how physically and mentally straining its gonna be on all of us back home.  Thinking about how long its gonna be till I can see her! Thinking about all the stuff I wanna say to her, and how I dont see her enough to get it out.  Thinking about how Im gonna tell *you* that Im gonna be gone for a month.  Wondering if you'll care...Thinking about how much is gonna happen while Im gone, and how Im gonna be totally excluded! overall, I just think about EVERYTHING under the sun and its frightening....not like Im scared, just....consumed I guess you could say.  Im scared to start school.  Im one of those wierd kids that loves EVERYTHING about school, and Im scared that when school starts Im gonna forget about these things, the things that I think about, the things that make me, me!  School is good for me b/c its all a big game.  To me, its a game to see which teacher or student I can fool the most.  Who really thinks everything is ok, when in my world....things could come crashing down at any instant.  I think I split personalities too! But Ill save that for another day b/c I've already written a bunch today. But anyway back to my insomnia....I usually get to sleep around 4:45-5:30....mom wonders why Im such a bitch all the time, and thats part of it, but most of it is b/c my life sucks and most think its just wonderful!  um....I got to see dude last night and that was good.  I was kinda mad when he didn't say anything when his cousin was tryin to hook me up with this random guy that wanted to fuck me on the spot, but ya know...oh well!  I was actually kinda scared b/c of something I had heard about him and you just walked away like it wasn't a big deal.  Oh well, I guess things that you've said recently dont neccesarily mean you like me. anyway...I kinda stole these lyrics out of daniel nolan's blog from like a long time ago, but they're meaningful to me so.... Three Doors Down--Away from the Sun It's down to this I've got to make this life make sense Can anyone do what I've done I missed life I missed the colours of the sun Can anyone go where I am 'Cause now again I've found myself So far down, away from the sun...... I'm over this I'm tired of living in the dark Can anyone see me down here The feeling's gone There's nothing left to lift me up Back into the world I've known.......    Sugar Cult...Memory  This may never start  We could fall apart  And I'd be your memory  Lost your sense of fear  Feelings insincere  Can I be your memory   So get back back  Back to where we lasted  Just like I imagine  I could never feel this way  So get back back  Back to the disaster  My heart's beating faster  Holding on to feel the same   This may never start  I'll tear us apart  Can I be your enemy  Losing half a year Waiting for you here  I'd be your anything   I've been ok about everything until the other day....I knew coming over was a bad idea, but I was forced to go, and Im glad I did....for her sake, but for mine...well, it could have been better

      well....yesterday i went out on the lake for a while, and then i came home and helped mommma around the house, at dinner...around 10, me and cretia went to tha square.  I was really pissed that I didn't get to see *someone* but oh well....there's always some other time though!! :P...Im so pumped about the recent news....Its gonna be cool as hell, and Im down! I went out on the lake again today and it was fun....the tops of my legs are a little bit burnt but oh well.  I leave in 6 days!!!!! :( yall will be glad to get rid of me! lol...........NO, everything i've been working on is gonna fall apart, I can feel it.  Im gonna try to go out tonight and see some people before I leave but I dont know if its gonna happen!! Im gonna try though!!!!  I've been thinkin a lot about the past and how everything just seems to dissapear and noone really takes the time to find out why!  I lost the best thing that ever happened to me a couple of years ago and I'm still tryin to recover. I've been thinkin a lot about it lately and I can't come to a conclusion...what if I could go back and change something ya know? I mean there is so much shit that coulda been avoided but I guess thats how life works. I just wish I could go back but I can't. Some say that there is that special person out there for you and you should wait for them. I messed up and lost mine but....well yeah...I don't want another special person...I guess I'm done.

I went to see how mrs. shelton's doing b/c her dad is really sick and she looked terrible....bless her heart...keep her in your prayers please, then we left and went to graduation at State Farm, then to brownwood's graduation, then to my house to get some stuff, then we went to huntsville for adrienne's sugery, then to the mall, then to eat, then back to the hospital, then back to s'boro, then to wal*mart, then to jessi's then to chevron for freakin baking soda, then chilled there with j-mar and mack, then home around 9...holy crap thats a lot!! lol

      Thanks...thats about all I can say on that subject.  Hmm, memories.....   My big sissy's leaving me.  The infamous kiss today...my lord, I thought yall people were gonna die! lol...It was sweet and if yall were in their shoes, you'd do it too!  Its only a few more days till she graduates, then a few more days after that and I'm gone for a month...she leaves sometime around july 1...she cant make a phone call till July 18, and its for 10 FREAKIN MINUTES!!!! She's gonna try out for cheerleader and if she makes it she wont be able to come home for thanksgiving, or christmas.  :'(  I dont know what Im gonna do.  I know she can do it...hell, she's been beatin on me since I was little, Im proud she gets to take it somewhere else now! *sigh*  she'll be great.  she's tough mentally and physically and no matter how bad I dont want her to go, this is an oportunity of a lifetime.  The Air Force Academy accepts 9% of their applicants on average.  That means that its harder to get into the Air Force Academy than HARVARD, PRINCETON, AND JULIARD!  Everytime I hear a song like letters from home, or american soldier, or something like that, it makes me want to just break down and cry b/c in a few weeks....THAT'S GONNA BE HER!!   I CANT WAIT TO BE GONE.  you say you're gonna miss me, but you know, when I get back, I know things aren't gonna be the same.  I have to beg you to tell me stuff now....am I gonna know anything when Im like 1000 miles away?? um thats a BIG NO!!! oh well...atleast someone's happy. maybe.....for now oh well.....screw it...."Dont try to tell me what to do, Dont try to tell me what to say, you're better off that way"   Me and Becca have been talking more lately and Im soooo excited about that.  Its good b/c both of our sisters are going to college, colorado springs, and northeast are kinda diferent geographicly, but....its still good to have someone to listen to ya! She's gone to look at a golden retriever today and Im sooo excited b/c I love those dogs, but it wont be as purty as Shelby (my yellow lab) no matter what!!!  Aubrey....bless him....I think Im gonna miss him the most.  We dont fight, We dont argue, we just get along, it just works, and I love him to death!! He's sooo sweet, and I couldn't ask for a better friend...*so take some notes yall* If he doesn't write and call, Im gonna kill him though! lol, nah, you know I love ya, but I will be higly pissed! "true"   .....between "us"........I just wish things could get better,  yah, I screwed up by saying that with your family there, but I didn't know your dad was there, and I really dont think anything I said was bad. Its really not my fault you dont tell them anything.  They were eventually gonna find out that the golden child image wasn't true!!!  I wanted to call last night and say sorry for everything, thanks for everything you've done for me in the last......like 4 years.  Its closing time now, and as much as I never thought it would happen, it is.  You've given me more than I could ever ask for, always there for me, always listening, no matter how stupid I acted, or how dramatic or bitchy I was.  I know I take a lot of things out on you and hopefully things will be easier for you now.  You know Im ALWAYS here, Im just tired of seeing you mad at me...Id rather know that theres nothing there than know that theres something but its not progressing!   I love you........  SOME OF MY FAVORITE SONGS AS OF RIGHT NOW....   Dwight Yoakam  The Back Of Your Hand   when you give it up for gone but you're still digging in the mind and you're staring out the window  saying everything wil be just fine keepin with whole affair every word seems out of line no matter what angle you get its polished til it shines   take a guess at where i stand pick a number one to two take a look at the back of your hand just like you know it  you know me too   and when you say who the hell am i living with what just went down where did this come from why are all my colors faded brown when did it change whats with the rage  whos the dude with the extra roll whats the verse, the line, the chapter, the page   take a guess at where i stand pick a number one to two take a look at the back of your hand just like you know it  you know me too    you think you're alone without any place left to go like you need one of those kisses long and slow first glance is not what it seems but there's some things i just know like you take two sugars with a splash of cream   you take a guess at where i stand  oh pick a number one to two then take a look back of your hand just like you know it you know me too yeah like you know it you know me too just like you know it you know me too    Randy Travis  You and You Alone     When this old world gets me down And life's a chain I drag around When I can't find a ray of hope To help me sooth my worried soul  Only you and you alone  Can turn the darkest night into dawn  The only reason for hangin' on Is you and you alone    Holding you close to me Gives me all the strength I need Then I wake up, it's just a dream All that's left are memories   Of only you and you alone Can turn the darkest night into dawn The only reason for hangin' on Is you and you alone   My only reason for hangin' on Is you and you alone.    Keith Urban  Your Everything     The first time I looked in your eyes I knew that I would do anything for you The first time you touched my face I felt What I'd never felt with anyone else    I wanna give back what you've given to me and I wanna witness all of your dreams Now that you've shown me who I really am I wanna be more than just your man    I wanna be the wind that fills your sails Be the hand that lifts your veil Be the moon that moves your tides The sun comin' up in your eyes Be the wheel that never rusts Be the spark that lights you up All that you've been dreamin' of and more So much more I wanna be your everything   When you wake up I'll be the first thing you see and when it gets dark you can reach out to me  I'll cherish your words and I'll finish your thoughts  I'll be your compass baby, when you get lost  repeat chorus   Be the wheel that never rusts Be the spark that lights you up  All that you've been dreamin' of and more So much more I wanna be your everything I wanna be your everything I wanna be your everything   Brooks & Dunn  That's What She Gets For Loving Me     She said what she wants is a man to be faithful A true heart somebody willin' and able To stay by her side through thick and thin A tender touch every now and then  She's not hung up on fairy tales Or some dream at the bottom of a wishin' well Fancy cars or diamond rings What she wants most are the little things   That's what she gets That's what she gets That's what she gets for loving me  At times I lay awake at night Stare at her laying by my side Knowin' there in her heart as she sleeps She can forever count on me  That's what she gets That's what she gets That's what she gets for loving me  Whatever turns her on I'm here to do it Till the day they write my name in stone I'll live to prove it  That's what she gets That's what she gets That's what she gets for loving me   That's what she gets That's what she gets That's what she gets for loving me   Change a couple him's to her's and man to woman, and she to he, and its my life....all wrapped up into a few songs....if you only knew!! no, these aren't just about CK...he's just one of the most influencial things in my life...so what, yall have 'em too!

      I wonder how I ever made it through a day How did I settle for a world in shades of gray When you go in circles all the scenery looks the same And you dont know why Then I looked into your eyes Where the world stretched out in front of me And I realized I never lived before your love I never felt before your touch I never needed anyone to make me feel alive But then again, I wasn't really living I never lived before your love I wanted more than just an ordinary life All of my dreams seemed like castles in the sky I stand before you and my heart is in your hands And I dont know how I survived without your kiss Cause you've given me a reason to exist --- And I dont know why, why the sun, decides to shine But you breathed your love into me just in time

My house is not gonna be the same with them going off to college! :(  While we were at the beach, me and daddy rode the ferry to Dauphin Island, and I showed him around and he was really impressed!  June 6th is creeping up on me quicker than i expected.  Its really beautiful down there and I know I'm gonna have an awesome time, but being gone for 4 weeks sucks really bad to!  Im gonna miss Jessi, and Mack, and Aubrey soooooo much! Its not even funny! If my parents dont get me a dang cell phone I swear Im gonna shoot myself!!! "fo real"  I got to talk to Aubrey while we were at the beach! yay!! I was soooo excited! *tekek* He's sooo sweet! and if you think he has a girl name, I'll tell you like he told me....AUDREY is the girls name, and AUBREY is the boys name! lol.....I just let him think what he wants to on that one! :P  jk with ya!   Im soooo ready to be out of school!  Its gonna be soo much fun for the few weeks that I'm here..then I'll be gone for 4 and yall will all miss me so much (hah I wish...Jessi and Aubrey will, but that's about it) then I'll come home and get my license late since im gonna be gone for my birthday! :( oh well....who needs a birthday anyway!!! lol....I feel ya on that one jess! As long as I get a few cards, I'll be good!  I just thought I'd let yall know that I do NOT like suprises at all!  Its fine if you give me a sweet note or card or something, but I hate it when everyone knows about something that someone's gonna do to me and I dont! It really stinks!  and another thing....when you are calling a person "honey" its not spelled like that its HUNNY *aubrey* and just b/c you think someone tastes like honey, doesn't mean you should tell them about it...that's like telling someone you're sex fantasies or something.  You only share those when you're face to face! lol, but I'll let it slide this time but dont let it happen again, oh..and another thing....if you're going to sleep, you probably shouldn't tell people to call you, b/c when they wake you up they kinda feel bad! just a lil tip....hmm anything else I can think of.............nope, not today!  I hope yall had a great weekend b/c i know i did!! ttyl

      hmm......thursday me, lacretia, and chelsea went to the talent show until about 7:35.   Then we left and went to BV to meet allison, blake, dereck, sterling, liz.  We ate and saw kirby, tittle, kevin, luke, lauren j., JP, and ben.  We were singing karoake and having a big time....I got home that night at about 10:30.  Friday night I had the band banquet which was as always quite boring.  After that, me and Lacretia went to the my house to change clothes.  We went to the square and met up with Stacey, Chelsea, Duhbresse, and this other girl I didn't know!  at about 12 we went to Old Mexico and partied.  It was SOO much fun.  College guys all over the place, this girl dancing all over the place! and then there was John John...lmao.....my boy!! lol! bless it....I cant really share much more about last night...its all history now! lmao...hopefully! We took John John home around 3 and then we went home and "crashed"! hah! I wanna go to trog feast tonight to see everybody that wants me to go, but I doubt mom will let me b/c I was out till all hours of the mornin this morning!!! Im sick as a dog, and I cant be sick b/c mom will know something's up if Im sick...Im tired as hell and I cant go get in the bed which sucks too.  Im about to go help daddy do something outside so I might be able to go to Trog Fest! Ill talk to yall later! leave a comment! lol  Nothing Maybe I like giving smiles which seems to be a sin today, and maybe I allow my imagination to sometimes run away, maybe you don't understand this and that's why you cannot see, if this make me nothing  hey, that's ok with me!  The world makes you believe your personality mustn't be detected, your face must be picture perfect and wear cloths just to be accepted. Maybe I look at you and feel sorry that you're blind, robots you have became, yourself you'll never find.

I really miss seeing her everyday! she's my big bitch sister, and I'm not complete without her! I'm gonna be all nice and shit when she's gone off to school! OH DEAR...the thought is scary....lol....Not really, I think Im generally a nice person! Maybe Im totally crazy for thinking that, but I don think so.

Today I got on here for approximatly 45 minutes.  Then I went upstairs and got in momma's bed and I was asleep in minutes.....I got up at 8 something and I was still feeling drowsy and blah.  School stinks, but I do enjoy it while I'm there!

      wow....I never knew how much I enjoyed social activity.  Having hardly any contact with fellow humans is quite tough and I do not enjoy it at all...especially being isolated from those few human I enjoy the most.  (Jessi's grounded)        I won 17 bucks playing cards....Im gonna miss the boys so much when the leave for school.  Our house is going to be boring unless we have some new guys to come play cards.  Any takers???? I cant wait till tomorrow....Im gonna hear all about Jessi's weekend, and since my life is completely boring...anything that happened will be enthralling! I think my life is turning around b/c things are different now, but the thing is...I cant tell anyone about it....:( thanks for reading

      hmm.....well, I guess I should start with Monday.   Monday  Well, I got up at 7:30 and got a shower and got me and Nate ready, then me and daddy and nate went to the place to get my license.  At 10 they still hadn't called me to do my paper work so I had to leave b/c I had a dentist at 10:30 and I had already rescheduled it twice.  So anyway, I got back for the dentist around 12 and I fixed dad and Nate lunch, then dad had to go to work at 12:30 so momma came and got me and I went back to the place to get my license.  At like 2:30 I was finally a licensed driver.  so after that I took mom to her work and I ran home to get my photo album and Elizabeth's birthday present. then me and nate went to wal*mart to make copies of some of my pictures from Dauphin Island to send to Elizabeth.  After wally I went to the post office to mail her birthday present then I went to my grandma's and chilled for about an hour until I had to go pick mom up from work.  That night jordan took the computer to his house b/c he was gonna get it fixed the next morning at work.  Thats all i can remember for that day.    Tuesday  well, I got up at 10:30 and just hung out around here for a little while, at about 12:30 I took Nate to mom's office b/c he was going to go bowling with the church.  After that I went to eat at Pikeville with melissa and then I took her to the doctors office to get an allergy shot.  After that we went back by mom's office to get her car and then we went swimming at her house.  It was fun.  I came home at like 6 got a shower and got ready and me and mom left to go to BV.  We met jana, kristen and melissa to eat.  It was fun. After that me and mom came home and I called daddy to ask him if i could go out and he said yeah.  Mom was pissed about it and that made me happy b/c there was nothing she could do about it.  Dad said I had to be home at 12!!! and I was pumped as hell.  I left here at like 10 something and met jana and chelsea at T.B. to drop off my car b/c I didn't wanna drive around the square.  *I know Im a chicken* So after we figured out there was NO ONE there, we left and went to T.B. to get my car and we all went to Ruby Tuesday's.  after a lil while we decided to go back to the square and hang out for a minute.  Jay backed my car up for me b/c I dont like to do that either! thanks babe.  Anyway, so....jana and chelsea in jana's car, jay and lacretia in jay's car and me in my car, we all head to the square.  I rode around once and thought I was gonna die b/c tray about made me go deaf when he saw me driving.  AWWW.....anyway, I stayed there and talked for a little while and then everyone was going to the rec*com to play ball so I left and went over there with cretia in my car.  Jay had jeans on and didn't feel like driving "his shit" so I took him to his cousins to get some wind pants and then I dropped him and cretia off at the rec*com and left.  sorry for yelling at you tray...you know i aint got nothin but love for ya!    Wednesday  well, I went to bed at 5:30 this morning and got up at 8 to watch nate...I didn't do much of anything but sit...mack came over and hung out for a while... I went to church with mom...great fun...today was boring

      I got up this morning at 10:09 b/c I set the clock for 10 and I hit the snooze button once. anyway, I got up and took a shower, dried my hair, and got ready and then daddy came in my room and told me that I didn't have to go to this luncheon unless I really wanted to. Well, I didn't really want to go so me and Nate stayed home. I came downstairs at like 11:30 and decided to make mom and dad and nate some blueberry muffins. I made those up and put them in the little cups in the pan, then while they were cooking I unloaded the dishwasher and washed the pans from last night. Then I put the dishes I had used for making muffins in the dishwasher and me and nate had a muffin. Then we watched Finding Nemo for the 3rd time this week. Jordan came over at 1 and got on the computer playing pinball...Me and Nate finished the movie at like 2:45 and I went to take a nap b/c I was on the phone with Jana till 3:30 last night. I woke up at 4:58 and I looked on my phone and I had 2 text messages. They were from drew. The first one was like a yahoo! messenger user is trying to send you a message and then it was telling me how to reply. So then the next message was him asking me if I could give him directions to jesse p.'s house. I just sent a message back saying to call me and id give him directions. I dont know if it got to him, but I tried. It was really wierd, I was like what?!?!? drew??!?! and then I was like how the heck did he get this number!?!?!? It was wierd. So after that I came downstairs and jordan was still here and he asked if I wanted him to help me wash daddy's car again since me and mack didn't quite do the best job when we did it. So me and jordan went out and washed dads car again, and then I kinda helped him wash his truck. After that I came in a watched part of G.I. Jane till 7, then I helped momma cook spaghetti. I called and talked to Jana sometime in between all that and found out her and Lacretia are going to Jacksonville tonight at 9 to pick up chelsea b/c her car broke down. Me, mom, dad, Nate, and Jordan got done eating at about 8:30 and then we just sat around talking about stuff. Momma was telling jordan about how looking at pictures of chris on the internet makes her wanna cry and jordan was like well, imagine how many times christa wants to cry EVERY day, but cant. I said well, Im sure she can, but SHE WONT!! Its crazy to think about...she's going through HELL right now and there's nothing I can do about it! Me, Tyler, Jordan, and momma and daddy are played cards for a little while, but Im about to go get in the shower and talk on the phone for a lil while b/c I have a long day planned for tomorrow!

      well, I woke up this morning around 10:30 b/c my phone was ringing....it was charley telling me to get my lazy ass up lol....that was quite funny.  I talked to him till about 11:15 or so.  I got out of the bed at 12:30 and I came downstairs and got on the computer.  I checked my mail and saw who all was on and stuff.  After that I went swimming for a little while just to relax all by my damn self a little bit.  After that I came in and helped mom clean out christa's room for a little while.  It sucked really bad. After about 2 hours of cleaning, I got on the computer again to check the air force academy website for picture's of chris again.  The other night me and mom got on it at like 12 something and looked through 4 days of pictures....It took up 3 and a half hours!  We found 2 of her on the day of in-processing.  She looked pissed at the world, which is how she's supposed to look.  We got a letter from her yesterday and it sounds like she's doing ok.  The altitude is really messing her up and since she's a vegetarian, she doesn't get to eat much.  She said in the letter that her meals consist of cold rice and veggies at everymeal.  They get 10 minutes to eat and in that time they have to say all this stuff before they can eat so its not actually 10 minutes! I miss her.  Anyway, after I looked for somemore pictures of her, I decided to write her a letter.  That took like an hour and then I decorated the envelop all pretty and stuff.... After that mom decided we needed to go to wal*mart, but we both needed showers so, I got a shower, then mom got one, and we got ready and went to wally.  I saw drew going in and then I saw jess at the 4-way stop thing....Christina was with her....:( *sigh* anyway, we got home at like 7:30 and me and momma are cooking steaks for dad.  He had to work today and he's supposed to be home at around 8.  Hopefully I'll get to go out tonight but I'm not gonna be mad if I dont b/c I know askin to do something is pushing it.  I'll keep those who care posted...  Well, we had steaks and potatoes.  They were really good.  Me and dad bitched at mom b/c she bought the crappy potatoes lol...it was funny.  I made pecan brownies for daddy.  They were good but not as good as usual b/c mom bought the cheap brand...:(  I cleaned up my room and everything and I asked dad if I could spend the night with Jana and he said no, then I went to can I go out and he STILL said no.  He says that he's sorry that I cant do anything, but he wants to prove to me that its not ok to be a smart ass to mom...I see his point, but 2 weeks sucks ass! Oh well, one more week, then Im gonna party hard and get grounded again.  Fuck it man, Fuck it

      I love the song because almost all of it applies....I made the things that I think apply to me and how I feel bold, the rest apply some, but not as much...  Memories consume like opening the wound I'm picking me apart again You all assume, I'm safe here in my room Unless I try to start again   I don't want to be the one the battles always choose 'Cause inside I realize that I'm the one confused  I don't know what's worth fighting for Or why I have to scream I don't know why I instigate And say what I don't mean I don't know how I got this way I know it's not alright So I'm breaking the habit Breaking the habit Tonight...   Clutching my cure, I tightly lock the door I try to catch my breath again  I hurt much more, than any times before I have no options left again     I don't want to be the one the battles always choose 'Cause inside I realize that I'm the one confused  I don't know what's worth fighting for Or why I have to scream I don't know why I instigate And say what I don't mean I don't know how I got this way I'll never be alright So I'm breaking the habit Breaking the habit Tonight...    I'll paint it on the walls 'Cause I'm the one at fault   I'll never fight again And this is how it ends   I don't know what's worth fighting for Or why I have to scream But now I have some clarity  To show you what I mean I don't know how I got this way I'll never be alright So I'm breaking the habit I'm breaking the habit I'm breaking the habit Tonight...

Wednesday         Ok, I woke up this afternoon around 12 b/c I went to bed at like 3. I got up, applied a green face mask, just cause I felt like it. I picked up some clothes in my floor and took them to the dirty clothes basket in my bathroom, then I got in the shower. I got out, dried my hair. Came downstairs, got on the computer for a while....fixed some ramen noodles....ate about 12 bites and didn't want anymore. I went to my car and got my horn and then I started memorizing Amazing Grace. After that I put on my make up and found some clothes to wear...brushed my teeth, and then I left around 2:35....I sprayed off my car before I left so I drove to wal*mart instead of turning at the high school. I was gonna make a U-turn at wal*mart but there were too many people so I just went up and got on the over pass thingy and then came back down....I passed matthew and his dad b/c they were going slow and I was trying to dry off my freakin car..anyway, I got to the high school, put my crap down.....looked over Amazing Grace, then I went outside and waiting for someone to pass me off....FINALLY ster did and I passed off everything....I went back in the band room, socialized then ms. Bates came in there and we played Jesus Loves Me and Cadillac and then we went outside....we did the last part of the opener set by set a few times and then we came home....I went to the bowling alley for a while and left at about 9 and went to the square, came home at 10:15 or so and jonathan came over and left around 12.       Tuesday    hmmm.....I dont really know what I did until band, but we had band from 4-8...I came home, changed clothes and went to BV with......tracey, ster, josh t. josh t.

About 15 minutes later I was gonna leave so I drove by the courts agian and I met tray in front of whatever that store is beside the church, so I turned around, and when I got to the square, he was no where to be found.....Patrick asked me to give him a ride home so I did and come to find out he just wanted to show me where tray was...so I took him back to the square...and then I came home at around 10:20...Jonathan followed me from the square and came over for a little while till he had to go home!        Monday      ok....we had pictures at 8:30 and that took forever....we got done at like 10:30 or so....I came straight home...took a shower, got ready, ate lunch, and then I was back at the high school at like 12:50 to get something..i cant really remember what....we had the party from 6-8...I hung out at the civic center talking to mark till about 9:15..then I rode around the square for a lil while and then I came home....

I unbuckled and opened the door and I heard air coming out of my tires, but I wasn't sure what the hell it was at the time....I SCREAMED "JONATHAN" and I looked up and james had made it down the hill and was coming up to me....jonathan was pulling up in his truck and he got out and just came up and hugged me....I screamed "SHIT, DAD'S GONNA KILL ME" and he was just like oh my gah, im glad you're ok...him and james watched it happen from james' driveway....I've never been so scared in my entire life.  I was sooooo glad they were there....After the police came and percision towed it off,  Jonathan took me home b/c mom and dad had left russ t's to come see about me so they went back and I went home.....I got a shower and he sat with me and I feel asleep on the couch....he took me to get something to eat later and then he left at sometime and went to charles'....I went out with chelsea and lacretia friday night till 12 and it was fun, but seeing "him" made my life harder......anway, saturday i didn't do anything.......today I didn't do anything either.....jonathan came over at like 7 something after work and ate homemade pizza with us...then at like 9 something me and him went to ruby tuesday's to look at some rims of jay's cousins...they are bad ass, and they'd look killer, but one of them is warped really bad so i doubt daddy will buy them for me...anyway, im about to head to bed....night night guys
