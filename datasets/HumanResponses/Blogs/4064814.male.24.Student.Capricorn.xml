      Fixed  urlLink Matt's  Dates, so you no longer have to look for him at the bottom of the page.  Also I am retrieving the feeds without the atom-to-rss translation (now that I have the newest  urlLink magpie  version) so links and other formatting is being perserved in the posts.

      Lauren and I are going to see FC Porto take on Liverpool at SkyDome on Friday.  Rumor has it they are installing natural grass for the first time in SkyDome's history for the match.  Should be a good time.  I just need to practice my  urlLink chants.

      I agree with  urlLink Seinfeld . There is far too much urinary freedom in our society.      On three separate occasions I have been walking along Scary Path only to see the back of someone standing just off the path and hear a sound that one does not expect to hear while walking to campus. The first two times I just averted my eyes and hustled on by, but the last time some fellow had completely straddled the path.    So who are these people who are these people who just can't wait? Well, in each case it was a thirty-something guy wearing a baseball uniform. Understandable since the park is used for slo-pitch each afternoon. But the games had not started yet! I can only assume these people are coming straight from work, yet have not the presence of mind to use  actual  washroom facilities before leaving.  I should  also  note that the park does provide washrooms nearby. What are these people afraid if they hold it in for 5 minutes they will get Uromysistisis poisoning and die??    Ridiculous.

       Came across some  urlLink research  on multi-agent systems solving traffic problems on Slashdot the other day.   They designed an automated system where cars reserve a time to pass through an intersection as they approach it and are then sped up or slowed down to ensure their arrival at exactly the right time. This allows traffic to enter the intersection from all directions simultaneously, eliminating the need for traffic lights and considerably reducing delays caused by stopping traffic.   Check out the  urlLink simulation  of an intersection of two six-lane roads.  Pretty cool stuff, but how useful is this?  The paper concludes by stating that  once autonomous vehicles are common, this mechanism may be useful for managing real traffic.    Hmm, well it doesn't take into account pedestrians or errant soccer balls, nor does it allow for turning, but I think the real problem is a simple one. People just love their cars.  There is a sense of personal empowerment when in control of a car, and I just can't see people giving that up. I am reminded of the movie Singles (which I might add features a young Pearl Jam circa 1992) . Anyhoo, one of the main characters is working for the city developing a  Super Train  to solve Seattles traffic woes. This train is luxurious, fast, safe, convient and cheap compared to a car. But, it will never succeed because people just love their cars.

      So while purchasing the new laptop I opted to pay the extra 22 dollars for guaranteed 2 day shipping from Fedex. It began shipping on Saterday, after two business days I should have recieved the package on Tuesday.  Well it turns out Fedex shipping was too efficient. One of the nice things about Fedex is they provided  urlLink online tracking , so I watched my laptop travel from California, to Memphis (the fedex hub) and today (Monday) it arrived in Toronto. The online tracking was then updated to say that the package was taken off the truck in Cambridge because the package was "not due for delivery".  I was all excited when I saw it land in Toronto. I mean how long could it take to get to Waterloo? Apparently, not long enough. Now I really wanted to have the laptop tonight and I was playing with the idea simply jumping on the bus to Cambridge and picking it up in person, so I called up Fedex.  A nice Fedex representitive explained to me that their two day guarentee did not guarentee a package to be delivered in  at most  two days, but  EXACTLY  two days. My package had arrived too quickly and so had to wait an extra day. When I asked about going directly to the Fedex depot in Cambridge to pick the package up myself, the representitive explained that this was not possible,  but  if I wanted to upgrade to one day service for  x  dollars, I could have it delivered tonight.  Now this sucks, but it doesn't suck as much this other  urlLink person  whose package was delayed for 5 days at a depot not 15 minutes from his house.  Okay, now as a customer I don't mind getting a package in two days when you say it will be there in at most 2 days. But when you make your tracking transparent enough that I can see a package being intentionally delayed that is  not  cool.  Why not surprise and delight your customers by occasionally delivering your packages a little early?? It's not like you will lose customers paying for the premium services because there is no guarantee that it will arrive early!

      With Jon's departure, the Hotel Goyer is starting to feel a little empty. It has been great spending the summer in Waterloo and being able to say goodbye to my friends as one by one they strike out to start their "real" lives.  First Matt and John, then Ben, Ming and Nat, then Drew, now Jon and soon Robin. It is beginning to dawn on me how much I will miss them. But this sense of loss is filled with an optimism as I wait to hear of their achievements as they each follow their own path.

         My computer turned 5 years old this August. It has served me well through my university career, but I decided its finally time for an upgrade. After shopping around for a good part of the summer I finally decided on an  urlLink Apple Powerbook  just like  urlLink Jen's .  I bought the Powerbook from the Apple website on Friday. When I got home I was welcomed by a call from Visa who had blocked payment for this expensive item that Kevin could not possibly have bought.  After reassuring Visa that I had indeed purchased the item I had to call Apple customer support and tell them to charge my card again. As I sat on hold listening to the latest single from the Black Eyed Pea's I began to appreciate how much work Apple puts into projecting their brand as a young and hip.

      I just found out  urlLink Tim Bray  used to  urlLink work  for  urlLink Open Text .  For those of you who may not know this guy pretty much invented  urlLink XML  and is now Technology Director at Sun Microsystems.   I have been working at Open Text over the summer and have been tasked with the tightening up the next version of  urlLink Livelink  before its release.  This takes the form of many tiny bug fixes with an occasional in-depth code optimization.  I have found it easy for me to loose sight of all the cool things we do here.  Recommender Systems, Dynamic Text Summarization, Natural Language Processing, Automatic Text Classification: These are all pretty hot research areas and there are a bunch of Phd's here applying some of the most cutting edge stuff and occasionally making it work.

      I like to keep up with what everyone is doing through their blogs, but I hate clicking through to each site twice a day to check for new posts. Since I don't wanna pay for  urlLink Newsgator  like money-bags  urlLink Matt , I thought I would whip up something simple that lets me view everyone's posts from one place.   urlLink Here  is my first try.  (The link is now in the sidebar as Everyone)  Most of the code was provided by  urlLink FeedOnFeeds  which uses an old version of  urlLink MagPie  that unfortunately does not support Atom feeds.  Luckily there is an  urlLink Atom to RSS converter  out there to massage the feed before FeedOnFeeds gets it.   Still,  some of the formatting appears to be lost.   Update   For whatever reason the dates are not being retrieved from Matt and Ming's feeds so their posts show up at the bottom.

      All summer I have been experiencing this nagging anxiety about the fact that I had nowhere to live for the Fall.   Well, Jeff and I found a place to live this past weekend and its pretty sweet.   It's a small house, but we have it all to ourselves.  The exterior gives it this ramshackle look, with weathered unpainted wood and holes in the porch floorboards, but the inside has been totally redone.  We have a spacious living room and kitchen (with its own island!), and a patio in the back with a garden.    It's at  urlLink Weber and Marshall  so its a little farther away, but its still close enough for groceries (and the beerstore).

      I will never forget the first time I saw  urlLink Jim Guthrie , performing at the  urlLink Jane Bond  in front of about hundred people in a space the size of my living room and bantering with the audience as his music "loaded" on the Play Station that served as the rest of his band.

      Saw a great show on Friday at The Ford Plant. I still can't believe the value, 7 bucks for 5 bands including Jim Guthrie and the Fembots.  The venue was a converted retail space in the middle of Brantford's deserted downtown. The stage was setup in front of the storefront and from behind the performers you could see this street scene straight out of the 50's with Kerby's Barbershop, the Maytag Refridgerator Emporiom and a run down T.V. repair shop all plastered with For Sale/Lease signs.  The delicate harmony and slowly building melodies of the Wooley Leaves was the perfect way to start the evening. As day turn to night out in the abandoned street, things started to pick up inside with spirited sets from Nathan Lawr and the Fembots.  I have seen Jim Guthrie in Toronto at a packed club with more than a thousand people looking on, but Friday was different. All the little punk rock kids that had packed the Constantines show the previous night were nowhere to be seen. It was probably the most chill perfomance I have seen and definitely one of the best. There was enough room that half the audience was able to sit cross legged on the floor and just enjoy the spectacular show Jim and his band put on.

      Off to the Ford Plant in Brantford tonight for the second show of the  urlLink festival  Ben  urlLink mentioned .  Brantford you say? You know it, and from what I  urlLink hear  its a pretty cool venue.  Its too bad I missed the  urlLink Constantines  last night, but I am sure  urlLink Jim Guthrie  and  urlLink The Fembots  will put on a good show, so come one come all.

      Okay, so when it comes to mountain biking I am what you would call a weight snob. If we are heading out to the trail I will be the last person to volunteer for carrying the spare inner tube, lightweight pump, or anything of the other small things you  need  to have with you on the trail.  In fact I will try just about anything to be the guy not carrying anything simply because it  adds weight .  So you can imagine my excitment when I found I came across  urlLink wrenchscience , a site that allows you to choose from a bunch of custom frames and then completely outfit all the components,  but  best part is that as you go it tells you how much weight each component will add.  I spent at least an hour fooling around on the site and managed to create the following masterpiece:   									       Frame:DEAN Colonel X-Lite         Fork: ROCK SHOX SID Race 2004     Group: X.0 2004         Weight:    19.66lbs         Price:  only  $4,960.95 USD   Or perhaps a road bike:      									       Frame: GIANT TCR Composite       									Frame size: 51cm C-to-T      									Fork: GIANT SL      									Group: Record 10spd 2004      									Wheelset: Factory Wheel      Weight:    14.3lbs          Price:  a mere  $5,784.62         I am pretty happy with the weight of my  urlLink Klein  right now, but man that giant would be litterally half the weight.

      Man my  urlLink Peasant Quest  skillz are weak.  I was able to:      Take the pebbles from the shore and put them into the well to drop the bucket and retrieve the mask     Use the mask to scare the horse to break down the fence to reach the archery guy and say  Haldo!      Win the bow from the archery brothers and use it to slay the Kerrek    ... I just can't seem to get into the hut with no knob.  Oh well, back to work.

      I was impressed with the Skydome's tranformation into a soccer venue. The specatators were split down the middle of the stands with all the Liverpool fans on one side and all the FC Porto supporters on the other. I was seated smack in the middle with a sea of red to my right and the green and red of Porto to my left. The over forty thousands fans were good and noisy on occasion, but for the most part there was a more subdued vibe due to the lacklustre play. Both teams were quite tenative during the first half of the game, with no scoring and only a handful of chances. Things got worse at the beginning of the second half when all the starters subbed-off so their backups could see some playing time. The best part of the game came after Porto finally scored with only five minutes left in the game. Liverpool woke up and showed some spirited play for remaining time getting a couple of great chanes, but alas, no goal.  Saterday afternoon I shopped around Toronto for a new laptop. Now that I am going to be on campus at Waterloo for another couple years, I figure it might make sense to take advantage of the wireless coverage. Here is my shopping list:      Under 5 pounds      12" display     Integrated wireless     CDRW/DVD drive    I found a  urlLink Sony Vaio V505  at a great price, but I am leaning toward a  urlLink Powerbook  cause its just so dead sexy.  Saterday night I met up with my sister and her friends for Sushi and chilling on the beach. Sunday it was off to the beach again, this time on Lake Erie with Lauren and her family. Monday it was back to Waterloo for some volleyball and a BBQ. Good friends and good food is the pefect way to end a weekend.
