      My baby is growing up.  Amani turned one today....I didn't think I could handle it, but it seems I could. *sigh* Subhan'allah I have been blessed to even have her in my life for this long. If she grows up to adulthood, I know I would have been the "lucky" (for lack of a better word) one to have her in my life. She's taught me quite a lot about life and about myself.  I sometimes wonder if babies really do possess all the knowledge in the world in their little minds (Astagferlah if that statement was wrong).  My baby is growing up. I'm so ready for this.

      I was up and out my mothers house at 17/Been a grown ass married man ever since/Family reunions, I'm talked about but never seen/Cause I learned that some of them can be your nemesis/Got a lot of scars on me, I'll now tell you the stories/If, you promise not to take offense/Homie, sit back then, hand bring the beat in/I'll try to find a place that starts to make sense now/The first time I was pushed out blind/Cold and naked, spanked on the ass to breathe/An immigrant from heaven on earth with a word peace/I announce my self with gasps and screams/Before black and white supremacy, heighted my innocence/I was living out life behind the picket fence/Happy go lucky scared of no one/With the only exception, I'm allergic to the sun/Didn't know I had a image that a camera couldn't capture/100% on Mars manufacture/But then came the laughter, and outside I'm battered/Picket fence shattered/I saw my self as bastard tagalong, harassed and spat upon/By the children of slave masters who passed it on/The saddest songs been sung at the hands of who I call the race from hell/Its a disgrace from hell/Fell face first in the self hate/Burst into tears when I hear my own hellish name cursed/If I seem timid, its only because every mirror that I saw back then had the earths ugliest human being in it/And with that said, they would kick me till they got tired or I act dead/And I, have to tell ya'll that the obvious part/That I always feel free when I'm talking to god/Alone on the playground, Friday afternoon/And the, old sister who hums gospel tunes/I saw her notice getting closer/She approached me and put a knowing hand on my shoulder/And booked my feelings/Cause she looked at me in a way that adults very seldom look at children/And with the wisdom only earned by years/She read my thoughts and she welled up with tears and said/"You look the way you do because you're special/Not the short bus way, I mean that God's gonna test you/And all of this pain is training for the day when youwill have to lead with the gift God gave to you/Grown folks don't see it but the babies do/And there's a chance that you can save a few"/And time will prove that, she started my movement/She didn't tell me to take it - she told me to use it The second time poppa ripped the womb open early/And exposed me to the coldness life prematurely/Where mom's love used to live, now housed denial/And when that decayed, it made it bitter and spiteful/But me and my runaway, we share something special/Rode into the sunset, can barely can tough the pedals/No strings attached, screaming, "fuck Geppetto"/We may live in the gutter, but we cling to each other/A week before my son came, I caught a bad bounce/And had to step to mom with my hands out/And momma proved the two of us could not live in that house/She lied to the police so they would throw us in the streets/And separating from you, is something that I feel I must do/Its not that I don't love you, its more that I don't trust you/Its been a year since I've seen a living relative/And it's just now that I'm starting to live/But while I'm sitting here, choking on tears wishing that I didn't care/Feeling all alone in this hemisphere, I swear upon everything I hold dear/And then my wife comes near, and I hear a voice whisper in my ear/"You're going through all of this because you're special/Not no superstar shit, I mean that God had to test you/And all of this pain has been training for the day when youwould lead us with the gift God gave to you/Your parents might not see it but your babies do/And there's a chance that you can save a few"/And time will prove that, she started my movement/She didn't tell me to take it, she told me to use it So I use it

      Insha'allah....I'm not ready for this...I'm not ready for my baby to grow up...*sigh* I think I've been subconsciously sabotaging my husband's efforts to make her more independant so I can hold on to her longer....Other parents can understand, watching your baby slip away from you and becoming his/her own person, no longer a part of you, but becoming a whole new person.... This is a conversation my dad and I had a while back...   D58 : how's my ity bits  Iman : she's good  Iman : she's perfecting the art of finger foods  Iman : she's getting better at walking too  D58 : thats good  Iman : we got her a new carseat so she can face forward now  Iman : I can't believe that in a couple weeks she's gonna be 1  D58 : wow  D58 : she just got here  Iman : I still remember the day we brought her home  Iman : does time always fly like this with kids  D58 : the years will start to speedup now  D58 : just hold on as best you can  Iman : :-)  D58 : enjoy the ride  Iman : I'm sure it's gonna be an interesting one  D58 : it'll be over all too soon  D58 : then comes the hard part  Iman : yeah  Iman : I can imagine  D58 : no you can't  Iman : you're right...I really can't  D58 : donn't worry, noones ever died from it  Iman : :-)  Iman : *hugs* I love you dad  D58 : if tyou raise her right, she'll be OK  D58 : your proof of that  Iman : LOL

      For about the past 6 months, anytime the theme song to the show "The Nanny" comes on, Amani wiggles, dances, bops, and shakes her rear. I know the song is catchy, but wow, it never seems to tire with her. Amani has also been teething the past few days and running a low grade fever, making my cuddle bear seem more like a hot&nbsp;little coal, but it seems that her second tooth is breaking through quite nicely. In fact, she's been fever free for the past few hours, so, Insha'allah we're past the worst. &nbsp;  In Other News  The cookie business has put the emphasis on BUSY...which is of course an opportune time for me to come down with yet another eye infection (since my exzema has spread to the skin around my eyes I've had three stys-two at one time once- and it seems I need to brace for another bout with them...see  urlLink MyBody's in Total Upheaval  for the back story). *sigh* It seems just when I'm done with one, I have to face another....I think this time it may be because I haven't slept well in the past few days, partially because of Amani's fever and teething. &nbsp; My arabic classes are going well, I'd say I'm advancing pretty darn well, subhanallah. Insha'allah I'll continue to keep up my studies even though I'm not feeling 100%. &nbsp; *sigh* Such is life right?

      Often at night, I stand at my bedroom window and watch the fireflies in the grassy courtyard between buildings. If you watch long enough, you kind of see how each one has its own unique flash. Each one developed it's own style of flashing to attract a mate. If I remember my elementary science classes correctly, it's only the male that flashes to attract a female. When you think about it it's pretty cool, just knowing the complicated chemical reactions involved in making that flash that only lasts about 30 seconds, but for them it's instantaneous, not even a second though (if that doesn't prove to you Allah is the Almighty, nothing will). Now I'd be a little disturbed if human men's butts started lighting up to try to attract a mate, but I think, from the bug's point of view, that the fact that the male firefly goes through all that just to impress the female is pretty cool...In fact, in nature, it's usually the male that's brightly colored and goes through the whole process of impressing the female...so what happened with humans, when did it become that women had to attract the male? BAH! I'm not even going to go there....I'm simply going to enjoy the fireflies and take them as they are, proof that Allah is the Great Creator.

      When I first became Muslim, I was reading all the time; studying all the time; learning all the time. Then I got married, and got pregnant, and had my baby and suddenly I didn't study as much, if at all. Going to any class became a total chore, especially if I came in the middle and had to start at the beginning or try to play catch up on the side as I picked up where they were. It was just so tedious. Then I found myself just going through the motions. Making Salaat (the five daily prayers) because I was supposed to, and rushing through them to complete whatever task I was doing before then. Only begrudingly reading my Qur'an when I got tired of flipping channels and I didn't want to re-read any of the books on my shelf and NPR simply held nothing for me (I've pretty much given up on privately owned radio stations since they are all owned by one of three conglomerates-in Detroit you really only Clear Channel stations and one station that is privately owned and operated by the Free Masons, who, by the by, run the best radio station in Detroit that isn't public radio-and all the music is crap). For a while I holed myself up in my apartment, using the excuse that I hate the telephone not to call people (I really do hate the telephone, I spent 3 years as a campus telephone operator the only thing I hate more than talking on the phone is hearing the phone ring), my main contact with the community was online, at jummah (when I attended) and random run-ins at Wal-Mart (who doesn't shop at wal-mart, really?). Recently I joined an Arabic class to start learning Arabic so I can teach my daughter one day, Insha'allah (God Willing). And when I really started to get into it, I began to feel it. I began to feel my spirit wake up. I feel like I'm not just going through the motions. I don't feel like a black and white person just moving through a technicolor world. It's almost the same way I felt back when I took shahada. I can feel my insides waking up. I walk into the door of my apartment with an entirely different attitude. I don't feel like "Well, let's get this over with." It's more like "Ok, what's going on, do you need any help and what can I do even if you don't need help." I feel alive again. Subhan'allah (Glory be to God). I was beginning to resent my choice of becoming Muslim deep down. But now, it's like a dark cloud has rolled away and now I can see the sun again. Let's hear it, three for the sunnah: TAKBIR! TAKBIR!  TAKBIR!

      For years my father and I had an uneasy truce, he didn't kill me and I did just enough to keep him off my back. We were constantly at odds with each other, always butting heads on one thing or another. I was the target of his jokes and antaganism and he the target of blame when it came to my personal misery. Most time we spent together was spent in silence, doing just enough to keep from sniping at each other or making snide comments. Of course, as my father, he always had the upper hand. I couldn't simply go off on him the way I really wanted to. Regardless of my feelings, he was still my father and subject to my respect, which I gave half heartedly.  Since becoming Muslim, getting married, and having a child, my father and I have come full circle. We now have a mutual, unbegruding, respect for each other. We no longer have the uneasy tension between us, now we are beginning to see each other as people. We are re-learning to be father and daughter, much the same way my mother and I are learning to be friends. This is almost like crossing an old rope bridge over a canyon. You take it slowly one step at a time, hold on tight, and don't look down.   I sometimes think about what I went through with my father, and what my father must have been going through with me. Then I think about my own daughter. I watch her take her first uneasy steps, falling now and then, but always getting right back up, even if it just leads to another fall. I wonder when my dad watched me at this age did he ever suspect that we'd have the conflicts that we did. I kind of feel bad for the time we missed with each other. But I have a feeling that those times we did have, good and bad, are going to make the future a little easier for us. Maybe it's a good thing I was never "daddy's little girl", that I was never put on that pedestal. It think it makes it a little easier to relate to my father person to person.

I am not not worried/Wrap her up in a package of lies/Send her off to a coconut island/I am not worried-I am not overly concerned/with the status of my emotions/"oh", She says, "you're changing."/But we're always changing/It does not bother me to say this isn't love/Because if you don't want to talk about it then it isn't love/and I guess I'm going to have to live with that/but, I'm sure there's something in a shade of gray/or something in between/and I can always change my name if that's what you mean My friend assures me "it's all or nothing`/But I am not really worried/I am not overly concerned/You try to tell yourself the things you try tell yourself to make/yourself forget/to make yourself forget/I am not worried/"If it's love" she said, "then we're gonna have to think about the/consequences"/cause she can't stop shaking and I can't stop touching her and.....

      Wednesday I turned 23. Thursday I spent the day with my mother who is 25 years my senior. I know, I should be hung for divulging my dear mothers age, but she is not ashamed of her approach to 50, she simply dyes her hair and leaves the rest of us guessing. To be honest, my mother doesn't look like a woman whose ship is approaching the harbor of midlife, she has managed to age gracefully. To this I credit the Irish that flows in her blood. I have yet to see too many Irish women who looked like 50 hit them with a cinder block. The Greek, Hungarian, and Russian that is also in our blood...well, all people have women who don't age well. But my mother won the toss of the dice in the game of life (lord I'm using  way  too many metaphors) she has sailed through 40 and is coming into 50 beautifully. Congrats mom.  But I digress...Thursday my mother and I went to lunch then hung out in the mall for several hours. It was then that I noticed how much alike my mother and I had become. I used to bound from this store to that, I'd barely pay attention to my mother when she was shopping for myself preferring to find things to ask her to buy for me. Her slower, more calculated pace annoyed me to no end. Her need to window shop every jewler and even try on rings that we both knew she was never going to buy clashed with my "Now! Now!" attitude. It didn't help any that she and my sister, who is four years older than me, made perfect shopping partners. They both loved those girly-girl clothes that I abhorred and that I made efforts to keep away from just in case they got the idea to try to strip me of my work t-shirt, blue jeans and work boots and put me into some God-awful dress. But Thursday, it seemed as if those past years never existed. My mother and I perused the mall slowly moving around the perimeter of the building, dodging high school kids out for the summer and stopping in stores to look and discuss, and, occasionally, drool over the different items. Now please note, this mall isn't too far beyond a glorified indoor strip mall. It's large enough to have only one public restroom and anyone at any end of the mall will have no issue getting their without an unseemly accident. But at our casual pace, you would have thought that we were walking the Mall of America. Granted we lingered in the Brookstone store much longer than is usually considered polite, but it was my birthday and I was sitting in the  urlLink shiatsu chair  that reads your body to appropriately locate your muscles and massaged your calves for as long as I wanted to. The sales person can shoot me as many dirty looks as she wanted, that chair, for those 15 minutes, was mine, all mine.  And of course, sitting in massage chairs wasn't all we did, but that wasn't important, what was important was that we were learning to enjoy each others company as we never did before. I was no longer the standoffish teen and she no longer the frustrated mother trying to find a way to communicate with an often distant and cold daughter. We were on equal footing now. Both mothers before we turned 25. Both married to men that our families were, at best, dubious about; both insanely in love with these men, frustrating as they are. While we are still on the surface mother and daughter, down below, we are much more. Maybe, just maybe, even friends.

      I was born in the 80's and back then, things made sense. You woke up, ate breakfast while watching cartoons, and not some PBS cartoon either, you watched GIJoe or CareBears and you went to school because knowing was half the battle, you needed to help cheer a friend up and dagnabbit McGruff was counting on you to help take a bite out of crime and you intended to do  just that! . Back then you had gym  AND  recess and you played your hardest at both, and dodge ball was a requirement. Getting dirty while having some random fun was ok, so was getting hurt. The occasional play ground fight stayed there (though sometimes it carried on to giving the evil eye during class and/or settling it after school). There was none of this using guns or knives. If anything you used a rock, a stick or a brick, and that was only if you were out numbered or the guy you were fighting was three times your size, but no one died. Once the winner was declared that was all there was to it. There was no getting a gun and shooting ten kids at school. That was just unheard of. And we made fun of the fat kids. That's right, the FAT KIDS! We'd laugh and tease and have fun at the expense of the fat kid. And even the fat kid made fun of the kid that was fatter than he was, or if you couldn't beat the fat kid in some game, you got made fun of. Everyone got teased. You got teased for being short, you got teased for being tall, you got teased for being fat, you got teased for being skinny, you got teased for being black and you got teased for being white.  Everyone got teased.  The only one you didn't tease was the handicapped kid. That was off limits, because if you made fun of them your own children would turn out like that and no one wanted that. When you got home, at 3:00 it was more cartoons. The new cartoons too. The ones that set the trends. Once that was done you went out side, played until 6 or 7 ate dinner, then went back outside until the street lights came on and you had to go in. Even then you watched one or two more hours of TV, usually some sitcom that went over your head but you laughed when the laugh-track laughed and that was all there was to it. Then off to bed until tomorrow when you repeated the process again.  Then there were the weekends. 7am cartoons until noon when Soul Train came on. You danced, you dressed, you went outside and played. There were no play dates. You just went outside, knocked on doors, woke everyone up and got them outside. There was running and shouting and arguing over rules to a game that has different rules every week anyway and never really had any set rules other than "it", "not it", and "glue". No one ever really won or lost. You just played until you decided to play something else. And you got dirty, and musty, and sweaty. You'd go in in the middle of the day, dry off, gulp down two or three glasses of water, eat a sandwich, drink some juice, go find your ball and go back outside for another random game of whatever. We weren't over scheduled like little adults, because we weren't adults. We were children. We behaved like children, we thought like children, we acted like children, we had fun like children. We got rough, we got mean, we got over it. Kids these days are suffering from stress related health problems. ARE YOU HEARING ME PEOPLE?  STRESS!  Little 10 and 11 year olds WITH ULCERS! 12 year olds worrying about having enough extra curricular activities to get into college!  COLLEGE!  When I was 12, do you know what I was doing? I was seeing how far I could ride my bike without getting into trouble.  I'm glad I'm an adult now, because childhood sucks these days, and you, people, are the main ones at fault. Stop living through your kids and move on with life. You'll never be the star athlete, you'll never be the popular one and you'll never be Prom King/Queen. Leave your kids alone.  and i'm spent....

      For as long as I can remember, I've had very sensative skin and exema on my arms, but in the last year or so, I've developed exema around my eyes causing the skin to peel and, if I rub them, my eyes to swell like I've been on the recieving end of a fist fight. More recently the left side of my body has developed a rash caused by dry skin (something else I've been plagued with since youth)and aggrivated by whatever Ypsi puts in its water. This has made me completely self concious. Not that anyone can see the left side of my body since I'm covered in public, but my eyes...*sigh* not to mention trying to even feel somewhat attractive to my husband (who insists that my beauty goes far beyond my body and he still feels I'm the most gorgeous woman). I've never been one to fall into the body-image trap, but my self image is taking a header.  I've yet to figure out why all this is going on. According to my husband, it's all a test from Allah...I guess that's true, but I can't see how something like this can be more of a test than a punishment for something that I've done and have yet to figure out. If I was ever a recluse before I most certainly am now. *sigh* Things like this are hard for me to deal with...I guess deep down I'm a little vain.

      Ok, I'm not going to bore you with too many details. I'm Iman, I'm Muslim, have been for 2 years, mash'allah (God has willed it) and as of yesterday, I'm 23. I'm married, I have an 11 month old daughter that I love to death. So far as I'm concerned, she's the most beautiful, most intelligent, most personable child to ever grace this earth-hands down.   As yesterday was my birthday, my friend, Kristy, convinced me that there are people who want to read my random little thoughts and I should stop talking to myself like a nut and just make a blog. So I guess I should just hop right into it....

      Why I post so many lyrics. The answer is fairly simple. Music has always had a huge role in my life (as of now it's my bread and butter), and there are so many songs that say much better how I feel at anyone time than my own words do. And then some songs simply move me in a way I can't describe. Like that song Desert Rose, I hear it and suddenly something inside me begins to move, like my soul is dancing. There are some songs I can get absolutely lost in, many times it's the singers and not the songs that move me. Seal's voice just evelopes me, so does Prince. I can sink into Phyllis Hyman. Even the lead singer of Evanescense, her voice moves me.  Maybe this is why in Islam we are warned away from music, because the voice can hypnotize.

      but I fell in love with Sting hearing this song...I've always liked his music, but this song made me love him I dream of rain/I dream of gardens in the desert sand/I wake in pain/I dream of love as time runs through my hand/I dream of fire/ Those dreams are tied to a horse that will never tire/And in the flames/Her shadows play in the shape of a man's desire/This desert rose/Each of her veils, a secret promise/This desert flower/No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this/And as she turns/This way she moves in the logic of all my dreams/This fire burns/I realize that nothing's as it seems/I dream of rain/I dream of gardens in the desert sand/I wake in pain/I dream of love as time runs through my hand/I dream of rain/I lift my gaze to empty skies above/I close my eyes /This rare perfume is the sweet intoxication of her love/I dream of rain/I dream of gardens in the desert sand/I wake in pain/I dream of love as time runs through my hand/Sweet desert rose/Each of her veils, a secret promise/This desert flower/No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this/Sweet desert rose/This memory of Eden haunts us all/This desert flower /This rare perfume, is the sweet intoxication of the love
