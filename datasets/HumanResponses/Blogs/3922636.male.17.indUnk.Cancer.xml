      to my mama  Memory conveys that you were something to be When you weren't held captive in an aged body You had a family that needed you and job security You had everything a man could ever need But where did your children go? Where is your family? Did they turn into the adults that you always hoped they'd be? Did you finally retire from that job that tortured you? I thought all your dreams had come true So why are you depressed when your life is at it's best Is it really cause it's not what it seems? Or are you unable to see that you should be happy 'Cause your still living in yesterday's dreams  to my papa  Your eldest son reminds you of the way life used to be When you didn't bear the chains of matrimony You had no job that you hated, no responsibility You were youthful and careless and free And the woman you wed, she seemed better in bed When there wasn't a ring on her finger Yes your life seemed all right when you partied all night Those days are gone, does the flavor still linger? Don't tell me life would be great if you were reprobate And had friends who were losers and fiends You've a family a wife and a meaningful life But you're still holding on to yesterdays dreams  to my stoopid little brother Loneliness reduces you to disharmony Your life seems so hopeless and melancholy You're still young but you can't find the strength to move on Now that the woman who loves you is gone Did you find she wasn't so close when you needed her most Is it hard facing up to rejection? You might understand that she needed a man But you're still seeking maternal protection Don't give up you're still young and your life's just begun At every corner opportunity screams Sometimes life is abrupt but it's time to grow up And stop clinging to yesterday's dreams  slit me wrist...

      Lying idle in my room, telling my thoughts to the moon Why do I always feel so unimportant? To other egos my mind clings and inside these voices ring That I'm just a carbon copy of everyone else  And now I'm searching out my own identity Something down inside telling me that I'm like no one else but me But as of yet I still don't know Who is this guy that I am and for his life what does he have to show? Who am I? What am I for?  I wait for answers from the sky, the only audience I find But no comfort finds my ears just silent mocking And I know I was created but I just can't figure out why  Still searching. Who am I? Some answers I don't ever find I just want to know I have a place Come from and return to dust, but I don't want to feel that useless I want to see something in me that is unique. I just want to know. Who am I? What am I for?  slit me wrist...
