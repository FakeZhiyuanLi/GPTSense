      A few months ago, my sister bought this gorgeous purple/blue/red beta fish. Didn't name it. She never feeds it, never changes its water, etc. I felt bad for the little bastard, so I've been taking care of it. Well, today I decided it was time for me to bring Marlon (short for Marlon Brando) upstairs. But I didn't want Marlon to have a fogged up tank-like thing so he wouldn't be able to see his new surroundings, so I decided to change his water beforehand. I had never had any trouble changing his water, so I approached the sink with no sign of anxiety or nervousness (word?). I put Marlon in a bowl along with some of the water from before I cleaned out the tank-like thing so he wouldn't die. I rinsed out the tank-like thing (what the hell is it called?!) and put Marlon back in, but when I was doing so, some of the food that remained in the bowl that he was staying in went inside of the clean tank-like thing. So naturally, I had to repeat the process. But I decided that it would be easier if I didn't do this in the kitchen sink, because it was stacked high with dirty dishes. So Marlon and I venture into the downstairs bathroom, and I place him in the bowl, etc. Then hell breaks loose. I tried to put him back in the new tank without making it dirty like last time. But Marlon falls out on the way. Into the sink. Near the drain. I flipped out, and kept trying to pick him up. But I hate slimy, scaley (word?) things that flop around like they're having a seizure. So that didn't work. Then I see my sister's headband off to the side. I take it, and pick up Marlon and put him in the tank. Everything seems fine, then he starts having another seizure! So I sang to him. You know that song in Finding Nemo? "Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming..." I sang that to him. And surprisingly, it worked. Although, I'm still breathing quite heavily. But Marlon is safe and sound inside of my room now. That's about it. Everyone have a great day.

      So I don't know which is weirder, the fact that I sound like Sam Collins on the phone, or the fact that Josh now sounds post-pubescent. Whatever. Josh, you're wonderful, I love ya, happy birthday.

      I know this is terrible of me to say, but I feel very fortunate that I have grown up with good friends, and a good background. There are so many people out there that have no goals, no future, and are going to end up cleaning my house some day. I may sound snobbish, but whatever. It's their own damn fault if they don't achieve what they want. It really isn't about money though. It's moreso that you have to work hard to achieve what you want, you have to try to make yourself better. If you are content with your surroundings, you will get nowhere in life. I am so blessed though. And I've cleaned up my room (partially) ! I'm in a wonderful mood lol, I'll write more later.

      I was so tired last night! I think I went to bed at like, 11. Probably later, I barely look at a clock anymore (the joys of summer). Today is going to be devoted to a) Sex and the City or b) cleaning my room. I haven't decided which yet. Nicki said she might stop by sometime, so probably clean up my room. I'm wicked hungry right now, so I'm going to go see what I can cook up in the kitchen. Hopefully Mom got me donuts before she left or something..probably not though. Oh well, whatever. I'll write later. Everyone have a good day.

      I'm in this absolutely wonderful mood right now. It's great. I don't know what exactly brought this mood upon me, but I am grateful that it's here. I had a shitty day and I needed some sort of a "the glass is half full" reminder. I've decided what I'm going to devote my tomorrow to: cleaning my room. And not only cleaning it, but thoroughly organizing it, to the best of my capabilities. This will definitely come in handy when Mike (?) and I paint my room, so all my stuff will be easy to find, and easy to put away. I'm excited. Who knows what I'll find inside my closet. I need to go to the mall too. I had a weird moment earlier today in the car. I was thinking about how I needed clothes, and the first thought that came to me was "hey, maybe this weekend Eric and I can go to Vista Ridge." And then it hit me. Unless Vista Ridge packs up and moves to Atlanta, with me in it, that probably won't happen. Oh well, hopefully the mall will still be there in a month or so. Anyways. I'm beginning to hate those things that people put in their AIM profiles, like "98% of teens have tried to smoke pot. Put this in your profile if you're one of the 2% that haven't" and "If you love someone more than they know, put this in your profile". I hate it! Who the hell cares if you haven't smoked pot before? Sure, it's wonderful, it's your choice, but believe it or not, nobody gives a shit. I'm one to talk though, writing my emotions and such into an online journal that hundreds of people will end up seeing. Whatever, I just needed to talk about that. And by the way, everyone loves someone more than they know. If they knew how much you loved them, then they would get conceited and arrogant, causing you to love them less. Anyways. I guess that's it. Nicki, thank you for the signs. You're awesome. Everyone, have a great day.

      So I started up one of these things. I already have a xanga, a ujournal, and God knows what else, so I figured, what the hell? Why not add in a blog too. Pretty soon I'll get a LiveJournal, a Greatest Journal, and whatever else there is out there. Today absolutely sucked. I expected an easy babysitting job, and some fast cash. What I got was no babysitting job, and a headache. It was wonderful, let me tell you. So Eric's out of town now, he'll be back..the weekend of the 17th I believe. So that's what, 19 more days? I think. I'm working on getting Laura in town. I haven't seen her in a year, and I miss her. When I was filling out the information as to what I want this site to look like, they asked what I wanted the title of the page to be. I had no idea what to put, so I just put in a line. If you have any ideas, feel free to contribute. I guess that's about it. I'm probably going to get addicted as hell to this thing, so whatever. I'm sure I'll write soon. Everyone have a good day.

      Laura's coming tomorrow! In..about 26 hours. I'm so excited...There is so much I need to get accomplished this week! School stuff mainly, but I'm also about to begin the process of remodeling my room. My dad's also coming with Laura, so that should be fun. I can't wait! Anyways, I guess that's about it. Have a neat day.

      I saw Napoleon Dynamite today with Eric and his family today. It was actually really funny, considering it had no plot whatsoever. But I guess that was what was fun about it. It was one of those movies where at the end, you wonder..."Why did I waste my time?" and then you remembered how much you laughed and realize, "I guess I didn't waste my time after all". I also went to YG today for the first time in a month or two. Leah and Alisha met me up there...'Lisha got her belly button pierced and it looks superb. Too bad I can't stand needles...or pain. So Laura will be here on Friday! I can't wait. Anyways, I guess that's about it. Have a great day.

      Eric and I went out to eat at the Olive Garden today. And..afterwards we walked to Blockbuster where this lady that worked there was absolutely terrible to us, and that put me in a bad mood. Oh well, I'm fine now. Anyways, nothing too big's happened lately. Have a good day.

      Eric and I went to the mall today...I got a new pair of jeans! And believe it or not, I think I'll actually wear this pair. We also saw "Anchorman" with the Kayla. It was a pretty funny movie. And..Vince Vaughn was in it, so that's never a bad thing. I have a weird Tim-Allen-sort-of-fetish with Vince Vaughn. (Ask if you don't know about the Tim Allen thing). I can't wait until Laura gets here...11 more days, kids! Anyways, I guess that's about it. Have a great day.

      I dropped Marlon in the sink again (while I was changing his water). Luckily, he didn't have a seizure, he didn't die, and I got him back in the bowl-like thing in about 2 seconds.

      Yesterday I met Eric's Dad...he was very nice. We went out to lunch and then went to a few stores and then out to ice cream at Coldstone. Keith was working, so I got to see him for the first time in a really long time, so that was fun. Tomorrow I think..I'm going to the mall with E. so that should be awesome. Anyways, I guess that's about it. I'm leaving for church soon.  Sidebar:  Leah... I'm so glad it wasn't a dream!!!!!!!!!!

      Hmm, I'm at Leah's right now and we're just hanging out. Today's Danny's birthday (Happy Birthday Danny) so everyone was up at the pool earlier..now they're going to some party. But it's not a party for Danny..yeah, I don't get it either. Alisha's coming over later tonight, and Katie might come over too. I guess it can be considered my last girls' night before E. gets back. Which is tonight, might I add...I can't wait. I have no idea when I'll get to see him, lol, but it's comforting knowing that he'll only be 15 minutes away. I will probably have my permit in 3 months, which means I should have my license before next summer. Anyways, I'm going to go look over some Driver's Ed stuff with Leah so I guess I'll write some other time. Have a good day.  &nbsp; &nbsp; hey Kayla.

      Eric comes back tomorrow! It seems like months and months since I've seen him..although it also feels like he just left yesterday. Anyways...nothing interesting happened today. I watched "Clueless" with my mom last night..during the scene where Cher is taking her driver's test, I honest to God thought my mother would die of laughter. It's amusing how adults think the most random things are funny. For those of you that haven't seen the movie, in the scene Cher accidentally hits a car but continues driving, adding the line that provoked the hysterics, "Should I leave them a note?". Yeah. I couldn't stop laughing either. Anyways, I guess that's about it. Have a good day kids.

      I was going to burn a back-to-school CD for Leah today..but the software wouldn't work. I've read so much these past few days..unfortunately, I've already read the majority of the books before. Although, I did read some book that was on the kitchen table and it was actually really cute.."The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants". There was barely any depth to it, but it was one of those fun summer reads that's only purpose is to entertain, not inform. Eric told me last night that he's coming back on Friday, instead of Saturday. Which is awesome, obviously. I won't be able to see him until Saturday, if at all. But there is some sort of reassurance in knowing that he'll only be a 15 minute car ride away. My mom, sister, and Susan are going furniture shopping today. To be honest, I really am not up for leaving the house. I'm figuring once Eric comes back, I'll end up being somewhat busy every day. Not because I'll be hanging out with him everyday, but because I'll be more likely to get out of bed before 3pm. So I guess I should enjoy this next week as much as possible and be as lazy as possible.   Sidebar: Laura's flight was finally confirmed! The tickets have been bought...she'll be here from July 30th until August 7th. I can't wait. Now..I have to think of ways to keep her entertained. Why am I so boring? Hopefully Eric and Leah will have some ideas...because I'm completely out of them at the moment.   I guess that's it. I'll write more later, everyone have a fantastic day.

      Went to the Jessica Simpson concert tonight. It was really depressing...  It was Jessica's birthday, and she was all sad because Nick's flight got cancelled or some bs story like that. Then she was talking about how her dream birthday gift would be to see Nick, and get a puppy...and diamonds. And low and behold, guess who decides to surprise her at the end of the show? If you guessed Nick, you're smarter than about half the people at the concert that didn't see it coming. Then he serenaded (sp?) her with a song...so sweet. Very cheesy, but nonetheless, incredibly romantic and sweet.Anyways, I guess that's about it. I'll write more later. Have a superb day.

      Kayla apparently figured out that I have Marlon in my room. I don't know when she noticed though...she never mentioned it. I'm really tired though..so yeah, I'm going to go to bed now. I'll write tomorrow..

      Leah spent the night yesterday. We hung out in the hot tub and talked for a while..just the usual. Oh! Leah had Smith's yearbook from Katie, so I finally got to look through that. Carl wasn't in it though. Although, they did have a quote from him talking about Magic the Gathering. Anyways. Tomorrow's the concierto with Nicki and Leah...I find it really amusing that after tomorrow night, 3/4 of the concerts that I have been to have been teen pop sensations. Avril, 'Nsync, now Jessica Simpson. How sad am I? Psh, at least at the Avril one I got to see Gob. Anyways...I guess that's about it. I'll write more later.

      I'm so tired. I woke up really late today. At like, 11. Normally I wake up at about 9:30. Oh well. Nicki got a blog finally. I wonder who has more of these journal things. Probably her. I don't have a greatest journal. I was talking to Eric the other day and he brought up a good point. If a couple starts going out on December 31st, when would their 2 months be? There is no 31st of February. Hmm...anyways I guess that's about it. I'll write more later if something important happens.

      I need new clothes. I've pretty much figured out that I have 3 shirts that I wear. My red VIP choir shirt, Kayla's Flogging Molly shirt, and Leah's Atticus shirt. Oh, and the red striped shirt from Express. It's too hot out now to wear my Tech shirt, or my plain black shirt. I also have 2 pair of pants that I wear. My jeans, and my Tilt capris. I really need new clothes. I have my Dickies, but I need to go get them hemmed. My mom won't give me money until the 16th. That's when she gets her paycheck. It's funny, if I ask her for anything, the answer is always "wait until the 16th". Even if I ask her for dinner. I just need a bunch of shirts. And they must be shirts that I'd actually wear. Oh well. Dad, if you're reading this, your daughter is seriously lacking any form of decent attire. Feel free to let me use your credit card. I want to get that pink Fender shirt..and I want a Coheed and Cambria shirt. Not black though. I want a Gob shirt..the white "Gob saves the queen" one. Oh well. I guess I'll wait until the 16th.

      I had a weird sort of conversation with Leah today. I think at times I tend to take her for granted, but she has pretty much always been my shoulder to cry on. She's my best friend, and she's about as close to me as one can get. She's the only person I'd share a bed with...when they aren't wearing pants. I love you Leah, you're a beautiful person inside and out and if someone doesn't realize that, it's their loss because they truly are missing out on getting to know an incredible girl.    Happy sweet sixteen Nicki!

      On Friday night Leah called me and invited me to go mini-golfing with her dad and Linda. I was totally up for that...minature golfing is one of my most favorite things to do. Only at night though. But then we were on our way there and her dad stopped at the bank to take some money out, and the ATM machine ate his card! So we didn't get to go. We just went back to her dad's apartment and hung out there. I spent the night, and the next morning we woke up and went to look at cars for Leah. There was an awesome S2000 there...and I really want it...After that Mr. Merrill thought he lost his phone so we had to go back to all the dealerships to look for it, but it turns out that he just left it at home. Dustin met up with us then, and we went to go look at more cars. Then we went back to the apartment and hung out some more. It was the 3rd of July, so there was that big fourth of July thing in Addison, so we went there. I saw a bunch of people I know, which was fun. While we were looking for a place to park, Leah thought she say Danny and Pablo and she wanted to go back to where they were but her dad wouldn't drive that far. So we walked. Like..a mile anda half. And we weren't even sure it was them. Luckily, it was. So we ended up just hanging out with their family for the rest of the night. It was fun. Lol, then we walked back to Leah's apartment..which sucks when you're crossing Trinity. Oh well. So yeah, I'm pretty exhausted right now. Oh! So while I was at Leah's, I called my mom and she said "hey Cal, have you heard the good news yet?" and it turns out that Laura is coming to visit!!! I'm so excited about that...I miss her so much. I can't wait for her to meet my friends, and see my house, and especially see Eric. I can't wait. I really want her to meet Leah too. They're a whole lot a like. Anyways, I'm really excited about that...I guess that's about it though. I'll write more later.

      I got online this morning, and the first thing I heard is that Marlon Brando died! The actor, not my fish. That's so weird. I just named my fish like..yesterday. Or the day before. I don't remember. I've kind of lost track of days. RIP Marlon Brando. Anyways. Nicki did come over yesterday. We walked up to blockbuster and rented "Thirteen". That movie is so messed up, I loved it though. I definitely recommend it to everyone. Okay, well yeah, I guess that's about it. I'll write more later. Everyone have a great day.

      So I've gotten to talk to Eric a lot these past two days, which is awesome. I feel bad talking to him sometimes though. Like..he's supposed to be spending time with his dad, and I hope to God that I'm not taking away from that time. But he knows to only call me when there's nobody home, or his dad and stepmom are at work or something. We had a 3 hour long conversation yesterday! (phone). It was crazy. I'm not sure..but I think that's the longest we've talked on the phone before. Although, something is telling me that we've had a 4 hour long conversation at some point or another. Whatever. Maria came over today to clean our house, but she was crying a lot and my mom and I didn't know what to do. Then we finally figured out that she was really sick so my mom took her to the hospital.  Hopefully she'll be okay. I think Nicki might stop by later today. Although I thought she was going to stop by yesterday and she didn't, so I don't really know. But she said she was going to after her orthodontist appointment. We (the family and I) got that summer pass thing from Blockbuster, but we've been too lazy to actually go to Blockbuster and rent any movies, so right now it's looking like it's a complete waste on money. Blockbuster is getting on my nerves though. They don't have a great selection of movies, because they're so committed to being a family-safe store. But damnit, every once in a while, I would like to see a movie that my sister wouldn't be allowed to see! Whatever. I guess that's about it. Good luck Paul!!

      Eric, I love you. Thank you for calling, you made me feel a lot better.  I had an away message up last night. And I guess sometime during the nigiht, the away message went off, leaving no response to let people know that I wasn't near my computer. This morning I checked my computer, and I had 1 message from Andrew telling me that I was sad. I'm not sure if he was saying I was sad because I had called him crying the night before, or because I was online at that hour. But the 2nd one wouldn't really make sense considering I was asleep my bed, and he was the one actually talking. But the first one would be kind of weird, since you would think that it would be obvious that I was sad. Tears are usually a good indication of that. Oh well, whatever. I guess that's about it. There's a cake downstairs that's calling my name. I'll write more later. Everyone have a good day.
