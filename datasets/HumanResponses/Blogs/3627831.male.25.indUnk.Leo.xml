      Why do you look away from yourself? Do you think that you can ignore your pain? Can you just turn your head and let it be gone, or does it still linger in the corner of your eye?  Look at it. Stare at it. Let the fear consume you. For you are not looking away from the pain. You are looking away from the idea of it, and in not looking are bringing the threat to reality. It is easier to look and be done than to continue to look away.   It has been proven that there are things in nature which cannot be successfully observed, for the observation itself changes the very object that was being looked at. It is this way with fear. Once embraced without restraint, they disolve completely or become insignificant. We are free from fear as we acknowledge it and embrace it. Once we realize that our fears are part of our very make-up, they cease to have control over us.  More important is the place where we have kept these feelings; the emptiness where we have tried to hide our darkest secrets even form ourselves. For it is here that we find our higher self, our connection with God.  It was the fear that our actions or our past was in some way shamefull to this presence that kept us from looking at it. The less we looked, the more shame we felt and the more afraid we became. When we finally look, we find that god has loved us whithout condition. There is no amount of shame or any act so abhorrent that would turn god away from us. We are the ones who deny ourselves companionship with god, we are the ones who put conditions on our relationship.   Once we overcome our fear and look at the decay we have held in our heart, the darkness turns to light and soon the cup will overflow with joy.

      A friend of mine was telling me about this whole blogging thing. I guess i kind of missed the boat. Been going on for quite some time. I've never been one to get in on the ground floor of anything anyway. In the end it doesn't matter when you find the path, just so long as you find it. Anyway, I just thaught I'd see what all the fuss was about and found that this would be a nice place to kind of collect my thaughts; a place to describe my philosophy.   It really matters little if anyone agrees with my views. This is only a half truth. I really would enjoy hearing from those who see things like i do or are interested in my "opinions". But if I get absolutly no response to my writing I will not be dissapointed. I'm sure most that visit will just see the mondane ramblings of some seemingly random individual. Fair enough.  The fact of the matter is that I am a fairly content and patient individual. I can't help but ask myself why. And, in doing so, maybe I can describe some of my beleifs which can help a few others reach a higher level of personal satisfaction.  I'll try not to boast on myself too much. I do not mean to give the impression that I am some kind of modern saint. I am not immune to obsession, lust, greed, loneliness, procrastination, or any number of personal defects. But there are times when I transcend these earthly ties and allow myself to feel complete, if only for a few minutes, hours or days at a time.   I think that by exploring this, I can help myself to bring these occurrences more frequent and perhaps more intense. If this be the case than why not publish my thaughts on the matter so that I may help someone else along the way.

       The price of apathy towards public affairs is to be ruled by evil men.  - Plato   Those who can win a war well can rarely make a good peace and those who could make a good peace would never have won the war.  - Winston Churchill   When the rich make war it's the poor that die.  - Jean-Paul Sartre    You cannot simultaneously prevent and prepare for war.  - Albert Einstein   Never think that war, no matter how necessary, nor how justified, is not a crime.  - Ernest Hemingway   People never lie so much as after a hunt, during a war or before an election.  - Otto von Bismarck   In all history there is no war which was not hatched by the governments, the governments alone, independent of the interests of the people, to whom war is always pernicious even when successful.  - Leo Tolstoy    But in modern war..You die like a dog for no good reason.  - Ernest Hemingway

      The 9-11 commission announced today that there was no connection between Saddam Hussain's regime in Iraq and Al Q'uada.  President Bush responded with confidence:  "The reason I keep insisting that there was a connection between Iraq and Saddam and al-Qaida is because there   was    a connection between Iraq and al-Qaida."  That's great Mr. President but you didn't offer much of a reason. All you really did was insist again.
