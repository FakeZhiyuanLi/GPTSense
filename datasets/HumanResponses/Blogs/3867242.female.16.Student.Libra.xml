      Today has been a pretty depressing day :(. Like Monday night, I didn't get a lot of sleep last night. To make manners worse, I woke up around 7:30 this morning&nbsp;because my jerky brother just had to pick a fight with my sister...grr. I went to work today..I was supposed to work from 12-7:45 but I went home at 3..because we didn't get a lot of business today in good old concession. I took a nap again today, and had some terrible dreams that I don't want to share with anyone. Plus, I miss my mom!! My mom always goes on business trips for work. She's been in Chicago since Monday..and won't be back till' Friday. I've been used to my mom traveling a lot since I was little..but I miss her!! There's another why I'm sad..but I don't want to share what is it on here..just pray that I feel happy really soon. I will on this weekend when my mom is home and I go to Kennywood :). So yeah..I would write more..but again I'm not in the best mood..sorry.

      I hate rain. Why do I have live through snowy winters, and rainy summers!! I can't wait to get out of this stupid state...I don't care if I have family and friends here...this place is booooorrrrrrrrrinnnnnnnggggg!! Anyways today been an alright day. I didn't get a lot of sleep last night though...I&nbsp;had a lot on my mind..and I can't never sleep when I have a dilema or when my brain has the juices going at a fast pace. I woke up around 7:30 this morning because my stupid cat is in heat and was moaning outside my door. So I gave up and got up and drank my daily dose of good ol' O.J. This afternoon I visited my grandma, watched my usual soap operas, and then made up for lost sleep last night by taking a nap. I really have no big plans this week until Sunday when I'm going to Kennywood with Day and hopefully Ashley C. I just pray that it doesn't rain tommorrow because I don't how much more I can take of this crappy weather! It's making me depressed..especially since my skin is shade of Dracula. Whatever...I'm going to stop whining and make the best of it...sigh...

      I would be watching the Red Sox vs. Yankees game right now..but now I am mad at my Boston Red Sox..for they're already losing in the 1st inning! I am a fan that is not happy right now! So anyways..my day was pretty boring. I went to church..and then I went to work. Work was so slllllloooooow today. Nobody was there for most of the time. I mainly cleaned and talked to&nbsp;Chris, Drew, and Ashley&nbsp;whenever they were on there break. After work mom and Rachael let me drive them home from Meadville (I still have so many hours to go!). Then I watch a little of I love of the 80s Strike Back. I am such a loser for liking shows on Vh1 that talk about pop culture from the past few decades. I didn't live in the 70s..I was born in the late 80s..and so the only decade I can mostly remember is the 90s. Anyways...I'm really bored right now..and I don't want to watch the game..because I'm mad at the Red Sox! So I'll sit here awhile and check on the game later. Later...:)

      This is my second post today..even though it seems like my first..(Last post was around 12:15 last night..so it still considered today instead). But I wanted to post some lyrics of this&nbsp;awesome song that's starting to get some air play. I first heard about Ryan Cabera from watching "The Ashlee Simpson Show" (I'm truly sick of reality shows..and Ashlee is a bigger brat than Jessica!)..and anyways..Ashlee is dating Ryan. A few nights later I heard "On the Way Down" and fell in love with the song as well as it's lyrics.   Sick and tired of this world  There's no more air  Tripping over myself, going nowhere  Waiting, suffocating, no direction  I took a dive and  [CHORUS]  On the way down  I saw you, and you saved me from myself  And I won't forget the way you loved me  And on the way down  I almost fell right through  But I held on to you  Been wondering why it's only me  Have you always been inside waiting to breathe  It's alright, sunlight on my face  I wake up and yet, I'm alive 'cause  [CHORUS]  I was so afraid of going under  But now, the weight of the world  Feels like nothing, nothing  (down, down, down)  You're all I wanted  (down, down, down)  You're all I needed  (down, down, down)  You're all I wanted  You're all I needed  And I won't forget the way you loved me  All that I wanted, all that I needed and now  [CHORUS]

      Everything was going pretty good today..until' a few hours ago..(keep reading)..Anyways I went to my grandma's today..and then I went to work. Work was boring and nothing exciting happen. After work..I headed over to MCT..to see "At This Evening's Performance"..and it was awesome! I highly recommend it..Dan did a awesome job w/ directing..as well as Stephanie and Grant acting. So go see it..the 7 dollars is worth it! After the play I went home w/ Mike..and his dad drove. By time we reached East Mead..a stupid deer ran out to the road and hit the driver's side of the van. Nobody is hurt..but the car took some damage..and after all that the stupid&nbsp; deer ran away. I feel really shaky right now..because about year ago..Rachael and I almost hit a dog..and well we hit a tree. That's might be the reason why I'm not in a such a hurry to get my linese..and I'm lazy..well..it's late...night.

      Today was pretty boring as usual...I woke up&nbsp;around 11..watched the View...and then took a shower. Then I ate lunch and took a nap. After my nap I ate dinner..and then when to my driving lesson. The most interesting part of my day was my driving lesson. This is my 4th lesson with Mr. Deardorff (I think that's how you spell his name..he's a math teacher at MASH..and he sounds like Kermit the Frog..haha..Drew). So anyways back to the subject at hand..My first three lessons were pretty stupid because I basically drove around Saegertown, Guys Mills (why? I don't know), and Cambridge Springs, as well as Meadville. Well..this lesson I drove North I-79! When Mr. D...told me that I was "Dear God..help us all!"..because I've only drove the backroads of Crawford County and not the highway! I said a quick prayer and I merge on the highway (with no problems thank God..but it was hard!), and drove at 65 mph!! It was nuts!! But I survived..and I am able to type this in one piece! I have another lesson tommorrow..and I'm scared that we'll take another trip on great I-79! Anyways..that's all I have to say for now..later

      Today..been pretty depressing. I went to the denist today..and I have no problems..except my wisdom teeth are already coming in! I don't have to get them pulled but's it's sad..because I will someday! Then I had to wait in the denist office for like a half hour afterwards because Rachael had to teach swimming lessons..and no one else could get me. Then I when home and ate lunch. Then Rachael and I went to Meadville..and then we headed for the REC for work. 1 hour after I got there we had to close the pool because it's raining really hard. So after Kim (my boss) and I cleaned up..I went home. So I&nbsp;only got&nbsp;payed for&nbsp;1 hour worth of work today :(&nbsp;The only great thing about my day was I ate chinese for dinner. Now, I'm kind of bored...I filled out this survey (160 questions!) that Mike send me over hotmail. I'm thinking about watching t.v. with the family soon. Tommorrow, I'm possibly going to my Grandma's house and then I have good old driving lessons again. That's all I have..I'm sorry..I'm not in the best mood right now..I wish something exciting would happen and I would be happy. Night and sweet dreams.

      Today was really boring!!!! I didn't work today, and I didn't have driving lessons. I just watched my usual dose of Soap Operas..and I finally got around to cleaning my room. Then I made dinner for the family (I'm surprise that I didn't burn the house or anything!) Then I went to Kyle's soccer game. Now, I'm here..bored out of my mind!!! I can't wait till' next month! I'm going to Kennywood on the 1st with the family and some friends. Then on the 13th I'm going to see John Mayer and Maroon 5 in concert...my life is&nbsp;almost complete!&nbsp;I can't wait to see John Mayer play the guitar&nbsp; and&nbsp; sing&nbsp;in person!! Yeah..I can't stop smiling when I even think about it. Then of course there's the fair. The fair is o.k..I just come for food and friends..the rides are dangerous..haha...Kyle. Oh, I can't forget about at "This Evening Performance"..directed by my awesome friend Dan..and starring my friends Stephanie and Grant. So please see it..I'm sure it's going to be awesome. Well..that's all I have..see ya!

      Alright..Here's a recap of what I did yesterday. My day was boring until I went to Old Home Days. There I hung out with Daylin, Mike, Ashley, Lacey, and Jenna and Brittany (these two girls Daylin met at Creation and they go to Conneaut Lake). Then we&nbsp;to went to Daylin's sister house to have a bonfire. Everyone I hung out with earlier was there and so what Kevin and Jake. We hung out in woods (fun unless it's pitch black!) and we play the "question game". Then for 10 min.&nbsp;Zack came..haha.&nbsp; Everyone left around 11 except Daylin, Brittany, and me. We spent the night, and ended up&nbsp;watching South Park till' 2 in the morning..haha! Then I had to wake up around 9 so I could go to the parade and stuff. After the parade, my family went to Old Home Days to eat..then I went home (none of my close friends were there today :( !) Then I took a long nap because I was so tired!! Tommorrow I'm going to church and I work. Next week is gonna be busy, I work four days and I have driving lessons as well as other stuff. I can't believe summer is half way over! It's makes me sad and depressed!! I've had a great summer. I did some fun stuff, I made some money, and I met some great people too. I just wish stuff like this wouldn't go so fast. As the saying goes "time flies when your having fun".

      Today has been an alright day. I went to the eye doctor today (my eyes haven't gotten any worse..thank God). Then since I got called off of work today, I went to Pizza Hut with Rachael and Kyle. Afterwards, we went to Giant Eagle to buy food, etc. because my mom doesn't have anytime this week to do that sort of thing. When I got home I watched Days of Our Lives, and I read my issue of Teen People that I bought. (Kristen Dunst is on the cover, they had a big back to school issue, but I can't think about that..it's too soon!) Then I went to my room, and watched "Catch Me If You Can". Awhile ago I ate dinner, we had tacos..yeah. Now, I'm typing crap about my really boring day, so no wonder why this post is extremely lame. At least I get to watch I love the 90s again tonight (Tonight, it's '96 and '97..so they're talking about the Backstreet Boys..that bring me back..haha.)  Tommorrow afternoon, I'm going to Old Home Days and meeting Daylin, Ashley, Mike and the usual crew to hang out. Then I'm spending the night at Daylin's sister Dana's house. Then on Saturday I might to go the parade and stuff. Then Sunday I'm going to church and then I'm back at work. So that's all I have..I'm sorry that I wasted your time with my craziness...haha

      Haha..I didn't update this thing yesterday..so here a recap of what I did yesterday... I finally after two weeks of impatient waiting..I saw "Spider Man 2". The movie totally kicked..something. Doc Ock..is an awesome villian..and I loved the ending. I can't wait for number 3..but it doens't come out till' like 2007 :(. After that, I went to the REC because I was taking driving lessons..and my teacher was picking me up there. While I was waiting I chatted with Ian..about some stuff..I don't remember exactly what we talked about..haha. The lesson when good..I drove from Meadville to Mt. Hope..past my house...through Blooming Valley...to Saegertown..then to the REC. After that I waited for Rachael to take me home..but there was a lifeguard meeting...so I waited for like 20 minutes..but Ian and Kim my concession boss kept me company. Then when I got home..I watched I love the 90s... Today, I woke up around 10:30 and then when to my grandma's house with Rachael and Kyle. We ate at Porter's and then watched Days of Our Lives. Then I went home and a bunch of girls called for Kyle..haha. Then I when for my driving lesson, and it rained for most of my lesson..ahh. Then I when home and watched I love the 90s again. It's on a commerical break right now..so I type this really fast.  Tommorrow, I have to get my eyes checked at the eye doctor..then I'm heading to work. Alright, today wasn't so exiciting but aleast I wasn't bored!!

      Today I woke up at 11:30 (!) because I had a hard time sleeping last night due to thunderstorms...I hate them!! I always had and always will. It's almost 4:00 already and I feel like my day hasn't really started yet. In a few hours I'm going to take driving lessons. Watch out Meadville because I'm driving. Anyways I didn't clean my room today...because I didn't have enough energy to do it..or in other words I can't get off my lazy behind. I'll get to it tommorrow...after I come home from Erie to see Spider Man 2 (!) other than that nothing really exiciting going on. I don't work till' Thursday.  It's weird how last week I was working almost 5 days, and this week I'm working 2..but oh well. I can't wait till' this weekend because not only do I not work..but it's Townville Old Home Days. I know I'm doing a lot of repeats from my past postings..but my life isn't that interesting right now. It sucks that I don't have my linese and my friends are doing so many different things this summer. I guess it's better than sitting in school right now (eek!) This school year is going to suck because of the classes I'm taking and I have to start looking at colleges and take PSSAs, SATs, the SAMS test, as well as my driver linese's test (double eek!). I guess I can enjoy this semi-boring time in my life right now while I can..because it's going to be stressful in a few months!! See ya...

      Today was pretty busy. I went to church..and then I went to work. It was like 150 degrees in concession and I made the huge mistake of wearing jeans. I thought I was going to die of the heat. The good thing was everyone who bought something..bought something cold!! I only had to use the fryer like a few times. (Excuse me Drew, but I had to cook a seasoned chicken sandwich for you..haha..it's alright.) When I got home I watched "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition"..then I watched a little bit of Harry Potter (haha..Ian), then I talked to some people on ICQ, AOL, and MSN (unfornuately one person who I can't stand was trying to talk to me..), now I'm writing for no reason..haha. Tommorrow, I'm taking driving lessons, and cleaning my room (yeah..wish me luck) and then I'm watching I love the 90s. Then Tuesday...I'm going to finally see Spider Man 2!! Yeah!!!!!!! I'm so happy..I'm such a loser because I get exicited for movies..haha. Well..that all the brainstormig juice that I have. Night...!

      Today was a long day at work. I didn't get out till' 7:30 (I was supposed at 7). Then I didn't have enough time to see Spider Man 2! AHH!!!! When am I going to see Peter Parker take off his shirt? haha. After I finally got out of work, my parents took me to Grandpa's and I got soft served Orange (wasn't great..but it was ice cream.) Now I am home..with nothing to do, just listening to Stevie Nicks "Edge of Seventeen" on the radio (hey when you think about it I am on the edge of seventeen..haha..) Nobody is online tonight..I only talked to like two people. Tommorrow, I'm going to church, then work. I guess I can look foward to next weekend..because it's Townille Old Home Days. I know it's lame but I do like the parade (hey, you get free candy..haha). Dough boys are always good (they're better than the ones we sell at the REC.) Anyways, I thinking about headed to bed soon..or I might watch "A Knight Tale" again...Heath Ledger is HOT in that movie. I love how they put semi-modern music into a movie about the middle ages..haha. Well...I'm going to see if I can do anything semi-exciting with my lame boring self. Night...

      Well..I ended up not going to the Conaway family function..so I'm home now..but anyways..for those of you who don't know me that well..I do write poems. I have written some really good ones..and some really bad ones. This one that I am willing to share. It is about a guy..of course..and hopefully I tell this guy how I feel about him..soon..but we'll see...anyways here another stupid poem  "Feelings of many kinds" The air is clear tonight, but somehow I'm breathless. Emotions and feelings are overwhelming and making me restless. How can I tell if what I'm feeling is real? I've been immuned to rejection, and my soul can not feel. I'm scared of what I'm getting myself into. Afraid that you won't feel the same way too. I'm taking my time, but time goes so fast. Any chance I have being with you might not last. I get confused by your signs. I wonder if our thoughts are aligned. Please tell me that my worries are wrong. Tell me that you loved me along. I know it's wishful thinking, but then again I might be right by what I'm dreaming. Between us, I can feel some heat. When I see you, my heart skips a beat. When I look in your eyes, my heart can melt. I'm wondering when you see mine, how you felt. I'm putting my heart on the floor. I'm hoping that our friendshipe mean more. You are like a shooting star, because with you my heart can go far!

      Today was another boring day!! They called me off work again..so now here am I sitting at the computer with nothing to do. I'm sort of tired right now..last night at Ashley's was a blast. Even though I suck at badminton..right Craig? haha...We watch "50 1st Dates" and it was a funny movie. Today after they sent me home from the REC..I got my paycheck (yeah!)..and then went to McDonald's with my mom and Kyle.  I'm having a family get together tonight instead of seeing Spider Man 2:(. I might see it tommorrow, so you if want to come see with it give me a ring on my cell. Tommorrow I'm working cashier at the REC..so if you want to swim.. visit me there. I have nothing to do during cashier! I wish I could talk to someone...but there's cameras there..and we're supposed to be on the job..right Drew? haha...well...I gotta go..family duties call..See ya!

      Today..has been really boring!! I thought I was going to work today..but I didn't have to come because nobody was there. In about in a hour, I'm going to Ashley's (see yesterday's post) and I'm sure I'm going to have a lot of fun. I wonder if Ashley's dog is going to tackle Mike again..haha..that was one of the funniest things ever! Tommorrow I'm hopefully going to work and then I'm going to Erie to finally see Spider Man 2! I'm really excited..everyone I've talked to who has seen it said it was awesome.  Feelings today was neutral..I'm not happy or sad..just blah. Other than that, things are going awesome! See ya later...

      Well..today I found out about blogger from a website..so I said to myself "Self that looks cool..let's make a lame semi-cool blog to share with your buddies." So I took my own advice and voila here's my blog. I didn't work today..so after Rachael got home from teaching swimming lessons..I got to drive for awhile. Unfornuately..my driving is going nowhere..and I feel like I'm not going to drive on my own until I'm 80!! But I called some driving school place..and I have some lessons next week, (yeah, Daylin I used the phone..aren't you proud of me?).  Then I called Ashley and told her I can't come to her house until 8..because I am working tommorrow. So yeah, tommorrow I'm going to Ashley's..and Mike, Daylin, and Jake will be there..yeah. And then on Friday I'm finally going to see Spider Man 2!! Then this weekend I'm working at the wonderful REC.  Work is going o.k...some days nobody shows up..and other days there's too many people! The staff party on Monday was fun..I got to hang out with Harmony, Ian, and Drew. I played in the baby pool..and Drew and I went down the water slide pretty fast!! Then after those guys left, Rachael, Lucas, and I went home.  So yeah..I know that's long..but hey I have a lot to say! Life's been pretty busy for me lately..with work..and stuff. I hope I have enough time next week to watch I love the 90s! (Finally, a decade I actually remember what happened!!) Anyways that's all I have to say. Oh..wait I finally got AOL! I only have like 6 people on my list..so add me..will you? it's stephc0687. See ya...

      Yesterday had to be in my opinion one of the best days ever! This day has to be in my top 10 favorite days of all time! The only bad thing I have to say about the concert was the crappy dj that opened at the beginning. Some people behind me yelled "Bring out Maroon and Mayer!". Well when Maroon 5 came out the place went nuts. Girls crying, people screaming "at the tops of there lungs" (haha..I just had to throw a lyric line from "No Such Thing"..John's breakout song). But yeah Adam the lead singer just has an awesome stage presence about him..and James the lead guitar player kicked major...I just loved them. I swear that whole place wented crazy when they performed "She Will Be Loved". Now I want to rush to Border's and buy there CD. I also recommed there song "Sunday Morning"..great great song. The band was awesome..and again I love them. Then of course there my birthday buddy (I found out that John Mayer was born 10 years before me..on my b-day October 16th!). Gosh...seeing John Mayer  in person  was one of my life goals that was completed last night. All the way from singing "Clarity" to ending with "Neon" were the best 90 minutes ever! Of course I almost cried he sang "Wheel", "Your Body Is A Wonderland"..and so many good songs...and I loved the way he talked to the crowd. No my favorite part was he said for a few mintues "Why are musicans suddenly become political active these days?..there's singers for a reason..because they can't talk..so it doesn't matter to vote for red or blue..vote for you feel right about"..yeah I'm sick of celebrites and musicans telling us how to think on political issues but that's another story. Anyways..the crowd (including myself and my mommmy :) got so into the concert..and he came out for an encore! I thought it would be one song but it ended being four! The last song "Neon" John brought out James from Maroon 5 and they played awesome together!! They played the guitar behind there heads and then at the end they rammed the guitars together and played..it was awesome!! I also got to hear John's new song that won't be out until the record is out (which I hope is soon!)..and it talks about how people can suck at relationships! (I swear this should be my theme song!!!!!!!)..but yeah THE BEST CONCERT I'VE BEEN TO YET!! LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      I just came back from the staff party at the REC. The cool about working at the REC is staff parties where you can ice skate and swim after hours. I've never been ice skating before..and so after get convinced by Harmony, Ashley, and Kat..I tried to put some skates on, but I fell over as soon I as put them on and stood up. So I decided to go on the rink in my flipflops because Corbin was doing it too...haha. Well then Harmony was trying to get me to "skate" but that didn't go very well. Then we had to get off the rink because there was a hockey game that was going to take place. So then I got in the pool. The pool was fun..people jumping off the diving board and then people going up and down the waterslide (I didn't go up it though..haha)..and it was fun. Then the foam surfboard was fun even though Drew hitted me..but everything is alright ;). I had to go home because no only was it getting cold but Rachael and Lucas wanted to go home (they didn't swim). But yeah is was fun. I just hope I don't get a cold because I will be screaming at John Mayer and Maroon 5 tommorrow :)...Wow this has been an awesome week and the best part is tommorrow. I've been waiting for this for a few months and it's finally here! yeah! Yeah..I'm heading off soon..later :)

      Yesterday was a blast. I was happy when Daylin called me yesterday and wondered if I wanted to come over to her sister's house..and of course I did..haha. I arrived around 5 and I remember Ashley, Daylin, Mike, Jake, and Craig "leading back" to that Fat Joe song..(haha...I remember doing that with Ash and Day at Kennywood). Then people got hungry and Ashley and I made brownies..and I bought everyone wings from this place a few miles away. So since not of us had our linese, Daylin, Craig, and Mike rode 4-wheelers to the place (I mean this is Centerville we're talking about..haha). Well..halfway there one of the 4-wheelers ran out of gas so they came back and got gas. The wings were good and we ate outside in the nice weather. After that everyone (except me that is) rode 4-wheelers in the woods. Personally, I don't like 4-wheelers..and they kept trying to run me over!! So yeah..I played with the dogs outside..and they got into a mud fight. Thanks goodness I wasn't involved in that because I didn't have anything extra to wear except my bathing suit. After that I had to be all "mother" like and hose them off and doing little jobs for them. After that we got in the hot tub..since it was outside we were under the stars and we listened to the radio (haha..Mike and Jake like to sing to Jessica Simpson!). After that we watched "Sleepy Hollow". That was a creepy movie..and I must admit Johnny Depp was pretty hot..haha. Then Craig's dad took me, Mike, and Jake home. Today I had to work all day..and that was it..haha..nothing exciting. Tommorrow..staff party at the REC..yeah! Later...;)

      My day was really boring and so I decided that instead of writing about nothing..I'll write about something..haha. I'm willing to share another poem with y'all even though it sucks. I wrote about this poem about what kind of things I feel whenever I'm in love or in a relationship with someone. Right now..I'm  not  in love..just crushing a little..haha..but I'll neeevvverr tell! (Don't Say A Word..is an awesome movie! Go Brittany Murphy!) So yeah..here it is.  Whenever I Think About You  Whenever I feel the breeze of fresh summer air, I can feel your brace lock around me. Whenever I hear a love song, I think about how I want to dance with you. Whenever I watch the rain, I cry because I think about your pain. Whenever I hear a child's laugh, I laugh because you too are a child at heart. Whenever I wake up,  I think about how it's going to be a beauitful day because you are a part of my life. Whenever I pick a flower, I think about how rare and beauiful you are. Whenever I am sad, I wish you were there to hold me and tell me everything is going to be alright. Whenever you say you love me, it sends chills down my spine because you picked me out of everyone else in the world. Whenever I see these things, I love you more than before.

      One word to describe my day at work...ZZZZZ. Cashier must be the most boring job at the REC besides lifeguarding. I had sit at the good old cashier's desk for like 8 hours. The only time I didn't was when I was on my break..or when I counted my drawer. But yeah..I get payed. The only entertaining thing about today was Mallory fixing Ian's boo boo when he cutted himself cutting lettuce. Nothing happened at the cashier's desk today except me reading my YM magazine and drawing..haha. Oh and Chris using my cell phone because he said his "is a piece of crap"..and I talked to the lifeguards too..like Drew and Harmony. I have work cashier again on Wednesday and Saturday..and I come to the staff party on Thursday (If I decide to go..but I think I will..good times on the waterslide :). Tommorrow..no big plans..maybe getting some hours for my permit..I got some time today! I need to get together with friends soon..maybe next weekend..because this weekend I am booked! I can't wait till' Friday..John Mayer  and  Maroon 5  in concert!  Then I'm working the rest of the weekend. So yeah..that's all I have..later!

      Before I start blabbing visit this site--> http://www.freewebs.com/nayaka4watashi/ It's Mike:) I have to put these lyrics to this song on this blog. It's "Dare you to Move" by Switchfoot. It was in "A Walk to Remember"..I think it's such a pretty song. I love it! I would love it if a guy sang it to me..haha..but that's a whole different story for another time. I also love how Switchfoot is a Christian band..that's always a good thing:) Anyways here are the lyrics....  Welcome to the planet Welcome to existence Everyone's here Everyone's here Everybody's watching you now Everybody waits for you now What happens next? What happens next?  I dare you to move I dare you to move I dare you to lift yourself up off the floor I dare you to move I dare you to move Like today never happened Today never happened before  Welcome to the fallout Welcome to resistance The tension is here The tension is here Between who you are and who you could be Between how it is and how it should be  I dare you to move I dare you to move I dare you to lift yourself up off the floor I dare you to move I dare you to move Like today never happened Today never happened  Maybe redemption has stories to tell Maybe forgiveness is right where you fell Where can you run to escape from yourself? Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go? Salvation is here  I dare you to move  I dare you to move  I dare you to lift yourself  Lift yourself up off the floor  I dare you to move  I dare you to move  Like today never happened  Today never happened  Today never happened  Today never happened before

      I'm sooo bored right now. I slept in till' 11 today..and so yeah..that's all that happened so far. Except I drove a little today. Which is the first time since I had driving lessons awhile ago. I watched A 2 Z "Sixteen Candles"..and I must say that it was funny :). ANT even though I hated him on "Last Comic Standing" (not because he's gay..he's rude and annoying)..I loved his impression of Jim Carrey. Apparently, Jim Carrey was supposed to play Farmer Ted in the movie..but it ended up being Anthony Michael Hall instead. Anyways Rachael and I baked brownies. I wish I would do something with her today, but she's heading for work for awhile, plus it's Lucas's birthday and she's doing stuff with him later. So here I sit in front the computer with nothing better to do. Sigh...I have to work tommorrow..and Satuday..and Sunday. So I have a busy work weekend coming up. The Meadville Medical Center pinic is Saturday and I'm sure it's going to be a living hell! Sigh..I hate my life lately..but's that another story I just don't want to go into detail right now. I just hope that things will better soon..I'm sure they will..I'm just in a flipping stump right now. I think it's the weather gets better..I'll be happier...and when I finally get my linese..I'll be even more happier! But yeah..I'm alright..I'm just being a brat..so don't mind my constant complaining that I do quite often on this blog. I need to get to together with my friends soon. I haven't seen Rachel, M-dawg, Craig or Mike lately! I saw Daylin and Ashley on Sunday (see Kennywood!) and that was fun. Sigh again...this blog is going to be long since I have nothing better to do right now. Again much randomness and complaining about how my life sucks lately. Except my hair is better now..haha. Anyways another random thought..I want to see "Princess Diaries 2"..why you ask? I've read all the books..even the movie doesn't do the books justice..I want to see it. The first one was good and I'm sure the second will be better. I also want to see "the Village"..even though I am a wuss when watching scary movies (I remember Jodi grabbing me during "The Ring"..or Craig coming behind the couch at Mike's b-day bash during "Gothika")..so yeah you've been warned if you might see "The Village" with me. Alright..I'm going to shut up now..I must look for a backpack for school. Sigh..we must clear ones now thanks for a few dumb ass individuals that go to our wonderful school. Geez...I am swearing today..I'm sorry about that. I promise I'll do some praying after I get off the computer. See ya :)

      Today has been an alright day. I slept in till' 10...and listened to my Sarah McLachlan CD..I love her old stuff :). Anyways I got my haircut today and I feel and look so much better! I don't have anymore bulk at the bottom and I got highlights. Of course you might not care..my hair is important to me. Guys..it's a girl thing..kay? haha..I'm such a loser but anyways..yeah..that was the "highlight" of my day. Yeah..so much excitment. I went to Kyle's soccer game..nothing exciting..I did want to stay and watch Mike's game..but my parents said "no". Then I watched "I love the 90s" a little bit. I can't get nothing of that show. I love Mo Rocca (loved him on the "Daily Show"), and John Mayer was quite funny too (Countdown to the big concert is like only 8 days! yeah!) So yeah..today was quite boring except my getting my haircut. I also found out Heather (the girl who cuts my hair) is going to the concert too. So much randomness but whatever..it's my blog. Anyways as I was saying..today was boring..tomorrow will be boring..the next day will and I have to work (unless it's crappy like the forecast said it would.)..so yeah that's all I have to say for now. blah blah blah..good bye :)

      Oh my gosh...I have to put this song up here! The song is called "1985" and it's by Bowling for Soup..I love this song! I'm sorry for the blabbing but it's a cool song. There's so many cool 80's references in it. I wasn't born in 1985 (Rachael was)..but I was born two years after that (Two and a half more months till' my birthday!). I love how they talk about U2(!), Duran Duran, Pretty in Pink, and Bruce (!!!)..so yeah here are the lyrics!!  Woohoo  Woohoo   Debbie just hit the wall  She never had it all  One Prozac a day  Husbands a CPA  Her dreams went out the door  When she turned twenty four  Only been with one man  What happen to her plan?   She was gonna be an actress  She was gonna be a star  She was gonna shake her ass  On the hood of white snake’s car  Her yellow SUV is now the enemy  Looks at her average life  And nothing has been alright   Springstein, Madonna  Way before Nirvana  There was U2 and Blondie  And music still on MTV  Her two kids in high school  They tell her that she’s uncool  But she still preoccupied  With 19, 19, 1985   Woohoo  (1985)  Woohoo   She's seen all the classics  She knows every line  Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink  Even Saint Elmo's Fire  She rocked out to wham  Not a big Limp Biscuit fan  Thought she’d get a hand  On a member of Duran Duran   Where’s the mini-skirt made of snake skin  And who’s the other guy singing in Van Halen  When did reality become T.V.  What ever happen to sitcoms, game shows  (on the radio there was)   Springstein, Madonna  Way before Nirvana  There was U2 and Blondie  And music still on MTV  Her two kids in high school  They tell her that she’s uncool  But she still preoccupied  With 19, 19, 1985   Woohoo   She hates time make it stop  When did Motley Crew become classic rock?  And when did Ozzy become an actor?  Please make this stop  Stop!  And bring back   Springstein, Madonna  Way before Nirvana  There was U2 and Blondie  And music still on MTV  Her two kids in high school  They tell her that she’s uncool  But she still preoccupied  With 1985   Springstein, Madonna  Way before Nirvana  There was U2 and Blondie  And music still on MTV  Her two kids in high school  They tell her that she’s uncool  But she still preoccupied  With 19, 19, 1985

      Today was an awesome day. I got some sun and I got hang out with Ashley and Daylin. I've never been to Kennywood before, and I must say I wasn't disappointed. I am wuss when it comes to amusement park rides, but I rode a few. I hated "The Exterminator". I did cry like a baby..the first time I've cried since I watched the last show of "Friends"! I liked the water rides even though I was wet for like 2 hours and my hair was doing something funky.  Today for the first time I tried deep fried Oreos. They dip Oreos in funnel cake batter and fry them. They are so good!! Daylin spray sugar all over my cousin Kenny..haha! Anyways, it was fun and there were some memorable moments especially on the way home. Everyone in the car not only made me listen to Blink 182 (gah! I only like a few of there songs.) but they made me listen to techno...AHHHHH!!!!!!! We had to listen to Eifel 65's "Blue (Da be Da..or whatever) like three times. Ashley had her hair all 80s like with the side ponytail. The dance routine Kyle and Kenny did to stupid Eifel 65. My mom rocking out to Rod Stewart...so many more I can't think right now and most of the funny ones will take too much space for this blog. All I can say now is that it was blast...and the next time we go..I'm getting revenge by having everyone listen to John Mayer even though they hate him. (Which is   crazy!  John Mayer is best singer/guitar player/writer of my generation! 12 days till' I see him and Maroon 5! YEAH!) So yeah...I'm heading to bed now..I'm flipping tired! Night!
