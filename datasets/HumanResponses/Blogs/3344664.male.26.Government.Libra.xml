      So I have this friend which I recently came into contact with that showed me their blog, I had never seen one before and at first I thought it was kind of lame, especially after reading their first entry but then I figured why not.  With a degree in English I figure I should be able to write a couple paragraphs every now and then without too much effort.  I just finished going to a two day conference, one of those where the presenters try to be entertaining but after the presentation is done you're still left asking yourself, did I actually learn anything?  One of the speakers from SUU (Southern Utah University) was actually really good and said some things that I was beginning to realize myself but she helped to reinforce.  You can change everything with your own mind.  From one day to the next you can go from being the saddest person in the world to being the happiest, all you have to do is wake up and decide that your outlook for the day is going to be positive.  There is no absolute reality, only reality as we perceive it (ok I'm not trying to sound like the Matrix but it's a simple truth that people see things differently--glass half full/empty).  To get a little personal, recently I had been having difficulties in my marriage, and I was ready to give up, I thought there was nothing left that I could do to save it and I started not even wanting to save it.  Finally, I decided to give it one more effort.  The mental decision to "try" is the biggest thing that you can do, from one day to the next things went from desperate to enjoyable.  Now I have to say that you don't fix your marriage in one day and who knows what will happen a month from now but by having a good attitude you can change your reality.

      So I have this friend that constantly lies about their situation.  Why I don't understand is that shouldn't I get tired of the lies after a while?  I don't know what it is but there's something about it that just makes me want to stay friends, you know how you just get along with some people better than others.  Anyway, maybe I just need to learn how to cut the strings and be free of some people.

      I remember the first time I heard the expression "don't burn your bridges."  It made no sense to me at all.  Lately it has seemed to make more and more sense to me.  The funny thing with that expression is that it can apply to anywhere you want to go, whether or not you've been there before.  If you want to go to Stanford but you sent the Dean a death-threat-hate-mail, the odds you're going to get in are about the same as Saddam returning to power.  You may have never set foot on the campus of Stanford, but your bridge has been burned.  I've realized that you need to be careful but fortunately, judgement allows me to burn or just blow up the bridges that I feel I'll never have to cross again, those are the best ones.  There's nothing like letting someone have it that has ticked you off one too many times and you know you can get away with telling them off or doing something even worse because it won't affect you.

      Do you ever deal with people that don't know how to just say what's on their mind?  One of the things that bugs me is when someone won't just tell me to my face or on the phone or however I happen to be communicating with that person what's going on.  If you hate me, tell me you hate me.  If you love me then just tell me.  Don't tell someone else to tell me or dance around the subject, or put it in a different context and make me interpret what it really means.  Just spit it out.

      Catch the game last weekend?  I say "the game" because when the Lakers play there might as well be only one game going on.  Yes, that's right I'm a Lakers fan, no I didn't jump on the bandwagon, I've been a fan since the days of Magic, Kareem, Worthy, Scott, Cooper, and even Kurt Rambis, plus I grew up in the L.A. area.  Everyone is writing about the Lakers this year, win or lose the story is always the Lakers.  Living in Utah I get plenty of Laker coverage because the 18-year Jazz man, Karl Malone, is now wearing the purple and yellow.  I've always given in to peer pressure so why not give in again and add my two cents about the Lakers.  First of all I have to say that more and more people are calling the Lakers Kobe's team.  WRONG!!  There is one man that makes the Lakers who they are, it's Shaq.  Although I enjoyed the series winning game against San Antonio there were several times when Kobe tried to do it all himself and just got shut down.  Sometimes he looked like an aging white guy trying to reclaim the glory days from high school.  It is a team sport, don't forget that.  When the Lakers (Kobe) stuck to the offense they scored.  Defensively I guess Kobe is pretty good, but he hasn't had to guard anyone spectacular so far, while Shaq had to guard Duncan.  Of course Duncan did hit the luckiest shot I have ever watched live with my own eyes, but once again that was luck.  Shaq shut down the big man and proved why he is still the most dominant player ever.  Some may say that Shaq can't hit free throws and that is true most of the time, but when it counts Shaq hits them.  Sown the stretch of the San Antonio game when they tried to use the "Hack-A-Shaq" it failed because Shaq hit his free throws and put the game away.  Anyway, that's my opinion, not that anyone cares, but I know sports.  There aren't too many things that can get me jumping off the couch and screaming incoherently like a last second basket or an overtime touchdown.

      So I'm half-way through the Da Vinci Code and I've been very interested in the book so far.  One of the things that I think I've enjoyed so much is that a lot of the book seems to be (or at least puts on the front) educational.  I was attracted to the book because it seemed similar to books written by Crichton where he does a lot of actual research and then supports his theories through his fiction.  The religious implications of the book became obvious fairly early.  As I continued to read the facts presented they seemed very convincing and for all I knew they seemed to be correct.  Then they mentioned the "Dead Sea Scrolls."  Now I have to say that I can read things that are completely incorrect and still enjoy them as long as they're entertaining, but here's where the factual evidence being presented lost most of it's value.  I've studied the Dead Sea Scrolls, the book tried to make assertions that are just not consistent with the Dead Sea Scrolls.  I'm still going to finish reading the book but as far as becoming a heretic, not going to happen any time soon.

      We use the term "headache" pretty loosely these days, it can mean just about anything that's causing you a problem.  Last night I had a literal headache like I've never had before.  From what I've heard from other people I'm guessing it was a migraine.  It started when I was taking a bath after getting home from my softball game (we lost so I decided to take a soak and relax the muscles a bit).  I was sitting there reading the DaVinci Code when it became hard to read, it was like there were lights that were blocking my reading and it was really hard to focus.  I get sick maybe once or twice a year so when I do get sick it’s a little traumatic for me because I’m not used to it.  Last night I had that headache that was unbelievable until 4 in the morning.  I couldn’t sleep, I couldn’t do anything except roll around in pain.  I have way more compassion for anyone else who has experienced a migraine, it’s not fun.  But life goes on and here I am at work, oh well.

      So there are two professional teams playing in LA right now, oh wait, is this soccer season too, are the Galaxy playing as well, does anyone even care?  Well, the Dodgers are playing and the Lakers are wrapping things up.  Recently the Dodgers went on an 8 game losing streak, that hurts, especially when before the little losing streak they had the best record in baseball.  Either way, win or lose I'd rather go see the Dodgers than the Lakers.  Yes the Lakers have Kobe, Shaq, et. all, but there's nothing magical about the team that they have, they're all hall of famers but when does ego ruin talent?  The Dodgers don't have any "big names" right now, except maybe Shawn Green but he's not playing too well right now.  The Dodgers are playing and winning with team work.  I don't think there are very many sports "purists" left but I think I'm one of them.  I can go to a Dodger game and appreciate a game that ends with a score of 1-0.  I don't have to get drunk or "have a couple beers" to have fun at a game.  There aren't many people left that are like me, most people today want to see a "rally monkey" or some other attraction that has nothing to do with the game.  Maybe it isn't the same in Boston or New York but in LA where the fans show up in the 3rd inning and leave in the 7th there isn't as much fan support as the numbers would indicate.  Get rid of the fans that don't care about the sport and just go because someone gave them some tickets and they have nothing else to do.  I hate Boston and New York but I do have to admit that there are no better baseball fans in the world.  Take a lesson LA fans, all the real fans need to buy their tickets now and not leave room for the casual fan that's just looking for another place to have a drink.

      So remember Jurassic Park when Jeff Goldbloom says that when a butterfly flaps its wings on one part of the world it can affect things that happen thousands of miles away?  Sometimes I really think about how different my life could be just with one little change.  Imagine how your life would be if you decided not to talk to the person that’s now your best friend.  Imagine how things would be if you decided not to apply for that job that has changed your career.  How big a difference would it have made in your current life if you had never broken up with that past girlfriend/boyfriend?  I was just thinking about that recently, I was at a point where I had the choice between two jobs, my wife REALLY did not want me to take the one I ended up taking but I ended up meeting one of my good friends that ended up hooking me up with a job that I am in now.  It’s crazy to think how many little decisions we make that end up having major changes in our lives.
