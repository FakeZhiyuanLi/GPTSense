          So, we have a dog now.      The wife decided it would be good for Ben to have a doggy buddy to bond with.      I can already see the way this is going. &nbsp;I was the one up walking it this morning. &nbsp;I can see I'm going to have to get used to picking up dog poo too. &nbsp;I've not had to do it yet, but somehow, I know it's going to be my job.      I always see those people walking 'their' dog - little shovel in hand - and I always think &quot;Who exactly is the boss of who&quot;. &nbsp;Anyone who's picking up poo can't really be the master can they?      Anyway, that person's me now.

       Actually, I blogged once before, but it was drivel and I quickly gave up.  I didn't want to start again uptil I'd written my own blogging engine and hosted it on my own server (PLUG> http://sagar.org).  But then I realized it was way too nurdy and I don't have time for it.  Right, this is turning to drivel too.  I'll stop now until I've got time to write something meaningfull.    Just finally should say  WELCOME!

        urlLink Whale Watching with Fantomex   My comic-book hero friend  Fantomex  urlLink [1]  is currently whining because we went whale watching in Monterey and we saw no whales.  Actually, it's almost a year ago since we went, but that's by the by.  Obviously still holding a grudge that it cost him $40 and half a day :-)  He's put the following picture up on his "site".  Presumably he's having a dig at me because I'm always going on about how great California is and we have everything, whereas Leeds just has rain, homeless people and a tier 2 footy team.   urlLink Click for full size image     It amazes me that he totally failed to see the pre-historic monster off the port bow.  Should get his super-hero super-vision checked maybe :-P   [1] - Actually, he's no hero, he's just delusional.

       Saturday afternoon around 3pm.  This is the life!  Just lounging in the back yard with the dog and my fifth Budwizer of the day.  Had a yard full of people round this morning.  One of Ben's friends (and her family) is leaving the area to go back East :'-(  I suppose we should get used to people coming and going living around here.  I suppose Ben will, this is the second time in his little 4 year lifetime that a friend has moved away (we're talking 3 time-zones away, not moving down the street here!).  Being from a small town in Yorkshire you get used to living in the same house with the same neighbours for 20 years.  It's a bit sad for Debbie and I when people that we've just got used to 'suddenly' up and leave.  Anyway, we had a nice old party round at our place for them.  I've had a few beers - though the plan was to not pig out and drink too much.  Rest of the day probably will be a write-off.  The dog's been good.  Despite a garden full of pre-school kids and their parents and tasty food he was happy to be sat under our orange tree on his blanket with his toy.  He certainly seems to be resigned to constant harrassement from kids wanting to "stroke the big doggy".

Click on a link below to watch an episode.        urlLink BBC - Cult Television - Roobarb (and Custard)        Ahhh, I used to love this when I was a kid!  Apparently a new episode will be added each week.  And it's a full episode, not just a stinking 30 second clip.  Must force Ben to watch 'em all and become edumacated.

       I have to say, American real-estate has 'bodge-job' designed right in up front. You can't do anything in a structured and well engineered 'reversible' manner.  For example, houses in California.    Made out of wood, dawbed with 'stucco' to keep out the rain.  So when you want to run some wires (erm, cat 5) how do you do it?  You can't!  You can't chase a channel in to the plaster, you can't pass 'em along a cavity wall, you can't run them behind a skirting board.  You have to nail the wire to the outside of the house, drill a hole through to your room and wang the wire in.  Nailing to the outside ain't exactly childs play 'cos all the woods covered with stucco to stop the termites eating it.  Whatever you do, the result is an unsightly mess of wires running on the outside of your expensive 'shed'.  God, how I long for a nice bit of brickwork drill into.

       Had a great time last weekend camping up in the redwoods at  urlLink Butano State Park , up in the hills near Half Moon Bay and Pescadero.  Took Friday off from work, so I had three days of relaxation up there.  Debbie stayed home with the dog, so I was responsible for Ben!  First time we've been let out on our own for more than a couple of hours!  Had a great time cooking burgers and marshmallows on the log fire!  Didn't do much washing :)  Went on the beach some, climbed trees a little.  On our way home on Sunday we called in at  urlLink San Gregorio Store .      I always like to go there if I can find an excuse to be up on that part of the coast.  There's always a good live band playing on a weekend and the atmosphere always makes me feel like a cowboy.  Damn shame we had to return to "civilization".

       Yes, I know, I'm sure my title for this entry is a very tired joke around the  urlLink Apache Forrest  team!  I just discovered  Forrest  as a documentation tool.  I'm working with it for my latest (top secret) project at work.  It has to be said, I'm getting pretty excited about using it.  It's a tool that helps you build a website our of all the HTML snippets that you have laying around.  Forrest takes care of the 'style' issues, things like your menu bars, tab list, fast "breadcrumb" navigation buttons.  Meaning rather than having to refactor your entire website when your design department change the corporate style guide, you just change one template and re-build the site.  Kind of like what some people can do with  Dreamweaver  I believe, but       without the annoying WYSIWY!G editor.     IT'S APACHE - SO IT'S FREE     Anyway, enough of this post.  Check out  urlLink Forrest .

       A great day for lovers of contrived software hacks!  Take a look at  urlLink this page  (or  urlLink this ) that describes a newly found vulnerability in IE6.  Two new browser vulnerabilities have been identified in the process.  As someone who writes software for a 'living' I know first hand that it's not always possible to identify every sloppy construct in your code, nor predict how arbitrary combinations of flaws might work together to  completely blow open the security of your computer .  But it was f@*king obvious what was going to happen - even 8 years ago - when Microsoft started down this road of browser/OS integration and total omission of a security model.  Yeah, it's a neat trick that you can integrate and automate your contact database, spreadsheet, and email client using teen-friendly BASIC scripts - but what price convenience?  Our security got sold out just so Bill could show off some 'neat tricks' with his Mozilla-killa.  How convenient is it now to install a 10Meg security patch every month?  Anyway, go download the latest copy of  urlLink Mozilla  until this current storm blows over.  By which time you might just be so hooked on the  Tabbed Browser Window  that you'll never go back :-)  Personally telnet to port 80 is my favorite way to get online.

       People talk about how terrorists use the 'net and newsgroups to co-ordinate terror attacks and other nafarious stuff.  I always thought they'd be using their own sites.  I thought "That'd be easy(ish) to monitor and shut down the servers".  But after some random searching last week I stumbled on an idea.  If you do a search (on google) for sohardtopicksn@aol.com you get dozens of message-board/feedback-form hits.  The 'email address' appears on hundreds of unrelated sites.  The content of the posting is apparently garbage.   Redundancy   One of the principle design goals of the Internet was  Be resiliant to an attack or outage to a single node .  Meaning someone can take-out one router or cable and the US gov doesn't loose it's comms network - all installations/nodes are still accessible.  Traffic that would ideally go over the link just taken out uses an alternative path.    This is redundancy.  Hmmm, those sohardtopicksn@aol.com messages have a similar level of redundancy.  You have clean-up dozens of notice boards if you want to prevent the 'message' getting through.   Crypography   When you don't want someone to read your messages  cryptography  is a way to 'scramble' the message in a way that makes it (approx) impossible to read.    The US gov doesn't want us to have access to strong cryptography - they want to be able to crack the 'scambling' on our messages.  They want the ability to read them when they think we're terrorists.    My buddies at the EFF ( urlLink http://www.eff.org ) don't like that idea - they think we all have the right to privacy and must be allowed to use strong crypto to protect our love letters.  Those seemingly garbled messages sent by sohardtopicksn@aol.com  might  actually be encrypteed texts.      Ergo    Pissed-off individual    + Message boards    + Redunndancy    + Cryptography       =  Co-ordinating a terror attack ?     Conclusions   Maybe the US government is right to restrict access to strong cryptography.  Perhaps they do need a backdoor to unlock and read our love letters.    Lame    Perhaps people who run newsgroups / discussion groups / blogs should remove all the garbage messages that are on the list.  Don't be so lazy and untidy with your lists.  Don't just assume it's a message that got "mangled" in transit.     Better    FYI: messages can't get mangled in transit with  IP+TCP+HTTP transport.

       It's been a stressful weekend at sagarville.  Made worse because it was a 3 day weekend.    The new dog (lucky) has driven us crazy.  Yes the honeymoon period was short lived!  The wife almost had me take him back to the pound on Sunday night.  I'm not a dog person, so I don't know what's good and what's not.  But his current list of shortcomings are:  	-	Taking food off the table 	-	Pulling hard at the lead on walks 	-	Barking at (and trying to chase) squirrels, birds and cats 	-	Barking at anything that passes us while we're in the car  The latter woke Ben up from a sleep which was something that really pissed me off.  I was ready to throw him out of the car as we drove along the freeway.  And I can open that trunk from the driver's seat, so he needs to watch out! :-)  So Lucky is now on probation.  We plan to get some training - doggy and parents - to see if we can get these problems fixed.  I think he's on a timeline though!  He needs to get fixed before too long!

       I must say the early morning trips to the gym are working out pretty well!  Anyone who knows me can confirm that i'm really not a morning person, so it was with great reluctancy that I conceded morning would be the best time to get my work out.  Anyway, I'm now about three weeks into it and I'm feeling like a new man.  There's a slight problem with getting to work at the momebt, i.e., going to the gym makes me super late into the office and I then have to work till 8pm.

       With the completion of the Sagarville drive-way (and very nice it looks too) we are moving onto the next little yard project - the deck or patio.     There was a patio at the back of the house, but the concrete was all lifted due to the big mulberry tree in the middle of it. So Andy (the builder who did the drive) took the concrete away - at our request.     We now have a big plot of dirt at the back of the house which we want to convert into a deck. However we have a couple of dilemma and Mrs Sagar and I can't agree how to 'design' it.     Mrs Sagar wants to just plonk a 20'x20' redwood deck there, with the mulberry sticking out of the middle. I on the other hand see that building around the tree is going to cause bags of problems with setting the level of the deck, clearing roots, digging out hundreds of cubic feet of dirt. And it's going to look aesthetically retarded.     unfortunately I don't have a good suggestion for what it does need to look like.     Time is running out, however, as Mrs Sagar is complaining that lucky-dog keeps digging in the patch of dirt and coming into the house with dirty paws.

       Break out the champagne !  My  urlLink bot'speriment  was successful!  My  scumbot-channel  has staggered from the primordial goop to prove that malware across the planet can reliably (if slowly) "phone home".    I managed to find the   diveboy@hotmail.com   signature.  Alas, I had to modify the search a little!  I had to prefix with a  %20%3f , which was text I prefixed the email address with, for no reason other than giving it a certain random error look! I guess it's something to do with the way google tokenizes the keywords in their database.    Anyway, with a google search I found two guest books that were hosting my 'scumbot semaphore':          Chinmoy's Portal     and         Air of Authority - A History of the RAF Organization       Sure enough, I hit the link from google and I could search the retrieved guestbook page for my message. Ah, the joys of genious ... now all I need to do is take over the world.    So I think it took about a week for the guest-book entries to get into Googles database. Which isn't too bad. If you were planning to launch a DDoS you could reasonably expect to plan your attack a week ahead of any major world event.     Next Step   Obviously, the next step would be to automate a the whole thing:       Search Web Using Google to find "Sign Guest Book"     Randomly retrieve the HTML for 10-20 of the hits          Parse the HTML of the page into some kind of DOM      Traverse the page's DOM to find the                     Create a HTTP response with the  textarea  full of scum-bot semaphore          To be honest posting the semaphore doesn't really need to be automated, as it's done as a one-off by the scumbot master. Could be done manually. On the other hand, the zombie/virus/worm/malware needs to be automated to do the following:          Search Google for  %20%3fdiveboy@hotmail.com  once per day         Retrieve all/any matching pages         Parse the HTML into some kind of DOM         Traverse the elements looking for the semaphore pre-amble ( %20%3f& )             Extract the scumbot-semaphore             Decrypt/unpack the message              Anyway, someone else can do the donkey work. As we system architects say,  the rest is just software...               Oh, I suppose I should call it something other than a scumbot channel, as  Scummy  has already developed his own little bot that he calls a  urlLink scumbot . But in his case, it's not half as nafarious as mine, it's just a useful little IRC bot.            c@malware

       Lucky has his first trip to a dog park at the weekend.  The Sagars went on mass, along with  Ben's friend, his family and their dog.    Things went well, Lucky didn't run away too much or attack anyone ... ah, well. He did get overly curious with one little rat like chuwowa dog. He almost crushed it with one of his mighty paws. He only went over (er, bounded over) for a sniff, but the little boy holding rat-dog got scared and let go of the leash ... I think rat-dog got scared too cos it tried to run away. Now, anyone'll tell you, if you run away from a boystrous lab that's like an open invite for it to come and play 'tag'.  Unfortunately rat-dogs break easy. There was some yelping and some upset children. Rat-dog and his family decided to leave the park in a huff. Sorry rat-dog! If it's any consollation Lucky felt really bad about spoiling your morning. He came and laid down on the grass for two minutes looking guilty.

       I was watching  urlLink  The Screen Savers   yesterday and they were inteviewing a guy called  urlLink David Rumsey  .  He has a really cool website full of old maps.  Hey, now you know I really am a geek!    Anyway, he's got a new book out:  urlLink Cartographica Extraordinaire   Here's what they say on Amazon about it;      Cartographica Extraordinaire alluringly presents the highlights of a remarkable collection of historical maps. What makes this book stand out from other published map archives, though, is its reflection of the generosity, energy, and intellectual curiosity of David Rumsey.   Not just yankie maps, found some really good old French ones.  Incredible resolution!      This image of  Cap d'Agde  one ...      Is a zoom in of this picture of South West France ...          Incroyable n'est pas?

        Scum Bots   So, I'm trying to refine my theory about what I will call 'scumbot-channel'.  I did a search on Google for "Sign Guest Book".  I then picked, at random, some hits and traversed to their site.    If the landing page had a form on, I filled it with 'pseudo-garbage'.  The garbage basically consists of three fields, depending on the type of field;     Field name contains 'name' or 'email'   form element name  plus   %20%3fdiveboy@hotmail.com        Field is a 'textarea'   form element name  plus   %20%3f&09f3228caf090ef4b98c1d44e03c6c03 *-        Otherwise   form element name  plus   %20%3f  random digits       The  textarea  one is the important one.  The text after the '&' is supposed to be a secret message from the 'scumbot master' to a scumbot running on a zombied machine somewhere out on the internet.   What next?  The idea is that I will, in a week or so, do a search of Google for  urlLink diveboy@hotmail.com .  If I find it then I can extract, from the search result, the  textarea  field - identified by the magic prefix string  %20%3f&... .  The text after the '&' I consider my 'secret message'.  [infact it's just a md5sum of  This is random selection 1 ].   Why?  I consider the messages posted (fairly annonymously) in the third party guest books to be control messages from 'scumbot master' to scumbots.  Scumbots can run scripts that use a  urlLink XML interface to Google  to obtain search results.  The scumbots will get their instructions from the guestbook posts.  A short message, possibly telling them to connect to a specific IP address at a specific time to receive their real payload.    Let's call it the 'scumbot semaphore'.  The scumbot master will post the message to hundreds of guestbooks - I got 3million hits for "sign guest book" when I just did the google search.  It should be easy to get the 'scumbot semaphore' to stick on a least a few of them.  And because we know those guest books are also going to be indexed by Google (after all, the guest book was found through Google) then we can be fairly confident that a later search will be successful in locating the available 'scumbot semaphores'.   Why am I telling you this, doesn't it spoil the suprise?  So in the interest of full disclosure I'm publishing my intent here.    Stating that it's  research  in the name of  internet security  gives me a fighting chance in court of not being sent to Guantanamo bay ;-)  I'd like to write a real paper on this when it's proved try, then talk at some swanky conference where people will chear me and throw pettles...

       Couple of years back my retarded multinational employer set-up an information sharing service so that all employees world wide can disseminate information.    Kind of a cool idea, people are 'network' and 'empowered' (blah).  If someone has something they want to share they can send out messages to other employees who list similar interests in their profile.  Maybe other employees would like to 'pick-it-up-and-run-with-it'.  At the moment the retarded multinational I work for is busy, like all retarded multinationals, re-locating all its 'development resources' to Bangalore.  Someone told them that an engineer in Bangalore is just as good as an engineer in Silicon Valley, but 1/4 the price.  Someone said that ... I think it was an India guy, anyway!  Remember that kewl information dissemination board I mentioned?  Below is an example of the types of message that come-up on the list on a pretty regular basis these days;   I have been assigned the task of developing a  doo-hicky  for Set-top Box. Does anybody has a prior experience in developing a  doo-hicky  for Consumer Electronics goods?   Regards, Sanjay - Bangalore   Hmmm, let me think, ..., just a minute now ... I'm sure I've got that information.  Oh wait a minute it's right here  in my fucking head .    Needless Sanjay isn't his real name and he isn't really making a  doo-hicky .  There were a couple of small typographical errors in the text, but I don't want to focus on those.  I am perplexed, my dear retarded multinational employer.  I mean, assuming it's a good idea to have all these people in Bangalore saving you money.  And assuming they're saving you lots of money.  Wouldn't it be a good idea to  train them  to do the job you pay them to do (pay them $4/hour).  ...  I'm having a little trouble formulating exactly what I want to say here.  Needless to say, the poor Bangalore employees (and they are poor) never seem to get their questions answered on the list.  Not suprising.  Presumably the person who used to do  Doo-hicky  design got laid-off about a week before Sanjay got his company push-bike.  I'm thinking there's some misconception by 'senior management' that just because two guys both have an engineering degree it makes them the same person.  Funny a BMW and a Lada are both cars, yet no CEO ever drives a Lada.  Both cars right, should be interchangable.  Do you know you can get 4 Lada's for the price of a BMW.  Ah, I'm rambling.  It just takes a couple of retarded multinationals to say they're onto a good thing then every other retarded multinational jumps at the same idea.  Regardless of whether the business situation for their company is identical to the other.  To be honest, it made no sense for my retarded multinational to move into silicon valley in the mid-90's.   I'm glad they did, cos I got a cushy deal out of it.  I know they did that just because everyone else was doing it and someone (an American I think) told them that Silicon Valley has creative people.  Incidentally, my retarded multinational opened up it's office in silicon valley and staffed it with Expats.  Yeah, I know, what was the point of that.  Good holiday though for us expats.  So, back to Sanjay.  I'm assuming that, in about 3 years, poor Sanjay will be writing a bitter blog entry like this.  Complaining about some young guy called, ahem ... Sum Yeung Gai ... sorry couldn't resist :D who's now doing the job he used to do.  But for $1/hour.  I don't see many expats scrambling to get postings to our Bangalore office.  p.s., I'm bitter, but no, that doesn't mean I got laid off incase you were wondering.  But if my retarded multinational employer reads this things might change...

       Got builders in this week.  Need a new driveway.  I recon I'm in the wrong business. The builder's charging $14000 to concrete us a new drive. It'd take me weeks to earn that kind of dosh and I bet he'll be done by Thursday.  And he gets to drive 'round outside in a Bobcat all day catching some rays.  Ben's impressed by all the trucks. However he started to blub when the back patio got ripped out.  He liked to drive his Jeep on there. It's going to be a swanky woodern deck soon.

Oh, I later found out, the battery was nearly flat on my minidisc player, so it was crapping out during the transfer.

       Well, you need to turn off your firewall and virus scanner, but other than that  just do nothing !   "LONDON (Reuters) - Vast networks of home computers are being rented out without their owners' knowledge to spammers, fraudsters and digital saboteurs, security experts said on Wednesday.   urlLink Yahoo! News - Home PCs Rented Out in Sabotage-For-Hire Racket   The terminals have been infected by a computer virus, turning them into 'zombies' -- slaves to the commands of a malicious and unseen controller."   Hmmm, some kind of firewall product might be the answer.    Maybe - as part of the big chunk of change you pay to your ISP every month - they could provide some level of port scanning to their customers to see how wide open they are.  They could probe for known bots and look for traffic signatures.  Presumbly these bots all use some kind of p2p protocol to communicate back to their mother-bot.  Admittedly there'd be issues with SBC doing port scans every day on my machine.  I mean, they might notice there's a webserver running on port xxxx of my machine, but that's not a 'bot, it's my server.  I don't want constant emails warning me about my own webserver.    But most mugs don't  intentionally  run servers from home, or if they do, they should know which port it's on and could do a selective disable of the ISP scan on that port.  In the meantime,  urlLink Shields-Up  is a good free service that can be used to do a quick port scan of your machine - based on the IP address that it sees when you connect to their site.   urlLink RUN IT NOW !

       We got an 'early' start and drove into Monterey.  We knew it'd be busy for the July 4 celebrations.  First stop was the bike shop, to buy a new tire.  Got a 'Thorn resistant' to see if that's what I need to hold the extra pressure due to Ben's trailer-bike.  Went to  urlLink the aquarium  for a few hours.  They have a new shark exhibit that we wanted to see.  Turned out to be not as good as we expected - not enough sharks!  It was more historic display of people's interaction and misconceptions of sharks; from ancient hawiian shark-god worship to Jaws.  And not forgetting shark-fin soup - what a stupid idea that is.   Did some beach time after the aquarium.  Then went to  urlLink The London Bridge, English pub .  Three pints of Smithwick's.  We had a great spot for the 4th of July fireworks, the fireworks were on a barge in the bay.  Admittedly, there's something ironic about watching the Independance Day fireworks from inside and English pub, but there you go.  I have to say the fireworks were a somewhat disappointing.  San Fran is much better.  Ben cried because the fireworks were too noisey.  But didn't want to miss any of it.  Got back to the camp-site around midnight.  Long day!

       Nice relaxing day on the campsite.  Ben and I got up and went for a little explore - Ben on scooter, me on foot.  Debbie relaxed by the campfire with her book...  Explored the big river running through the campsiite.  Some hick redneck was letting his son shoot an air rifle into the river to 'catch fish'.  Sure it's illegal.  Anyway, there were no fish in the river ... but now there's lead.    I later found out that the river is a breeding ground for an endangered steelhead trout.  So there you go, just adds a little extra red-ness to the rednecks neck.  I knew the guy was a retard when he used the phrase "... let's wait 'till after we  break camp .".  I'm sorry, when you're on a three-day camping weekend with your kids I don't think 'putting the tent back in your truck' counts as 'breaking camp'.  Maybe next-time your steering cows cross country with ol' Cherokee Bill and Tonto maybe "break camp" is an appropriate phrase to use.  Anyway, I digress...  Checked out what looked like an old homesteader's house.  Ben made me do three puppet shows on the 'stage' before we could proceed.  Basically consisted of me making a fool of myself doing 'Three Little Pigs' and other such stories at the side of a road as people walked passed and looked at me funny.  Went back to the campsite for 'full-English' breakfast.  Ben and I went down to the river for a swim.  We arrived at the same time as about 100 Mexicans, so I thought we were going to get over-run and have nowhere to swim about, but luckily they were just there to baptise some of their clan.  Most simply stood on the bank and clapped and sing as a few got dunked in the 60F river.    Water was exceptionally clear (dispite the recent addition of lead shot).  Splashing about was great fun, even though it was damn cold.  Ben wasn't having any of it.  He sat at the side and ordered me to get cold and wet.  Meanwhile, back at the camp, Debbie relaxed by the campfire with her book...  After drying off, we made pop-corn on the campstove and fotogrphed some of the local wildlife (stella-jay's and squirrels).  Ben and I went for a bikeride around the campground in the afternoon  ... while Debbie relaxed by the campfire with her book...  Went looking for crayfish.  Saw some crazyass asian-guy trying to fish for crabs in the river (I'm sure that must be illegal too).  Stopped for ice-cream on the ride back (Ben had a  Ben & Jerry's  "Cherry Garcia").  Got another damn puncture.  I'm beginning to think it's having the extra weight of the Traile-bike that keeps popping my back tire, that's two tires for three rides.  Fortunately we were nearly back to camp, so it wasn't a great hardship to wheel him (and the broken bike) back.  Finishing up the day with a bottle of red (wine) by the camp fire.  Nice Copolla Claret.  Very impressed with Francis'  reds.  The Cabs, the Zin and this have all been good.  Fast becoming my favourite vintner.  Must pay a visit to his 'shop' in Napa next time we're up there.

       The following input was received from a space geek in response to my  Cassini consternation .    Cassini didn't actually pass through the rings of Saturn during SOI. What it did was pass through the Ring Plane. That's pretty much unavoidable if you go past Saturn - even Voyager had to do it.  Now the wackos at JPL did expect there to be some material in the ring plane, but 'minefield' is a bit of a misnomer - the average particle size in the ring plane is the size of a grain of smoke. Cassini registered 100,000 hits in the five minutes it took to cross it.    100,000 hits and it took it on the chin - what a manly space-probe that was.
