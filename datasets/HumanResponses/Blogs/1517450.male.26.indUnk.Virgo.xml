      Hi there This is all new to me, so please bare with me if you are reading this.  Kevin kind of showed me the bare bones of what to do.  Hopefully I will have something interesting to say when I blog, but I most likely will ramble.  Well thanks for listening on my maiden voyage. Bye.

      Due to the overwhelming demand for me to blog, I have decided to grant everyone's wish and do so.  I have nothing in paticular to say though.  A discovery was made by myself and i beleive many other's this week.  The temporary closing of the glorious Barley N Hops Street Pub has left a gaping whole in my nightly entertainment plans.  Thursday was probably the worst of the days.  Not to say that I didn't have fun on Thursday, it is just that something seemed missing.  The lost feeling was only amplified by constant barrage of questions.  "What's going on with B N H?", "What the HELL are you doing here at (insert random bar name)?", "Why are you so sober?".  Well I want everyone to know I am surviving, and it will soon be over.  I have been informed that we are shooting for a Wednesday night re-opening.  So if you need to find Wednesday after work at Hollywood, I will probably be drinking a pitcher of beer at B N H until 2am.  Thanks for listening.

      Sorry it has been so long since my last post.  The incredibly demanding lifestyle I lead does require an investment of time.  But I thought that this  urlLink article  was funny.  Good job you crazy canadian Rolling Stone fans.  Also to comment on the second article on the page.  Ashton Krutcher is slowly gaining my respect and envy.  He got to handpick Daisy Duke and he picked  urlLink her .

      OK.  I am finally finished with the hangover from Monday.  It may not suprise many of you that I was a little intoxicated, but the level of intoxication was the key.  I fit so many activities into a Monday it had to be some kind of record.  First,  urlLink CM  and I went to the movie house to take in a little S.W.A.T.  I was like watch a really good blacksplotation, colin ferrell commercial.  Then I go watch Eric's (one of the bouncers at B N H) softball game, where I downed 5 cans of  urlLink MGDL  in less than an hour.  From there I go straight to Barley N Hops.  I see that the pitcher gap is starting to widen, so I convince the 4th place team that we need to join forces and we drink until bartime.  Somewhere in the night CM makes a hilarious comment about a girl of questionable character.  His mistake was saying it directly to her.  Everyone was seriously mad at CM, except myself because I was trying not to laugh.  At bartime my other roommate Mike suggest that we hold a little get together after close at our house.  Being of sound mind and body, I agree.  We send everyone over to our house and order pizza on the phone.  Little did we realize that the doors were locked and we were walking.  So I convince Nate (my boss at Barley, and all around good guy) to drive us home and come in for a few cocktails.  The girls find our limited selection of liquor and wine, and proceed to make the worst drink ever.  We named it Blue Death.  This drink single handedly ended our party.  Eventually it was just myself and one of my lady friends, and yes if you read CM's blog, my streak ended.  Yeah for me.  On Tuesday I awake to a splitting headache and a disaster of a house with a huge hangover and large grin on my face all day.  I will drinking heavily again tonight, lessons obviously not learned.

      Yes the time has come.  A new, and in my opinion more spectacular, name has been given to this blog.  Many of you may note that I do not have any formal "pimpin'" training.  This is just a formality.  The american public has let people all over this country do things they are not necessarily qualified to do.  Many fine examples can be given.  We let  urlLink Ben Affleck date J.Lo , we let  urlLink Al  drink in bars, we let this  urlLink man  be president, we let  urlLink Heather Mitts  stay under the shadow of  urlLink Anna Kournikova  as the sexiest female athlete. Not for long though, she is an up an comer.  Someone even let Kelly Osbourne sing (I will not link to Ms. Osbourne because I feel she doesn't have any talent even warrant any celebrity status).  My point is that the name of my blog is cool and maybe Jay-Z will notice it and possibly want to meet me.  Then I will probably meet  urlLink Beyonce .  One can only dream.  In closing I ask that those of us old enough to do so, go to Barley N Hops and drink like crazy for the pitcher team "But It's YOUR Dog".  We are currently in second place with a realistic chance of winning this year.  Lets make it happen people.

      I just wanted to comment on urlLink  Al's  recent attack on my character.  And yes I am "coordinating" this post with  urlLink Chris  .  I just wanted to comment on the last line of the post.  In it you say, and I quote "This work of satire was brought to you by the letter A, the number 17, and Viewers Like You."  Let's break this down.  I think it is a little  urlLink narcissistic  (here is one of those big words Al has trouble with, click the link if you need a definition) of Al to have his post be brought to us by the letter A.  I mean if you type A, you have already spelled half his name.  I don't think we really have to delve into why the number 17 was chosen.  Let's just say that Al prefers numbers  urlLink less than 18 , wink, wink.  Finally we come to Viewers Like You.  The sad fact is people are only technically viewing the site.  It really should have said Readers Like You.  Well that's all I have to say.  Thanks for reading and I hope that we have all become better people for this.

      I know it has been awhile since I blogged.  Sorry.  The birthdays of this month have left me a little tired.  First of course was mine.  It went well, or so I was told.  The birthday of  urlLink Chris  was also enjoyable.  Mike (our roommate) and myself purchased Chris a cake from Wal-Mart that had a picture of him during an intense hangover on it.  Pretty amusing.   urlLink K-Dogg's  birthday was fun as well, even though I had to work.  Thanks to everyone that came to his party, it was fun for me as well as all of you who were drunk.  In closing I think anyone reading this should visit this  urlLink site , watch the preview, then take the recommend amount of time to recover.  Bye

      Saw Kill Bill Vol.1  and I would have to say that I am forever desensitized to violence, and that happened in the first five minutes of the movie.  This movie is very good, but it is so violent and crazy it slowly becomes a comedy.  A must see all the way.  That's all for now, I have a recently bought parrot that I must return because it was sold to me deceased.

      OK I also saw Matrix 3 and liked it well enough.  I felt it was a good movie, but it did lack some loose end tying.  Are they leaving it open for new sequels.  It would be interesting to see another "The One" battling a new Agent Smith.  However, I do have a problem with people saying that this set of movies is our generations Star Wars.  This statement is totally innaccurate.  Star Wars started the whole movie inspired tye-ins trend.  One of the best selling toylines ever came from that trilogy and made George Lucas the ceo of several different companies.  Star Wars changed the way movies would be made from that day forward.  The Matrix trilogy is good, but the sequels never really improved or surpassed the original.  For a trilogy to be great, the story and visuals all have to be better.  Examples of this include "The Empire Strikes Back", "The Godfather, Part II", and "T2."  All much better movies than the originals that allowed them to exist.  The Matrix is more like the little brother of Star Wars, a trilogy of movies living in his older brothers shadow.  I am done ranting now.

      I just discovered something about my 4 and half year stint at Hollywood Video.  I watched a lot of movies, most of them crappy, simply because they were free.  As I walked the store today, nothing seemed appealing to me.  I just hope the same thing happens when I am done getting drinks and sex for free at my job now.  OK so I am just getting the drinks for free.  I still have to work pretty hard for the sex.

      Wow, what a weekend I have had.  On Friday my family's dog Quinn died.  He had to be put down because of health problems.  On Friday night I got put down because of stupid drunk guy problems.  It all started when I went into Molly's Friday night.  There I saw three girls that I haven't seen in a few years, and went over to talk to them.  We all decided after a few drinks that it would be a good idea to dance.  So we are on the dance floor, and these hoodlums take exception to my ability to dance with three hot girls to there zero hot girls.  They decided to push me in the back about three times.  Those of you that know me, that was about two pushes more than I usually put up with.  I lost it on the fourth push, not so much because of the push, but because of the fact I spilled my drink.  I started to yell and actually went after one of the guys.  The bouncer decided that it would be easier to kick out the short loud white guy (that's me) than the ethnically diverse band that provoked me.  So about 20 seconds after I leave Molly's, by myself I might add, the three hooligans are escorted from the building.  At this time they spot me, and heroically attack me from behind.  Now my nose is twice the size it should be.  The moral of the story, don't go to Molly's, but if you have to, make sure you are with someone who is able stop you from getting jumped by three guys.   Man did that suck.  Oh yeah, who would have thought that the most important play or the Packers 2003 season would come in Arizona, and Green Bay wouldn't be playing there.  Thanks McCown and Poole, the 2003 Packers co-mvps.

Are we all trying to entertain each other, I think so.    So far this year is the best year for a new years resolution ever for me.  My resolution this year was to drink more.   I have been out every night since the 3rd.  This includes work, since I do quite a bit of drinking at work.  That is all.  By the way, Chris the CM stands for centimeter.  HEHEHEH.

But if you like looking at girls from closer to home, watch the new  urlLink Girls Gone Wild  video and you should see a bunch of girls from Oshkosh.

      This is an actual email intercepted by myself.  Read and enjoy        From: "Al Coenen"       Sent: Thursday, January 29, 2004 3:03pm       To: "Chris Mann"       Subject: Confused about us?  Dearest Chris By now you have read Ryan's very nice and innocent farewell to you on his blog.  I can't help feel a little jealous though.  I know that you said that you needed some space and you wanted to sort things out.  And I know that Ryan Hayes is the probably the closest thing that God has created to the perfect heterosexual male, but still I am seeing red.  Remember the good times.  Like our weekend getaway to Rhinelander.  That was amazing, all the roses and wine.  My knees are still week.  Or even as recently as last weekend when we went home together.  I guess I am trying to say that even though our "relationship" may be sinful in some eyes, I feel it is beautiful and I don't want to lose you.  Gotta go, my roommate is calling me for some sweet gay porn start hot young Japanese baseball players. Forever yours,  Big Gay Al Coenen  In know people, I was as shocked as much as you were, but it does explain a few things.  Keep reaching for that rainbow Al.

      A tribute to the Mann.  When you agreed to live with me I knew it was with some hesitation, but I knew that you could live through it.  You had some reservations about the other person that you would be living with.  In the months to come I think you came to accept and deal with the faults of both your roommates.  I just wanted to take the time in cyberspace to thank you for the time that you have taken to enriched my life with by living with me.  I know that I am not the easiest person to live with, but who is.  I learned that by you living with me that we are truly good friends.  I know this because we were able to live together and remain friends in the end.  I believe that we are better friends because of it.   Good Luck to you on your future challenges and always remember that I am here for anything if you ask.  My good friend Chris Mann, University of Oshkosh-Wisconsin graduate and one hell of a MAN.

      I got one that Bill Stevens will love.  I get a craving for late night pizza.  Who do I call, Topper's of course.  The girl on the end of the line picks up and asks to put me on hold.  "sure" I say.  About 15 minutes later she picks up.   "what can i get you?"  I tell I want the late night special. She then remembers that she first needs to ask me all my info.  So I give it to her, you know, phone, address, first born's name, etc.  Then she asks me, "what can i get you".  She apparently could not remember things longer than 40 seconds.  I tell her again.  Then she asks me what i want on my pizza.  I say "what kind do you have?"  She says "Toppings?"  No idiot, what kind of car do you drive, of course toppings!?!  That last part I said to myself in my head.  What have I learned from this.  It is easier to order a pizza totally drunk a 2:54 am on a Friday night than it is at 2:10 am on a Sunday night stone sober.

      So, nothing new really happening in my life.  I do have to say even though it was hard to dismiss the obvious, I still held out hope that  urlLink baseball wouldn't be tarnished by cheating .  The last 7 years of baseball regrowth has been ruined by a few cheaters.  Many people in the media say that the  urlLink fans do not care  about steriod use in professional sports.  Being a fan, I say that they are wrong.  It reminds me a little bit of breast implants.  When you see them for the first time, you know that something just ain't quite right.  If you are lucky enough to play with them you feel incredibly excited for the opportunity to view greatness.  And when you find out for sure that it isn't real, you feel a little smaller for having ignored it when it was so obvious to everyone around you.  I imagine that to be the case when dating a  urlLink girl with fake boobs  as well.  Speaking of steroids,  urlLink Wrestlemania XX  is happening in less than 2 weeks.  I currently do not have a venue to enjoy the extravaganza.  Anyone willing to host this event on their TV would be my personal hero for at least 5 hours. (hint KP or AC)

      I don't really have much to say right now, just thought I would update the old blog.  Vegas was once again a very good time.  Highlight of the week was slipping $40 to the bouncer of the Ghostbar to get six guys in.  I was amazed as I was doing it.  The personal highlight of the trip was a bartender at Coyote Ugly hitting on me, and yes she was a woman.  I was a good boy and did not go home with her.  I am not sure if I even had that choice, but I didn't.  I think that Nate had a good time, but I think that the sin that permeates the air overwhelmed him at times.  He seemed much more comfortable in Oshvegas on Friday.  And yes, my brother was the big winner.  He spent most of our last day in the company of some young ladies from Gurnee Illinois.  We all saw O.J. Simpson, out by the Palms pool.  I assume he was looking into a lead on the "real" killers.  One of the Maloofs (owners of the Palms, and Sacramento Kings) was in the ghostbar when we were there.  The cool thing was that he was not in the VIP, but out with people like us.  I think that we should start planning a super trip, we can all kind of book our own trips and meet out there.  It worked out pretty good with Som and his crew this time.  That is all I really have for now.  I am trying not to drink this week until at least Thursday.  So Friday I will be ready to go, who's with me?

      Tarantino just doesn't stop.   He is now planning a  urlLink third Kill Bill .  Could be good, could be horrible.  I have seen "Walking Tall", the Rock is going to be a leading man in a good movie sooner or later, just not right now.  The story was kind of weak, but the Rock has grown as an actor already.  I don't think he will be wrestling anymore for the foreseeable future. Well in closing, is there a time when Britney doesn't look hot.  I think not.

      So I had one of those turning point experiences tonight.  I ventured out to Evil Roy Slade's tonight with my friends Nate and Brent.  A little background is probably required to make this story understandable.  Nate is my boss at Barley & Hops, and he is 32 yrs old.  Brent has been a friend of mine for about five years now and is 26 yrs old and about 5 months younger than me.  We all go into ERS and the bartender wants our ID's.  She then says to me "your fine".  At this point I don't know what to think.  Nate says to her that he does not have his ID but that he is 32 and he knows the owner.  The bartender says "I guess that is ok, but next time bring an ID".  I do not know if this bartender knew me or not.  But going on the assumption that she does, then it is ok for her not to card me.  On the assumption that she does not know me, well then she must think that I am really old.  Either way I get to laugh at my boss, and I like that.  Seacrest Out.

      I think that starting to work-out is possibly the stupidest idea I have ever agreed to in a sober state.  Not much to say today.  If you are looking for laughs, check out  urlLink Dane Cook , very funny stuff.

      This is proof that just because one knows how to access a computer, it does not make them a smart person.   urlLink Idiots. In closing, was Greg driving this? urlLink disaster.bmp

      Just wanted to remind those of age and interested, I will be throwing our 2nd annual Wisconsin Daze party on Friday.  Festivities begin at around 12:30 pm.  Was a great time last year and expect more of the same this year.  Alright, back to my homework.

      As you can see I am updating my blog.  I am trying to learn how to do this sort of thing on my own so I can start working on the Barley and Hops website for Nate.  My next task to reapply the links to everyones blogs.  Bare with me.  Getting prepared for a monster weekend.  Beer gardens is Friday and should be fun.  My plan is to go out after class, have a few drinks, come home and eat, and then go into work and turn that mutha out.  I don't see any holes in that plan.  That is all I gots. Later.

      Thanks to all for a successful Wisconsin Daze.  I say successful because only one person got in trouble with the police, my brother lost his phone, I went home with someone and am feeling incredibly guilty about it, Nate drank in a tree, and Kevin did not get divorced.  Good job everyone.

      Sometimes a person can get a little depressed with their lives.  I was feeling a little down on Monday before going out.  A few drinks later and I am having a fairly good time, then a girl steals my camera phone and takes this picture.  If I wasn't me, I would be jealous.

      So I haven't posted in a while and decided that today would be as good as any.  Not much new to report.  Most of my days are spent either watching TV or finding some lame excuse to ride my bike.  Most of my nights are spent keeping the beer companies in business and trying out new techniques from the hallowed pages of maxim.  I was thinking that someone should organize a trip to Appleton to see the opening of Spiderman 2.  I want to be part of history again, and it was fun last time.  In closing, I would like to take this time to officially put my hat in the ring.  That's right people, I would like to offer my expertise on knee injuries to Miss Spears, I am sure that nothing but good could come from this.  Later.

      So I saw Farenheit 9/11 and I feel that it presents some interesting points.  If nothing else, this movie should get more young people to vote.  That is all I am saying on that subject.  I saw this  urlLink article  today and was a little upset, but then I saw this  urlLink article  and was ok.  I love this country.

      Been awhile since I posted, so here I go.  Went to see KISS on Wednesday with Kevin.  It was a good time, but I only know their last 5 songs, so I probably did not enjoy it as much as others.  Poison opened for them and I enjoyed that a lot more than I thought I would, maybe I was drunk though.  Got to see the Mann at the  urlLink Safe House .  It was fun as well.  I am incredibly hung over today.  I worked with Jeremy last night and that requires heavy drinking to get through the night.  As of right now I am watching women's beach  urlLink volleyball  on TV.  It seems to be a good hangover cure.  Good looking, athletic women in bikinis sweating.  You don't see that in Wisconsin very often.

      I am having a stressful week so far.  Nate at B&H went on vacation and pretty much left me in charge.  In typical Nate fashion, he does not tell me this until Sunday.  But I am having fun with it.  Think that this is pretty  urlLink funny  and my  urlLink spider  sense says this is super cool.  That's all for now.

      So I am going over my personal entertainment budget for the next month and I am a little surprised.&nbsp; It is going to cost me a lot of money to go an see OTHER PEOPLE get married.&nbsp; Now I am all for these glorious union of souls, but should it get in the way of my good time.&nbsp;  One wedding I am just going to and I am not even bringing a date and I figure to spend at least $200 on it.&nbsp; I come to this conclusion because I have to pony up for a hotel room and I lose a Saturday night of working, easily my most lucrative.&nbsp; The other wedding I am standing up in.&nbsp; This will cost me the price of a tux, gift, hotel room, hooker for the night.&nbsp; This wedding I figure around $250.&nbsp; And I have not even thought about bachelor parties.&nbsp; D'oh.&nbsp; The sad thing is that I am probably getting off pretty easy this year.&nbsp; Next year my sister is getting married and I have to travel to the homeland for that. My friend and boss Nate is also getting hitched and I am just scared of the bachelor party.&nbsp; That being said, this weekend is the 2nd Annual Barley &amp; Hops X-mas party.&nbsp; This will probably be the last weekend this summer that I really cut loose.&nbsp; Those of you invited to this soiree, you are officially warned.&nbsp; That is all.

      So I am not sure what happened in my last post, but I do know that I was to lazy to go back and fix it.&nbsp; Sunday was the B&H Xmas party.&nbsp; I will try to sum up what happened that day.&nbsp; On the Wolf River were these quotes:&nbsp; "drink", "it's like prison, once you relax it hurts less", "She has got some boobs on her", "DRINK".&nbsp; At the campsite was pretty much more of the same, it included such memorable lines as: "drink your damn shot", "Did we just make out?!", and everyone's favorite, "Are you trying to sleep, get up and drink".&nbsp; I am just glad that we all had fun.&nbsp; On a side note, I "lost" my cellphone in my tent, so I don't have a lot of phone numbers that I used to have, so if you call me and I don't know who it is right away that is why.&nbsp; That is all I have. Later.
