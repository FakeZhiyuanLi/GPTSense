        Hey Ryck as l write this me and Tom are on our way to Sheringham on the No. 44 bus to book a youth hostel in Paris for our trip there in 2 weeks time. It’s along story but basically the dumb idiots at the international youth hostel booking centre cannot run a web site or use or computer. (we have tried three different types of debit card [all of which they claim work on their site] and tried over the phone for ten minutes with some woman who couldn't use a computer. so eventually we found out we could pay in cash at our nearest youth hostel. Which according to our members guide was Norwich, though this turned out to have closed in 2003. So it turns out our nearest youth hostel is Sheringham and we are desperately hoping our bus passes will also work on the way back. I am gonna have to stop writing for now as the road is getting way to bumpy, I will finish later.   Well after all that it turns out the Youth hostel in Sheringham is not connected to the international booking network or something and our nearest Youth Hostel that can book for us is Cambridge, so I have used mums card to book eventually. But at least we didn’t have to pay for any of the bus journeys and managed to get on with our passes. Also before we got into Norwich we caught the paston bus by accident and so we had to get off at Baningham and walk back to the main road where mum picked us up. 
  Re yor email: Thanks for the email, its nice to hear from you and to know your still reading this. Bah whats a bit of hypothermia going to do, did you not tell them you went to Aylsham High where in siome classrooms the temperature would be over 60c and other rooms it would be 10 degrees below the outside temperature. With this alternative URL you have been using, does this mean you could accept an invite for this blog to contribute, i wasent really sure what you meant. Anyways am back home now and thoughraly board, i have to now edit mum and dads holiday video from my camera from their holiday which I wasen't alowed to go on, how demining! It was so much fun not having parents for a week, although i had more to do with looking after the house and dog and chickens and hobit and whatnot, I actualy found myself with more time on my hands because I could do it all when i felt like (at one instance i was tidying up at 0300) without nagging. Yesterday me and chris speant an hour in the pool and by the end of it we were blue and thats especially hard considering how Chris's skin colour is quite alot darker than mine. BTW how much is your insurance costing you mine has been lowerd from 800 to 600 (and now i get to use dads car)? So anyway I must get back to meaningless tasks.   Alex   P.S enjoy Gmail, I do.

       Well theres only one way to describe Gmail and that is heaven in the from of Email its a cross between heaven and well email. It's pretty fantastic, fast on 56k, smooth, asthetically pleasing, loads of useful functions, infinate storage, It puts outlook express to shame let alone hotmail or yahoo. the minute i get my next invite you will be first on my list (the first invite I recived went back to me so I could get another account for the sake of extra invites). To tired to talk much now anyway, thanks for the email, i will respond (on here obviously) shortly but at the moment im wacked.

       Hey, sorry I haven't posted in a few days I just haven't got round to it recently. Have been pas de parents this week while they move the boat. They have encounter a few problems but are pretty much on schedule. The temperature in Greece at the moment is reaching about 37c during the day, basteds. Went to a "universities fair" at the UEA yesterday and just picked up a pile of prospectuses (although I still have my heart set on Kent) and some free stuff too like pens and a mini inflatable chair. Had an pocket draining few days: I was borrowing mum and dads TV in my room and when I decided to move it the aerial socket came out along with the coax, so I though ahh, and took it up to Postles in Aylsham to see if they would fix it, the gimps said it would not be ready until Tuesday (mum and dad are back on monday) and would cost me £25 (not including VAT) just to look at it so I came back home (after luging this TV into aylsham and back) and phoned Chris so I could use his soldering iron, that was a mistake because in the end I just coverd the hole with solder and made it completly un-usable and un fixable, so I came to the conclusion that because the SCART still worked the only choise I had was to either give them my freeview box or buy a new one. So in the end I brought a new one (which I kept) and gave them my old one and hope they wont be to mad when the get back, but they should be Ok about it as they now can just work it. Got your email: Hey guys

Hope you are well and your exams tailed off to a great finish! I've just returned from a week of sail training which was amazing. F-in hard work, really cold, force 6 winds at least, rough sea - therefore inducing mush sickness..... mmmm nice, vomit colour there! However after 2 days of throwing up, i got my sea legs and over the voyage we covered 550 miles from the west coast of scotland to Lewis, then to the group of islands called Orkney. Damn good fun and i r now a proper sailer, innit. Well, i'm now off on expedition into the Cairn Gorms, 16hours after returning from Cruise and I feel like shite. But hey, it's a hard knock life.

What have you dudes been up to latley? Since last week, the IT fuckers have completely blocked blogger.com & blogspot, so i can't even read your board till I get off campus in a week.

My exams went ok i think, I could ever be sure about Biology though, its such a ridiculous subject and you never know exactly what they want from you in an answer. Plus so much that we learnt, we weren't tested on, bastards!!! Chem was ok and Maths, the best I can hope for is not great, but I never was great with numbers. Did you know that it is official that the ability to 'count' is not a requirement for A-Level Maths! Crazy.

Anywho, must go and pack now, have 2 hours to departure and have not started yet. Take care everyone and I'll be in touch in a week or so. I go on tour on thr 5th July and return to Norfolk around the 17th. Take care all

Love R

 
The sailing to the Orkney isles sounds fantastic I'm very jelous. I also realise you probably cant read this so I suggest when you do you grab the nearest wooden spoon and shove it so far up the IT geeks dandruff covered, pale arses and forsably unblock Blogger, they might as well block Google, BBCi, Hotmail and every other popular site. Hey maybe if you don't need to count for A level maths then I should give it a go because I have real trouble with that :). I suppose its like not needing to go near a computer to complete GNVQ IT (its just glorified letter writting after all). Good Luck on tour. My brother is comlaining constantly about AHS, Proffeser Mitchel has enforced cameras in each classroom (1984 anyone?) and they say they cant even afford batteries for our precious clocks :(, well maybe that what its like Back To The Future.
Anyway laters Girls, looks likes Sams contribution of two very short posts and one comment is all he can manage(no offence Sam). Alex

       Had politics induction for A2 today, seems fun, we are going to be doing in the first module what we did this year in Sociology. I have a relaxing week ahead of coaxing into college at random times every now and again, see a few friends, do no work and come home, and as mum and dad have gone to greece for the week i will have the house to myself half the time. I hope your having fun Ryck. I hope the weather clears up soon as i can get back in the pool, and laze in the sun. Also heavily analysing university prospectuses, Kent really takes my fancy. Anyway I'm tired and your probably bored reading this so I'm off to bed. Night Alex

       Ooh look at me, I have been invited to a Liberal Democrat Party to celebrate the election success in Aylsham (2 out of 3 seats one), because of my help (paid help mind you [£75 for a weeks work]) delivering leaflets and putting up signs in our garden. Although I probably won't be going because it's going to be lots of old people there who I have know idea who they are and I'm not to interseted in local goverment, but cool to be invited, I've also been invited to help out Andrew Duff (local MEP, lib dem of course) in Brussels and Strasburg for a few weeks next summer, and with Norman Lamb (North Norfolk MP, again Lib Dem)to go and help him out in the Houses of Parliament (work experience type thing). I'm really looking forward to both of these :). Any way sorry to bore you with politics crap. I'll get back to my boreing sunday afternoon begging for Gmail invites, tyding my room and listening to Guns 'N' Roses. Have Fun. Alex

       Did basically nothing today, did some things that needed doing around the house. Mainly helped mum with planning and organiseing her and dads trip to greece next week to move the boat. In the afternoon Ben came over and then Simon and we just pissed about for the evening, watching DVDs etc.

       Just got back from Sams, had a great time we watched loads of films and some bad ones (cyborg cop, cyborg cop2) watched the Big Brother fight and stuff and the England match (3-0). But we have just recived our quarterly phone bill and it was a bit steep. At present we pay £80 a month for cheaper phone calls and free after 1800 phone calls etc, yet the phone bill was an extra £86 over this, shit. This is mainly because with the (gay) BT 1571 service, although it costs the user nothing, it costs the person calling 42p just to hear "the person you are calling are either looking at porn or having amindless boaring conversation so call back later you dumb fuck we are taking all your money" or whatever it says. It also costs the same with mobiles to hear the "the person you are caling are too stupid to know how to turn on their phone this could be because they are either a mong or a girl.". What a rip off, BT are making loads of money out of people not being able to get through, how tight!. {[political rant, ignore if you are not a looser like me] This is all because of bloody Thatcher and her "free" market economy, and privatising all the national companies so in the end the fat cats at the top of BT get loaded with cash whilst everyone else gets fucked, bitch! [end of rant]} So I won't be using the phone that much for a while, i'll just have to let others waste their parents phone bill. Anyway sorry about all that you probably really don't give a toss. But this is a blog and it's good to keep in topuch even if it is only small things. Alex

       Anyway, Today Jez, Simon and I went kyaking/canoeing at Blakeney. We decided we were going to try and paddle through the creeks to Morston (about 3km away), so we set off padling and got about a km into the creeks and marshes and found ourselves stuck as by now the tide had gone out and there was no water in front or behind us (with high tide at 0500 and at 1700, being about 1100 at the time), it was low tide and we miscaculated just how little/none water there would be. So we decided to treck on down the river/mud until we needed a break. So we stopped for a break and then decided (after a brief sampha picking expidition and mud fight) to treck over the grassy marshes towards the water, so we did and it shreded our feet to pieces (painful, oowww!!) so we went in the next river bed we found for a while and then back onto the marsh and repeated this for the next 2 hours or so. The repeated broken sharp shells and sharp marsh grass does not do anything for your feet (blood actuly came through the mud), although it is considerd a chinese torture method and I am now ready to join the British running on hot coals team, hehe. Eventually after some testing of pain thresholds muddy faces, mouths tasting of sampha and some burnt shoulders we got to the basin of Blakney water (also now empty of water and rather chilly by this point without sun and a strong northerly wind). We ravished until our food suplies were succesfully diminished (bar a small yellow tangerine and some more sampha) and the played around for a whike waiting for an hour or so until the tide. Just before getting to the basin we had to cross some realy sharp plants and mine and simons legs we raw (jez was clever enough to wear shoes) so greeting large puddles of luke warm water and soft sand/mud was the most blissful state of being you can imagine. After about an 1hour 1/2 and simon reciving repeted harrasment from "friendly" crabs the tide finaly decided to be nice to us and come back (albeit slowly), so all we had to do from then on was sit back in our floating kingdoms of mud (it was like a scene from water world except for you [ryck] or tom weren't there with your webbed feet, sorry hehe) doing nothing for a km but sit back in the canoes. So all in all we did the least amount of paddling on a canoeing trip and a rather alot of pulling. But it was very enjoyable despit the injurys and crab bites (or love bites in Simons case). And when we got back to blakeney key we were greeted by a wet milly and mum, who after helping us pack the canoes away, took us for fish and chips and returned home stinking of Blakney mud. But at least we didn't break a boat this time (well we did damage the seat on one of the canoes but a repair involving the end of a fishing net solved that) and we had a very enjoyable time. It's a real shame we only have three canoes because a massive canoe trip would be such a laugh. Anyways latter dudettes. Alex

       Had a fun day today, didn't do much just thongs around the house, but in the afternoon tom popped round and so did simon after college which was cool and we had water fights and swam in the oversised paddling pool (and lost the frisbee to the neighbours twice). It was fun and a lovely sunny day, unexpexected though. Hope its sunny in Kilttown and hope its sunny in Pikeyingham sorry Erpingham. Alex

       Ryck, do you remember the boat I took you sailing on in march last year (the laser 2) well yesterday we went sailing in a light wind, but enough to make the boat tip a bit and all of a sudden the left hallyard (metal rope holding up the mast) snapped, now this would have been fine as the boat is supposed to be okish with just 2 hallyards, but because of having the boat at Blakeney for years salt corrosion had got to the bottom of the mast and the same time the hallyard snapped so did the bottom of the mast plunging mast sail and all into the water. Whoops! Luckily the mast fell sideways missing both me and Tim, otherwise it would have hurt. It should be fixable though hopefully, but it now means we are stuck without two man sailing for the summer. Thankfully the nice new  urlLink Laser Vortex  is working fine I was on it yesterday again, hehe and the new laser hull dad got us works fine so we have to very good single man boats. 
Any way sorry for going on a bit. I'm gonna go have my lunch and eat a nice large sandwich.

       Well I had my media exams today; they were bloody brilliant: easy questions and a clip we had already studied in class. Fantastic! We went to see Troy afterwards and get some food. Troy was not brilliant it was uter tripe, they turned a fantastic epic myth into a poor story line with bad music and the wooden acting of Orlando Bloom. They fighting scenes were great though, but the whole film went on a bit. Lots of free time up ahead all though I'm gonna make myself busy. I have pleanty lined up with website designs, going canoeing, going to the beach (come along Sam, I'll give you a call), writing scripts, going sailing, attempting the great tidy of My bedroom (maybe that would be a better film than Troy!) and organising various thinmgs and finaly getting to play guitar a bit more. But it'll all have to wait as I'm off to bed soon after a long day. Oh and the week after next my parents are going on holiday so the house will be empty apart from the odd apperance by Tim grunting something about history in the corner. By the way if your ever get the chance read Salam Pax's blog - The Baghdad Blog/Dear Raed as it is called. It is fantastic I just finished reading the book and now I am reading the more recent stuff online at  urlLink  dear_raed.blogspot.com. It's supposed to be crap weather at the weekend so that puts my first oppertunity for sailing of the agenda, great! I was enjoying the heat in our new oversised padling pool.

       Re your email, stupid geeks I bet they allow them selves access to every site (especially for their kiddy porn!). Sounds like your going to have great fun after your exams with partying and all wish I could be there to party too. 
Do you have phone lines in your rooms? if you do then you could use it that way, but I'm sure that has already been thought of.
And a deffinate yes to the Gangster film, it'll be a laugh.
Unfortunately I'm going to Paris on the 14th and then to Corfu on the 19th or 20th of July and going for 2 and 1/2 weeks, so unfortunately I wont see you for a while but we will still have time for the gangster film :). Anyway have fun beating IT geeks and drinking hope to see or hear from you soon I'll smack sam up a bit and get him to post something.
Alex
 Hey bro

Exams are going ok actually, not too painful yet, Chemistry was nice today and bio wasn't too bad. I have my last one 2moro morning - Stats!!! Then party on, oh yeah, gigidy gigidy! The site is way cool, thanks for keeping it up. Its good to hear that you are doing ok with exams, beside your Dr Faustus, don't worry mate, it'll be fine. Our head giving IT geek won't unblock blogger.com, he says that its because people might post bad things about the school etc.... what crap, stupid nerd!! But i'll keep looking, its really interesting, like a texual big brother or diary. I'm looking into getting on of those vodafone connect cards (depending on prices etc) so i can don things like this from my lapy.

YES! Ripping it out of the Germans on D-Day was a lot of fun, and watching the german episode of faulty towers too, yes, good, good.

Well, look forward to the summer and parties galore! I get back to norfolk around the 15th July i think, then leave on the 12th August, not too long....... so best make the most of it. I'm holding you to that ganster film...... what ya rekon?

I'll keep looking, say hi to sam. I'm gonna keep bugin the IT techs to unblock it, see where i get.

Anywhoos, revision to attend to now, then excessive drinking from mid day friday onwards and forever!

       Before I get down to my video watching I'll tell you about my other exams. Politics went pretty damm well and I even manged to quote Micheal Howard (tory leader - twat). My English Lit exams on the other hand were not so great the first two exams were ok but the texts in contexts were horrible the poetry one went alright but it wasen't a brilliant essay but my Dr Faustus went horibbly. It was the worst exam I have ever done and I only manged to write just over a page and that was al rubbish. Oh well.
Best of luck with all your remaing exams Ryck (and you Sam if you have any more).

Oh Yeah and we got this really cool over sized paddling pool for 30quid which you can swim in and if you sit in it the water comes up to your neck, its fantasic!

Good Luck and speak to you soon.

       I am so tired and board of revision. I didn't get any sleep last night; I was cold but hot at the same time and cosequently had the worst nights sleep I can remember. So because of that I'm tired and none of this revision is going in to my head at all. anyway hope your having a better time. I've got a pretty nasty week up ahead with 3 three hour exams and my whole politics course is assesed on one days exams. After that though I'm completely free and can relax, yay! 
Sorry about the rant, I am just getting very annoyed with having to do stupid revision.
Speak to you soon

I have sent you an member invite to give you the ability to post here, whether or not it'll work is another thing. If you have trouble replying or commenting then just reply by email.

       Hey Ryck,
         This may look a little dumb, and its near the summer holidays but I thought using a weblog (blog) would be a great way to keep in touch with you and let you know what is going on form back in sunny Norfolk. In this log we (being just me at the moment but it will increase)will write down the weekly, daily, or monthly goings on around here and they will be published on this site to which you can access from anywhere. I intend to keep this updated whilst your in Scotland as a means of constant contact because frankly this year I have barely emailed you and when I have they have been short and crap - sorry about that. Once you have seen this site could you email me (telling me you have) and I will give you the means in which you can post responses on here. 
  Anyway exams are looming on Monday, though thankfully it's my last week of them and then I will be free for the summer. I presume you also have exams coming up next week and I wish you the best of luck with them (I know you'll do great). 
  It was my birthday last week, as you know (thanks for the card) and we managed to have a weekend of partying with a film (day after tomorrow) then a small Aylsham gathering on the Friday and then a college gathering on the Saturday at a resturant and then a pub (of course), so all in all it was great and I got to see nearly everyone even at short notice. I hope we can do something similar for your birthday.
  When do you get back then, I can't wait to see you, we have a lot of catching up to do as we didn't see each other last time, (and we have to make that gangster film still). Anyway I really must get back to my poetry annotations; I hope to see you soon and hope you reply, I will be posting again shortly.

  &nbsp;
 I'm at the Doctors in Aylsham at the mo, doing some work exp, good fun, aye! Just been out on some visits to oldies, nice! doing some stats and figures at the mo, so thought that in between ebaying and work, I'd post something. Just got a new laptop yesterday, its a fucking beast! P4, 512 DDR, DVD+RW, 40Gb HDD, 128mb ATI Radeon and more! Now guess what I paid for this 16" laptop...... £600! A bargin, i barted this dude in John Lewis down so much firstly because the ad was wrong, it was scrated a tad and then just to take the piss, knocked £80 off! Also, dad has finally agreed to buy a new desktop as ours just died and I can't be bothered to fix it in my pathetic ways any more. Its a nice one, sort of standard lower market spec, P4, Nvidia 128mb, 120Gb, DVD+/-RW, 256 DDR. But a nice 17" TFT. I can't wait for it to arrive so I can have my way with it!!! Tee heee. 
  &nbsp;
 Well, I strimmed the field last night so it's all ready for our party! I've done a cool layout and I'm plaaning for it to be between the 3rd and the 10th, in that week. So when do you and Jez get back? 
  &nbsp;
 Well, must do some work now, or they will pump me full of drugs and sell my body parts for spares...... honest

        Well, there's a first time for everything and this is my first 'Blog'.... its the biggest rush i've ever had, i was trashed after, I couldn't even remember whether I was an ostrich or an emu.. God!, I'm deffinetely having another shot of Blog next weekend!! 

Well, haven't done much lately, just worked and worked, and some more work. Lookin at Uni's and getting my Section 10 sorted (bit by bit). Been to the Pub a few times, it's crap luck that you guys couldn't make it. I'm sure you're Greece trip is going swimmingly... if you catch my drift... he he, 2 jokes.

Cool, I'm looking forward to all the PARTIES!!!, hoping for a bit of laugh and a bit of a drink. It's good to be home. I wish I had more time with everyone, but hey... times are hard and time tighter. 

We've got shitty twat head neighbours, who bad mouth us all the time to people (who naturally tell us they do) and tonight, their little bitch spawn kicked her fball into our garden, knocked the door and had the f'in cheek to ask for it back!! I damn well popped that little tweenie ball and pissed on it before I posted back through their letter box!............. I wish I had, really I do. She went and got it back, but I'm watching her, ready with my tranquilizer gun! 

OK, i've babbled enough, time for my fix of TV. Peace out

         Paris was cool, alot of fun, we spent ages on the metro and walking around due to tiredness and lack of ability to navigate maps after 8hrs in an airport without getting to sleep, (mainly because tom and ben were haveing a laugh to impress the 3 busty and one less so busty french girls). The whole thing was so much fun, and staying in the youth hostel was great to; clean, cheap and full of nice people. We met this Irish guy (we named him Paddy O'Brian) who was staying in the Youth Hostel whilst he brought an apartment in Paris, he managed to eat a whole massive jar of gerkins while we sat there playing cards and then came over and started talikng so we invited him to play cards. He came up with this game (wich is the same as black jack) which it seemed he made up the rules as we went along. "ahh&nbsp;ya can honly place dhat card on hay tuesday if hits bin raining and hits a coloured card". Oh and simon and Tom managed to snap the key card for our room into the lock within five minutes of getting to our room and so we had to get the cool guy with the long hair to fix it. the second day we saw all the sites and had a laugh. anyway must go i really need to start packing, oh and blogger has had a re vamp so you can now post pictures and don't have to use HTML codeing to do basic things.

        Firstly apologies for not posting this week, I have been very busy, very tired, and very much away from a computer. I had Lee round on monday and tuesday (he stayed the night and we were up till 0400, watching movies), and we have pumped out a script for our summer film "Disconnected", we have found the location, sign nearly all the actors, even invented a new type of camera techniqe (BikéCam). So the film is on schedule for after I get back from holiday and he does. Then Simon came over on the tuesday afternoon and after a trip to John's Water with chris he stayed the night. On wednesday had to do chors for mum, but in the evening we went to the worst organised cinema trip ever, (I think Laura W organised it, it oculd only have been a girl) we went to Cromer to go and see a film (Shrek 2 - zzzzzzz) in the crappest cinema and then everyone went off in different directions and we ended up having crap fish and chips in the fish shop because the rain was so bad, and of course there were no buses to go home on because Laura didnt think of that when she decided to go to a crap cinema in a shitty place to see an unfunny film.  Anyway I know you won't be reading this Ryck as you are on tour at the moment. On the way back form visiting the Kent university open day (fantastic I want to go there) we stopped at a welcome break service station where mum spoke to your family and they said they were on their way to see you perform. So good luck with it, you probably wont see this till after you've finished but my sentiment is with you. Break a neck... er leg!   Busy week ahead: Sunday, Tom and I are going to see Bi Jovi the Bon Jovi tribute band at the waterfront, Monday meeting Simon, Ben and Tom to change crappy pounds to EUROS and decide on routes and weather or not to pop over to Brussels etc, Tuesday take Jez on the Boat durring the day, Wednesday pack for Paris and Greece then go to Luton Airport and kip the night in the terminal (not as bad as it sounds i've done it before), then Thursday arrive a la Paris and sleep the night in a auberge du juennese (youth hostel), then Friday in Paris/possibly a while in Brussles and catch the 22:30 flight home (local time, arrive back in stinkville 22:45) then a three day break then Greece.  Anyways hope you sparkely new Gmail account is treating you well. Mine is. I shall send you one of the production shots for Disconnected. I shall also go to bed as I am tired after being in Canterbury all day.  Good Day!, Alexanderos> P.S. I may be spending a year in Italy as part of my course at uni, how cool! Alex

        After finally getting our (router, adsl modem, firewal, 4 port switch + usb port,) box we had a 3 xbox linkup game today and it was fantastic. Very geeeky, and just me tim, sean chris and jake but it was great (sam is away round beckys). Havent really done much else today apart from things around the house. I only woke up at about 1300 today after Hannah's party last night. It was a cool party with loads of sheringham blokes there who were all quite nice chaps. I think there was one Sheringham girl there (shows Hannahs priorities). Anna got with someone, what a surprise! (i give it a week that seems to be the average with her). got to go some one is awake   alex
