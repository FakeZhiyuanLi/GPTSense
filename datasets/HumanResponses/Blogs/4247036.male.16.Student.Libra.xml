       This weekend was pretty great.  I mean, so many things happened, all of different levels and types of good.  On Friday, I talked to my baby for a really long time, she was tired, but I stayed up.  I also watched Fight Club on Friday, that movie is just so good.  If you haven't seen Fight Club go get it...now.  Then on Saturday I woke up and did my chores, all the while trying to call Cyndi.  After a while I went and chilled at my friend James' house.  We played a game called Fusion Frenzy on XBOX.  Very fun mingames.  I ended up staying over there all night.  I learned a lot of Japanese from Akiya, the Japanese exchage student living with James.  I really love learning new languages.  Today was so great because Cyndi surprised me at James' house, I looked like the just-woken-up-devil-monster, but it was no problem.  She took me to a Chinese restaurant and then we just hung out together for a long time.  My weekend was so great, the perfect R&amp;R time for the long week I just had.

       Today was a great Friday! It went by at a pretty good speed so it was nice to get out of school. Practice was hard but it would have been better had I not drank really hot water that made me sick. Cyndi came to see me...that sexy punk straight up burglarized my house! Its ok because i take it as a compliment. I walk all up in my best friends house, its just how things work. It was really great to see *her* because I was missing her. Hopefully I can spend more time this weekend with her. I burned some dvds tonite, I'm a pirate, bootleggin is so fun! Anyway, I think tonite Ill watch bootleg fight club and play on the internet, fun huh? Thats about it for now.

       Today was a day of tiredness.  This morning I thought I would wake up early (yea right) I ended up snoozing a while then going to school.  I was betrayed by one of *her* friends...stole my cupcake, its totally on now...straight street...straight hood.  Anyway, today was pretty fun in school.  Practice was hell, hot and tiring, not to mention I had a TON of stuff to do and still do.  I'm getting my assignment from Cyndi...how great she is =]  I'm tired but I'll be up late, maybe even late enough to post again.  Untill next time...

       Today was great!  I had a really good day all day.  Woke up this morning a little sick with a sore throat.  It was all better when I got some donuts!  After that I went to first period, where I caught up on some much needed beauty rest.  The rest of the day went great, mainly thanks to *her*  She is so great and if not for her, this day wouldn't have been good at all.  She turns my world around :D   After school, I turned in my nomination for class president *cross fingers* I hope I win!  Well, that was my day.Until next time...

      Well, today was good, I posted three times including this one.  I really like having a blog, I've never done any type of online journal before and I'm pretty excited about this one.  Today at school was good, pretty much a regular day.  I've decided to run for class president, so hopefully that will work out for me.  Drumline is coming along nicely and Tuesday is homework day. woo hoo! Not. ;p  O well, until next time...

      First period is rediculously boring right now.  We're talking about blogs...how ironic.  I thought this class would be fun and easy, don't get me wrong, sitting down and doing nothing isn't too hard, but it sure isn't entertaining.  Did I mention this is boring?  O well, I had some donuts this morning so I guess it's all good.  Can't wait for something eventful to happen for me to post.

       Well, Here's my first post on Blogger.  I'm kind of excited about starting my own online journal.  Today at school, I was in computer class and the teacher told us to look for an example of a web log.  I found this service and got very interested. I set up my own account before the period was over!  So yea, school was fun today.  Until next time...
