      So today I had to get up early as heck for a Saturday.  Went to my doctor's office and discussed with the office manager what steps could be taken to set themselves up for potential growth in the future.  I didn't really get a feel of where they wanted to be 5-10 years from now and I also didn't know what their "limit" would be (i.e. how big they want their practice to be).  I did notice different things that could be improved to streamline the operation and make everyone working their and their processes more efficient.  This is really an exciting opportunity to start my own business.  If I do a good job on this on molding their IT infrastructure and they like it, my name would be spread amongst their peers and more opportunities would present themselves.  I mean think about it, one clinic, I could charge them $10K a year for support and maintenance and pretty much be their IT manager.  That's one practice.  If things are setup correctly, I wouldn't even have to visit their office more than once a month!  That's $10K for doing support and maintenance.  Now imagine if I had five practices to take care of?!?!?  That's $50K a year right for visiting clinics five times a month.  Now think about ten practices, $100K!!!.  If I really wanted to be absurd and ridiculous and want more than ten, let's say fifteen or twenty offices.  I would have to hire someone to help me out and be the main point of contact, kinda like the help desk (or tech support line), I could just pay that person $25-30K a year and their going to be set.  This is still really a dream, I still have to set that doctor's office up and that depends if they want things done right.  The computer people that they have taking care of their IT needs seems like a lame shop.  They really don't care about the business and the growth of the business and positioning the clinic properly for potential of growth.  Anyways that's a lot of rambling over an opportunity that hasn't even fully materialized yet but it's good to dream right?  Well going out tonight to North Beach again, free party deal, it could be fun.  I will have to stop being a little bitch and just go out and have some fun and stop comparing everyone to her.  It's proving to be somewhat difficult but I guess the setting is not really a place to find a person like that.  Thursday was lame  I really tried to talk to girls and see if they had anything intelligent to say or talk about things that I don't have an idea about but I couldn't really do it.  I feel like I should go to a fucking library to find a smart, intelligent, classy, not overbearingly opinionated, good looking, funny, appreciative girl that knows how to just let loose and have fun.  Yeah...Library? Not my style.  Man, I should stop doing this I gotta do laundry.  Peace out.  I really don't know why I am typing this at all.  Maybe it's just a journal that people can see but I guess it's more for myself as a therapeutic release of writing things down and looking back next year and checking out what I was doing, how I was feeling, I really don't know.  As much as I hate to say it, WHATEVER.  I'm outtie

      Tomorrow morning I get to visit my doctor's clinic to take a look/evaluate their current IT technologies as well as offering some ideas to help them reach where they want to be in the future.  This will be interesting since I haven't seen their network/IT infrastructure or have done this sort of extensive work before.  I guess I also want to do a good job so that they pay me well and then refer me to their other doctor/non doctor buddies to upgrade their current IT infrastructure / SOHO network and expand from there.  While tonight I see myself doing some laundry while playing KOTOR.  I think I am almost done with the first time of playing the game.  I suppose I shouldn't go out tonight since I will have to be up somewhat early tomorrow and be all professional and such.  Sounds like another boring Friday for Gonzo.  No pain, No gain.

      Have you ever gone to a place that served THE best steak?  Juicy, tender, full of flavor and the thought of eating there just makes you hungry even if you're not.  Yeah that's a great steak house huh?  Then suddenly the place goes out of business.  You then try to find another steak house that served that perfect steak but nothing has come close to it.  Maybe in the future you will find a steak house that serves steak that is just as good or even better than what you had but right now you still want to go back to the steak house that served THE BEST steak.    Yeah this is a metaphor or something like that.....

I scored a whopping 591,524 (could have gotten 650,000) in Drift mode 10 laps in Drift Track # 6 with complete stage 3 Honda S2000.  Yeah, I'm a fucking NERD.  I got proof if you want me to email it to you.  Boo-yah!  Anyone want to bring it?  Anyways, time to go to the bar.  It's thursday, late work day tomorrow, I'm outtie!

      http://mywebpages.comcast.net/80mike/mario3.wmv  We've all seen this one and it's just great to watch even though it's probably fake.  It was still fun to watch and take a big shit over the bouncing on the cannon balls and huge bullets and the gerbils throwing thier 3 polygon ninja stars.  Amazing to think that this was done with out cheating but I doubt it.  Not exactly sure how this was "cheated" but it's still fun to watch

      Well here's me taking it to another level in being a geek.  Today was a hard day to get up to.  It was freezing, I didn't get enough sleep and on top of that I am in limbo with this chick that I really like (as cheesy as that sounds) but we won't get into that right now.  So I get up and proceed to do my morning rituals as fast as I can as to not be late for work.  Still got to work late.  GRRRRR  So I'm sure that you all have heard of "things happen for a reason"  A lot of things have happened over the last three weeks but I still haven't found out why they happened.  GRRRRR  Yeah doesn't make much sense.  I'm sure I'll get the hang of this sometime.  The Butterfly Effect looks like an interesting view.  Might not be good at all but the idea of "The Butterfly Effect" is still intriguing enough that I think I will pay the highway robbery fee of $9.00 and watch the movie anyways.  Atleast I get to go to North Beach (Downer's Grove, IL) tonight for a little fun and people watching.  Hopefully it will be a lot better than it has been over the past few weeks.  That's it for now.

      Damn!!!  That last race was a fucking hard one.  There were 111 races listed and I beat all of them.  Now I had to go beat this "Legend of the Street" guy driving a 350Z  It took me a few tries (6) to finally beat him on EASY!  Shit, This guy never made a mistake and when he did, he was able to fucking make up for it it was NUTS.  I would be up 6 seconds on him because he would crash and then the next thing I know he's right up on my ass!!!  I mean what the fuck is up with that?  I also believe that there is some sort of handicapper system with in the game because I was prone to lose my footing going fast if I had an absurd lead on the guy.  I guess just get to know the track and then race a clean race and use the nitrous if you get into a crash to get back up to 130 mph.  So that's done, everything is unlocked.  Whoop-dee-doo.  Now I wish there was an online option for this fucking game.    Anyways, I then set out to beat my own drift score of whatever it was and I did.  No one can beat me here.  Stage 3 S2000 10 laps around and I accumulated an insane score of 666,843.  Yeah I definitely think I can get that 700,000 mark.  That's for a different day though.  I will savor my nerdiness for a few hours till I get to see "almost" and hangout at my buddies apartment.  Next up:  Superbowl Bet, that's for Sunday night, after the game.

      So last night I went to Derek's for a little baseball action.  March 4th is the when the Cubbies have their first game of spring training but spring training actually starts Feb 14th (or sometime around there) with the Regular Season Home Opener at Wrigley on April 12th (Monday).  High heat was fun.  We started out with Boston vs. Giants, as Derek kicked my ass with the final score of 9-3 Giants.  I was having problems telling my runners to go for extra bases and I kept throwing the ball when I caught it to home plate.  It was not a pretty sight.  The second game was a totally different story.  Well, the end result was the same but how we got there was something else.  It was The Cubs (Derek) vs. Marlins (Me, yeah we wanted to recreate and then change what happened.)  The players were mostly the same but it was evident that the roster that they based the game on was from the beginning of 2003 season.  It was alright.  So started out good, a couple of base hits here and there but ultimately I left runners stranded as Zambrano was mowing my guys down.  Josh Beckket was my pitcher.  He was doing pretty good against Sammy and Moises.  So in the second inning Derek made the mistake of throwing me a nice hanging curve ball and I just sat on it and hit it out of the park, 1-0 Marlins.  Round the bases and now it's the Cubs turn to hit.  I get through the first two batters with ease but I was just being lazy with a fast ball and Derek hit it out of the park, brand new game 1-1.  The pitchers then started to dominate the game throwing knee buckling curve balls as well as freezing cutters and just jam you up and force you to pop out.   Zambrano was pulled in the 3rd replaced by Wood and then in the 6th Prior was called up to pitch.  Remember Steve Bartman?  Yeah it was kinda like that.  Pitch by Prior jammed the batter but the ball didn't travel too deep into the seats for it to be uncatchable so Alou was able to make the catch.  Just looked all too familiar as the camera panned right down the left field line focusing on the left fielder as he got underneath the ball to catch it.  Reminded me of the NLCS.  So after that was caught went to the 7th and I hit a homer to lead 2-1.  Derek then shows up with Sammy to hit one as well tying the game at 2-2.  That's when things just got ugly.  We played a total of 15 innings.  No one wanted to lose.  We started the game at 8:45 PM and it was a long game!  15 innings.  Pitching was strong for both teams, strikeouts were starting to pile up for each pitcher.  10 pm came around we were still tied. 10:15, still tied 13th inning.  10:30 pm top of the 15th, had a chance to steal home I took it because I knew my pitching was going to come through for me, hesitated for a second and they got me at home.  Bottom of the 15th, got the first batter to pop up. 1 out.  Moises Alou was then walking up to the place.  He was having a bad game 1-6 or something like that so I knew that I could mess with him a little.  Fast ball upstairs.  Strike 1!  Curve ball high.  Strike 2!  Slider low and away.  Ball 1!  Low and inside 92 mph fast ball.  GAME WINNING HOME RUN!!!  Yeah, I was crushed.  It was a great game but I just got lazy and should've thrown a pitch outside to see if he would chase it.  Oh well.  It was a pretty enjoyable game.  Good graphics, smooth animation and transition and the game wasn't too hard to pick up on.  Great variety of pitches, around 30 overall.  Stealing bases is great but the pickoff moves are just as good.  Batting was a little hard to get used to but once you get the hang of it, it's pretty easy to direct where you want the ball to go.  The game definitely took longer than expected leaving little time to do ther stuff.  Sorry I was really going to call.  Graphics A- although the players didn't really look like themselves here, animation was still smooth and you could see their jersey numbers Game Play A - controls were okay, took a little while getting used to but that's just me Sound/Commentary C+ - the announcers didn't have anything to say, same repetitive crap with Mr. Obvious sitting with them  Overall - I would say that it's a must rent.  I haven't played it enough to really get into the franchise mode, 2 on 2 baseball etc. and to decide if it's a must buy.  Sounds like it if you can download updated rosters from XBOX Live.  Maybe I can give a better review if I do rent it myself.

      Well, it has happened.  I can officially be  urlLink "Googled"   Wierd.  I really don't know how to react to this.  Hah.  I guess people who have known me as Gonzo Marte can only find me like this.  Which is everybody right now.  So I suppose with that said, if you found this, do I know you?

       ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE   By Author Unknown   If there was ever a time to dare,  to make a difference,  to embark on something worth doing,  IT IS NOW.  Not for any grand cause, necessarily...  but for something that tugs at your heart,  something that's your inspiration,  something that's your dream.   You owe it to yourself  to make your days here count.  HAVE FUN.  DIG DEEP.  STRETCH.  DREAM BIG.   Know, though, that things worth doing  seldom come easy.  There will be good days.  And there will be bad days.  There will be times when you want to turn around,  pack it up, and call it quits.  Those times tell you  that you are pushing yourself,  that you are not afraid to learn by trying.   PERSIST.  Because with an idea,  determination, and the right tools,  you can do great things.  Let your instincts, your intellect,  and your heart, guide you.   TRUST.  Believe in the incredible power of the human mind.  Of doing something that makes a difference.  Of working hard.  Of laughing and hoping.  Of lazy afternoons.  Of lasting friends.  Of all the things that will cross your path this year.   The start of something new  brings the hope of something great,  ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.   ----------------------------------------------------------   I've Learned   Author unknown   I've learned that you cannot make someone love you. All you can do is be someone that can be loved. The rest is up to them.   I've learned that no matter how much I care, some people just don't care back.   I've learned that it takes years to build up trust, and only seconds to destroy it.   I've learned that it's not what you have in your life, but who you have in your life that counts.   I've learned hat you can get by on charm for about fifteen minutes. After that, you'd better know something.   I've learned that you shouldn't compare yourself to the best others can do.   I've learned that you can do some thing in an instant that will give you heartache for life.   I've learned that it's taking me a long time to become the person I want to be.   I've learned that you should always leave loved ones with loving words. It may be the last time you see them.   I've learned that you can keep going long after you can't.   I've learned that we are responsible for what we do, no matter how we feel. That either you control your attitude or it controls you.   I've learned that heroes are the people who do what has to be done regardless of the consequences.   I've learned that money is a lousy way to keep score.   I've learned that my best friends and I can do anything or nothing and have the best time.   I've learned that the people you expect to kick you when you're down will be the ones to pick you back up.   I've learned that sometimes when I'm angry I have to be angry, but that doesn't give me the right to be cruel.   I've learned that just because someone doesn't love you the way you want them to doesn't mean they don't love you with all they have.   I've learned that maturity has more to do with what types of experiences you've had and what you've learned from them and less to do with how many birthdays you've celebrated.   I've learned that you should never tell a child their dreams are unlikely or outlandish. Few things are more humiliating, and what a tragedy it would be if they believed it.   I've learned that no matter good a friend is, they're going to hurt you every once in a while and you must forgive them for that.   I've learned that no matter how bad your heart is broken the world doesn't stop for your grief.   I've learned that our background and circumstances may have influenced who we are, but we are responsible for who we become.   I've learned that even when you think you have no more to give, when a friend cries out to you, you will find the strength to help.

      So I wake up today at 5:30 with all the best intentions of getting to work before my check in time but that didn't happen.  It usually takes me 25 mins to get to work driving around in the suburbs to get to another suburb to work.  No major expressways to hop on to nothing like that.  Just main streets and busy road that are supposed to be fucking plowed so that people wouldn't be driving so damn slow.  Well it was still shitty.  It took me 50 mins to get from my house and drive 10 normally short ass miles.  I was more than relaxed though a little annoyed that it was moving so damn slow.  I sympathize for the people that actually had to take the expressways and wait two even three hours to get downtown to go to their place of employment.  That just blows.  I gotta admit though that it was fun pulling the e-brake around turns and having the ass end of this P.O.S. rental get loose and go sideways for a little while and then straighten out and continue driving.  Of course I don't do it when there are other cars around for fear of a lawsuit if I do hit another car.  Snow drifting baby!!!    Last night I had beer for dinner.  That probably is the cause for me being so damn tired this morning, not to mention hungry.  I can't wait for lunch so I can go to the local McDonald's for a number 3 with a  root beer or Dominick's for a Sushi platter and a slice of pizza.  My dad ate my lunch last night.  I was pretty bummed this morning about that.    On other news.  What about the next Ben Stiller movie titled "Meet The Fockers"?  Even though the first installment was kinda stupid, it was still very entertaining.  Now they bring in another big star to play the role of Gaylord's parents in Dustin Hoffman.  I don't know how that will go because he is a pretty serious actor.  It would be a nice change to see him play something outside of his role (kinda like what Robin Williams did in Death to Smoochy, very different from his normal comedic or good for the family oriented roles).  I do agree with  urlLink this  article that Ben's real parents should play the roles.  Not exactly sure who Anne Meara is but I do know Jerry Stiller and George's dad in Seinfeld.  that would be perfect!  In any event, I'm sure Dustin Hoffman will be a good job and play the role pretty well and I do look forward to watching the movie.  I just hope that it can be a good sequel to a funny movie.  Yeah Ted, I really couldn't care less if Friends went off the air.  I think I watched it for a total of 7 episodes.  There was really nothing else to watch for the last two times I did see it.  I did like to watch it when it was still in it's early days.  Right now though, I don't think I could even give two shits if it stayed on air or not.  It's definitely past it's "use by date"

      Rough as hell.  Although I must admit that I did get up from bed with a sense of purpose today energized and ready to go take care of business at work.  I was in the middle of locating this fucking port last week when I realized that it was time to leave.  I knew this coming into the week and I was actually excited to go back to work and work on the bigger pieces of the pie.  I got to work and worked through the mundane requests that people had me do and deliver my normal reports to the sales supervisor so that she can do her job.  I then decide to go back and locate that damn port from last week.  I spent an hour and a half looking for that thing in my wiring closet and finally I found the fucking thing.  It was very rewarding that hard work pays off.  My good feeling was short lived because I then tested the cable and it had some fucking wire that were shorting out (probably because during the pull, it scraped of a piece of metal and pretty much was damaged goods) so I had to talk to Greg Y. and he helped me out with a plan to use the pairs that weren't being used and "swap" them out to just make it work and not make maintenance pull a single cable (it takes a long time for that shit).  So we did but by the time that I had it all figured out.  It was time to build a box for our new engineer so that AUTOCAD 2004 will work on the damn thing.  So I did that shit for a while and now my backups are taking too damn long and I have to stay here at work for a little while longer.  Oh well, it isn't too bad.  I get to listen to my ghetto music and get caught up in what has happened during the day while waiting for stuff to finish.  I then check my yahoo email for new mail because for some reason I was expecting and email from a certain someone.  I really don't check my regular mail since people I know usually email me at my work email or sprint email.  Low and behold there it was.  The email I was eerily expecting.  Now I said that I was feeling better and all that shit last night and I was, but I wasn't -completely- feeling better.  With that said, I think I will go play some Top Spin tennis at Derek's house and have a couple of brewski's while I'm at it.  As I wait for the last tape to be dismounted in the backup server, I gather the tapes that need to go in so that I can check them in and get myself checked out of work.  Yeah this was really just me rambling for a little while.  I felt like I had to talk to someone but at the same time I didn't want them to say anything.  Just venting you know?  That's it for now.

      So I was on my way to work today and heard something about having the choice of selecting your child's gender on morning talk radio (KISS FM 103.5).  Would you do it?  There are supposedly three different techniques with varying success rates and the price that corresponds with each.  Ultimately the "best" technique has a 97% effective and costs in the neighborhood of $15,000-$20,000.  This sounds all nice a gravy for that family on the other side of the street that has had five boys when all they wanted was 2 boys and a girl but they kept trying and trying.  It's also bad because in places like India since they would much rather have a boy.  The expectant mothers would actually go to get an ultrasound as early as possible to find out if their child will have the "preferred" gender, if not, they would go abort the baby.  Now I have a pro-choice stance with the abortion topic but if you're going to choose to kill a child because they aren't males then that's some bullshit.  I can understand if there is a child conceived under severe circumstances (i.e. incest, rape, or you find out that the baby will grow up with a severe disorder etc.) abortion seems like an option.  But if you're just going to kill the baby because of preference, then that is some bull shit right there.  If everyone had a preference of males in their future children, their whole country would be pretty fucked up with just all males.  They would have to import in women to reproduce right (scary thought)?  Another issue with this is as with any new technology, it always starts out expensive.  Right now there are no regulations or a regulatory body to prevent the "abuse" because a majority of the population cannot afford it so there is no need to keep a watchful eye over it.  As costs continue to drop and success rate is getting closer to 100%, what regulations can be put in place to preserve nature's balance?  I do realize that there are different factors that affect the gender of a child and couples can try to influence that but ultimately shouldn't we leave this to nature?  I think this is something that should be left alone.  You have to deal with what you get and roll with the punches (pretty much take what life gives you, shit happens deal with it type thing).  What do you think?

      Well I am now back.  After this extreme bout of being a little bitch constantly whining and complaining and just really being a fucking little biatch about shit that just happened I am now done with it and it's definitely time to move on.  Fine fine it was time to move on a long time ago but I took my time and am now feeling better.  So anyways, I just want my fucking car back.  I miss my baby.  She was so new and full of promise and some little punk-ass HS drop out fucks up her oil change rendering her pretty much dead.  I was contacted last week by the service manager who said that they will be replacing the engine and they got their top mechanic working on the damn thing.  Yeah I hope so.  I will for sure be asking for all the warranty papers and shit like that and will always be bringing my car to that damn dealership so that if things like this happen again, I got my ass covered.  I can't wait to rev her up to 7g's hearing that high pitch sound that she makes and just driving her hard, stretching her legs.  Oooo.  I can't wait any longer.  So I am not sure if everyone knows but January 22nd marked the beginning of the Chinese New Year.  Hell yeah!  My fucking year baby!  It's the year of the Monkey.  See I'm not one of those retards that believe in astrology and crap like that but it was definitely fun to read and think about what it has to say.  Here are a few excerpts from a few websites that I plagarized.   Forecast for the year:  The year of the Monkey will be a fast-paced year, where nothing is straightforward.  You will enjoy the year if you enjoy a fast pace and are risk-taker, however, it will be a trying year for those that prefer a slower tempo. It is a time to give way to your imagination. This is a great year for business with communication being very important. The Monkey year will bring new and unusual ideas. Keep alert!   what is   urlLink this  ???  This sounded good too!!!  If you have been thinking about making a major move, this is the year to do it. It will be a lucky year for those who are willing to work hard. In the love and romance department, love abounds for monkeys this year as many romantic opportunities will arise.    Really?!?!?!  Hmm, looks promising.....I hope   Oooo what about   urlLink this  ...hmmm.....I gotta find my   Rat 90%  Tiger 81% Dragon 82% Monkey 85% Pig 81%    urlLink Wow   what the hell is this?  Well enough of this shit now...Who am I kidding...  People born in the Year of the Monkey are the erratic geniuses of the cycle. Clever, skillful, and flexible, they are remarkably inventive and original and can solve the most difficult problems with ease. There are few fields in which Monkey people wouldn't be successful but they have a disconcerting habit of being too agreeable. They want to do things now, and if they cannot get started immediately, they become discouraged and sometimes leave their projects. Although good at making decisions, they tend to look down on others. Having common sense, Monkey people have a deep desire for knowledge and have excellent memories. Monkey people are strong willed but their anger cools quickly. They are most compatible with the Dragon and Rat.   Man, that was a whole lot of nothing.  Ha!  I swear everything on the Internet is true!!!     Ahh, brand new week, we'll see what the week holds.

      Well I guess that's it huh?  After talking to you, I went and stood outside my basement door for a smoke I was looking for our snow tracks weren't there anymore.  That's when I realized that it was truly done.  Life goes on.  These are the things that I may or may have not told you over the phone.......  Thanks for everything. Thanks for challenging me to think a different way. Thanks for showing me that the little things in mundane routine everyday life are really worth taking note of. Thanks for eliciting feelings that have laid dormant for a while (good to know that they're still there). Thanks for making me appreciate things that I have taken for granted. Thanks for making the time I spent at work more enjoyable because I looked forward to talking to you on the phone. Thanks for making me feel wanted in ways only a woman can *wink wink*. Thanks for showing me that being picky is a good thing. Thanks for everything, again  This experience was most definitely enjoyable as well as educational.  I will always look back at the moments that we shared in person as well as on the phone with fondness and gratitude that I actually learned something here and it was fun.  I hope that things do work out for you and your boyfriend and if it doesn't, I hope that your next will be someone who is good for you as well as you be good for him.  Have a good life and good luck in your future endeavors.    You know where to find me......

      Well, got home, very interesting night.  I was dressed up in my turtle neck and grey dress cargo pants with some nice black dress shoes.  I got to the bar and started drinking with people from work as well as people that I used to hang out with a lot in my younger days (19-20).  That was pretty fun.  I did get sucked into a volleyball game with total strangers though, that was an experience.  I had to take my shoes and my socks off while still in my dress pants and take off my turtle neck.  I was not looking forward to playing a spirited game of volleyball because I knew I was still going out that night.  So I did it anyways.  Played for an hour there and it was a lot of fun.  I was the only guy there playing volleyball with a drink in one hand and a smoke in the other.  Pretty impressive if you ask me.  I was able to hit the damn ball over the net with my foot, my thigh and my head.  I guess it's the soccer player in me that was able to contribute to the team.  The other times that I did play normal were just horrible.  I couldn't get an overhand serve over the net for the life of me so I had to do the underhand sinker serve that was just too perfect.  We got done and I don't even know the score, I think we won.  It just sucked that I got super sweaty and just covered with sand that I really had to clean myself well before going to the next club.  Me and some friends from DeVry then decided to go to Alumni Club in Schaumburg.  That was fun too.  We drank quite quickly to loosen up and then proceeded to cut up the dance floor with some moves.  I was not impressed with any of the dancers that I saw there.  It was retarded.  I was just cringing at the fact that there are people like this that dance like this and their friends encourage them to dance like that.  I have no problems if people actually tried to dance to the beat and try to look good.  That's fine, I can manage with the thought that they are trying their best and not just fucking around.  The other segment of the dance floor was just plain pathetic.  Imagine this girl who was good looking but couldn't dance to the beat/rhythm for shit and at the same time she thought that she was hot shit.  It was just painful.  I would rather see a fat cow try to go with the beat and actually move accordingly to how the music went than watch a smoking hot chick with no sense of rhythm and still dancing not giving a fuck.   UGH!  The place wasn't conducive to conversation either so I couldn't really figure out if these girls were worth talking to or not.  I could easily talk to them and not listen but it just seems so unfulfilled and superficial that I can't do it.  I was even out just to get some booty but my picky ass just wasn't cooperating.  We then left there for some food since it was 2:30 in the morning.  Went to this Mexican place that was open .  Los Tapitos Tapatillos (or something like that)  $5 will get you full with a burrito suizo and a drink.  MMMMM I am still full.  Satiated even.  While there I over heard this one guy sitting next to us and he mentioned his name.  I recognized the name as someone my friend from NOW Foods (who moved to Sweden) talked about.  I mentioned to him that I was his friend's friend and he mentioned that the girl that my friend went to Sweden for was his third cousin.  UGH UGH UGH.  Yeah, then came the jokes and we had the whole place rolling.  Even the off-duty cop was ripping on my buddy that moved away.  It was a lot of fun.  I don't think my friend would have appreciated it but it was still funny as hell.    Left that place and now have been typing for the last 15 mins.  I gotta go to sleep.  I wish that "almost" was here........

      Phase I : Leave pack of smokes in the car (Only allowed to smoke in car or when drinking during the weekend) Amount : 1 pack a week MAX Duration : 3 weeks (end of February)  Phase II : Bum cigs from people (only on weekends when drinking) Amount : varies (depends on if people want to share) Duration : 4 weeks (End of March) *note - hopefully people won't share so that I will be right on track to quit  Phase III : Eat gum when craving Amount : as much as needed Duration : forever hopefully this will lead to no more smoking and a healthier set of lungs *note - Cigars are still permitted only for special occasions  Theoretically I could just quit cold turkey but this has proven difficult as well as unpleasant to other people.  Today I had 4 smokes.  Not bad.  We'll see how this plan holds up.  I will keep track with the blog so I can see for myself that this plan is working.  Chicago Auto Show this weekend.  I just want to sit back down in my Infiniti G35 Sports Coupe and preview what I will be driving in a couple of years, hopefully.  If anything, I just want to spend time with Meghan.  I can't wait.  Well I hope everyone will have a nice weekend.  Cya.

      If a packet hits a pocket on a socket on a port, and the bus is interrupted at a very last resort, and the access of the memory makes your floppy disk abort, then the socket packet pocket has an error to report.

      You know when you haven't done something for a while and you kinda forget how to do it.  Yeah... I'm Still trying to get familiar with my car.  I was beginning to be able to just listen to how she sounded and then I would shift when I lost her.  I could actually feel the power start to decrease as I reached redline so I knew I needed to shift.  I really don't know what the hell I was going for here but whatever.  I have my car back.  Hell Yeah.  It's finally sinking in, I have her.

      Deep Thoughts by Steven Wright  A bus station is where a bus stops. A train station is where a train stops. On my desk, I have a work station...?  If Fed Ex and UPS were to merge, would they call it Fed UP? (what if FedEx, UPS and Emery Worldwide merged = Fed Up Worldwide)?  If quitters never win, and winners never quit, what fool came up with, "Quit while you're ahead?"  Do Lipton employees take coffee breaks?  What hair colour do they put on the driver's licenses of bald people?  I was thinking that women should put pictures of missing husbands on beer cans.  I was thinking about how people seem to read the Bible a whole lot more as they get older, then it dawned on me they were cramming for their finals.  How much deeper would oceans be if sponges didn't live there?  If it's true that we are here to help others, then what exactly are the OTHERS here for?  Clones are people two.  If a man says something in the woods and there are no women there, is he still wrong?  If you can't be kind, at least have the decency to be vague.  Ever wonder what the speed of lightning would be if it didn't zigzag?  Nostalgia isn't what it used to be.  If a person with multiple personalities threatens suicide, is that considered a hostage situation?  If a cow laughed, would milk come out its nose?  I went for a walk last night and my kids asked me how long I'd be gone. I said, "The whole time."  So what's the speed of dark?  Why don't they just make mouse-flavoured cat food?  I just got skylights put in my place. The people who live above me are furious.  Why do they sterilize needles for lethal injections?  Isn't Disney World a people trap operated by a mouse?  Whose cruel idea was it for the word "lisp" to have an "s" in it?  Since light travels faster than sound, isn't that why some people appear bright until you hear them speak?  How come abbreviated is such a long word?  If it's zero degrees outside today and it's supposed to be twice as cold tomorrow, how cold is it going to be?  -------------------------------------------------------------  TEN Best Things To Say When Caught Sleeping At Your Desk  10. "They told me at the blood bank this might happen."  9.  "This is just a 15 minute power-nap like they raved about in the time      management course you sent me to."  8.  "Whew!  Guess I left the top off the tippex.  You probably got here      just in time."  7.  "I wasn't sleeping!  I was meditating on the mission statement and      envisioning a new paradigm."  6.  "I was testing my keyboard for drool resistance."  5.  "I was doing a highly specific Yoga exercise to relieve work-related      stress.  Are you discriminatory toward people who practice Yoga?"  4.  "Blast!  Why did you interrupt me?  I had almost figured out a      solution to our biggest problem."  3.  "The coffee machine is broken."  2.  "Someone must have put decaf in the wrong pot."  AND THE number 1 BEST THING TO SAY IF YOU GET CAUGHT SLEEPING AT YOUR DESK...  1.  ".....in Jesus' name.  Amen."   -----------------------------------------------------------------------  A language instructor was explaining to her class that French nouns, unlike their English counterparts, are grammatically designated as masculine or feminine. Things like "chalk" or "pencil", she described, would have a gender association. For example: House is feminine - "la" maison. In English, of course, words are of neutral gender.  Puzzled, one student raised his hand and asked, "What gender is a computer?"  The teacher wasn't certain which it was, and so divided the class into two groups and asked them to decide if a computer should be masculine or feminine.  One group was comprised of the women in the class, and the other of men. Both groups were asked to give four reasons for their recommendation.  The men decided that computers should definitely be referred to in the feminine gender (la) because:  1. No one but their creator understands their internal logic.  2. The native language they use to communicate with other computers is    incomprehensible to everyone else.  3. Even the smallest mistakes are stored in long-term memory for later     retrieval.  4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending    half your paycheck on accessories for it.  The group of women, however, concluded that computers should be referred to in the masculine (le) gender because:  1. In order to get their attention, you have to turn them on.  2. They have a lot of data but are still clueless.  3. They are supposed to help you solve your problems, but half the time    they ARE the problem.  4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that, if you had waited a    little longer, you could have had a better model.

      Lost in Translation  This is a tough one.  I actually had to "effort" and really think about how each character was feeling to appreciate the movie.  This, as Meghan has aptly put it, is an "art house" movie appealing more to the, as I say it, "artsy fartsy" crowd that and less to viewers that appreciate a good action flick with a good dose of sex or just a stupid comedy about nothing.  I was forewarned that it was going to be a slow movie and it was but it was still good.    It's about two people being "Lost" in their own respective lives.  Bob (Murray) plays an actor who is in Japan to pick up $2 mil for endorsing Santory whiskey while Charlotte (Scarlett) plays the wife of a photographer that is always chasing and ass kissing the celebrities.  The movie pretty much circles around the fact that both of them aren't very happy on where they're at and the love affair that never happened.  It's painfully beautiful.  Older man, career is past it's prime and the younger woman wondering if marrying her husband was the right thing to do.  The see each other around in the hotel (side note:  I've been to Japan and in that country space is limited so space is expensive and that hotel just seemed a little too much) noticing each other wanting to say something but holding back.  They see each other at the bar no real dialogue between the two of them and that what makes it good.  It makes you feel what each character is feeling, the longing for companionship, the disappointment, the connection between the two of them when the camera shows them looking at each other.  It's definitely not about the events but the moments.  The lack of dialogue also makes the movie so human.  It's just so natural and imperfect like real life it really is believable.  There is also one scene with Mt. Fuji as the backdrop and he teed off for a round of golf.  That was beautiful.  It was just perfect.  I also think that the fact that they decided that Japan would be the location was a good choice because this story would be a little harder to make if say it was filmed in an English/predominantly English speaking city.  That made the connection between the two people just that much more special.  I enjoyed the film personally although it was slow and really not your typical movie, I say I like it.  Now if I watched that thing any other time before now I would doubt that there would be anything good coming out of my mouth.  I still feel like I have to watch it again to really notice the little things/nuances that make this movie worth watching.  The best thing about it: the ending.  It's where Bob chases after Charlotte and whispers something in her ear and she fights back tears and smiles and it seems to leave you with a feeling of closure for both as they return to their own lives as they both walk away from each other.  Also because it was just so slow, I wouldn't have any qualms about the slowness but since I had to get up in the morning I felt sorta rushed.  It would have been better to watch it on a Saturday afternoon or something.  It was so human and very focused on the feelings it was a nice change of pace from the run of the mill, event driven movies that are always out.  So if you are feeling "art house-y" I recommend watching this flick.  This isn't your typical movie, there you were warned.  It was a good talk we had.  Thanks!

      Well Ray Underwood, General Service Manager of Lisle Honda just called me and explained that they had to wait for a part to be shipped from Japan because the tech insisted so it took a while.  He said that the engine was better than new, although I think it's just a line, it's good to know that it has a warranty added to the factory so everything is cool.  They're just going to put new oil in, start it up let it run for a while, take it to the detail shop have her all clean and we're ready to rock and roll!  Hell yeah!  I get my dildo shifter back tomorrow!

       urlLink This  is fucking scary.  I live 5 minutes away from fucking Fermi Lab.  If a kid and other users were able to break in, what else could have been compromised?  Well I guess if you guys ever see on the news that Fermi Lab just blew up it was nice knowing ya.  You know the former Network Manager of that place, Roger Fahnstock, was the one who taught me Novell Networks at DeVry.  I am not sure where he went but I guess they're pretty clueless without him at the helm.

      Definitely a good start for the Monday with Meghan being here.  Thanks!    So today work was alright, definitely not boring.  From RMA-ing a bad switch, replacing a thin client, installing software to catching up on some  urlLink IT news   Lotsa small things to do but finally was able to finish them.  Tuesday holds more excitement at work, YEAH!  Will be renting Lost in Translation for Tuesday night's movie viewing.  Got a couple of recommendations and apparently I've been living under a rock because I have never heard of the damn movie and it's got 4 nominations for that gold statue they award people for doing a good job in film.  I dunno.  I guess that's really it.  Tis was a good weekend.  Left the XBOX at Jerry's since it'll get a little more action plus it's a nice house warming "rental" for the time being.  I still gotta finish KOTOR and apparently I have to get on every magazine cover for NFSU.  Started playing Halo again.  Last thing I have heard about that game is that it's not going to be released till fucking Christmas (at least that's what GI said).  Man that sucks!  So along with Half Life 2, both these games better be fucking UNREAL.  Call of Duty should also be ported over to the XBOX.  I especially enjoy it when someone gets killed, there's a replay from the person that killed you point of view so that you can tell if they were cheating or cherry picking or what not.  It really evens it out so even the best locations are going to be discovered since they're being replayed to the person who died.  Everyone has to keep moving, there's no ultimate hiding spot.  (YAWN) time for bed, long day tomorrow.  Gotta make up hours missed at work.  Have a good one.

      Meghan was in town.  We had a bet....I'm never going to be on anything like that again, that was stupid....I lost but I actually won because my team was the Pats.  She got in around 9:30 Saturday night.  Went to the store to pick up girly drinks and proceeded to go to Jerry's new apartment.  It was definitely a bachelor's pad.  Old furniture and a big TV.  Yeah, it was great.  Interesting neighborhood too!  Lisle isn't really known for the being ghetto but there was a bunch of ghettoness standing outside in the apartment complex entrance and about 9 Lisle Police Department squad cars.  Yeah it was scary.  Brought along the XBOX but didn't play that till after the Bulls squandered a 15 point lead to the Trail Blazers.  That was a pathetic display of basketball teamwork.  It was really sad.  So while that was going on we played ASSHOLE (the drinking game).  It's always interesting to see that the rules to the game change depending on where you are.  For example when I played at Kappa Sigma, President would always get the Asshole's 2 best cards (including the 2).  Here in Illinois, they never do that.  They just keep playing.  They also don't play with two decks if there are more than 5 people playing.  It was still fun.  Got Meghan some food.  Man that girl can eat.  Double quarter pounder w/ cheese from McDonalds and she put it away like it was nothing.  I was impressed.  Finally got tired and decided to go home.  She told me something at home that I will not forget.  Next day, Superbowl Sunday.  Got up around 2 or something I don't even know.  Ate breakfast cereal, rice, eggs and ham.  It was nice to wake up next to her in the morning.  With the messy hair and the sleepy look.  It was great!  I definitely think I can get used to that.    Went and shoveled some snow as she did her ECON homework and then she practiced her Kanji.  She talked to my dad about golf.  I had no idea.  Took our showers and went to this Japanese supermarket thing right where my old work used to be.  It was fun.  I think that's an understatement for her though.  ;-)  We then went to Derek's house for his Superbowl party.  That was cool.  The guacamole was insanely good and then they put some chopped jalapeno's with it and a little bit of lime.  OOOOO it was real good.  I made some burgers, they were man burgers.  It was just too good.  A lot of black pepper powder, good amount of garlic salt and a little more regular salt topped off with an egg to make it stick together.  Juicy meaty.  mmm, could be better but it was good enough for making it in 3 minutes.  Game was tight, very close, exciting.  Scary because of the bet.  Glad you changed your mind.  Told her not to leave.  Snow coming, she stayed, snow didn't come.  Monday, stomach not feeling well.  Want to purge myself before going to work.  Had cereal, rice, eggs and ham again.  Showered and took her to the gas station to gas up for the trip.  I was sad.  went to work and there was a heap of stuff to do.  Got a little break and type this out.  Hope everyone is having a great day.  Peace out!   Game - Panthers Vs. Patriots Line - Pats by 7 Score - 32-29 Pats

      Well, I really don't know what is next.  There has been a little drought in my video game playing since I let Jerry borrow my XBOX.  I think I will take it back sometime this weekend.  Today has been a very frustrating day.  You know when you still live at home (i.e. ME) and there's all this shit that your parents want you to do or ask you to do and they're just being parents it's fucking annoying.  And when they send you bitching emails to your corporate account, yeah, that's fucking retarded.  I need to get the hell out of my house.  I need that raise to be significant enough to allow me to get out.  Fuck the bullshit, period.  Then at work today, there's this one person that kept fucking bothering me for piddly little things everyday since last year.  I mean I dread seeing the guy in the halls because I fear that I might just snap and punch him in the ear.  I seriously feel like I want to land a nice right hook into this guy's face.  I'm sure he's a nice guy and shit but for real, I don't understand how this guy could reproduce.  Who could stand this guy long enough for him to ....UGH...Nevermind.  Bad visual.  Yeah I don't like the guy.  And the beer at north beach was a little shitty, it was shitty last night and I was shitty (literally) this morning till after lunch.  UGH!  Speaking of which.  Yeah I got my car back right?  And my darts were in there.  I finally brought them out last night and it was complete and utter domination.  Now I know that I'm confident about a number of things but I know that I am good at darts, that's a fact.  It was just insane beat downs that me and Jerry brought to Mark, Dave, John and Chris.  Lopsided wins with them having no chance to win it at all.  We won the first 7 games easily.  Average 2.7 - 3.5 marks per round.  Yeah that's not bad.  The score was also pretty bad it ranged from 120 - 0 to 450 - 119 or something like that.  Yeah I was on, except for the white knight I didn't get that.  We did lose 1 game.  This one guy got hot, opened with a white knight and just tore the game open right there.  It was bad.  I was able to get the score pretty close around the 7th round but he hit 3 triple 18s and just slammed the door shut for a possible comeback.  UGH, we came back the next game and whooped them though.  So record for last night was 8W 1L.  The only people that could quite possibly beat me 1 on 1 are Sam and Derek.  Sam still owes me like $45 coz he lost that many times against me.  Pay up BIATCH.  He won few but not enough to clean the slate.  When Derek is hot he's hot for the whole night.  It's hard to beat him.   he doesn't even play anymore so I think I could drive his dart game to ground and tell him "You Just Got Served!" like that dance movie that's out now of whatever.  Tonight will probably comprise of drinking while playing XBOX then hitting up the bar to watch a band later while playing darts, again.  602 I think has some sort of drink special on Fridays, I believe that it's $2 you call it's.  In any event, that should prove to be entertaining.  Tomorrow is back at North Beach.  There's a free party under the name Mark Mesa.  Anything free is always good.  Hang out there for a while and then possibly go to Alumni Club.  Of course I gotta take my car to the dealership to get it checked out and what not.  Eh.  I'm done.  Time to go.  You - Iwillcallyoulater  Everyone have a wonderful Friday or whatever day that you read this.

      What is love?  I feel the need to explorer this due to discussions last night.  From the  urlLink Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary   Main Entry: love  Function: noun Etymology: Middle English, from Old English lufu; akin to Old High German luba love, Old English lEof dear, Latin lubEre, libEre to please 1 a (1) : strong affection for another arising out of kinship or personal ties   (2) : attraction based on sexual desire : affection and tenderness felt by lovers (3) : affection based on admiration, benevolence, or common interests   b : an assurance of love   2 : warm attachment, enthusiasm, or devotion   3 a : the object of attachment, devotion, or admiration   b (1) : a beloved person : DARLING -- often used as a term of endearment (2) British -- used as an informal term of address 4 a : unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another: as (1) : the fatherly concern of God for humankind (2) : brotherly concern for others b : a person's adoration of God 5 : a god or personification of love 6 : an amorous episode : LOVE AFFAIR 7 : the sexual embrace : COPULATION 8 : a score of zero (as in tennis) 9 capitalized, Christian Science : GOD - at love : holding one's opponent scoreless in tennis - in love : inspired by affection   Sounds so "academic"  It doesn't really define what the hell love is.  More...random thoughts.....  Some attributes that are related to love  Trust: People talk about how they aren't afraid that their significant other would cheat on them, because they trust them. Whether that is a consequence or cause of love, I don't know.  What bout the thought of your significant other meeting someone else?  Is that trust or fear or losing?  Is that a part of love?  Faith: I don't know how related this is to trust, but there seems to be a subtle distinction lurking around someplace. I think that trust is the knowledge that the person you love won't let you down, while faith is trust that the person you love is a good, worthy person.   Devotion: I don't think this is a difficult concept to grasp. I don't think that love (or true friendship, for that matter) can be a selfish state. When you love somebody, you are making a sacrifice. You are abandoning some part of your selfishness and forming a bond with another. If that bond is to be true, you have to give yourself to that person. You can't just live for your own needs and wants any more. The word "devotion" comes from "devote." To devote something to a cause is to allocate resources (time, energy, emotions, money etc) to that cause.  Vulnerability: People who are in love exist in a fragile state. It means exposing one's heart to another.  It truly is a difficult thing to do, that is why We don't do that for everybody, I don't think.  I think that love's vulnerability is related very closely to trust. We are safer revealing embarrassing aspects of our lives to close friends and people we love because we trust those people, and don't expect them to betray our trust -- either unintentionally or otherwise.  RICHARD BERANEK 11/27/96   Love is an intangible, an emotion - yet so much more. To be given freely in large quantity for in doing so, it is returned in even more abundance. Love is of self; for without having such personal concern, love of another is weak and fragile at its very best. Love is a special caring. A concern expressed for another extended beyond self need when necessary. Love is gentle, wishing and doing no harm. The kiss of sunshine, touch of a cloud, expecting nothing in return of that touch. Love is an evolution, ever changing, growing, a learning process for the positive. Love is freedom for each person to be an individual yet allowing integration into a single spirit more powerful than the sum of each. Love is lasting with strength to endure the difficult. A willingness, wanting to overcome, to be ever better and stronger. It is a commitment of hearts, one that can exist forever, even when not together. Love is beautiful from within and between. It is a radiance of light and warmth for all to see.  Love is to be....... given received shared    MARV HUNDLEY 09/21/96  Love is being happy for the other person when they are happy, being sad for the other person when they are sad, being, together in good times and being together in bad times... Love is the source of strength. Love is being honest with yourself at all times, being honest with the other person at all times... telling, listening, respecting the truth and never pretending... Love is the source of reality. Love is an understanding that is so complete that you feel as if you are part of the other person... accepting the other person just the way they are and not trying to change them to be something else...

Love is knowing that the other person will always be with you, missing the other person when they are away but remaining near in heart always... Love is the source of security. Love is knowing the other person has your highest and best interest at heart... Love is the source of all life.   Is feeling important, accepted, wanted, cared about, understood, cherished and everything else that is wonderful and good in the world mean that you are loved?  If you feel the same way for the other person, does that mean you love them?  When you feel loved, everything seems wonderful and beautiful and you feel invigorated.  You are more thoughtful, you're inspired, happy.  Does love cloud your perception of things?  Love is what makes you smile even when you're tired -Terri age 4  It's unfortunate that the word Love has been used so often and in so many contexts that it has become almost meaningless.  Isn't it great to hear it from the heart with the spirit, if you may, of the word is felt.  When you hear the phrase and it is loaded with all the emotions that would take too long to tell someone it feels good.  WIth that said, is saying "I Love You" a cop out?  A time saver?  When is it appropriate to tell someone that you love them?  In the morning before going to work when you tell your loved one "I LOVE YOU" is that meaningful?  What about when there's the two minute phone call, when the couple get off the phone and say "I Love You" do they really mean it?  Is it appropriate?  When you say I LOVE YOU can it mean everything and anything?  Should it?  An all encopassing expression for all nice and wonderfull in the world no matter how insignificant along with the deep emotions that mean -the- world?  Is the phrase that flexible and vesatile or should it be saved only for "special occasions" and only when you really mean it?  Loving is not always easy. Some times it is a bit of work. And most importantly, love is not a feeling, it's not a flutter of the heart, or a light-headedness or any of that. it is a deeply held state of mind.  True love is hard to acheive.  You have to get past the fears rejection, of failure, thoughts that they will run away to another or go back to someone.  I think that love starts out small and it grows to True Love.  That takes some time   Sometimes people "sacrifice" things for love.  Though romantic, this isn't always true.  Sometimes people sacrifice shit just because of guilt.  It's no sacrifice to do anything for someone who's worthy of love. A blood relation or a wedding ring doesn't instantly make them worthy, however. It's an ongoing process of change and discovery. Calls for understanding and like-mindedness. Calls for an appropriate give and take.  There is no sacrifice in love. When acting out from love there can be no loss or gain. Love is a constant. It energy so pure and alive that it obliterates everything else. Love is the highest and most basic reason for existence.  It can be beamed out of your being forever without ever draining the source.  Does Love stop?  As long as you love someone, it isn't going to stop unless they betray your love (trust, faith, devotion, vulnerability etc.).  Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.        1 Corinthians 13:5-7  I don't know where I was going with this.  I guess since it was the topic of discussion last night I couldn't stop thinking about it.  What I said last night still stands.  It hasn't changed.

      Well.  I guess I can like the movie.  It wasn't really all that bad.  I wish I had a better quality bootleg of the damn thing but I can't complain.  In the Matrix code is Green.  In the real world, code is Orange.  I can't think of anything else.  Maybe since he went to go see the source he learned to see "real world code" compared to "matrix code."  Even Smith was orange in his eyes after he downloaded himself into Bain.  (the actor who played Bain did a great job in imitating Hugo Weaving)  I don't understand that either.  How can he download himself onto a brain?  Like Slashdot.com mentioned, there has to be some sort of compatibility issue right?  I don't know.  "It's not a vary big leap from powers in the Matrix to Neo's powers in the real world. All the human bio-electricity flows from the pod fields to the Source, and then it is redistributed back to the Matrix along well-defined channels. The humans plugged into the Matrix then have experiences, from which they have emotions, and their emotional energy flows back to the Source. What I haven't mentioned is the machines. They are parasites on this energy loop between the humans and the Source. We should also notice that Neo's apparently "supernatural" abilities in the real world are strictly limited to affecting machines. He doesn't fly or do kung fu in the real world. The reason for this limitation is that he is merely tapping into the energy loop and...modifying it. Just like in the Matrix, where he modifies the energy loop to defy gravity, etc."   In Reloaded he is driven by Love (i.e. Trinity).  In Revolutions he is made into the savior, Jesus.  He sacrificed his life to save all.  Too bad she died but I think it was necessary so that he wouldn't be distracted from doing what he had to do.  There was also the balancing of the equation.  So there are two variables that are dependent on each other?  (Neo vs. Smith)  As one gets stronger, so does the other?  Mobil Station.  It was the "connection" between the Machine City and the Matrix.  Kinda like Limbo (River Styx)?  Merovingians and Club Hel.  Sereph, the wingless one.  Deal with the Devil.  Oracle's Eyes while eating two eyeball looking olives.

      Wow what a weekend.  Watched Battle Royal with Meghan at her place Friday.  It's a messed up movie.  Fiction of course but it was all in Japanese.  The subs were a little off according to Meghan but it was close enough to get the movie.  It was about a randomly selected class (7th grade I think, if I remember correctly) that was "kidnapped" and put on an abandoned island where they are supposed to kill each other.  Yeah messed up.  I guess the youth in this movie were just a bunch of delinquents and they were chosen at "random" to bet shipped off to the island because it was some sort of government act or something (Battle Royal Act).  Very bloody and cheesily graphic.  I thought it was good but I doubt that your local Blockbuster will be carrying the damn thing.  Saturday was the car show.  Pretty cool.  I saw what I wanted to see.  Meghan was a little lost and intimidated (HA! :-P ) but we got to see a bunch of cars and hang out with Derek and Carmie as well as Vicki and Freddy.  Had some drinks at the place chillin, looking at cars.  Saleen S7 was gorgeous.  Porsches were beatiful and the 2004 S2000 was just sitting there aching to be driven.  They didn't have the top of the line trim for the G35 so I didn't bother sitting in it.  I also liked the 04 Audi S4.  BMW had a sexy red M3 on display.  Acura had a beautifully painted 2004 TL.  It was gray with silver glitter type paint, it's kinda hard to describe.  Body kit and everything.  I would have liked to have taken a bunch of pictures but someone (Meghan) forgot to bring the freakin camera and I wasn't about to use my camera phone.  I didn't get to see the freaking new Mustang though, there were just too many people around it and I really didn't want to deal with them.  Top 5 cars that I want that I can get in the next 5 years 5. BMW 330 Ci 4. Honda S2000 3. Subaru WRX STI 1. Infiniti G35 Coupe 1. Acura TL  Yeah it's a damn tie.  Honda vs. Nissan again  After the car show we drove to go catch the fireworks display that was being held at the corner of Michigan Ave and the Chicago River.  We made it but the damn bus prevented the viewing so, instead, we watched it as a bunch of reflections off the Wrigley Building.  Japan 77 was the next stop.  Good food, highly recommended.  Our chef was little lame because he didn't have the flair that the other chefs had but the food was cooked good.  Vicki graciously let us stay at her place and her dad cooked breakfast for everyone.  It was good.  I was full.  My mother came back from the Philippines and got me a bunch of stuff as well as a bunch of movies.  Meghan ate "chocolate soup" I was impressed she even ate some after I told her what it was.  Crazy chick.  Took her back to EL she did her homework and I watched TV it was nice.  Just hanging out no pressures no nothing.  It felt good.  She got done with homework and we ate and then that's where I leave everyone else at.  Hah!  Oh, well I can say "bonk" ;-)  Anyways at work now, nice drive from EL to work, it got kinda busy around Indiana but everyone was calm, no one had road rage, I was just chillin to the sounds of Ghetto Cowboy by Bone Thungs and some old Goo Goo Dolls, Beatles, the old Cds that I made back in the day.  Yeah...  You - I something you 'n stuff  Have a great day people.

      Yeah, I'm going to go see my little boy this weekend.  That should be fun.  I hope he still remembers me.  It's hard you know?  I guess no one really understand my situation.  I'm not bitching I'm just sharing.  It's hard to accept that your own flesh and blood is living so far away from you and you're not a bigger influence in their life.  You know you want the best for them but at the same time you know that this is best for him because he is surrounded by love and family (by the grand parents, the mother isn't doing shit).  It's bad.  It makes me sad that someday he might not understand what happened.  That is why I cherish the moments that he still knows who I am, he still recognizes me and wants to play and talk to me because I don't know how long it'll last.  I love you Bryce.  Another plus is seeing Sam.  Haven't seen that kid since what, the week after New Year's?  Yeah, that's a little while dawg.  Anxious to see who he met out there.  Might be cool.  I guess there's some sort of party on Saturday.  That could be a good time.  Well I guess that'll be it for a little while there.  I won't be back home till Monday night.  hope you all have a great weekend.  You - love and such, miss you much

      another discussion from last night  I like to watch basketball the best.  Constant dribbling, the interactions between the opposing teams, the defense, the offense, the flashiness, the streetball moves that makes the other player look ridiculous.  It's definitely more entertaining than watching any of the other sports as a whole.  There's always something going on.  Dribbling, the passing, the man-to-man defense, the cuts, the back door screens, the alley-oops, no look passes, behind the back cross-over dribble, the shake-n-bake, the intensity of the defensive player trying to stop the player with the ball, how that person is on the other person like stink on shit, the explosive first step, the dunks, the leaping ability, the eye to eye communication that has to happen, all those things and the possibility of all those things happening make basketball a very entertaining game to watch from start to finish.  the list would go (basketball, baseball, football, golf, soccer, hockey)  I don't understand hockey that is why it's last.  Plus it's on skates, and you can't really explode the way a basketball player can and just blow by the opponent.  I would assume that I could appreciate it better if I knew how it was played but since I don't, I don't.  And that damn icing rule, that is just retarded, it stops the flow of the play.  yeah it's hard to catch a "transition" game in basketball to be played the whole time and there are fouls that do interrupt the flow of the game but it's still exciting.  I do like how the fighting is allowed and people just beat the shit out of each other, that seems fun to watch.  I like to play basketball and soccer but if I was by myself, Golf is great, it's just you VS. you and that could be intense.  I think that everyone wants to bether themselves and there's no other competition that you need except your self.  You always want to beat that great game that you had and beat that and no one depends on you and you don't depend on any one.  you are in control and that's fun.  How's that for not too serious?

      So things were a little shakey the other night but now things are a lot better. You - Thanks baby.  I miss you.  Now to other news.  Hell Yeah the  urlLink Cubs  and  urlLink Greg Maddux  have agreed on terms for a contract that will bring Greg back home to Chicago where he started his big league career.  This just means that the Cubs rotation is looking like the best in all of MLB.  Sure there's still offense but it's pitching that wins games.  Opening day rotation would look like this.  Mark Prior, Kerry Wood, Greg Maddux, Carlos Zambrano, Matt Clement.  The highest ERA of all those pitchers belongs to Zambrano with a 4.11 ERA.  That's not great but it's good enough to be the number 4 starter.  With Patterson back and Derek Lee added to the mix, with Sosa and Alou still hitting with the rest of the role player line up, this is a good looking team that figures to be playing in October.  I can't wait.  Chicago will be buzzing NL Champs if not the World Series.  Oh yeah!  This just makes me want to go get some summer time food.  Imagine this, it's 85 out, on a Saturday in Chicago.  The sun is out but there is a gentle breeze that makes the weather enjoyable.  You are walking down Clark coming from a brunch to go watch the Cubbies.  You walk up to the entrance to Wrigley Field on the Clark Side (in front of the Cubbie Bear) and look up at the marquee " urlLink Wrigley Field, Home of the Chicago Cubs "  You watch all the people walk around with smiles on their faces carrying food and beer looking for their seats.  You walk up the stairs and see the Ivy that is growing on the outfield wall, then you see the green grass, then you see the in field and then the pitchers mound.  You make you way to your seats on the first base side 15 rows back.  You are close enough to see their numbers and somewhat makeout their faces.  You sit down and take in the sun.  You look around and see all the people.  You feel the electricity that you only get when you put a old building with a lot of people out to have a good time.  It's fun.  Ahh, late March, season opener.  162 games till the playoffs.  Go Cubbies.  In other baseball news,  urlLink A-ROD (Alex Rodriguez)  has been traded to the  urlLink New York Yankees .  The best player in baseball is now playing on the biggest stage and the most storied franchise in all of sports.  I guess it was inevitable after New York saw Boston trying to get A-ROD, the Yanks had to make sure that this deal won't have the possibility of happening again.  I think this is terrible for baseball.  It just shows how the rich get richer and the small market clubs don't have a chance in hell to land players like that.  Their payroll is approaching $200 Million and that's unheard of compared to say the Cubs who only have a $60-70 Million payroll.  That is insane.  4 Yanks have $100 Million or more contracts.  So tonight, I might wander over to the local Blockbuster and rent ESPN Baseball or Crimson Skies have a few beers.  ESPN Baseball is thought to be the best of the crop so far this year.  I also like how if you do have XBOX Live, the games automatically update the roster accordingly.  That is badass.  It's too bad that the next XBOX has no harddrive so this sort of functionality will not be available.  Well that's it for now.  You - Good luck with your exams sweetie.  I'll call you later

      Well, it's Thursday again!  HELL FUCKING YEAH!  Tomorrow I get to visit my sweetie in EL.  That should be fun.  Then Saturday we get to go to St. Joe's for dinner and a movie with the Pokorskis.  Haven't seen them for quite a while either.  Ahh, North Beach.  Home to the $3 pitchers and darts.  Good times.  Gotta do laundry tonight to have clean clothes for the weekend and then go out for a little while to whoop ass in darts.  Ain't no one around that can step up yet.  Maybe that will change tonight.  I got a few things to do tomorrow so that should keep me busy.  I have this one request to move a person upstairs, set their phone up and their terminal and then move the other guy to where this guy moved from as well as bringing his phone over with his monitor.  Then after a month, they're going to move back to their old spots.  What the fuck is that shit?  Can't they just stay there since they're going to be there for just a month?  Whatever.  Well better go home and start the laundry.  No time after this.

       urlLink This  is a list of the Top 20 Boom Towns that will benefit the most from the rebounding of the economy (according to Business 2.0)  Personally I would like to live somewhere that isn't too damn cold and somewhere in the Left Coast.  Top pick would be Seattle, WA but the growth prospects for the particular IT niche that I belong to is not that great there.  If anything San Jose, CA would be a great number 2 (along with anything in CA; Sacramento, San Francisco-Oakland, San Diego) but I would pick San Jose just because it seems to pay better than the rest of the CA cities.  I wouldn't want to live anywhere that had snow.  It's just aggravating to drive in it to clear your car of it, your drive way.  It's something that I can do without.  Seattle isn't too hot, isn't too cold.  It's got a coast, mountains, forests, it's a growing city.  I think that is the biggest allure for moving there.  Take for example Chicago.  It's an old city.  It's established, not much more room for growth.  I want to be able to grow with a city, that's exciting.

With that one guy doing a rendition of Madonna's "Like a Virgin" vs. Hung's rendition os Ricky Martin's "She Bangs"  Now that's quality TV, well atleast it's a step above the cattle auctioning that we watched at Ted's house

Projekt Revolution 2004 is set to start July 23rd and it's going to play till Sept 8th I think.  Man, that's already a great show with just those three bands but add Incubus in there and SHIIIIITTT!  That's a fucking concert to see.

      Bryce's birthday  Yeah it was cool.  Got there around 5 Bryce was already up and playing.  He had already opened presents from his grand parents (whom, oddly enough, he calls Mama and Papa.  Yeah...) and from Jenny.  I got there and we started playing with his "track."  It was cute.  He has a billion different  urlLink Hot Wheels   which was cool.  I got him a bunch of the tuner models to put a little flavor into it.  We then played with his fire engine with the ladder that went up and down.  He liked that a lot.  The he wanted to get tossed in the air and then caught.  He would get a running start and run towards me at full tilt and I would catch him and toss him in the air and catch him close to the ground so that he would have a little longer "falling" feeling.  He got a lot of laughs with that.  I was getting tired though.  He's getting big.  Jenny got him a cute little robe.  Just right for him and it will probably last him a year or so.  He got a nice little updated version of the Radio Flyer tricycle but it was branded Hot Wheels.  It was cool.  It even had shocks for the seat.  Fancy schmansy little thing.  He also got this Simba doll that talked back to you and -tried- to have a conversation.  It would ask "what do you want to be when you grow up?" I would say "I want to be a pimp (or something retarded like that) it would say back "That's a great idea!"  Yeah but it was cool, if you squeezed it's ears it would sing and dance (wag it's tail and shake it's head), I guess that is dancing for dolls.  So it was time for him to open my present.  It was nothing really big and I cheated by having him pick it out at the store the day before.  It was this car that would go forward and then backwards back to where it started and it also had a couple of songs that he liked and calls "noise"  He played with that for a long time.  The battery was almost dying when I left to go back home.  It was cute.  I feel bad for the other gifts but hey, "I'm really sorry."  It was awesome, other people would come and he would open those gifts, play with them for 5 minutes and go back to playing with the car.  It was gratifying to see that.    He still knows who I am.  I walked to the car when he and his Gramma got back from a quick errand and he stepped out of the car and looked at me and said "Daddy!"  That just made me smile.  He still knew me.   Sam in Iowa  Sam is still Sam.  Got to his house Saturday.  Dicked around for a little while drank a few beers (the other case that was there) and played some video games.  Met his friend Moe.  He's cool.  Seems like a good kid.  We waited for a call from some people to go to a party.  It was more of a hangout/get together.  It was still fun.  One of the favorite characters there was this girl named Danielle.  Her nickname was Cum Shot.  Yeah, that was messed up.  Went to the basement and there was a lot of country being played it was painful.  Drank more beer there.  I think this was where we started on the other case.  Oh yeah, why the hell does Iowa like Bud Lite?  UGH!!!!  I, myself am more of a Orange Whip (Miller Lite) drinker.  Eh whatever.  It was there I drank and enjoyed nonetheless.  It did give me gas though.  Bad gas.  Maybe it was caused by the easy bake thing.  I dunno.  We went to Hy-Vee for some breakfast.  Eggs, bacon, sausage.  It was good.  Spicy sausage with barbecue sauce on top.  Mmmm.  It was good.  Oh yeah I also busted out the video camera and filmed what we did on Sunday night.  It was bad.  We were real bored.  We tried to do a little Photoshop Tennis (as Meghan put it) but it was more of a collective effort.  We altered a picture of this girl and had fun doing it.  We then started playing Super Mario Brothers (the first one) on his PC.  It was cool except the controls were a little difficult to get used to.  I then had the "great" idea of mapping the buttons accordingly so that when I held the keyboard up it would seem that I was holding a regular controller.  That made things easier for Mario 1 as well as Street Fighter.  Then this chick came over.  Big girl, she was also a little pissy at the world.  Anyways, she got there stood up for a while and then proceeded to lay down on Sam's bed and fall asleep there.  Yeah, apparently this is a regular occurrence whenever she comes over and he has to boot her ass at 5:30 in the morning.  Bummer, not my problem.   Now for me to be cheesy.  I was actually thinking of you on my way up to Waterloo Monday thinking if I should call you or not.  I didn't have signal so I couldn't.  When I finally got signal I was surprised to see that I had a voicemail.  I was thinking it was from Jenny seeing where the hell I was and why I was late, but it was from you.  That put a smile on my face.  Thanks for calling.  I missed you.  I got pretty tired from last night's "talks" myself and had a nice sleep.  Thanks for talking to me during my lonely drive.  It prevented me from getting bored and falling asleep at the wheel.  3 Days sweetie.

      Apperently, the other layout was a little hard to read.  How's this one?  I really don't know, it seems easier I guess.  Readers don't have to work to read the thing.  What do you think.  Going to North Beach tonight, I guess that is the starndard for Saturday nights if there is nothing to do.  Free party again so it's a hit or miss on the quality of females that will be present at the bar.  We'll see how it goes.  Man, it's hard to look at fucking code all day.  I really don't know how people do it for 8 hours every damn day (even more!).

      North Beach was alright last night.  Well actually it was pretty lame.  I don't know if it was the weather or whatever but there were a lot of cuteis, hotties and whores last night but it was just blah.  I think I drank too much too fast so I had to go home before I got in "trouble" driving.  We tried to get John laid but it just wasn't working.  Actually we couldn't even get started because there was no cooperation from John.  See the act was that I was a foreign exchange student that lived with his family in Vienna, Austria.  The only snag was that he couldn't pull off the German accent.  Oh well, there's always another day.  Wow it is windy as fuck today.  Good thing there's no wind chill factor.  Supposedly it will be snowing late Sunday night/early Monday morning here.  I hope that it's not going to be enough that it will accumulate.  I have never actually driven my damn car in the snow so I'm kinda anxious to see how it drives.  Yeah, new look here.  I think it will change later.  We'll see.  I miss you sweetie.  Thanks for calling last night, I really appreciated that.

      Yeah so I was looking around and found some shit regarding templates and liked this one the best.  little changes here and there but nothing big.  I guess the other template was a little boring so something new was needed.  again I just wanted to say thanks to  urlLink NYOKIGLITTER  pretty cool stuff.  So now it's time to go to Jerry's and play some XBOX.  North Beach is next with drinking, darts and dancing.  Hmmm, Triple D's, alrighty.  I need a beer.  I can't look at code that long.  Yeah I am retarded.

      My company has a fucking decor committee.  Our department got written up for having toys on our desks.  I mean I have a little "streeted out" Civic Si from hot wheels and a Gonzo pencil/pen top.  My boss has a few things from McDonalds but that's about it.  Doesn't this person have anything else to do?  I mean really.  This person didn't even do this sort of stuff last year!!!  Why now?  Is this a every other year thing?  Favoritism also plays a role.  There are certain individuals that play the dirty game of "office politics" and it's just ridiculous that they get away with shit that other people can't get away with.  Whatever I guess, it's always going to be there.  On a lighter note, there are two auditors that are sitting in the office behind me.  I guess they're alright looking.  One is tall and definitely bigger than me, I'm afraid of her.  She's got brown hair, wavy down a little below her shoulder line, about 6'0 to 6'1.  Looks like she used to maybe play basketball so she looks somewhat buff.  Yeah still afraid of her.  The other one has a nice booty but the face is alright.  Brown hair, wavy as well down to about her shoulders, about 5'8 with a skinny but nice hour-glass figure.  Yeah, nothing special but it's somewhat of an infusion of women that are "do-able" into the building I suppose.  A bunch of stuff has happened already today.  One of our servers keeps fucking up people's profiles and won't let them log in so I got a few issues regarding that.  A printer has been temperamental.  That's always a fun time.  If fun meant not fun.  Yeah, that was dumb.  I can't wait to see Meghan again.  I miss you sweetie.

      looks like today will just be filled with little tidbits about nothing  have you ever met a person with a lazy eye?  you know when you talk to someone and it's eye to eye?  how do you talk to someone with a lazy eye? or even worse, have two lazy eyes.  there's a person at work that I know has one lazy eye.  I think I know which one is the "good" one but I find myself, when I am talking to him, looking at the "other" eye.  Is that bad?  I don't know

      So played NBA Live 2004.  Whooped ass!  Left Jerry's apartment and immediately I felt that craving again.  As I walked outside in the clean spring-ish air I felt the need to light one up and breath in smoke.  I then got inside the car and the craving subsided but came right back as I started to drive back to my house.  Was so tempted to go stop by the gas station and buy a pack but decided to stick with the plan.  I got home and called my sweetie.  She was doing homework, didn't talk much.  Still felt the need to smoke.  Going to bed soon.  Hopefully this craving will not keep me from sleeping.  It is now 12:01 March 3, 2004

      I feel frantic, I feel agitated, I feel pissed off  Do you ever feel like something is tugging at you lighty and it gets stronger and stronger and it becomes unbearable  What about the feeling of being restless, like you can't stop doing anything but yet you are doing nothing  How about the feeling of wanting something, how your mouth waters, how your muscles can't seem to relax, your head is going a million miles an hour, you are so restless that you notice every little sound that you hear  Damn I need a smoke!  7:18 PM CST  I think a little video gaming would be good.  Relax, beat the shit out of people.    You - I haven't talk to you at all today.  Seems like you had a busy day.  I don't know what to expect when I call you tonight.   7:20 PM CST

      Yeah Yesterday was a dull day all around.  Work was just boring.  It was just going through the motions and just being there.  The weather was also shitty.  Went home watched some TV and went to bed early, I mean early; like 10:30 - 11 pm or something ridiculous like that.  I guess it's for the better since I had to be at work early today so I can leave early to go on my date with the FBI.  Eh, that should be interesting.  This should be it in terms of naturalization.  I can now get an American passport and go wherever the fuck I want.  No more Visas to deal with no more going to various embassies etc.  Just go to the airport and fly out.  Now that I am looking forward to.  I remember the last time that me and my family had to take a trip out of the country, we went all over western Europe and we had to go get this Shengen Visa so that we could travel all over the place.  It was such a hassle but those days are over.  Hell Yeah.  In other news.  I told my parents that I plan on moving out at the end of the month and they really didn't give a shit.  Yeah, it's great.  Maybe they just need some time to digest what I said but overall, last night when I told them there was no response be it yay or nay.  Strange, I thought they would be at least somewhat leaning towards the yay but there really was no clear cut reaction to what I said.  Maybe today I will get an email from the matriarch telling me that I shouldn't do it or that I should I don't know.  Whatever I guess.  So today just slowed down to the pace of a snail trying to climb up the side of a fish tank.  Yeah that slow.  I got here and things were already in the swing of things but then, screeeeecchhhh... Everything came to a halt.  I don't know what it is.  I also feel the need to light one up.  I try to keep myself busy but shit, this is hard.  I am at the bumming phase and it makes me feel "sub-human" (you like that crab cake?) to bum from people all the time.  Maybe pride will win out, let's hope so, I think so.  After that I see myself battling the gaining weight problem that comes with quitting smoking.  At least it's getting warm out so I can do something about it.  Jerry is getting ready for me to move in.  Clearing shit from my tiny ass room.  Good thing I don't need a lot of shit.  I just need my futon, TV, TV stand, computer speakers, laptop, computer table, dresser and closet (with my clothes).  Little things I will just slowly get from the parents house.  Jerry also bought NBA Live 2004 and another controller.  There are three controllers for my XBOX now.  3.  That should include some nice HALO multiplayer as well as sports multiplayer action....and future games, oooo....Splinter Cell : Pandora Tomorrow or something like that.  That's going to be just badass to play.  Play as a spy and your perspective is 3rd person with good stealth and limited weapons.  Play as the mercs and you get 1st person perspective with a lot of weapons.  That's an interesting twist to something old.  Curious to see how that one plays.  Yeah interesting day so far this is.....

      Alrighty!  So the drive back was fun.  It started raining around the outskirts of East Lansing/Lansing.  Nothing spectacular just a steady light rain coming down.  It wasn't enough to slow me down and make me late today but it was definitely enough to keep me awake.  I hate how when you're driving behind a big ass huge semi and the splash guards aren't working.  It really hinders your driving vision.  Oh well I'm still alive and kicking.  There was only a section of the trip that was a traffic jam.  It was where 294 splits from 94 but after that it was smooth sailing.  I think I left around 5:20 Central time and got to work at 9 AM.  I dawdled around looking for a smoke to bum because I didn't have any for the whole trip.  I also didn't buy any to follow my little plan.  We'll see how this works.  So Friday drive was fun.  I really could have made it in about 3 hours 15 minutes.  Oh well, traffic in Chicago at 6:30 pm is BRUTAL but I finally made it to the Skyway.  That was fun.  Every 1/4 mile there's a turn around for the cops but everyone else was doing 85/90 so it was great.  Pretty much got from Chicago to MI in about an hour and from the border to EL was about 2 hours.  The damn traffic to get downtown was the real bummer there.  So I finally got to EL and saw Meghan.  That was nice, real nice.  After "catching up" we went to Taco Hell for some grubbage.  Wow, talk about drunk ass punks.  They were all wasted.  Everyone that was eating or just ordering was either blushing or really pale.  It was hard to believe that some time ago me and my friends were once part of that general drunken populous.  It was a whole lotta fun but man, I must've been a real ass.  Hmm...oh well.  So we got food and proceeded back to her place and eat food.  We played Super Mario 3.  I was pathetic.  I couldn't do shit.  I was even frustrated enough to mess up my sweetie's chance for a 5-up so that she wouldn't leave me in the dust but she got me back anyways.  That was a nice Friday.  Saturday.  It was beautiful outside and we got up too early, well I did, I kinda woke her up.  We got up around 10 or so, layette in bed for a couple more hours.  We got up and got cleaned up and headed for a little drive to soak in the sun and warmth.  We drove around campus, and around EL for a little while.  That was fun.  We then went to the mall for some fast food.  Looked at some video games, searched for the Dance Dance Revolution game pad to dismantle and make into the real box thing that have the the arcades.  Found a couple but didn't get the price.  Eh, I'll figure it out so that I can have them for my new apartment for people to try out.  That should be fun.  We went to this one store, King Dollar and found a retarded badminton set.  $1.06, hell yeah!  We played that for a little while until the projectiles that were being hit back and forth finally broke and no more playing outside.  I also found out that Meghan was pretty good with the table tennis paddle.  Her apartment community is really cool.  Free pool, foosball and ping pong along with two full court basketball  courts I think, there's probably tennis somewhere and there's a jacuzzi that was operational (it was outside too).  That was Saturday morning, little afternoon.  She then drove to St. Joes to eat at El Rodeo and watch The Passion.  Food was good.  I guess I was getting loud because of the 46 Ounce margarita for $8.50.  Holy shit they make it a little strong too.  Heard the fart stories, fucking hilarious.  I couldn't belive that Ted farted in the middle of the movie.  I don't even remember what part but I do remember that the people sitting in front of Ted just looked at each other after hearing the fart, started to giggle a little and continued to watch the movie.  I mean their heads just snapped and looked at each other at the wrong point of the movie.  It was also the first time that the cost of a date was shared.  She paid for the movie (insisted on paying for the movie) and I paid for dinner.  We went back to their house and watched more TV (SI Swimsuit show) with Meghan and Ted.  Not much talking about the film, just chillin.  We went to bed around 1.  Hey Teddy, the room is clean.  weren't disrespectful, promise.  And that was the end of the day.  It was kinda sorta, pretty busy I guess.  Sunday.  Got woken up by the dog, Zeeke (is that right?) around 8 or so but we went back to sleep.  Breakfast was served around 10:30-11?  It was good.  Thanks again, good bacon and waffles.  mmm.  Hung out for a little while more and went back to EL.  We stopped by at the Oriental store and bought curry mix and some roasted green peas with wasabe.  We then went to Meijer for by the rest of the dish (beef, bell pepper, onion, carrots) forgot the potatoes and the rice. (Thanks for driving again sweetie).  Showered and went to Pinball Pete's for the Dance Dance Revolution Challenge 2004 part 1.  She kicked my ass hard.  I sucked.  I did get a B in one of the rounds that we played (yeah played 16 or so rounds and I only won 2 of them).  I got super sweaty and I wasn't even wearing a jacket.  Meghan got a little winded so we went for a little walk around the block and bought a slurpee (Thanks!).  We went back to the apartment and chilled and took a nap.  It was a really nice nap on the couch where I completely forgot where I was and didn't care because I had her in my arms.  Woke up around 7 and proceeded to prepare the curry.  Meghan diced up the red peppers and I cut up the onion and carrots and started to saute the meat the onions.  Making dinner together was also nice.  I liked that a lot.  I messed up the rice.  It was a little undercooked but the sauce made up for it.  I wish I had eaten some for breakfast so I wasn't so hungry but I knew if I ate I would've been late, Oh well.  We watched parts of the Academy awards.  It was a nice clean sweep by LOTR:ROTK this year.  Must've been a real bummer for the movies that had to compete against that juggenaught.  Poor Seabiscuit.  Oh well.  Not my problem.  Sophia Coppola also won an Oscar for Lost in Translation.  That was pretty cool to be noticed for your work.  Pretty cool.  Favorite was Chalise Theron and how she looked along with Naomi Watts.  Both pretty pretty ladies.  She finished her homework and we went to bed.  That's it for my weekend.  It was very enjoyable.    urlLink Here  are some pics of the weekend.  I especially like the one where Ted look like he's on the cross infront of that Church Bus thing with a banner hanging in front.  I beliveit's the last pic...maybe

      watching  urlLink porn  in the car  Man, when I finally get my  urlLink Infiniti G35 Coupe  I was going to get a  urlLink DVD/CD/CD-R/MP3 Player  and watch some porn in my long drives to places.  I guess it is illegal in Michigan to watch TV while driving and considering how raunchy the DVD would be, I would probably get a ticket with fines along the same vein as tickets with fines for sex in public.

      Man, I feel like I am back in high school going off to college.  I have only moved to go live by myself once and that was back when I was a freshman at MSU (I guess you can count that as two because I did go back for my sophomore year).  I really don't know what to expect since this is a different setting from when I was in college.  I have a real job now and I didn't have a job when I was in college.  I can buy beer now compared to the very young age of 17 when I first got to college, heck I couldn't even buy smokes!  I will be moving in with people that I know compared to the two different room mates that I had at State.  I have to pay for everything now compared to nothing before.  I guess I need this.  I know that I won't be at my parents forever and I really don't want to be there forever.  It feels like it's time to leave the security of the parents house and be on my own, somewhat.  This is also a great deal, $200 a month plus other stuff that will be split three ways.  That's pretty good.  All in all I think it's going to cost $300 to live there.  That includes rent, utilities and groceries.  My room is small.  It's like the office room of a two bedroom apartment.  Dimensions are 9x12 with no windows.  Instead of a window I have a sliding glass door.  I can pretty much get my little car through the glass door way if the glass doors aren't there.  I really don't have a lock on my door but I'm not worried about that.  I can fit my futon in there as well as my closet.  I can have my own TV in there and it's going to fit in just fine.  I just need a computer table for the laptop and that's probably the only thing I will be buying in terms of furniture for the room.  I don't exactly know what "things" I will be putting up on the walls but I know it can't be bare.  Good thing there are already cooking wear and dishes there as well as their furniture for the apartment.  I got a couple of shelves that we could probably use somewhere in the apartment, just not sure where.  The parental units have given me some linen to start out with so that's cool.  Besides that big furniture stuff I just gotta bring clothes, shoes, old bills, some sort of decoration, computer books, and that's pretty much it.  So in review, I will be bringing my futon, closet, TV stand w/ TV, shelving units, computer, clothes, old bills, decorative elements, linen, bath room stuff, computer books.  I don't know what else to bring.  I also gotta figure out how long it's going to take me to get to work now, I think I might have added an extra 15 minutes to my drive or shaved off 10 minutes depending on which way I would take to work.  Would it be more economical to buy an IPASS and take the expressway or drive around in the burbs for an extra 15 minutes.  I don't know, that's another thing I gotta figure out.  Oh yeah, I gotta change a change of address as well.  Yeah, my room is going to be cozy.  Not huge but it's going to be enough, I figure, there's the damn living room if I wanted to hang chill or something, bedroom would probably be reserved for alone time, sleeping, or "extra curricular" activities.  I suppose since I am living with other people the process of asking for permission to have people sleep over from out of town would have to be addressed if they sleep in the living room.  The food issue I guess is BYO.  Sharing is permitted as long as you ask and replenish what has been depleted.  I will probably be the one who is going to be cooking.  I don't mind as long as they buy the food and shit.  Made plans with Meghan so that she could be down here to help me move.  Parents would probably let me borrow the truck and actually I can bring all the furniture and a lot of little things in one trip.  It should be able to fit in the Expo.  I think I could even move in in one day.  It would take a few hours before and after to take shit out and arrange everything.  It's do-able.   I know there will probably be issues with living with other people but I think it will be quickly resolved since it has been established that any problems should be immediately taken cared of before it becomes a bigger issue.  I like that, it's not girly and catty and bitchy.  Yeah, this should be an experience.  I feel like a little kid standing on the edge of the deep end of the pool wanting to jump in.  Determined but scared at the same time.   Here's the floor plan.  I will be moving into the den.  Not a bad space at all.

      Yeah baby.  I think I would go with the Crystal XBOX.  All the colours look great but I still am leaning to the neutral and flexible Cyrstal version.  I wish that they would also come out with matching controllers.  If I had more money, I would sell my old XBOX and all the controllers and go buy the Crystal Limited Edition XBOX with 4 Crystal S-type controllers.

      Hell Yeah.  I got a good review.  I am glad that some of what I do is actually getting noticed.  From the little shit to the big shit.  I finally have some sort of path to follow in terms of growing out of my position into another one and take even higher level responsibilities.  For a second there I have been thinking that I was just being taken for granted but it's good to know that people do appreciate your work and the work you put into things and return the favor, if I may say so, appropriately.  Recognition is one of the  things that make things worth it for me.  Recognition (per Maslow) is one of the things that is a need for humans.  There are the physiological and safety needs that are already there for me.  Now I find myself in need of higher level needs.  Belonging, Self esteem, and Self Actualization.  I guess the raise falls under the Self esteem umbrella in that it is some form of recognition in my professional life.  It feels good to be recognized and appreciated for what you have done and what you are trying to do.  I think everyone needs that in some shape, way or form as well as enjoys it.  I mean really, who doesn't appreciate a good pat on the shoulder?  I also got my tax return back.  I don't know what the fuck happened to it though.  I deposited the thing and only half of it showed up in my account.  WTF?  The receipt printed the exact amount that I had entered and that was on the damn check but I checked this morning and it's not the same.  I don't know.  Speaking of which, I should call the fucking back to see what the hell is going on.  Anyways, just wanted to share my little victory/achievement to whoever is out there.

      I bought another controller.  I bought the blue s-type.  Halo was fun again.  Four player Halo, you can't beat that.  Well you can but there's only one XBOX around so you gotta make do.  There was shit talking galore when we were playing Halo over the weekend.  We played Team Slayer on one of the larger maps (the one with the snow) and that was fun.  First to 50 TEAM kills wins the whole thing.  It's great when you and your team mate have figured out how to play together.  Someone take point to draw out some of the initial fire and the other person backs the point man up.  It's such a beautiful system.  The first guy has to have some sort of sheild to take a direct sniper rifle shot and the second guy has to be observant enough to pick up on where the shot is coming from.  Yeah there is some form of screen watching here but it doesn't play as huge as role as in Golden Eye.  Once you and your team mate have found some sort of rhythm and keep the players on the other team separated, it's going to be a quick game.  We also played EA Basketball 2004 this weekend.  I suck at that.  I mean I can play it but once the other team gets hot it seems that there is nothing in the world that I can do to cool them off.  I mean Baron Davis scored 60 point me.  He scored 60 on like 15 of 18 from the line.  Now that is absurd.  I guess I better practice on the basketball if I have any aspirations of being as good in basketball as Halo.  Today, I will be getting some of my shit ready so I can start to ship that shit out to the new apartment.  I think I will be leaving a lot of the baby stuff at my parents house.  I will be going through some of my old clothes and shit that I don't think I need and put them in a bag for the Salvation Army.  I gotta get my damn bills into some sort of filing system that will be easy to move out of.  I also gotta make sure to study the closet to make sure I can still take that thing down and hopefully move it out before I move out.  While I am at that might as well take a look at my fouton and see how it goes together.  Yeah I guess there is a lot of shit to do after work today to keep me busy.  I just hope that there is something not boring to do at work you know?

      Have you ever found yourself getting lulled into a state of depression?  You don't even know what the fuck is causing it but you find yourself thinking about all the bad shit that has happened, you find yourself thinking what bad shit is happening and what bad shit could happen.  It's not a very good feeling to be depressed.  You try to reach out but find out that in the end only you can help yourself out.  You truly can't depend on other people because they have their own things to worry about.  I wrote and wrote and wrote last night and I feel better this morning.  I guess I wasn't that depressed last night or I was just starting to get depressed.  Maybe it wasn't even depression.  I just felt out of whack, I felt out of balance.    So it's a brand new week.  March 8, 2003.  Hopefully I am out of my little funk here, we shall see.

      Wow it was high school night last night at North Beach.  Seriously.  There were so many underage girls there it was unbelievable.  I'm sure there were already some that frequented that bar but last night was ridiculous.  Their IDs said that they were 24 but there was no way these bitches were older than me.  Seriously, they looked young, really young.  Not 24 that's for damn sure.  We played ice basketball with one of our bartender's boobs (Sam you might remember, Heather).  She was working the beer tub and that had some ice.  She would throw ice at our table and we would catch it and throw it back at her.  Except she would lean forward exposing her cleavage as some sort of goal and we would try to get it down her chest.  That was fun.  The bouncers wanted to stop us but Heather said that it was alright so we played for a little while more till someone needed to get a damn drink.   urlLink MSU lost last night .  That sucked.  They were up 10 points at one time and I had them going to at least the Elite 8 possibly even the final 4 if they got hot, they could beat the piss out of Kentucky.  Shit they can't even beat Nevada.  They had a fucking lead.  A 10 point lead.  Ah, oh well.  What's over is over.  Can't do anything about it now.  I still have a lot of shit to move over.  Drawers, TV, computer, computer speakers, shoes, coats/jackets/suits, old liquor bottles, bill bin.  The biggest is the chest of drawers.  I can carry it myself so it's not that heavy.  The drawers are already pulled so all I gotta do is put clothes on the drawers and put them with the actual chest.  the TV, laptop, speakers and a big trash bag of shoes.  I definitely can do this all in one trip.  Meghan is coming to town, I'm happy.  She's helping me move.  She didn't have to drive 4 hours to help me move but she is so that's pretty cool.  After moving the rest of my stuff, we're going to Todai (Japanese buffet, good ass hell buffet) and watch  urlLink Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind .  That should be pretty good.  I know tomorrow I gotta do some shopping.  We will be going to the Art Museum tomorrow, it'll be my first time there as well.  That should be fun too.  Mmmm, Todai.  Buffet of everything.  Sushi/rolls and Hot Food.  This will be good.  Although I just had a big breakfast, I am still hungry for some Japanese food.

      I don't understand how people get violent when they're drunk.  Actually it's the punk ass kids that always seem to find themselves in trouble.  St. Patrick's day was yesterday but we didn't manage to get to the bar till about 10 pm.  I was out shopping for shit for the new apartment and just got back sorta late.  Anyways, there was this bar/restaurant that's called The Village.  Nice quaint Irish bar/restaurant.  It was packed.  I saw some kinds from HS there (Zagotta, Kevil, Murray, Kolasinki) and we talked for a little while.  For some apparent reason they remembered me as Gonzalo.  That's nuts because I have never been Gonzalo to anyone.  In HS I was 'Al.'  I took the AL from gonzALo to sound more American since I thought that people would have problems saying my name.  That's why I didn't understand that they'd remember me by my government name.  We talked for a little while and that was cool.  Everyone was having a good time at the bar and then towards the end of the night, I don't know why but people started yelling at people and Jerry's cousin's all of a sudden were up on a bunch of kids faces.  That was just wierd so I tried to ignore the thing because usually things get broken up anyways.  So things got a little bit settled and back to normal for all of 1 minute.  The punk ass kids got kicked out of the bar and we were about ready to go as well.  We got outside and there they were, waiting for us.  So more talking ensued as I stayed to the outside of the confrontation.  I was just wanting to go home but at the same time I was intrigued with the situation.  I was thinking to myself, if a brawl broke out, I wouldn't do anything unless there was some sort of team up against one of my friends.  The ensuing dialogue followed the heated bellowing of threats and obscenities.  Gonzo:*watching about 7 feet from the crowd* Fat Guy (to my group of friends):"Hey man, all I gotta say is that I'm sorry" Fat Guy's girlfriend (to Fat Guy):"Your not fucking sorry" Gonzo:*starts laughing hysterically at the girl's comment* Fat Guy:"You think this is funny man?" Gonzo:*just laughs and shrugs it off not saying a word* Fat Guy:"You're laughing?  You think this is funny?" Gonzo:"Yes I think this is funny" Fat Guy:*lobs half a plastic cup of beer at Gonzo* Gonzo:*Calmly side-steps the beer thrown at his general direction* "You missed" Fat Guy:"You still think this is funny, pick my trash up" *walking towards GOnzo*  This is where Jerry's cousins came back and started yelling at the other guys to back off and so did the bouncers.  It wasn't like I was egging the guy on.  I was just laughing because the girlfriend of the fat guy was funny.  I didn't egg him on by engaging him in some form of dialogue.  I didn't try to start anything again.  I was thinking about it was late, I wanted to go home.  I had work to think about etc. etc. etc.  Meghan called and I detached myself from the potential brawl and talked to her.  A few minutes later the cops came and everyone went home.  I was sober but I know that Jerry's cousins and those punk ass kids weren't.  It would have been an interesting fight considering Jerry's cousins and their friends were like bulldogs.  I wouldn't want to fuck with those guys.  If they were to get into it, I think that it would take 4 of those kids to get on one of Jerry's cousins.  There were only 5 of them and some girls, there was 8 of us.  Well I guess I can count as half or something.  ;-)  Oh well.  As much as I wanted to get into it with those kids, it just wasn't worth it.  That's my St. Patrick's Day.

      Let's start something new here.  What about a community story where everyone participates and adds to the story.  I am not sure how this works but I heard about this from someone and it seemed like something new to do.  So lets give it a whirl here.  Let's call this Story 1.0  It was fall of 2002, the leaves were falling and it was getting colder.  People were getting ready to go off to college and so was Ethan.  He is a shy guy.  He's not the person who would normally go walk up to a girl and start talking to them.  He had a hard time striking up a conversation with just about anyone.  Probably because he had a huge hairy mole in the middle of his forehead.  This mole was huge.  It was about the side of a baseball covered with short pube-like hair that was wavy (not curly but wavy).  The mole itself wasn't hard at all.  It was somewhat moldable.  Imagine those eyeballs that you can get at the vending machine for a quarter.  It was all soft and gooey kinda?  Yeah the mole was like that.  It was a baseball size mole covered with pubes that was soft.  The mole has always been there since he was born.  They've tried and tried to take if off with laser surgery, with a scalpel, with anything but it just keeps growing back!  They have found it wasn't anything that would be cancerous, it's just a bizarre skin condition that keeps growing back.   So how's that for starters.  I guess we'll see if people will continue the story and make something out of it.

      So, let me first start this out by giving a little shout out to a certain Mr. Mark Pulver formerly known as "Jesus Mark"  The man has saved me about $50 bucks for coming to my aid Sunday night in East Lansing, MI.  So it started with me wanting Meghan to be able to drive my car comfortably and like a pro.  So before we went shopping for dinner, I wanted to have her drive around the apartment complex for a little while.  So we got in, got everything the way she needed it and everything was set.  I took the parking brake off so that we could get started.  I told her to let off the brake so we would roll forward and to a stop.  I was being stupid and didn't think that the ground right after the parking lot surface was wet and pure mud.  So we rolled and rolled so more until we hit the mud and I said okay, here we go, "let off the clutch slowly....blah blah blah"  Yeah, she was doing everything correctly until I realized that we were in the mud.  It sucked.  I didn't anticipate the damn mud to be that soft.  I didn't anticipate that we were going to get stuck.  We tried and had a few ideas but finally it was just Mark who was going to be the saving grace.  He came to help us out right away.  Fortunately he had a tow rope and a 4x4 SUV.  It had no problem towing my car out of the mud.  It was nice to see Mark again and I'm glad that he's not too wierded out by me and Meghan.  Thanks again Mark Pulver.  You saved the day.  Saturday was just a lazy day, as much as I wanted to do something, I really didn't because I could feel my gout starting to flare up and I didn't want that.  Besides wanting to see Meghan, I also didn't want to go to the St. Patty's Day parade because I would most undoubtedly drink me ass off and really kick up my gout and that wouldn't be cool at all.  We went and ate Japanese.  She ordered Suki Yuki (according to a very reliable source, it translates to 'meat liked by all' ooooo sounds dirty!) and I just had the sashimi combo.  It was good.  We went back and was lazy for a couple of hours, it was nice and relaxing.  Went back out to go drive around, watched Kung Pow! ('we're children, we're children') and then we finished of Memento, which was a good movie.  Retired around 4 am and wasted away till about 2 in the afternoon.  I feel all refreshed and everything.  Sunday afternoon consisted to Bell's Greek Pizza on M.A.C.  That was filling, afterwards we went to CVS and then back to her place for a little more laziness.  It was beautiful.  I started reading something that I honestly didn't think I would like Milan Kundera:  Book of Happiness and Forgetting, it was a good read.  I was then "ordered" to read Unbearable Lightness of Being.  That too was by Milan Kundera and was just as captivating.  I can't wait to finish the books that I started.  I guess I better get started on the one that Meghan let me borrow, it's in the car somewhere.  That was it, a nice relaxing weekend filled with movies and reading.  I can't remember the last time I had that much fun being lazy.  We also cooked breakfast for dinner.  That was different.  Pan cakes, eggs, maple sausage, bacon and cherry coke.    "Yummy, Yummy, Yummy in my Tummy" -J. Lo of Cartman's hand.  Woke up today without any problems (well except for some sore muscles), the drive was perfectly fine.  I was averaging 85-90 MPH all the way through Michigan and 75-85 MPH Indiana/Illinois.  Got to work 1/2 hour early.  Brand new week.  Moving out some stuff this week.  Saving the little things for the weekend.  Futon and shelving units with the computer table today, closet and clothes tomorrow.  Little things all through out the week and weekend.  Thankfully, Meghan will be in town to help me out.  That should be a good time.  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is also showing this weekend.  That should be a good view.  It's probably going to be drinking at the new apartment this weekend along with some video games so if anyone wants to stop by, it's all good.  This work week has already started out busy and I hope this trend continues so that the weekend will come even faster.  Thanks baby, see you soon!  Here's a pic of the sunrise as I drove south on I-69 this morning.  It was a beatiful drive back.

      602 was alright.  It wasn't great, it wasn't be either.  It was just alright.  There was some sort of ass kicking band on stage that did covers of some really hard rock songs.  They did a decent enough job that it didn't really bother me that much.  They played Ozzie, Korn and Disturbed to name a few.  Beers were still a buck so that was a bonus.  Played darts, lost, won, lost.  Yeah, losing the touch here.  More practice needed.  We then decided to play some pool.  I haven't played pool for a while so the first few games were really terrible.  I couldn't even draw the damn ball back to set up a shot for the next ball.  We met a couple of girls.  Melissa and Joanne (I think) they were nice and friendly.  They were good at pool so it was good that we spilt them up.  John and Joanne and Melissa and me.  I'm still a guy so these girls had to be somewhat cute to keep my attention.  Melissa was this little petite latina girl with short brown hair a little above her shoulders, brown eyes a triangle shape face, skinny and just very little.  She looked young too.  It looked like she was about 17 but she was really 25 with a 5 year old son.  Joanne was this short Filipina girl with a bunch of curves.  She was also not that bad looking.  She knew Tagalog so it was pretty cool to speak in the native tougne at a bar to a stranger.  They really didn't stay long because one of them had a class in the morning.  So on the last game Joanne bought everyone a round and a shot of Kamikazi each.  That was such a pussy shot.  Anyways, took the shots and said the good byes and that was my night at 602.  It was alright, not great, not bad.

      People really either love to do  urlLink this  shit or they have way too much time on their hands.  I woud like to think that the person who made this is a digital artist and I hope that he/she makes a damn good living making more original and elaborate games as seen above.  That's just too damn cool.  Like the one  urlLink Bird Game .  That was pretty cool.  And the  urlLink pull the ball (Bauns)   game, that was fun as hell too.  I really don't want to keep playing but I can't help it.  It's mindless entertaining fun.  Yeah.  My brain needs a little break.  Although I think Mr. Milan Kundera is calling my name to be read as I do laundry tonight/tomorrow.  So weekend plans.  Not entirely sure.  there's a lot of basketball to be viewed this weekend.  Elite 8 berths are at stake.  Tonight will be IL vs. Duke at 9 pm.  I don't think I'm leaving the apt this evening.  This could be fun to watch.  On tomorrow's games between Bama vs. UConn and St. Joeseph vs. OK State.  That's sure to be a great games to watch tomorrow.  Not entirely sure what bar or club to visit tonight.  We shall see.  Beer is always cheap at  urlLink 602 North .  They might have a good band playing tonight.  Haven't been wanting to go to  urlLink Voodoo  lately, the place has that wanna be downtown feeling.  I just want to have a good time.  What happened to the good old days of  urlLink North Beach  when people were just there to have fun, drink, dance, meet people?  Have these people suddenly changed their bars?  If so, where the hell did they go?  Where are the fun people?  People who aren't so damn pretentious.  Places that aren't so pretentious.  Where are the old servers who actually talked to you and didn't want just your money.

      yes, North Beach was bad.  I am not sure why but it has been deteriorating over the last few months.  Actually it's been pretty bad since the start of the year.  Sure there were times when it would get fun for a while but ultimately the place has changed.  It went from being a happy go lucky place to a place trying to be "downtown."  Shit!  Give it up.  There is no way in the world that a place in the suburbs will ever be able to have a "downtown" feel.  Just face it, it's never going to happen.  Besides that, there was a lot of people who continue to bring their baggage into the bar.  I mean really, these guys and girls just waltz in with thier attitudes larger than thier heads and think that they own the place.  Eh, the place has changed, the servers have changed, the bartenders have changed and the overall appeal and attitude of the place is just gone down the tubes.  The place wasn't even packed last night.  I have never seen that place that bad before.  Heck, even the Thursday after St. Patrick's Day still had a descent number of people present.  More than last nights.  Eh, that's my current thought on North Beach.

      Yes, Gonzo reads.  Can you believe that?  Yes, it is crazy, Gonzo reads for pleasure these days.    Anyways, Meghan graciously lent me a book of short stories by  urlLink Haruki Murakami  titled  urlLink After the Quake .  The book is a collection of six short stories with each having something to do with the earthquake if Japan in 1995 (thus the title).  The stories aren't even directly about the quake in neither Kobe, Japan nor Kobe, Japan itself but about people's lives that are some how affected by the quake.  Now I, yes me, Gonzo, haven't read a great number of books nor have I written a book review since the mandatory shit that I had to endure attending a Catholic high school either but I will try to do something of the sort here.  Not necessarily a review but just thoughts.  The book is interesting and easy to read, granted it has been translated from it's original language of Japanese to English, to be able to reach a wider audience, the translated work required no effort to read.  The flow of the conversation is smooth and natural that one can’t help but compare it to overhearing a conversation.  His characters are complex and simple as they go about their issues of loss, love, finding one’s self and a host of other troubles that make his characters real and believable (well except for the freakin FROG).  There aren't a lot of characters in his stories; no big crowds to plow through, not a lot of people’s names to remember, no majestic setting; the stories are very centered around the lives of the few characters in each of the stories.  The short journey that happens within each story is enjoyable and sometimes leaves you wanting more.  The first story, UFO in Kushiro, is about a salesman and his quest to find what life is after his wife had left him after the quake.  She would spend all day and all night pouring over newspapers and watching the news about the Kobe quake till one day, she couldn't take it anymore and she leaves him.  She left a note that said "Living with you was like living with a chuck of air."  That just sounds painful and empty.  After all of this he decides that he needs a vacation, a nice long vacation.  His boss recommends him to go to Hokkaido to take a small package to a friend.  He arrives in Hokkaido and is met by two women.  He is clueless on what to do at first about the whole scenario.  He still feels somewhat loyal to the wife but soon finds that it’s useless and that he should start living his life again.  They spend the night in a love hotel.  In a conversation with one of the women that he meets in Hokkaido, Komura, the main character, comes to the realization that he is just starting out on his journey to start his life over again; to find himself and to find meaningful relationships with other people.  This realization gives Komura a sense of relief in that he can finally let go of the past.  Like any other normal person who just got out of a long term relationship (in this case he was married), this scares and excites Komura.  What’s going to happen now?  Who will he meet; what his life is going to be like etc?  Good story that leaves you with a feeling of loss and hope.  Strange combination but it works out nicely.  The second story, Landscape with a flatiron, is a story about Junko and Miyake.  They liked to have bonfires and talk about life.  Junko is a young clerk at a local convenience store and Miyake is a man older than Junko who is a struggling artist.  This story reminded me of Lost in Translation.  Both were dissatisfied with the emptiness that is currently their lives in a small town.  It was a sad realization for the both of them that they are living mundane lives with no purpose at all.  Both hope that someday there will be something to live for.  In some ways, both are drawn to each other despite the age difference.  It’s strange but at the same time comforting that they talk about death together.  There seems to be a strange deep bond that is forming between the two of them as the story ends and the quote “Don’t worry.  When the fire goes out, you’ll start feeling cold.  You’ll wake up whether you want to or not.”  Both of them will be still be living their lives the same way until it becomes so unbearable that they will eventually have to change something.  Miyake’s dreams of dying suffocating inside a fridge and Junko is already suffocating is her current life of nothingness.  I thought it was a sad story because of the lack of direction that their lives are taking and that it’s going to stay that way until it’s so unbearable.  What a sad realization.  All of God’s Children can Dance is the third story.  Yohiya, our protagonist, is the product of a single mother, who is sometimes a little weird and a doctor who had given her abortions after she got pregnant the first two times.  After the doctor denied the child as his (he adamantly said that his contraceptive methods were fool proof and that she probably ‘had knowledge’ of another man), Yoshiya’s mother aptly left him and lived alone raising her child.  It’s strange that she would prance around the house naked in front of her son not to mention that he would get an erection when she would crawl into bed with him.  As much as he wanted to leave and be by himself, he couldn’t.  He recalls the time when he rejected the faith and this gave his mother great grief.  He could only imagine what would happen if he had left her.  The mother also believes that her son is in fact a child of God (apparently, if you have an enormous wang, you are one of God’s children).  Mr. Tabata, a wise character in a story that seems to spin its wheels and get somewhere but really nowhere, says that “this life is nothing but a short, painful dream.”  The beginning of the ending of the story (and when the wheels begin to spin, so to speak) begins when he gets a description of who his biological father is and goes to the train station and finds the man that he saw in the beginning of the story.  As his mother described his biological father he saw it in this man’s face.  The missing ear, about the right age and the doctor’s bag, everything seemed right.  He then waits till the man gets off at his stop and he gets off the train at the same stop.  The description of how it’s raining and cold and dark really sets the tone for the ending and how he didn’t get anywhere and he is all alone in this quest in the end.  He follows the man to a baseball field and suddenly the man is gone.  He feels alone and in the end he is alone, a closure to something that never really started.  The next story is titled Thailand.  Here we meet Dr. Satsuki and fly with her to Thailand for a World Thyroid Conference.  She has been through a rather nasty divorce and would pretty much like to see her ex-husband dead.  She needs a break from her work and decides to spend a week long vacation in Thailand in the care of a private limo driver named Nimit.  Nimit has spent a great part of his life living in the shadow of his previous employer, a Norwegian gem dealer.  He did everything with him and went everywhere he went (there was a reference that they could have been lovers so there wouldn’t be any love connections between our heroine and the driver here.)  He lived his life for him.  He lost his sense of self and is also trying to find it.  The same can be said about Satsuki, she is a woman trying to let go of her past so that she can find herself as well as improving her emotional health.  Both Nimit and Satsuki are avid jazz lovers.  They spent a little bit of time discussing how they learned about jazz and what their favorite songs were.  Satsuki is also a swimmer.  Nimit takes her to a secluded athletic club where she can swim away from other people and stay relaxed (her hotel has a pool but there are always people there and she can’t do laps as one could in an Olympic size swimming pool).  Nimit senses that something is bothering Satsuki so he brings her to an oracle/fortune teller.  The oracle tells her to let go of her ill feelings towards her ex-husband so that she can continue on living her life and find herself once again.  She tells Satsuki to hang on to a snake so that it will swallow the white stone that is in her so that she can move forward in her life.  Nimit also offers up a few words of wisdom regarding looking forward to dying because “living and dying are of equal value.”  The next story is Superfrog Saves Tokyo.  It’s about the relationship of Katagiri, a loan collector of sorts and Frog, a six foot “real” frog that only Katagiri can see.  There is nothing lovable, tragic or charismatic about Katagiri.  In fact, Frog blatantly comes out and tells Katagiri that he is far from good looking, not eloquent at all, and other people tend to look down upon him.  Still, Frog sees a certain strength of character about him that is necessary to help him batter Worm.  Frog is just a big frog that walks on its hind legs.  Frog confronts Katagiri and asks him to go underground with him to fight Worm.  Worm got woken up by the quake in Kobe and now he is mad.  He has been absorbing all these little tremors all these years and now he is ready to unleash the collected fury on Tokyo.  This story seems crazy at first but after reading a few pages of it, it becomes believable.  The story never gave any details of the alleged fight that happened in his imagination.  Maybe his isolation from the world has taken form of the Frog and maybe the whole thing was a dream.  Like Frog said, “The whole terrible fight occurred in the area of imagination.  That is the precise location of our battlefield.  It is there that we experience our victories and our defeats.”  Maybe we just imagine our own victories and defeats and that they were never really there in the first place.  Could it be that we make up what victory and defeat is on our own?  That you can make anything into a victory and consequently a defeat as well?  We just made it ours by thinking it’s ours.  This is a very strange and bizarre story.  Katagiri has trouble discerning if he having a nightmare, a fantasy or just a crazy world.  The author did a good job of conveying how the protagonist was feeling since I too was as confused as Katagiri   The last story, Honey Pie, was really the most satisfying of all the stories.  It is a beautiful story about friendship, unrequited (but in the end, requited) love and loss.  It’s about an odd threesome group of friends: Junpei (shy and quite), Sayoko (intelligent and classy) and Takatsuki (loud and proud) (with Sala as the love child of Sayoko and Takatsuki).  Junpei eventually finds himself in the position to claim the woman he loves, when Takatsuki – Sayoko’s husband – leaves for another woman.  He has to deal with the fact that he loves this woman and her daughter but he doesn’t know how to deal with it appropriately.  He has maintained this secret love for Sayoko all these years even after she had married and bore a child.  There is a point in the story where things were starting to get erotic.  He finds that there is so much more to consummating his love for her than just the act of sex.  He realizes that he does indeed truly love this woman and her child.  This is also strange because the woman that he has loved all through out these years has already been married and had a child with his best friend.  It’s very admirable for Junpei to jump in and take responsibility for his love and her love as well as the well being of a child not his own but from his best friend and Sayoko’s ex husband.  The following quotations are beautiful.  ''I want to write stories that are different from the ones I've written so far,'' Junpei thinks. ''I want to write about people who dream and wait for the night to end, who long for the light so they can hold the ones they love.'' He vows that he will watch over the woman and her daughter, ''even if the sky should fall or the earth crack open with a roar.''  The ending to this one isn’t nearly as sad as the others.  Perhaps this is when he will finally start to connect with people of a different level.  It was beautiful how Murakami made the bedtime story of the two bears and the salmon being gone to reflect the relationship between Sayoko and Junpei.  It was also nice how the two bears are partners and how they never have to be apart.  Very Nicely Done Mr. Murakami.  Very Nicely Done.  I am sure that I probably missed a whole boat load of stuff my apologies.  It's just my first attempt to put some of my thoughts of a book into something coherent.

      I have been recently re-introduced into the world of high culture and have been afforded a couple of days soak it all in a reflect upon the experience.  I wanted to go visit the Art Institute and I wanted to take Meghan with because I thought that she would enjoy it more than I did.  I was wrong.  She did enjoy the museum thoroughly, she wants to come back but I think it had a bigger impact on me.  I've been to the Louve (Paris, France) but didn't really spent a lot of time there and it was with family.  This time, granted it was a smaller museum compared to the Louve, it was with Meghan.  It was a different experience.  It was a lot of fun she was able to show me and educate me about art and the artists and the styles of art from realism, to surrealism to impressionism, modern, post-modern, abstract and there is so much more.  I definitely want to go back and spend an entire day just walking around, lounging, soaking everything in.  Taking pictures and writing down how I feel about the piece.  I can't wait to go back.  I somehow feel a sense of balance now with my new found interest in the arts and culture to counteract my "party boy" persona.  It seems that I have forgotten about that aspect of my life for a little while now and it's good to sit back and read a book for a change instead of just playing video games.  I still enjoy playing video games, sports games and fighting games and watching mindless TV to just feel dumb for a few hours but sometimes the need to learn or exercise the brain be it in the form of music or reading is more enjoyable that just being lazy.  I think it's time to seriously put some time and effort into learning to play the guitar, it's going to be painful for the roomies but I'll try not to disturb the roomies.  Sorry for not putting up something that is for discussion, I'll see what I can do about that in the future.  For now, people can suffer reading this crap.

      Yes, yesterday was alright.  After a marvelous weekend, I guess with the Law of Averages, I am bound to have a shitty week.  I suppose that has already rang true in certain aspects of my life and I hope that the worst part is over.  For some odd reason I just want an uneventful pleasant week where not a lot of things will happen, something to the effect of a "down time" week where I can relax.  That's probably not going to happen with my professional life but that's quite alright.  Yesterday was full of revisiting old projects, updating them, finishing up loose ends and the sort.  Not too bad, I suppose I got through my work day without making a splash, definitely a good thing.  I went back to my parents house to pick up the TV, speakers, and TV stand converted to a computer table.  I also got a couple of spring jackets, the guitar and a bunch of little things.  I also put all my clothes in some order in my closet and chest.  Today I will probably go ahead and purchase an iron and pick up the ironing board for the parentals.  I should probably pickup the empty liquor bottles from my room and put them somewhere but I am not sure where.  Maybe I should jus throw those out already.  I don't think the "frat house" atmosphere is appropriate anymore, it kinda got old.  Now it's time to pick up some posters or some art.  The room is bland.  I am not sure if I like the walls to be bare and just be peaceful or have some posters or art to make it more colorful.  I guess time will tell.  Laundry night is tonight so along with an Iron, I gotta get some laundry detergent.  Sheesh, I thought the buying stuff part was over, I guess not.  I have finally gotten my room to the way I want it and I now think it has a better flow to it.  There's more floor space available for other things in the future (golf clubs, coat stand, etc) as well as a better path to the door.  I was reading some  urlLink Feng Shui   online and found certain things to follow when arranging your bed to comply with Feng Shui principles.  BANNED IN BEDROOMS  If you want to ensure your bedroom does not suffer from bad vibes that bring heartache, illness and loss, do observe these simple bedroom basics.  - Never have large mirrors that reflect the bed in the bedroom.  - Never have live plants in the bedroom  - Never place water features in the bedroom  - Never keep live fish in the bedroom  - Never hang peony paintings if your husband is above middle aged  - Never place clutter under the bed  - Never hang pictures of hostile animals.  - Never have reflective surfaces directly facing the bed    EIGHT MANSIONS FORMULA  Try very hard to sleep with your head pointed to your best sheng chi direction based on the KUA formula. If this is not possible then try to sleep with your head pointed to one of your good directions. In doing this, do ensure that:  - Your bed is not located at an angle to the wall  - Your bed is not 'floating " in the center of the room  - Your feet or head are not pointing directly to the door  - Your feet or head are not directly pointing to the toilet  - Your bed is not sharing a wall with a toilet on the other side  - Your bed is not situated underneath a toilet on the floor above.  - Your bed is not located under an overhead beam  - Your bed is not being hit by sharp edges of corners or furniture.  - Your bedhead is placed against a solid wall.   I don't necessarily believe in this crap but it was still fun to read and try to follow.  So I guess I have everything checked off.  I slept early last night, midnight maybe (or a little before that) and I woke up around 5:30.  I feel pretty good.  I woke up feeling better than when I woke up yesterday morning.  Maybe it was because I didn't really sleep till early morning but none the less, I still feel like I had a good night's sleep.

      I will have to say this is one of the best movies I have seen for a little while now.  Easily one of the best I've seen so far this year.  The movie is about a guy who finds a clinic (I don't really know if it's a real clinic considering the people who work there seem like a bunch of pothead retards who know a thing or two of the procedure because of repetitive actions) which offers a service that can erase specific memories from a person's mind (thus the title).  I like how Dr. Mierzwiak explained the procedure, "Well, technically, the procedure itself is brain damage, but on par with a night of heavy drinking.  Nothing you'll miss."  I thought that was pretty funny.  Joel (Jim Carey) wants to erase his memories with Clementine (Kate Winslet), his girlfriend.  What a sci-fi premise of being able to delete one's memories but at the same time it was very believable.  There were some good visuals (real or CGI) all through out the film.  I mean from the beginning of the movie and then the movie starts out again and you can't figure out what time in the relationship it is, that was great!  How it all comes together later in the movie, that was great as well.  The colors of her hair to serve as some sort of marker for the time.  The "spotlight/flashlight" effect as Meghan showed me.  The way the memories were being erased.  How he looked when he was going back to his memories to being a little child.  The house where they met was getting erased.  How her name was Clementine (remember the song Clementine?   Oh my darlin' Oh my darlin' Oh my darlin' Clementine.  Thou are lost and gone forever, dreadful sorry Clementine ).  How store fronts, signs, books everything were losing their letters as the scenes go on.  How people lose their faces.  How everything else when Joel and Clementine were together, things were getting blurry.  I also like how he could hear the people that were in the real world and not his memories.  The beach.  Man, I really want to see the movie again.  So much more to see and see again.  The movie was about that, loss (we'll get into that a little more later).  He didn't want the anguish of knowing that he lost the only person that he loved.  So he would go to that extreme to erase that part of his life.  Memories of their time spent together we beautiful.  The time when they went to the frozen lake, when they were just fucking around at his apartment, the time when they were at the Chinese restaurant.  Everything was so real and in tune with relationships.  It made me think of my previous relationships.  I followed the movie on how to think of the most recent memories of the relationship and the go backwards.  So I started out with the bad times and then the good times.  It didn't make me yearn for what was once there.  It made me think of how much I have grown since then and how that really helped me have a better idea of who I am.  I wouldn't dare erase these memories because they serve as some form of reminder of who I once was and how I have grown no matter how painful it is.  Another scene in the movie that I can't forget is the part where they were laying on the ice and Joel says to  Clementine  "I could die right now, Clem.  I'm just happy.  I've never felt that before.  I'm just exactly where I want to be."   Beautiful, just fucking beautiful.  I left the movie thinking and with even more questions.  I want to see it again.  I have to see it again.

      The weekend came and went it was a good one.  Friday - Went to work, work flew by fast.  It was good.  Meghan arrived late because of rush hour, poor thing.  Got her shit from her car and went to Best Buy to pickup Jerry's PCI wirelss card (802.11b).  We then proceeded to Fuddruckers.  Damn good burgers.  *hungry*  Yeah nice 1/2 pound burgers.  Damn it was good.  Juicy medium cooked burgers that was just sooooo good.  We went back to my house to pick some shit up to bring back to the apartment and set stuff up.  Got to the new home and setup tried to set up the wireless network.  That was fun.  We actually had it right the first time but we fucked a bit and got it all screwed up.  Meghan was watching, that was cool.  What a nerd.  She learned though and pointed out the mistake that we made the first time around because we couldn't get back into the thing so we pressed the reset button and logged back in as admin and it worked.  So now we have a wireless network here and it works perfectly!  The wireless router is also working perfectly as we were able to secure it accordingly and only allow the "known" MAC addresses to be able to connect.  Currently the thing is sitting underneath my bed and it shall stay there because it works.  After we got that shit and I am now able to be online, we went and saw The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.  What a movie.  It was good.  That's all I gotta say about it.  Just watch it.  It's kinda sad but hopeful at the same time.  Definitely worth the price of a movie ticket.  I think I might purchase it on DVD as well.  Good movie.  Jim C. displayed good acting ability as well as Kate Winslette.  She was kinda goofy looking as a "punk rocker" bookstore clerk stereotype character because she is just a classic beauty but it worked at times and didn't distract me from watching the movie.  Elijah Wood's character was creepy.  Good movie, definitely a good movie.  Came back and just hung out for a while before going to bed.  Saturday - Got up around 10-ish but really got out of bed around noon.  Plans were to go to the  urlLink Art Institute of Chicago .  We wasted away till noon that was fun.  Got out of bed and ate some reheated fries from Fuddruckers that was good.  McDonalds was also calling my name so we had some of that on the way downtown.  Drove around the city, it was a gorgeous day, absolutely gorgeous!  Sun was out, no clouds (car wasn't clean though) warm except for the wind but overall it was a great day in Chicago.  Drove around and looked for a parking garage to spend $20 to park for a few hours but was unseccesful.  Drove up Randolph and turned left on Wells (right underneath the EL) and found a car leaving a spot.  Immeadiately turned on the turning signals to park there for FREE!  Yes free, saved $20 and parked for free.  Now Mind you that was a long walk to Michigan Ave but it was worth it since it was a nice day and damn it's fucking free!  We got to the Museum and there was some sort of line but there was a bunch of people beating some drums to some crazy ass beat, that was entertaining but I also felt bad for the old Chinese guy playing "Danny Boy" on the violin.  He was getting drowned out by these kids.  Oh well.  We got in and got the tickets and proceeded to find where they take the tickets from you.  We got to the gate and walked right on by.  We were kinda walking side by side with this professor/curator or something and the people just assumed that we were with the old guy.  They never took the tickets.  Too bad those things were dated, we could definitely use them again in the future because the damn place was huge and we didn't even get through a quarter of the place.  Definitely have to go back and chill there.  One word, AWESOME!  Found out that my favorite artist is Tanguy and his art falls under surrealism.  I never knew that I liked art.  It hold's you for a second and lets out emotions and feelings that only certain paintings can.  It draws you like a magnet attracting iron shavings closer and closer.  His work is in the same catergory as Dali but I think I am more in tune with what Tanguy was showing.  We saw some Max Earnst, Rothko, Pollock.  Just absolutely good shit.  Good shit.  Good shit.  I can't wait to go back and see those paintings again and looks at the other stuff.  Wow.  I definitely a fan of the museum now.  I could just go back and back and back and back there and just chill out, hang out, relax.  Shit.  IT was that good!  *SIGH*  That fucking good.  We left because they close at 5 that day but whatever, it's another place to go to, another place to back to.  I can't belive that I am gushing over art.  Who woulda known?  We took a somewhat legnthy walk to the Lake and hung out there for a while.  It was nice, blue water, no one around to disturb us, seagulls (or Sea Cats I guess they are called in Japanese) were everywhere but it was fine until it got colder than bearable.  We went to Dunkin Donuts but no one was there so we went to Starbucks and got some shit to warm us up.  Proceeded on home and rented Ferris Beuller's Day Off at the local Blockbuster and watched that eating Hungry Howie's pizza.  Good stuff.  Fell asleep kinda early cuz of the walking and got up kinda early as well.  What a great day!  Sunday - Woke up and ate left over pizza.  Showered and went to Mitsuwa.  Meghan was super excited because her mission was to peruse and purchase some "little girl" manga for herself to read.  She bought a bunch.  It was cute.  Ate some chicken from the food court but that wasn't filling at all.  Came home and she did her homework and we read.  She read her recently purchased manga as I flipped through the pages of Murakami's After The Quake.  It's a good read, not done with it yet but next up is The Unbearable Lightness of Being by Milan Kundera.  The latter of the books is purpotedly a good read so I want to finish this one that I am reading and start reading the next one.  We just hung out at the new apartment because no one was home so it was definitely some needed good "down time"  People got back and were watching TV.  We were talking about things.  Mark P called and we talked for a little while (Yes Mark, there is more than friendship).  She left for MI and that's what happened to my weekend.  It was good, real good!  Here are a couple of pics

      So Ted and I had a great plan to make up a bad story about me getting into an accident to see if people actually responded to that one but nooo, they're smart.  Too smart.  Here is the email that was composed by the two conspirators as well as critiqued by a third party.  I was contacted earlier today by Gonzo's parents in Chicago. Early Wednesday morning, Gonzo was part of a street race on I-294 outside of Chicago. He lost control of his car, hit the median and his car was totaled.  Currently he is at the University of Chicago Hospital, and preliminary x-rays indicate severe neck trauma. He is currently listed as critical/stable. He is conscious and responding to people.   Erika and I plan on going to Chicago to visit Gonzo this weekend. Anyone wanting to join us please let us know. We will leave Saturday morning. Call us at XXX XXX-XXXX. Gonzo's parents said anyone coming is free to stay with them. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, call me if you have any questions.   Ted  Not too bad.  Almost believable except for the fact that if they did belive it they would immideately call the damn hospital to see if there's a patient that they could transfer me to.  I haven't heard from Ted yet on wether people actually called him although there was an interesting response from Heidi about Chicago.  She said "Chicago, isn't that where Mark and Jessica had their baby? :-)"  Yes, I was found out.  That reply just indicated that she remember's the last time some form of big news was delivered to all around April 1st.  Damn you Mark Pulver Damn you for destroying April Fool's.  You see the reason why April Fool's day will forever be a challenge to pull off from now on is because last year, our great dear friend Mark Pulver decided to really put a big one on everyone.  I wasn't paying attention to the date, all I saw was that Mark and Jessica were having a baby.  The email had something to the effect that Jess is pregnant please pray for us or some shit like that.  Now me, being a father and all, was naturally happy for them and excited.  So I replied back wishing them a good pregnancy and all that shit.  Well it turns out that it was just one big joke.  Well I was duped.  Oh well.  I think a lot of people were duped but eventually caught on.  I, on the other hand, just completely fell on my face with that one.  -------------------------------------------------------------------  Wel North Beach was again the destination last night.  I don't know why, I thought we were going to try out Rip Rocks.  That place is ghetto though.  Yeah, I would rather stick to North Beach even if it turns into more of a sausage fest every damn week.  Last night there was a ration of 1:5 hot/cute vs not hot/alright.  I was appaled to see that no one was dancing.  The place is usually packed with people who -CAN- dance.  Although, there were these two little girls making out on the dance floor.  That had a certain novelty about it that quickly wore off after watching for 30 seconds.  Oh, there was also the really big girl dancing.  She had some moves and a John Deere trucker cap.  Let's see, the volleyball girls were back, didn't watch them enough.  We were trying out lines again.  The line of the night was "Excuse me, do you have a band aid." (no, why?) "Because I scraped my knee when I fell for you."  That really didn't get used that often since the girls were just not present.  The waitresses were saying hi and so were the beer girls and shot girls.  It's kinda sad to know that these people know you because you go there enough but I guess as long as they're cuties, it's all good.  Now at work  wishing it was four  party later  drinking  laughing  talking  friends  time to go yet?

      So yeah, I've been inspired lately to do some form of art and picked up the trusty barely used guitar and dusted it off and began to tune it back to health.  It still sounds good and I can sorta remember some of the chords (yeah all three of them) but it's enought o strum on the guitar and kinda sound like I know what I am doing.  I then decided to play a little  urlLink Scar Tissue .  As you can see it's not really that hard but I gotta get the timing and the rythm right.  besides that I have been practicing a little  urlLink Fur Elise .  That's one too is also not too bad.  So besides learning to play guitar and reading a book, l think I'm doing good in nurturing this little kick (well I hope it lasts longer than a kick) that I am in.  Later tonight I plan on learning from the  urlLink "Idiot's Guide"   Well that's all I got for now.  Well besides the party that I will be having this Friday.  If anyone wants to stop by, it's all good.

      Has anyone been paying any attention to the Google Vs. The World (i.e. Yahoo and Microsoft specifically).  Yesterday I noticed that they changed their  urlLink website  and started to provide  urlLink links  to other services that they provide.  Most noticeable is  urlLink Froogle .  Froogle has been around for a little while now.  It's basically a shopping guide from Google.  It looks online for the cheapest prices for specific products that you search for.  I have no idea how this search works but if it's the same method that  urlLink Google  uses, then the prices that it comes up with will be from webpages that have a bunch of links (with the top search result being the one with the most links).   urlLink Yahoo  and  urlLink Google  used to be partners in the online world.  Google was the search engine and Yahoo providing content.  Yahoo got wind that Google was planning on becoming a content provider to challenge Yahoo for some of the money that is being thrown around out here in cyber space.  They plan to offer content and services similar to what Yahoo and MSN are offering.  Yahoo bought a couple of little search engines to bolster it's own web search engine.  This allows them time to fine tune their newly bought technology to be able to compete with Google.  MSN, on the other hand, just recently decided to do their own R&D for their own search engine.  This isn't really a surprise.  In terms of Web innovation, Microsoft has been always a little behind.  What Microsoft lacks in foresight it makes up for with resources.  It has billions of dollars along with it's manpower to be able to catch up in this search engine race, well it's not really a race, it's more of war.   urlLink Vivisimo  is another innovative search engine that groups together relative search results into "clusters"  For example, if you went to Google and did a search on  urlLink 'Paris Hilton'  you would most likely see results for the heir to the Hilton empire.  If you did a search on  urlLink 'Hilton Paris'  it would come up with the Hilton in Paris but still have some Paris Hilton results.  With  urlLink Vivisimo , you get everything in a nice organized cluster.  So if you were looking for the hotel, just go ahead and click on the 'Hotel' cluster and from there you can find everything from the official Hilton-Paris website to getting deals for the rooms at the hotel.  Now if you were actually looking for other risque 'Paris Hilton' related information, they too are also clustered neatly in this website.  With Google ripe for their IPO this year, it wouldn't surprise me if they actually try to buy out Vivisimo or develop something along the lines of clustering.  Microsoft would probably do something the same with all their money, who needs to innovate?  Yahoo, on the other hand, is still the leader as being the most popular destination on the Internet.  From news and sports, to maps, to movies, to email, to whatever, it's loaded with content to keep a visitor (unique, mind you) happy for hours on end.  Who will be the dominant search engine in the future?  Will it still be Google and we can term cyber searching "Googling"? or is it going to be "Did you MSN that?"  or "Go Yahoo that error message" or is it something else.

      So last night we went to Famous Freddies.  It was alright.  There wasn't any good music.  It was all gay techno "club" anthmes with out any originality.  The place seems like a trashy dive bar.  I'm sure other people don't share this sentiment but I thought it was trashy and a dive.  I was loving it.  It was still somewhat fun.  There wasn't a single person who knew how to dance there.  There was this one guy, if you can imagine the Thriller video by Michael Jackson where he's doing the "monster" sratch dance.  He was doing this to the tune of "Blow my Whistle Bitch"  Yes, it was retarded and funny to look at.  It was kinda like driving by an accident and you can't help but look at the carnage.  You know it's going to be bad but you still go ahead and look anyways.  I had no beef with this guy.  He was out having fun.  It was okay that he was dancing bad because he wasn't being pretentious about it.  The food was cheap.  It was a buck for cheese nachos.  It was a buck for a hotdog.  It was $2.50 for steak on a stick.  Yes beef tenderloin steak on a stick.  There was a band where the "kitchen" was.  The band was some sort of Phish/Greatful Dead tribute and cover band.  Not really my thing but they were still easy to listen to so that wasn't too bad.  Downstairs is where they had a club/dance floor area.  I don't know why but everywhere that I walked and hung out, I would get some sort of liquid to drip on me.  Yes, gross.  It was soon apparent to me that the bathroom was directly above where we all were standing.  Gross.  Beer was $3 a bottle.  Not too bad.  Maybe it was the band that was there because I remember the last time I was there, there were more girls that were easier on the eyes.  This time around, I can count how many good looking ones were there.  It sucked.  I did mange to take a picture of something.  I guess it wasn't a total loss.

      I am hurting today and it's bad.  I am sore in places that were to be expected after not playing basketball for quite a while.  My back is a little sore, my thighs are sore as well.  The worst is at my left ball of my foot.  That is where I get my gout.  I think I also rolled my right ankle trying to drive the lane against someone a foot taller than me.  I have some sort of limp when I walked today.  I shot the ball terribly.  I only reached double digits in the game of 21 once (and we played way more than one).  I need the practice.  I also need to regain my dribbling.  Oh yeah, and smoking is bad for you.  Definitely bad.  Although I was able to play for a couple of hours, I did have to take a break to catch my breath.  Smoking is definitely bad.  We might play again today, we'll see.  I'm also not sure about going out tonight since my gout foot is acting up.  I'de rather not chance it since I am going on vacation in a month.  That's about it.  I wish I wasn't at work.  Need to heal.

      So Meghan showed me something that was very entertaining.  First you have to read what the  urlLink project  is all about.  Then I want to share urlLink  this .  There are a bunch of other comic strips there that were also very entertaining.

      Well UCONN won it all last night.  Not surprising, I knew Okafur would dominate but I didn't think that Gordon was going to do that much damage from beyond the three point line.  Emeka Okafur was outstanding in the paint.  Grabbing 15 rebounds to go with his 24 huge points.  It was a no contest really.  UCONN was able to pull away by as much as 24 points with 14 minutes left.  That's really a telling sign of how good a team is.  They won each of their previous tournament games by some 70 points combined.  That just screams dominance.  Gordon was just as crucial as he scored 14 first half points and played it cool the second half.  He ended up with 21 points for the Huskies but his main contribution was the way he played the game the second half.  He was the floor leader.  Dribbling away precious time, time that Georgia Tech needed to make it interesting.  GT made it to within 8 points with a minute left but it was a case of too little too late.  UCONN did lose to this team in November of last year.  Okafur didn't play well as he was bothered by a bad back.  His play as well as the play of the whole team was indicative of how much more they wanted the title.  The play that I recall that has Champion written all over it was when Okafur was scraping on the floor for a loose ball to tap it to one of his open team mates.  It wasn't that he did that, it's expected.  It was he did it while they were already up 20 points.  There was no need to risk injury for a loose ball if you are already up 20.  I was really impressed with that.  He's no superstar in my opinion, he's a star, a great player but I don't think he has it to completely take over a game the way MJ did or AI or Kobe or KG.  If anything, I think he will be an Elton Brand when Okafur gets to the NBA.  He will work hard for you, he will get you 20/10 every night but he's not going to be taking over a game and putting the whole team on his back.  That's no knock, he will have a long and productive career at the NBA level.  I just think that the superstar X-factor is not present in the guy.  Anyways, congratulations to UCONN, it was a no brainer.  as long as Okafur was in the game, there really was no way for any team out there to beat them in the NCAA tournament.

      Well it was nice to see old friends again.  Well actually it was just one old friend.  I suppose the other invitees had other plans and stuff.  It was still cool to see Rich again.  He's still his old self.  Cooked some parmasean chicken Friday night for the room mates and Meghan.  Chicken was a little bland and bony but very juicy.  Meat was just falling off the bone.  It was good but it need a little more to give it a kick.  I think I put too much garlic salt in the mashed potatoes.  It kinda fermented and stank towards the next day as I was searching for left overs to eat for breakfast.  It was still good to eat though.  I enjoyed quite thoroughly.  Friday was drinkfest and video game night.  Losta fun.  There was also a bunch of talking and joke telling.  I wish I could describe the Irish accent that Jerry, my room mate can do and say the joke.  It needs the accent to bring the punch line that much more oomph to be funnier.  Played some basketball (NBA Live 2004) and Halo and just a little bit of Need for Speed Underground.  NFSU, brought back some memories.  Friday was a good night.  Someone got pretty drunk.  Let's just say it was a good time and leave it at that.  Saturday was good as well.  I shared a Chicago (at least I don't think thery're in any other state) food staple.  If you are from Chicago, you know of Portillos.  Good stuff.  Well actually we ordered from Barnellis.  Portillos is like the chicago itialian sausage/beef sandwiches or the burgers or the hot dogs with the onion rings or fries.  Barnellis is the pasta, regular sandwich place that also serves the Chicken Ceasar Pita.  Good sandwich.  surprisingly, their pita bread has been better than par lately.  It's been lack luster the few times before this.  It didn't really crumble or anything.  It was good.  We then went to my parents house to say hi and see what they were up to and get directions for my cousin's birthday party (there were two parties merged into one).  I didn't get invited to help out in the garden Meghan did.  Although it was said half jokingly, half serious, I thought that was very nice of my parents to make sure Meghan felt comfortable.  We retreated and got some TCBY because someone has been wanting that for like six weeks now, maybe even more.  Straberry shortcake, good stuff.  Caribou coffee was right next door so we went ahead and got something there as well.  We then went back to the apartment to relax for a bit.  I knew that my family gathering would be, let's see, how can I word this...a pleasant drain on your energy.  It usually was a crazy time.  I dont think I could have prepared her more if I tried.  I didn't really try, I just kinda let it happen to see what would happen.  We got there thanks to the directions that my dad drew out for us.  Everyone was already there.  I would think that it would be intimidating for someone new.  I wanted to see how she would interact with my family as well as how my family liked her.  We got there and let's just say that they really liked each other.  Rarely do I bring any of my friends to meet the entire family not to mention people I am persuing.  I only did that lately because I felt comfortable enough to share to them that this is who my family is.  This is where I come from.  These are  who I am related to.  This is where I get my values and beliefs.  These are the people that are the closest to me.  The last time that I did merge  my friends and family into one gathering was my 22nd birthday.  I had a bunch of people over.  All of my family were there and then later on in the night, my friends showed up.  It was a good time, my dad being all drunk along with my uncles and having them interact with some of my closest friends (who were also drunk).  I thought was was pretty cool.  Granted there weren't a lot of people at this particular party, it's still my family acting like they usually are.  I was just glad that my family made her feel welcome and she was having a good time.  She really had a good time and my family did like her.  Sunday was just not a good time.  It started out bad but things are better now.  I know I said some things that I shouldn't have.  I am sorry for the stuff that I said that hurt, intended or not intended.  I am glad that we worked this out already.  Water under the bridge?  Not a sinking ship?  Yeah....  Besides Sunday and it's wierdness, I had a great weekend.  Sorry to have "missed" a day here, but apparently it's a good thing when one does miss a day in "blogging"

      So I went to the driving range last night to hone my swing since I have a game with The Dungeon Crew (Ted, Mark, Chase) well the ones that can make it atleast.  Well, I was getting my bucket of balls and proceeded to the hitting area.  $6 for a bucket, fucking ridiculous.  Anyways, I was at the hitting area and proceeded to stretch and warm up.  I hit a few balls lightly to get a hand on things again.  I wouldn't want to strain something playing golf.  That would be retarded.  So I got warmed up and things were coming back to me.  My swing was still there, just a little loose and rustly.  My 9 iron was right on target.  There's was a 100 yard marker and I was getting it consistently within 5 feet.  not bad.  I then moved to my 7 iron and was going for the 150 marer but couldn't quite get it close enough but it was going straight.  I was surprised since I haven't swung a club in what seems like forever.  I then moved to the 5 iron and was able to get it to about 150-170.  not bad.  not that accurate though but still straight.  I moved to the 3 iron but that shit is just impossible for me.  Long irons aren't my friends.  So I picked up the 5 and 3 woods and was able to hit those 200-220 off the mat.  not too bad.  I was feeling good about that.  I was able to hit it straight and somewhat long so yeah, not a bad day so far.  I then picked up the big guy, the driver and boy that was a challenge.  I was hitting the thing so horribly.  Just terrible.  Slice here, a hoot here, I would hit worm burners, top the damn ball.  Yikes.  It was bad.  So this kid comes up and he's beed playing so he's like "I bet I can hit the ball father than you can." And I didn't want to play since his dad was there not paying attention to him.  He offered me a challenge and I took it.  Oh well.  It was a young kid.  9-10 maybe, he could hit the ball though.  He busted out his driver and hit that ball 175-190.  Not bad at all for a little guy.  So I stepped up knowing that I was having problems with the driver but I still chose to go with the driver.  Stepped up, placed the ball on the tee, properly set my feel, looked at my stance and posture and proceeded with my backswing and BOOM! 250.  yeah, but barely 250, it was like 220 in the air and then more with the roll.  It ended about 250 from the driving mat.  I won that one.  he was a little surprised but wanted to move on to the accuracy challenge.  We wanted to see how close we could go towards the 50 yard marker.  he went first and yeah, he was damn good, he hit it just short of the marker but the bounce put him about a foot from it.  Not bad, actually that was great and I had a feeling that I might actually lose this one.  So I stepped up and took a crack.  It was a little over and the bounce didn't help.  I was about 5 feet from the thing.  So I said I would take another crack since there wasn't any rules on not taking it.  Took another swing and hit the fucking marker. Yeah!  The kid left me alone after that.  I then went back and practice my driver in hopes of perfecting it before next weekend's game.  After a whole lotta of driving, pitching short game work, long iron work, I felt the need to work on my putting.  That was sorely needing help at the beginning because I had forgotten how much to move the club and how hard to thit the ball.  It was a pain since the green was wet and it was getting late so there was little light to judg the breaks on the green.  I was getting better towards the end of practice but I ha to try the across the whole gree shot that I always do when leaving the driving range or the last hole.  It was about a 60-65 footer and it was hard.  There were probably 5 breaks on the green and you had to hit it just right so that on that last downhill break it won't be coming into the hole HOT.  Well enough of that, here's a damn picture.

      Well I really wasn't going to put this on here but since it's been two straight nights and rarely do I remember what my dreams were, I guess here goes...  So I had a dream about the future with you again last night.  It was nice.  In my dream we were living together (I'm just going to merge the two dreams together since they were the same).  We had our own place and we didn't have to live far from each other.  I don't exactly know what time of year it was but I know it was nice outside.  I also don't know where the heck we were.  Eh, that's alright.  So it was nice enough for us to be able to go outside and have a beer (well I know you would be drinking wine since you didn't like beer) but we were inside relaxing on the couch.  I was sitting up on the couch and you had your head on my lap and I was playing with your hair.  We were talking.  We were talking face to face like how we would be talking on the phone.  Relaxed and easy going.  We talked about going on vacation.   Either somewhere nice and warm with a beach or some winter place for skiing / snow boarding.  We talked about unberable Lightness of Being some more.  Hmm, I suppose after all this time that book is still a conversation peice in our lives (at least in the dreams).  We talked about different philosophies.  Since G.W. Bush was on TV talking about Iraq that somehow made it into my dreams as well so we were talking about that.  We each shared stories of early childhood and stories from family gatherings.  We talked about things we did together.  Yeah, it was really nice.  We lived in an apartment that had big windows, a balcony with a view and contemporary furniture.  The walls were white and so were the ceilings.  We had a his and her's laptop on a table.  It was a plain old table with a white top and white legs.  Our stuff was by our computers.  It was positioned that they were facing opposite directions.  Yeah.  Maybe we played some computer games against each other or together.  Yeah, geeky couple.  We also had this abstract sculpture thingy that was flowy and twisty and yeah.  It was black with a single ceiling spotight directly above it.  There was also art on the walls with spot lights for each peice.  Pictures as well.  You were wearing a white tank top and a black/ dark gray sweat pants and I was still in my work clothes.  I guess I work at a place where it is business attire for work.  I was wearing gray pants with a white shirt and no tie.  during the first night of the dream, it fast forwarded to the next day and I was at work.  You went to work or class, not really sure which on still.  and I decided to check your blog since I haven't done so for a while.  I read it and there it was, you were talking about me, you were talking about us.  It was nice.  The second part of the dream everything was occuring much slower and I was able to talk around (in my dream) and check out more of the place.  I didn't really go full out on the snooping.  Yeah...my dream for the past two nights.

      Well, today was a slow day.  I'm glad that it's almost over.  I think it's time for a new layout here.  It's hard to read expecially since I have the damn resolution so small on my work computer.  Eh.  It's spring.  Another season.  Time for a new look.  and yes.  I will go ahead and rip off someone's code and change it a little.  I am truly lazy.  I am also not in the possesion of my own domain so Meyh.  So I read A Modest Proposal again today after forgetting if I did read it in HS.  Crazy stuff.  I didn't give a shit about that thing back then but now I understand.  Crazy.  More Kundera to Read and then Ayn Rand's Fountainhead.  Thanks to the girlfriend.  Thanks baby!  Yeah, I wish there was more I would share with the world today but I don't feel like it right now.  Yeah.

      So my darling girlfriend lent me Milan Kundera's  The Unbearable Lightness of Being  and it is good.  Actually I started reading it a while back but something happened and yeah.  We won't get into that.  Anyways, it's back.  I can read again.  I am sad though since it is almost over.  It's been good.  It's a novel about four people and their choices in their lives.  It's really cool how one section is devoted to one character and then it goes through all of them one by one and then they slowly come together in the end.  At times it got hard to read because I'm not too familiar with the history behiind it.  It's been enjoyable so far and I can't imagine it to be not for the rest of the forty or so pages that I have left.  The movie was worthless (Meghan warned me anyways but I still wanted to see it).  We tried to watch it one time a couple of weeks ago but "distractions" prevented us from doing so.  It was nice that I could recognize some of the lines that the actors were saying on screen were directly from the book.  I liked the way that certain significant scenes from the book were also portrayed nicely on screen (the holding of hands through out the night, the screaming while making love etc.) but it was sorely missing the narration that just makes the whole book.  It could have been better if there was some sort of narrator to explain how their were feeling, the explanation of their past before they met each other etc. etc etc. (well like I said, I didn't really see a whole lot of the movie so that's what I got).  Anyways, the movie was bad but cute at the same time.  I still would think that one should read the book and just the book unless you want to get dissapointed by the movie or just watch it for the sake of novelty.  Another book that she lent me was The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand.  I plan on getting started on that one as soon as I finish The Unbearable Lightness of Being. It's pretty thick so it will take me a while.  I guess I'm some sort of retard as well since another work by this Author (Ayn Rand) is Atlas Shrugged.  Now I have not read that book but I think it's one of those well known books that people know about.  Now sure but I guess that too is worth a look.  I've also been looking at other Kundera books that I will probably purchase  I have read  urlLink The Unbearable Lightness of Being   So now I think I am hooked.  Here's the rest that I want to read.   urlLink The Book of Laughter and Forgetting    urlLink Identity: A Novel    urlLink Ignorance: A Novel    urlLink Laughable Loves    urlLink Immortality    urlLink The Art of the Novel    urlLink The Joke    urlLink Slowness: A Novel    urlLink Farewell Waltz: A Novel    urlLink Life is Elsewhere   There's a lot of reading and I am afraid that I don't know if I will like them all.  I guess I better start from the top huh?

      MY weekend was alright, I wanted to stay a little longer but it was a family weekend.  At least I saw you this weekend.  That was much needed.  It's Monday and so far this year Mondays haven't been the best day of the week.  It usually involves someone or talk about someone or an apparition of someone or whatever about someone.  I hope that that doesn't happen this Monday.  Anyways, Friday was blah.  I was stuck watching baseball till late that night.  We didn't go out till 11 pm - 11:30 pm.  We proceeded to go to I forgot the name of the place but we only stayed for a beer.  We then went to Bar Louie in Naperville.  I didn't realize that it was such a damn corporate chain.  IT was pretty cool.  It was almost like a miniature Alumni Club.  It really was a restaurant that becomes a bar at night/on the weekends.  Not bad not great.  So I was beginning to like the place.  It was climbing the ranks of possible Friday night hangouts until a fight broke out and a girl passed out by the bathroom area.  First the fight.  In the end there were two people with messed up noses.  It was bloody and ghetto-like.  Why can't people just get along?  I just happened to look up as the bigger guy is being held down by two little guys and the third guy rocks the bigger guys world with a couple of punches.  Eh it was entertaining for about 5 seconds as the place became a little jumpy.  Promptly after the clean up of the blood everywhere.  There was a chick by some speakers near the bathroom and she just abruptly passed out.  It was just that.  She was leaning towards the speakers and then, BAM!, she dropped to the ground like a sack of potatoes.  It was actually kind of funny because she got up and everything was alright so no one was hurt in that incident.  The promptly shut the bar down after that.  It was retarded.  They were supposed to be open for another couple of hours.  Eh, I guess that is what happens when there are fights.  It was just a little too ghetto for me.  I mean it's freakin' Naperville.  It was supposed to be a nice town.  I guess there's bad shit everywhere you go.  Saturday was just alright too.  Got up a little late but I was still able to make it to my Dad's birthday party.  That was good since I was able to eat some food.  I then played a little baseball with the cousins and Meghan called.  went and saw her for the night.  It was just one of those things.  I did make it in record time though.  3 hours to East Lansing but total time was 3:15 to her apartment.  not only did I have the eastern time change going against me, I had to go to some sort of service in freakin' Barrington at the Willow Creek Community Church.  I guess it was cool.  Not my thing.  I would have preferred to have had mass and then left.  Whatever.  We watched the ending of a Chinese movie that I didn't quite catch the title.  We tried to watch the end of the movie but we were both distracted with each other.  We finally finished the movie and got some food ready.  bought some frozen pizza and corn on the cob popcorn.  The popcorn was damn good.  Smelled good tasted good.  It was good.  After that, .... yeah.  The we watched another movie.  I haven't seen Breakfast at Tiffany's.  I really don't have much to say except that Audrey Hepburn is good looking.  That's it.  We finally got to bed around 6:30 - 7 AM Sunday and tried to sleep.  Slept till about 12 PM.  ...  Left her house around 12:40.  I got home around 3:45, about the same time that it took me to get there.  Ate some food and went to the apartment and passed out till about 9.  woke up, ate some tom yum soup and ice cream after a brief hello good bye with Meghan.  Reminded her to do her Econ homework and went to bed.  Yeah that was my weekend.  I thought it was a good balance of friends, girlfriend, family and alone time.  I hope everyone had a good Easter and have a great week.

      Halo is still a sweet ass game.  I don't care what people say.  It's still fun.  I must admit the graphics are now showing their age but the game play is still top notch.  Jerry (one of the guys that I live with) and I played a little Halo before the highly anticipated sweep of the Pirates in the hands of the Cubs and it was a whole lotta fun.  We played Slayer Pro 2 player death match on the map Derelict.  I haven't played Halo on XBOX for a little while now so it did take a little bit of getting used to to be able to play with some skill.  I was getting slaughtered.  I was getting slaughtered severely.  I was really getting embarrassed with my game play.  I haven't sucked that bad since I started playing the damn game.  It was terrible.  My scoping was slow, my targeting was way of.  I couldn't even kill him with a fucking shotgun.  Kill after kill, I grew more and more frustrated, but I didn't lose my cool.  I knew it was going to come back to me.  The score was 8-0, with Jerry taking credit for all kills so far.  Suddenly with a chance kill with a grenade, I was able to rattle off 12 straight to catch up and take the lead.  We exchanged kills for the next few respawns and it was fun.  A couple kills here a couple of deaths there.  The score was now 18-23 with me needing two more to take the win.  Jerry then goes on a mini tear and gets me three straight times.  Once with a shotgun, a grenade and a shot to the head with the pea shooter pistol.  Score 21-23.  I was getting scared.  I knew Jerry had been playing a while now, he's been practicing at certain levels with the sniper rifle and the pea shooter but I didn't expect this sort of skill increase.  He has gotten better, a lot better.  I give him props for raising his skill to the next level.  He is now a worthy adversary and an even better partner.  I won the game 25-21 with sniper shot to the head and a nearby grenade.  After that we played Snipers on the level with the warthogs and the desert.  I forgot the name but that started out the same as well.  I was getting picked off left and right.  I couldn't get a kill nor get my sights lined up correctly on him that I missed.  But then again, that's what you get when you play against a good player.  I was shot and killed 5 straight times and it was just hell because I did so well the first game and here we go again.  Mind you the kill limit is 15 so it's not going to be another marathon.  This is some sort of a sprint and yes, it was frantic.  He too has also gotten more proficient with the sniper rifle.  I couldn't believe it.  Shots that he would normally miss were hitting me and the little moves that I would do to avoid his shots were only buying me a few seconds to get cover.  I had to adjust and adjust I did.  Came back and got the game even.  And then it was a 1 for 1 scenario from then on.  I pulled ahead by a couple after he pulled of three straight kills.  Man was it intense.  I give him even more credit.  He is definitely better then the last time I played him.  He better with everything, grenades, rocket launchers, pea shooters, shotgun, sniper rifle, shotgun, everything.  I still won Snipers 15-13.  A lot tougher this time around because of the vastness of the level but, myeh, it's all good.  I'm really glad that he's better so when HALO 2 comes out, it's just going to be nuts!  Yes, the game is a lot of fun single player as there are unlimited amounts of enemies to plow down and the plot/story is solid but where it lacks in multiplayer and it's age, it makes up for in multiplayer fun.  I still suggest this game for people who own an XBOX but don't have Halo but I wouldn't suggest buying it for full price, try and scope around to make sure that you get a used one in good shape.  It's still worth the $30 to go buy it while waiting for Halo 2.  Now I do admit that I bought the XBOX for Halo 2, I'm glad that I bought Halo to prep myself for Halo 2.  Halo 2  I can't wait for this game.  This is going to be sweet.  This is probably the most highly anticipated game of the season for XBOX.  From a continuation of the first storyline to improvements in multiplayer game play, SHIT.  This better be good.  With games like this, one can't help but scrutinize every single fault that the game has.  I mean it's been delayed so many fucking times that when it comes out, it just better be perfect because if it's not, they will most definitely lose a lot of their fan base for constantly disappointing fans by delaying the game and then on top of that putting a product out that is well below the populace's expectations.  A few highlights that I have read about Halo 2 multiplayer are but not limited to  New maps - I am curious about what kinds of environments that Bungie made up to reinvent the wheel.  I mean you can always have the multi tiered huge as sniping levels that could take hours to accumulate 25 kills in to the oh so intimate killing rooms where to reach 25 kills would only take 10 minutes.  I hear that there will be around three classic maps that will be added to the game.  That's always fun but who is going to decide which is the coolest?  Vehicles - along with the warthog, the banshee and the ghost.  All of these will be playable in multiplayer with their  respective maps.  Remember the really big open maps where it would take forever to traverse from one end to the other on foot and even on a warthog, the Covenant ships have some sort of booster that will allow you to take a banshee and get to the other side of the map faster than ever.  The Covenant will be playable - this gives another dimension to the while thing.  I think you can play as an Elite and have their weapons but also use human weapons as well.  Sarge is still there (DUH!) but it would also be cool to have another class of humans to play as.  It would be cooler since it would really differentiate the characters.  Heck you can even put attributes to certain characters.  Say for the other class of humans, you can make them be hurt easier because they don't have the armor suit that Master Chief has.  Since they don't have the suit, they can run faster and aim their sniper rifles better.  I don't know, just an Idea.

      Yeah, I was a little on the bored side today so I decided to make things a little easier to read for everyone.  no more bullshit pop-ups, not more stupid chatter box (although that was kinda cool) no stupid game that no one plays.  I admit, I just copied this and pretty much ripped it off but hey it said it was alright so I did it anyways.  Hmm, definitely easier to read.  Alrighty, have a good one!

      Yeah.  Yesterday I was just too tired from the whole weekend.  From the time I walked in the door at work, I just wanted to leave and take a long nap.  Actually I just wanted to stay in EL for another day!  But nope, I live in the real world and work in the real world so I had to do what I had to do.  At work, it was just a little to hectic for me to enjoy myself at work.  I don't know if I was being rude to a lot of people but I know I was being indifferent and not showing much emotion.  Eh oh well, they'll just deal I guess.  My dad called sunday night to see how to fix the monitor.  It was not working.  I don't exactly know what could have happened but I suggested to unplug it from the computer and try it on their laptops.  I'm not sure if they did that but it looks like they didn't.  My mom then called Monday night to see if I wanted to come over for some shabu shabu.  See, the way we do it is we boil the water and all the stuff in it already and have the raw ingedients ready on the side.  by the time I got there last night, it was already made.  They made it the day before so I think it still counts as shabu shabu.  I got there and looked at the computer.  Unplugged the power cable and plugged it back in.  It worked!  so I proceeded to do laundry at my parents house and eat dinenr there.  Before I had dinner I went to the mall to see if they have the shoes that I want for cheap.  they did, but it was still the same price.  I also perused the "From Chicago, With Love" store for any touristy goodies that are worth getting but I guess getting people you don't know little gifts might freak them out.  Whatever I guess. Went home and had dinner.  It was good.  shabu shabu, rice and philipino style pork chops and salad.  yeah.  It was a good dinner.  I put some aside for lunch today and I can't wait to eat it!  3 more hours and I can go eat!  I also watched one my shows.  So besides Star Trek (the new one with Scott Bacula, formerly of Quantum Leap), Star Gate and Smallville.  I also try to follow the stupid drama One Tree Hill.  yeah.  I know I am a sap.  Whatever.  I don't judge people with what they watch so whatever.  anyways.  I did that and it hit a little close to hime because it dealt with pregnancy and having a kid way too early.  I got somewhat bothered by it all, I wasn't balling or anything, I was just thinking of what could be if other paths were taken.  It really is no use to think like that because it already happened but sometimes you just can't help it.  After that I finished my laundry and went home.  Called the girlfriend and talked for a while.  She was tired and stressed from all the studying that she has to do for her last three weeks of school for this year.  I tried to alleviate her stress by talking about other things that isn't school.  Like a little break.  I don't know if it worked but I gave it a shot.  Called her again later in the night to talk to her about a problem that seems to keep coming back.  It's going to be okay.  Things will get and be better baby.  after that I couldn't sleep for a little bit so I made some nachos and cracked open a miller lite and watched the late edition of sports center.  I fell asleep after a little while of that.  Woke up and went to work and here I am.  Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead and philipino pork chops for lunch.  It was also recently brought to my attention that Worms3d came out so I will look at the local blockbuster for a copy to rent.  Wish me luck!

      I really had a great weekend pt. 2  So yeah.  I was going to Iowa to go see my kid.  The day started out alright.  I went and drank a little too much Thursday night.  I was hurting Friday morning as well as feeling shitty for something that was said the previous night.  eh.. fast forward.  Went back home and packed some shit to take to Iowa and off we go.  The drive was fast.  I got to Sam's in about 4 hours.  That's pretty good considering it was about 320 miles, I was averaging around 80 the whole way.  ======== I don't condone speeding.  with that said, there are two type of speeding, wreckless and safe.  Let me go of on a tangent real quick here.  Wreckless speeding involves the weaving in and out of traffic.  The safe speeding is the going fast on long straightaways and when there usually isn't anyone around.  Granted both of these are still breaking the law, it's still safer to drive safe and not wreckless. ========  I went through a really bad thunderstorm.  Big droplets of rain were coming down as if it hasn't rained for a millenia.  The droplets then turned into hail.  The hail was small enough that I wasn't worried that it could cause some body damage or whatever.  There was a lot of lightning going on.  Once the big ones start striking together, it would light up the whole night sky with this eeri glow.  Innannimate objects looked murderous and at the same time calm.  Yes, it was a little fucked up.  Amongst the lightning and thunder and hail, there was a little funnel cloud that I spotted after the lightning show commenced.  It was cool to see shit like that and I was glad that it was far enough away that it couldn't reach the highway just yet.  Yeah.  cool shit.  Got to Sam's and hung out there for a while.  Met his girlfriend, Laura.  what a sweet girl.  I didn't really talk to her a lot but we did interact somewhat.  I asked how they met and the regular rigamarole.  She was so sweet and nice that I felt bad for making off color comments and shit like that for fear of disapproval.  They seem really comfortable with each other and make each other happy and content.  It's good to see that someone with pure intentions actually give Sam the attention and devotion that he deserves since he as been through a lot with his previous shit.  I also met this chick Janine.  She's seems like a free spirit.  very easy to talk to and open minded.  She was cool.  We then proceeded to watch Battle Royal.  I don't know if anyone else has seen it but t's about a class that get's drugged and put on an island to kill each other.  The kids in this movie, not just the class but the whole "kid" population just doesn't respect the elders anymore and are just a bunch of deliquents.  So there's this Battle Royal Act that was passed alowing military people to kidnap and put these kids into this competition or something like that.  Anyways, I got the people that were there to be into the movie.  I was glad that they were starting to like it.  The we got this drunk ass who walks in with his drunk ass girlfriend.  So there we were watching the movie and peole are into it then bam, drunk ass comes and barges in and is all loud about the movie and making fun of how they spoke, how it was a useless movie because "you had to read what they were takin'" yeah, it was just not a good sight.  I was starting to get irritated by all of this because of the fact that I was tired and this guy was being rude.  Not only to me but to the other two people who were watching the movie before he walked in and made himself that center of drunk attention.  His girlfriend on the other hand couldn't stop talking.  She just couldn't  They already went to the bar and had a few drinks there.  She was already "Feelin' good" as she sptly put it.  She couldn't stop proclaiming that she was feeling good and frankly, it was starting to get annoying.  Here I was trying to "read what they were talkin'" and at the same time tune out the constant babble that was all about being drunk.  It was just too hard.  Then I thought to myself, "Well, they really don't know what they are doing and they're not really doing it on purpose so why am I getting upset?"  I just rolled with it, cracked open another beer and lit up a smoke and tried to have fun with the rest of the people there.  then Meghan called, I took a much needed break from all the rowdiness to have a nice talk with my girlfriend.  Yes, Meghan, my girlfriend.  We talked about the party that she was going to go to the next night.  Who was going to be there, food that was supposed to be bought.  We talked about what would happen is her ex showed up.  We talked about our day.  It was nice.  went back in and socialized with the rest of everyone.  Went to bed around 4.  Saturday was just a dissapointing day.  Didn't see Bryce.  ======== See previous post ========  went to King Buffet.  It was your typical chinese buffet with all the regular goodies that you might expect from a place like this.  Fried rice, white rice, lo lein noodles, chicken on a stick, kun pow chicken, egg drop soup, hot and sour soup, spring rolls, egg rolls, sea food combo, peppered beef and etc etc etc.  Yeah I was full.  Since Jenny didn't call back nor answer the fucking phone, we went and saw Kill Bill.  It's not like I didn't want to see it, I wanted to but I was looking forward to seeing my kid before that.  Alas, none of that.  KD V2 was alright.  Well, it was good.  Liked the kung fu a lot.  Liked the shots.  The cheesy 70's music playing.  Liked the story and the twist.  Liked the movie.  Not better than the first one but still good.  after that we decided to go to this sports store because I was looking for some shoes.  I need new shoes for the trip to NY City that I'm taking Meghan with.  That should be fun.  We're going to experience NY City on a college budget.  This will prove to be more memorable from the long drives to the crappy motels that we will be staying at.  It should be fun.  Back to Iowa, yeah after Kill Bill, we went to this store that looked like a Galyans but it wasn't.  It was some sort of hunting outdoor shit super store!  It was still fun.  We played with stupid orange hats.  I wore these white trash hats that made me look retarded.  Ahh, it was fun because even the regular shoppers there were smirking at my stupidy.  Whatever, as long as no one gets hurt, it's all good.  After that, Sam and Laura went and said Hi to Moe at Walmart.  I just stayed in the car becase I tried to call Jenny and then I wanted to talk to Meghan.  Jenny was being a bitch  Meghan was as accomodating as one can get when busy.  It was sweet.  After talking to her, I felt better.  After that she went to her party and we just hung out at Sam's house.  Oh we also played basketball.  God it was hot.  I needed a couple of glasses of water since I lost so much water through sweat.  Eh it was still fun.  I enjoyed.  After that we hung out.  Yeah.  hung out and watched SNL.  It really isn't that good anymore.  Grr. Grr. Grr.  Had a few beers and everyone gravitated towards Sam's room around 3 so I decided to go to bed.  around 6 aM.  A drunk girl calls me on the phone.  hehe.  It's my girlfriend.  Wow and she seemed loaded.  It was cute.  (okay okay, I will stop spreading the drunkeness).  HeHe.  what a cutie.  Sunday  Yeah.  Let's just say it was a lot of driving.  again, let's not talk about the other shit that happened but I left Iowa around 10:30 and got to IL around 2:30 in the afternoon.  Cubs were still playing.  I wanted to see Meghan so I did.  I drove all the way from Iowa to Michigan.  Yeah, I am crazy.  It was worth it.  Apparently Meghan had a lot of fun the night before and was still paying for it.  Cute.  Live and learn I suppose.  Well for this instance it's drink and learn.  We hung out.  Ate a little bit of food and was just lazy.  She did homework and I tried to do Japanese.  I could't Eh, it's alright.  I got there and was prety damn tired but managed to do stuff still.  We went and had Subway and rented sprit away.  Great movie.  I want to see it again.  we tried to sleep but found it a challenge.  Next morning.  I wasn't feeling the leat bit able to go to work.  I had some sort of bug it was terrible.  Joint sche.  stuffy nose.  Slight fever.  Maybe it was from the window being open all night.  I dunno.  I just felt like crap and would pass out if I tried to drive anywhere.  So I stayed an extra day trying to recuperate.  The next day I was let loose in the town of East Lansing, MI.  There were a ton of hotties around.  It really was spring when you see a lot more girls with a lot more skin showing.  It was Hot!  There were a couple of times during the day when things weren't as pleasant but overall it was still a good time spent with my girlfriend.  here at work now.  Drove a lot this weekend.  It was fun.  I suppose I am practicing for the New York Drive.  I can't wait to go on vacation.  I'm due for one.  It should be a good time.  Sigh, back to work.

      Ever (NOT SO FUCKING) Dearest Jenny (you fucking bitch),  I called you last weekend to tell you that I was coming to town and wanted to hang out with Bryce.  I wanted to see my son.  What the fuck is your GOD DAMN Issue?  I told you a week in advance so that you can tell YOUR mother, who ultimately takes care of Bryce because you are too busy smoking your fucking pot and being lazy doing nothing else but be a fucking bum, to not go anywhere because I wanted to take Bryce to the zoo.  I wanted to take him to the fucking zoo even if that entailed being around you and having to interact with you.    You know what, I envy people who can cleanly break all ties with and not have to deal with their ex-significant others.  I don't have that.  I don't want to deal with you anymore.  You always continue to let me down and let my plans down.  There was ample time for you to tell your mom that I was coming to town.  There was ample time for you to have him ready for that one day that I was going to be there.  There were only a few things that you had to do so that it was possible for me to take my own damn son somewhere so that I can be a dad to him.  You can't even do that.  You even had the fucking nerve to be upset with me because I was upset that I couldn't take Bryce.  Don't try to pin this shit on me bitch.  Don't tell me that I didn't tell you early enough so that your mother could know.  There was a week.  A whole fucking week.  Seven days.  One hundred and sixty eight hours.  Ten thousand and eighty minutes.  I gave you at least that much to tell your mother.  You couldn't even offer the idea of just leaving Bryce at home with his grandfather while your mom and sister went out and bought her prom dress.  At least take him for the day.  I was up at 10 waiting for your call.  I called before going to lunch but you didn't answer the phone.  You could've at least told them that you were taking Bryce so that I can see him.  You couldn't even do that for me.  That's seems so simple to everyone except you.  There's always something that magically appears and fucks up everything that I try to do.  I mean really.  The time before this, there was a fucking "misunderstanding" (more like you didn't tell them) about when I was going to be in town that they went out of town.  Hell even before that, you couldn't take a fucking week off so that I can take Bryce out to Florida.  Shit I was even paying for you so that I could at least take Bryce and have him see my family.  I was going to pay for you and I told you about that plan three months in advance.  you never did ask to take it off from work.  You never did once ask at your job to see if you can work more hours before or after to make up for the lost time.  Not the slightest effort.  I expected more but I guess that was expecting way too much from you.  Just too much.  A simple phone call after I called last weekend to your mother would have sufficed.  Just to let her know that I was going to be in town.  A call on Friday night to let me know that you did talk to your mother about the plans.  A call in the morning to let me know that he was going to be available.  A call after noon after I called you Saturday afternoon to let me know what is going on with Bryce.  If you also picked up your fucking phone once in a while that would also be great.  You fucking bitch.  You can't even help me out here?

      Yeah, I am worthy to be dumped now.  It feels shitty.  I mean I tried to do everything right.  My major downfall was that I was clingy.  Yes, clingy.  Everything good and right that I did was null compared to clingy.  What the fuck?  I loved this girl.  Yes, I fell in love with her.  After all the shit that has happened with her and her ex boyfriend, I was still there because I thought it would work.  I guess I was the only one that thought it would REALLY work.  It's just unfortunate that all that shit is nothing to her anymore.  That clingyness wins above all else.  Fuck I wasn't even that clingy.  I didn't call every hour on the hour.  I didn't write a billion emails.  Sure I called when I had a break at work but I knew she wasn't in class so I figure I would call her to say HI or whatever.  Whenever I was at my desk reading stuff and wanted to share something, I would just open up a new email and I would sent it to her.  Is that fucking clingy?  It sucks to think that I was clingy for wanting just a little bit of time and affection/attention from her.  Just a little bit to make me feel like I was wanted (kinda like how I make her feel).  She wanted space.  Well actually she didn't even ask that.  Hmm, maybe I'll share the whole story.  It started out when things were going shitty for her.  Job was not working out, school schedule was not going well, Japan was coming closer and yeah, stressful.  Being the -CLINGY- me, I felt a little shoved out of the way.  I was still there for her to talk to, for her to share and vent her frustrations to but at the same time it just seemed that she was forgetting me.  I was feeling unappreciated.  I sent her an email expressing how I felt.  The email pretty much explained that I really had strong feelings for her so I told her that if this feeling is still around in the future, I would move and follow her to where she would go because of how strongly I felt.  That freaked her out.  Next day is when things really turned out to be shitty.  See we used to email each other about how our days were going.  I emailed her and she didn't email back.  I checked my other email and there it was.  She was freaked out and didn't want to talk if the topic of conversation was "the state of the nation"  That was it.  I then wrote another email saying that I over reacted to the situation and just got caught up in the situation.  She didn't like that either but she never did ask for space.  A simple email saying that things are a little hectic now would have been appropriate.  Nope, she said that she has to think about the relationship now and didn't want to talk to me.  So naturally that's always a sign that things are going bad.  She had to think about things because of the email that I sent.  Fast forward to today.  According to her, I did everything right.  I was there for her, I gave her support, I was someone to talk to regarding everything from her day to whatever was bothering her.  I was just clingy.  Yeah, clingy.  Well what the fuck.  Maybe if you opened the eyes that said "I LOVE YOU" and saw that all I needed was a little attention then I would have been fine.  That was it.  I called and was worried about the relationship and asked if I was still her boyfriend.  She didnt like that.  She went to a party and spent the night there.  Well fuck yeah I'm going to worry if I'm still the boyfriend.  It's hard to find your footing if things aren't going well.  I guess my clingyness is a stress to her and she doesn't like stress.  I  got dropped.  The week before finals things are stressful, I'm dumped.  It's her personal sanity that's important to her.  I'm not helping so I got dumped.  Because of being clingy.  Shit.  Well there's the New York trip.  There goes someone who was really special.  I can't change who I am.  I don't think I was that clingy.  I wanted to be there for her but I guess I was there too much.  That's shitty.  I mean I made her feel like the most specialest (yes I am good with English, fuck off) person to me in the world because she was.  I made her feel wanted, desired, special, smart, worthy, funny everything that I thought she was.  What do I get?  This.  How unfair is this FUCKING WORLD?  I deserve better.  I really do.  I thought that being good to someone equates to them being good to you too.  I guess the fucking world doesn't work that way.  I belive in Karma and all I did for her and to her were things that I thought were sweet and I wanted some in return, hell who am I kidding here, I wanted more in return.  See I don't understand it, I didn't fucking hit her, I didn't fucking steal from her, I didn't lie to her, frankly all I did was love her.  I wasn't whipped or whatever the word is, I fell in love with this girl.  What a curshing feeling to layout how you feel about someone and to have that someone freak out and leave you.  It really makes you question another addage that comes to mind, "Good guys finish last"  Yeah, I was a good guy.  Things were going well for a while.  I guess I didn't keep my feelings in check.  Was I wrong or doing so.  My world wasn't her.  I did my job as work, I went out with friends and I talked to the girlfriend.  That was  my world.  She was a part of my world and now that she's gone I really can't explain how shitty I feel.  There were a bunch of things that I didn't like about her but the most pressing was the fact that she didn't show me affection.  I would show my affection by getting her groceries and little gifts, going out for dinner, doing things together you know? things that build memories (and to help her out since she was a college student).  I guess she didn't appreciate that because she felt stifled.  She explained to me that she showed affection by talking.  Yes, talking.  I gave her so much talking so I gave her more affection.  I did.  I gave her what she thought was affection by talking to her everyday and doing things and getting things for her.  She couldn't give it back by saying little things here and there to show me that I was appreciated.  No little emails to thank me for being there for her.  Nothing.  Don't get me wrong here.  She would be affectionate when I'm around but when we're alone.  I can't even hug her in public.  That's kinda shitty actually I wasn't happy about that.  Even though all this shit was going on, I still found it in me to look past it and love this girl for who she is.  Love her for all the good in her as well as the bad.  It sucks that she doesn't want to look past things that she's not happy in me.  I feel worthless.  I feel that I wasn't worth it to give just a little bit of affection and attention.  I feel worthless because she doesn't want to keep working on this.  I feel worthless because the last fucking serious relationship she was in, she stayed for two fucking years.  TWO FUCKING YEARS and all the time she would constantly catch him lying to her, at one point trying to sleep with her friend, he was addicted to sleeping pills (yeah sorry to divulge that but I feel it's necessary to get my god damn point across).  She stayed with him for two years after all that shit.  Sure there were good times and all, I mean there has to be for two years worth of that shit, but really I only had a fucking fraction of that time and BAM!  Because of being clingy when things aren't going well she dumps me.  Shit she even checks out his life through his webpage.  How would that make someone feel?  If you were in a relationship with someone and all they did was checkup on their Ex's life, would you feel a little shitty?  Would you feel a little unappreciated?  Would you feel worthless?  Wow.  I never understood that, why would chicks stay with assholes and then find a nice guy and do the nice guy thing for a while and then decide to drop them.  I mean really, she wanted me to call everyday and I wanted to call everyday.  I would send her emails everyday and she would do the same.  We both liked the attention.  Or at least, I did.  It still doesn't change how shitty and worthless I feel.  See here was something that I wanted to do for myself and her as well.  I haven't been on vacation for quite a long time.  She has been in school for a while now and since she's going to study abroad and go back to MSU right after that, I wanted to take her on vacation with me.  It would have been a romantic vacation.  First we were planning on New York for a week.  Everything was somewhat planned out and the biggest thing was the lodging.  My parents offered their timeshare in NJ an hour away from New York.  We were going to hang out in Central Park, go to a few museums, see a broadway show.  We were also going to Montauk Bay in Long Island because that's where part of the movie Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind was filmed.  We were going to spend a special romantic relationship building week together.  Nope that didn't happen.  I guess it "slipped" her mind and forgot that she had to house sit her mother's house.  So the whole New York thing was now being cut off to be a short on.  Instead of a week, we're going to be there for five days and I would be at her mom's house hanging out with her while she house sit.  Well that didn't work out either because she needs to work.  Hmm, that sucks even more.  So we then planned to have a nice romantic weekend in Toronto.  Go stay at a swanky hotel.  Check out the clubs out there.  Be a couple with out any worries in the world.  Well that's not going to work anymore since I don't have anyone romantic to go on vacation with.  I guess I'm just not going to take my vacation time and just do it some other time when someone who actually will appreciate me is willing to put up with my being clingy.  I don't even try to be clingy but whatever.  Yes, dreams and plans that fall apart.  I wanted it to work.  I wanted things to blossom into a fruitful and loving relationship.  I guess some people had other plans.  I still feel shitty but really I don't think anyone can help me out here.  It sucks to that she said that if I didn't call things would have been better.  Well it's a good thing that I did so to get how you really feel out rather than letting it fester.  It's over now.  I'm back to being single.  I've was single for a while.  I was fine then I think I will be okay.  In fact I remember being single and being happy.  Deep inside though, there's that feeling of wanting to share yourself with someone special.  Someone who I can be romantic with.  Someone who will appreciate me as well.  I learned a few things from her.  First and foremost was I absorbed a lot of her be a high culture chick.  I appreciate art and reading.  I learned to think about things a different way.  I learned to be understanding (but not understanding enough).  I learned about a wonderful person who I fell for.  I learned things but I can't help of hearing the song by Linkin Park...   "I tried so hard and got so far.  In the end, it doesn't even matter"   Yeah, that's my theme song for this relationship.  I really tried so hard to be everything, in the end, she didn't want that.  How dumb of me.  So with that I guess that wraps up my whole weekend.  It's shitty.  Actually it's pretty damn shitty.  Besides losing a special girl, I can't help feeling lonely, alone, worthless.  Meghan I told you to not read this but I'm sure you will anyways.  I hope that you will be happy with your decision.  I hope that this decision will make you happier than I made you.  I will miss you but if you don't want to work through things then it is definitely better that we go our separate ways.  If I am the only one watering the plant then fuck it.  It's really not worth it to continue.  If I will be the only one working here then that's it.  I really did fall for you.  I would have given you the stars and the moon.  Apparently, it's not what you wanted.  I hope that the next guy will make you happier than I did.  I hope that both of you will be clingy together and be happy.  Someone deserves your love and someone deserves mine as well.  I wish you good life.  Something tells me that you'll just forget about me soon anyways.  Like you said, it's early enough in the relationship that this will be easy for you.  Again have a good life and stop reading this.  Your next boyfriend deserves more attention than you give your boyfriends.  I love you.  Good luck.

      So this weekend is supposed to be shitty, weather-wise.  I hope that it's just the weather that will be shitty.  Tonight is Rick's birthday.  We're supposed to go to Voodoo to celebrate.  I'm not really too keen on Voodoo since the last time I was there, it was all ghetto and shit.  I hope that the place won't attract the ghettoness tonight but then again it might be worse.  Tomorrow (Saturday) is my company's open house for customers and the public.  They have a few presentations and such and tours.  Good thing I won't be here.  I'm not really involved in sales nor the advertising/marketing side of things so there's no reason for me to be here.  In the afternoon I am helping one of the mechanics here at my company with their computer problems.  I'm sure I will just reformat the reinstall everything.  I'm probably going to download any service patches that need to be installed as well as programs/games.  That shouldn't take long.  After that, relax for a bit at home and then get ready for North Beach on Saturday.  I heard that it's better than the Thursdays there so it's definitely worth checking out.  Sunday is free.  It's free all damn day.  I really don't know what to do on Sunday.  Maybe I'll do laundry then.  I kinda don't want to do anything right now.  Yeah, those are my plans for the weekend.  I hope you have a good time at the party.

      Went to North Beach last night.  I swear it was fucking FAT GIRLS night!  It was all about the heffers and ghetto hood rats last night.  I was not impressed.  I mean from the moment we got there all that I saw were big girls.  I mean there were cute girls there too don't get me wrong but shit!  Not enough of them!  Besides the big chicks, there were also a few MILFs in the crowd.  I mean WOW!!!  Hot ass moms!  But that's about as HOT as they got!  I could count the hotties and cuties at the bar on two hands.  Shit!  Good things we don't pay for beer there anymore nor have to pay for cover.  Shots still need to be purchased.  So after paying for the first pitcher to look like we are buying, we got a new pitcher everytime we were low.  It was cool.  So after a few pitchers, I got bored so I started dancing.  It was shitty.  No one on the dance floor could dance.  I could see that the people were having fun and that was cool.  The others who thought they were good but weren't were in need of a little shaming.  So there was this one guy with his shirt unbuttoned and a black wife beater on with big baggy pants.  Ghetto ass motherfucker.  Just one of those slimeball peices of shit.  Yeah you know what I'm talking about.  Yeah, he had an attitude that he was the best dancer there.  So being the jackass that I am, I went ahead and copied his moved right behind him.  He would do that fag twirl and eventually twirl his way to that he was facing me and I would just stop.  My buddies were cracking up as well as the other people around us.  The guy actually thought he was being watched because he was good.  He would crack his neck to the right and I would be right there with him, he would bounce his shoulders and I would bouncing them at the same time.  People were just pointing and laughing.  It was great!  He was oblivious to what the hell was going on.  Eventually, the bouncer crept to where I was and I just thought that was a signal that I should stop.  I mean this guy has it out for me.  That fucker last week told me to put my hat straight (it was straight, I don't know what he was talking about) or else he was going to throw us out.  The he went over to Jerry to tell him to put his hat straight.  It was!!!  We both had it straight!!!  Damn fucker.  Last night maybe I can understand since mocking people will uually irritate them.  Oh well, whatever, I was having fun.  If it's too hot on the dance floor go to the damn bathroom.  We then retreated to the bar and chilled out for a while and eventually went home.  It was an alright night out.  I wish there were more people who can actually dance and I can learn from.  Got home and really wanted to call you.  I'm sure you were busy so I didn't.  It's finals week and things are hectic.  I didn't want to take anymore of your time that you need to use for other things.

President Bush, in 1972 did your father arrange to have your cocaine arrest expunged from the records through a judge, a close-acquaintance of your fathers, in exchange for you to perform community service at Project Pool, a Houston inner-city program that mentors youth in poor neighborhoods?  3. President Bush, was your friend from the National Guard, James R. Bath, arrested for cocaine around the same time? Is this why both of your National Guard records show suspensions in 1972 for refusal to submit to annual medical exams? Is this why you were no longer allowed to fly? If so, why did you make up the story that you no longer WANTED to fly?  4. President Bush, do you remember Bill Calhoun from your National Guard duty in Alabama? No one else remembers your serving in the National Guard in Alabama at that time, but "coincidentally" the Republican National Committee suddenly found this Bill Calhoun to vouch for you. Is Mr. Calhoun a paid operative of the Republican Party? Or did he just volunteer to lie to save your reputation?  5. James R. Bath was appointed by your father as a CIA operative in 1976 leasing aircraft in Houston and serving as a liaison between wealthy Arab sheiks (including the Bin Ladens) and American entrepreneurs. According to all sources, Baths company served as a front for the CIA. Before 1976, Bath was broke, according to all accounts. What was it that prompted your father to select James R. Bath in 1976? Did he hold incriminating evidence against you?  6. James R. Bath, representative of wealthy Saudi sheiks, channeled investment money into your first company in 1977, Arbusto Energy Corporation of Midland, Texas. Were you personally acquainted with Salem bin Laden (Osamas brother) and Khalid bin Mahfouz (Osamas brother-in-law) who poured thousands into your first company and millions into your subsequent enterprises?  7. Mr. Bush, how did you profit $880,000 from Harken Energy (your fourth company), when all other investors lost 90%? Why didnt the SEC (under your fathers administration) look into the matter of your sale of stock a week before the stock collapsed?  8. Mr. Bush, how did Harken Energy (who had never explored off-shore) land the contract off Bahrain in 1990 when your father was President of the United States? Who, then, worked up the sweetheart deal under the table?  9. Khalid bin Mahfouz, whose younger sister married Osama bin Laden, was director of the powerful Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia and also served as director of BCCI (Bank of Credit & Commerce International) which laundered money for the CIA under the watch of your father. He was also part of the IRAN-CONTRA scheme (Ollie North) and the savings & loan debacle of the 80s. Mahfouz was also one of your prime investors (through James R. Bath, your Guard buddy) in your 4 failed firms. Khalid bin Mahfouz has also been tagged by the CIA for funneling millions to his brother-in-law, Osama, since the 1980s through 2004. Why, then, are you EXEMPTING Mahfouzs banking activities from being closed down? The 9/11 families especially WANT TO KNOW. (9/11 families are incensed at Bush for exempting these Saudi royals connected to Osama bin Laden.)  10. Why will you not release the August 6, 2001 brief from the CIA (delivered to you personally at Crawford) as part of the 9/11 Investigation? Did the memo not warn that Al Qaeada was planning imminent hijackings flying airliners into American buildings?  11. Mr. President, did you authorize contracting out the gathering of intelligence to a group called OFFICE OF SPECIAL PLANS? Was not this group closely associated with the Republican Party? Did the OFFICE OF SPECIAL PLANS circumvent the use of the CIA for the sole purpose of lending credibility to your pre-conceived notion that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction and was poised to use them against the U.S. and its allies? Was there another ulterior motive in contracting OFFICE OF SPECIAL PLANS ($80 million taxpayer money)? Since OSP is a private enterprise, the Congress cannot oversee its operations. Thus, you were free to dismiss any congressional inquiries. Is this correct?  12. Mr. President, who was on staff at the OFFICE OF SPECIAL PLANS? Were they not close to your administration and were part of the formation of PNAC (Project for a New American Century) in 1997? Was not the PNAC determined to invade Iraq regardless if Saddam was there or not even if no WMD existed?  13. Mr. President, did not the PNAC write a policy statement in September 2000 in which they believed a new Pearl Harbor was necessary to rouse Americans to back a war against Iraq?  14. Mr. President, name members of your administration who also serve or have served with the Project for a New American Century (PNAC  15 An organization/business called CARLYLE GROUP, whose members include 3 Bin Laden brothers, your father, James Baker, Frank Carlucci, and several others from your administration, serves as a conduit for weapons sales between major defense contractors and governments all over the world. CARLYLE also rebuilds defense companies both financially and through market availability. Mr. President, you also served with the CARLYLE GROUP 1990-92. Dont you find this organization and its members in conflict of interest since they come directly from high government positions and are now selling weapons systems to those same governments? Dont you find it a conflict of interest when the CARLYLE GROUP advises governments what weapons systems to procure and what strategies to use against potential enemies?  16. Mr. President, were you really born again upon Billy Grahams visit to your fathers summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine? Or was this another ploy to cover your future political aspirations where you foresaw the need to sway the Southern vote to lock up elections?  17. Mr. President, did God really speak to you in 1999 and predict your rise to the presidency? While you were sitting at your mothers church in Houston?  18. Mr. President, did God really direct you to strike Afghanistan, then Iraq, and then turn your attention to the 2004 election? (As you claimed to the Prime Minister Mahmoud Abba of the Palestinians)  According to Abbas, immediately after the peace negotiations Bush said: "God told me to strike at al Qaida and I struck them, and then he instructed me to strike at Saddam, which I did, and now I am determined to solve the problem in the Middle East. If you help me I will act, and if not, the elections will come and I will have to focus on them." June 25, 2003 Ha'aretz - Israeli Press Article  19. Mr. President, who were the White House staffers who leaked information to Bob Novak and five other prominent journalists concerning Ambassador Joseph Wilsons wife, Valerie Plame, a CIA operative? Wasnt vengeance their prime motive? Did you or your closest adviser, Karl Rove, have knowledge of the leak at the time, and did you approve?  20. Mr. President, name the company executives who sat down with Vice-President Cheney at the energy policy meetings of early 2001. Was not Ken Lay chief among them? What did they discuss and what were their plans? If Cheney and the energy planners motives were pure, why not release the names and information to the public? Or at least to Congress?

      "And shepherds we shall be, for thee my lord for thee. Power hath descended forth from thy hand so our feet may swiftly carry out thy command. And we shall flow a river forth to thee and teeming with souls shall it ever be. In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti."  MacManus Brothers' Prayer  This is what they would recite when they were about to kill their targets.  It all starts when Connor and Murphy MacManus, two typical Irish Catholics that grew up in the Irish neighborhoods of Boston just having fun.  Along with them is this idiot Rocco, your delivery boy for the local Don.  The three of them hit their favorite pub on Saint Patrick's Day and have a few with friends.  As the night draws to an end, the old bartender, who is suffering from Turret's Syndrome, explains that he is getting evicted from that spot since the Russian Mafia is moving in.  Three of these "soldiers" for the Russian Mob come in and threaten the kick everyone's ass if they didn't leave.  A few words were spoken, drinks were spilled and eventually the Mob's soldiers gets their asses handed to them with a pint of Guinness.  The next day, the mob finds them in their home and were going to kill them.  Well, that's where the self defense comes in.  They pretty much end what the Soldiers started.  Willem Dafoe comes in as Smecker.  A openly gay FBI detective.  Since the two dead bodies found in an alley way came up having connections to the Russian Mob, the became a Federal case.  A few hours later, Smecker is in the police station ranting about the incompetence of the local police department's work when out of the blue, these good natured killers (MacManuis brothers) come walking into the station ready to face whatever charges were against them.  They're not charged.  Self Defense, what a beautiful thing.  Hearing about the big boss of the Russian Mob coming to town to check on things, the brothers go to their local arms dealer and purchase the supplies they need for their new "JOB"  Rocco hears about their plans and wants in.  He becomes and informant to turn in the Yakavetta crime family.  As the Don hears of these recent killing, apparently by the same people since they would cross the people's arms and leave a penny on each eye for toll to cross the river.  This is their signature that these people were bad people and that they deserved to die.  Il Duce is coerced out of retirement (prison) to off these rouge killers and help keep the Crime family alive.  It's going to be sweet to see these two parties meeting up later in the movie.  I liked the movie.  I'm not going to be some sort of snob and say that they were just trying to be a Q. Tarantino.  It's worthy of a rental and just watching it with out any expectation.  Willem Dafoe steals a lot of the scenes a the gay cop.  The most memorable parts of the movie for me were when he was actually with the brother's and Rocco as they took out an assassin's poker game.  He was right there, his words were the sound track to the scene.  It was a recreation and he was "imagining" the people and what was going on during the killings.  The dialouge was funny.  A lot of profanity used.  not too much drama but really in a movie with a lot of violence, who can expect top notch dram acting?  The brothers MacManus were good Flannery and Reedus did the job as the fraternal twins out.  Il Duce I guess is some sort of Irish stand up comic and he did a very good stone face character.  There was a bunch of slo-mo action that were just a little to much.  I personally would have preferred about half less slow motion firefight shooting scenes.  The cinematography could be better.  That's where it really shines as trying to be a Tarantino copycat (oops, I slipped and became a little snobby).  Sometimes it looked as though it was made by an amatuer trying to be artsy professional.  I also had a little something against the sound track of the movie.  It seemed very "techno" and "clubby"  I just thought that since it really wasn't a Matrix or any other sci fi cyber fighting movie, the choice of music wasn't appropriate.  Two Irish Catholic ass kicking twins set in the bad parts of Boston.  It just doesn't go well together.  I would have gone for something a little more rock/rap tracks.  A couple of POD songs would have been better for a couple of fight scenes.  Papa roach would have been a good addition to the sound track.  I'm sure there are a few boston bands that would have been more appropriate.  Hmm, those just started flowing.  I guess that's that.  I really don't know what else to put in here.  Don't get me wrong here.  I really enojyed the movie.  It's just a couple of criticisms that I have for improvements for the second one.  I guess there will be a sequel to the movie.  I don't know how it's going to be any good.  I personally thought it should have ended at one point but they added another 15 minutes to set up the sequel I suppose.  Eh, I'll go see it still, it's titled "Boondocks 2: All Saints Day"  I really don't want to spoil it for everyone so I suggest just rent the damn movie and watch it.   Honestly though, I really can't write a movie review.  This was more or less a half-assed effort to enter something today.

      Relationships.  According to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, a relationship is:  Main Entry: re·la·tion·ship  Function: noun 1 : the state of being related or interrelated   2 : the relation connecting or binding participants in a relationship: as a : KINSHIP b : a specific instance or type of kinship 3 a : a state of affairs existing between those having relations or dealings   b : a romantic or passionate attachment  Today we're going to deal with the last definition, or rather, the romantic relationships.  Let me offer an analogy, since I can't get my point accross in other ways.  Think about duets.  The thing about duets is that each singer brings out the best in the other singer.  A good song to duet is a song that is based on both singers strangths and weaknesses.  Men can date many women but in reality, few women bring out the best in men (and vice versa).  If both parties understand each other well (stregnths and weaknesses) and know the tune they are going to sing (share a common goal and strategy to acheive that goal) then can bring out the best in each other as they work together.  This really shows the importance of exclusivity and commitment in a relationship.  A lot of people (both men and women) don't understand why it's important and are just satisfied with the physical aspect of it.  But, it is through these stages of learning that you undertand your mate/significant other and share your visions.  In duets, each singer has a distinct score.  It would have been boring if it was the same.  Similarly, people will get bored with the "same" person.  Despite the differences, duets sound beautiful and the key is harmony.  When these singers harmonize, each singer will listen to the other party and creatively repond with their own melody.  This shows the importance of active listening as our partner shares their parts and creativity in relationships.  Woemn and men don't need to conform.  Each can still maintain their own individuality and don't have to lose their freedom.  I guess that's that.  Being in a relationship means that you don't win them all and you don't lose them all either.  It's being in a happy medium.  I suppose it's some sort of comfirmation to the old addage that "Opposites Attract"  I hate to use cliches again but really, if your mate was just like you in everyway, you would eventually get bored with that and look for something else.  If they were like you, they would have the same strengths and weaknesses and there really wouldn't be any sort of complementing each other nor growth.  Sure you can have the same interests and thoughts but in the end there has to be something different about the person who you are in a relationship with that complements you and something that you are different from them that complements them.  These differences can also be the source of fights in a relationship.  Because of these differences, people take things differently.  Something might mean the world to you but your partner doesn't think much of it (or vice versa).  That can definitely be a source of misunderstandings and fights.  The point is you have to communicate with each other to have a healthy relationship.  Talking, actually more specifically communicating with each other is essential.  Along with being committed, honest, respectufl, open, caring, thoughful, supportive, strong, funny, sponteneous, intelligent etc.  In conclusion, being in a relationship is hard work.  Go past all the emotions and feelings that make everything seem fine and dandy and and you find work.  It's up to you if you want to jump into that pile of work.  If you keep up the work and the other person is also working with you, then there's so much to gain if both people keep working on it and share the same goal and strategy.  That's enough of me rambling today.

      strikes again!  Who belives in the Law of Averages?  I do.  I think that everytime there has been something good happens, there's always something bad that happens.  It's not really anyone's fault you know, it's just how the world goes.  It's crazy to think so but really stop and think about it for a second.  Think about your earliest success.  It was great, it provided growth and happiness but sometime after that there's a disappointment that evens things out.  Life is like a line filled with peaks and valleys.  There are points in your life where things are great.  Your happy and things couldn't go wrong.  There are also points in life where things don't go your way and everything goes wrong.  Yeah, shitty as it may seem, these little and big disappointments really are shitty.  There's no way around it but to deal with it.  Sometimes you can blame others for thier choices but sometimes you can't.  Things appear and change the course of your line.  I guess the real growth is how one deals with these changes personally.  I guess it's just a little dip here.  I really don't know why I had to write this down, maybe it's for my own self therapy.  Who knows?  I look forward to a better week.  I'm sorry you can' help things right now.  I wish there was something I can do to help you out but I can't think of anything.  I'm sorry.

      yes, it was a good weekend all around.  -----=====:::BEWARE THIS IS A LONG ENTRY, YOU MIGHT GET BORED:::=====-----  I suppose I can continue on blogging my life on a website "that a 13 year old made" but nonetheless, it's something.  Friday:::::  Left work early to make it to MI early and be able to do stuff.  Actually I left early enough to be able to have enough time to get "certain requests" from Chicago to bring to MI for the dear girlfriends friends.  Jamba Juice was one of them.  Unfortunately, as soon as I (settled?, hehe) came upon this wonderful establishment of fresh juice smoothies, I realized that there was no possible way for me to have this thing stay in it's smoothie state for the 4 hour drive to East Lansing.  I then called the girlfriend to inform her of this unfortunate news.  I then went to a Chicago souvenir store and bought this yellow bag.  Myeh, it works.  Started going to EL but the traffic was terrible.  It was just bad but by the time I reached Indiana, it was smoothie sailing from there.  Got to Melrose around 10 EST.  I brought up the souvenirs that I brought up.  We watched an episode of live action Sailor Moon.  All I can say about that is the girls are definitely cute!  Dare I say, if they dressed up and they're not in their ridiculous sailor moon uni's, they would definitely be spank bank material.  Saturday:::::  Saturday was such a long day.  not long in the sense that it was long because things were bad, it was a long day because I did so many things thus really making the whole day seem short.  It was great!  Woke up at 8:30 AM (yeah, fucking Saturday and I'm freakin' up at 8:30) to get ready and get breakfast for golf with Ted at Indian Hills near East Lansing.  that was fun.  I beat Ted by 1 stroke after doing so well the first six holes, I eventually broke down and had my worst scores for the entire course on the remaining 3 holes.  Ted took his lumps early during the round and eventually settled in nicely with his play.  It was relaxing.  nice weather, sun was not hot, it wasn't humid at all.  the grass was nicely cut and the greens weren't too fast.  I actually think I hit some sort of structure the first drive I hit.  It might have hit the railing on the street.  Yeah, first drive, first ball, out of bounds by a lot.  Yeah, that was pretty funny.  After golf, we then proceeded to go to Chase's place to rendezvous with everyone (Chase, Mark P, Ike, Raj, Geoff, Charles).  the trip there was fun indeed.  I think I broke 110 on Michigan 127 as I squeezed between a pickup and a granny driven Buick as Ted got boxed in by those two.  He eventually caught up and we raced up to 110 and finally slowed down for fear of going to jail (yeah we were more scared of a damn ticket than death, is there something wrong with that picture?)  We got to Chase's and relaxed for a bit.  A little while later, Mark P. got there and we all got back to our nerdy-playing gay-but-we're-really-straight states reminiscent of the good old college days.  That was quite fun.  Ike got there next and busted out Worms 3d.  It was for the PS2.  Fun game, still need to develop and fine tune skills for playing competitively but it's definitely one of the better $30 items one can send $30 on.  See, we were supposed to have a few rules but there was just one instated.  There's a max of people that can play at one time and each team (depending on how many people are playing can have a max of 4 worms on each of their team.  So anyway, the last two players should stay (kinda like winner stays) and they take a shot to "even out the playing field.  Yeah, so that went on a little while.  We reminisced on what has happened the last 6-7 years that we've known each other.  That's fucking crazy! 7 years!  Raj was actually a little lost because he thought we were going to meet at fucking Crunchiest and he called us from there to tell us to head out already.  So we Crunchy's up and headed for Crunchy's in East Lansing.  I was graciously given a chance by Ted Pokorski to drive his newly busted-out-of-the-garage-S2000 to be driven to the bar/restaurant.  Yes, that was fun!  I honestly forgot for a split second there that the way to start the damn thing was by pressing a button.  I forgot and quickly realized but decided to play along to see the reaction on Ted's face.  yes, after we got that figured out, I stalled it out because I forgot the damn parking brake!  So I got that figured out.  We left.  Hell, I was just glad to be able to drive the damn thing that I wasn't even thinking about how it needed to be pinched to the high RPM of 8000 to really appreciate the engineering marvel that is the Honda S2000.  So we got a red light, I was lined up to a beater but it didn't matter for a second.  Saw a cop turn to go the other direction and straight ahead (about 1/8th of a mile) was the exit for the freeway to get to the bar.  GREEN!!!  jumped on the clutch, revved it to 7000, it was asking for more, going 37 mph.  -snick- wind getting louder, engine crying for more revving it up to 7500 and it was still screaming for more, going 55. -snick- pushed to third and we're at the on ramp! going 68 in 3rd.  Yeah...that was quick!  I love how it has to be past 5000 for the VTEC to kick in.  The damn thing is an absolute DOG if you drive it like a normal car.  I'm going to quote Ted's quote that he got from this one guy about the car.  He said that to get the best performance out of the car, you should drive it like you absolutely hate the car.  Yes, absolutely hate the car.  Well, I can do that...EASY!  So we're on the on ramp and Ted tells me to leave it in 3rd gear.  We're going 50 and to leave it in 3rd.  We get on the highway and he tells me to punch it.  yeah, it's still got some balls even going fast.  So going fast, going fast, and we had to slow down since we were going to be going through downtown Lansing and it's only 55 there.  Yeah, slowing down, appreciating the weather.  the sun was out blocked by a few clouds.  We then got to an open area with our exit just a few hundred yards away.  I decided to downshift and push the car a little bit.  -snick- 3rd gear, 65 mph, wind getting louder -snick- 4th gear, 95 mph exit coming up, -snick- 5th gear 110, brake for the exit...slow...slow...slow down to 35 mph.  yeah, I love that car.  I want one.  I want one BAD!  I really had to work hard for the damn thing to have it's tired screech.  I was able to do it still though, harder work but the same technique.  It's seems like a cardinal sin to hear an engine scream like that but scream for more.  Ooooo....that car is great.  we got on Grand River and we're about to take a left turn into the street before Beaners and being the retard that I am, I got the sweet idea to get the ass end loose for a little bit.  So I swung the car around a little as I punched it and it went for just a little bit.  good thing there weren't any cars turning.  There was however a cop that had to turn around because of the noise that I made in Ted's car taking that turn.  OOoo...so close.  Yeah, so close!!!  I didn't realize that the car is so light that really underestimate how much the ass end would go.  I was a little surprised therefore I let go of the gas and wasn't able to completely straighten out.  Good thing since, again, the damn East Lansing PD squad car was right there!  needless to say, we were lucky, very lucky.  We ate Crunchy's, listened to a few jocks cheer loudly as it seems that their lives were complete after a certain team would pick their choice.  Yeah.  Still fun.  We talked about Caf-to-Go and how it was such an invaluable tool in having fun at Brody.  So much wasted food.  It really didn't stop there, I still hear stories of how things were just as bad at Mason Abbot.  yeah, open windows are just a bad idea when you live around the caf I suppose.  After a much needed medium well crunchy burger with everything on it.  we headed back for a little nerdery and drinking.  Ted drove on the way back.  I really wanted to relinquish the ability to kill ourselves in a two seater convertible that I really really really want and want to drive fast!  It was just the smart thing to do, or was it?  So we're both full and I figured Ted would be the one to be the safe on.  Ooops, guess not!  He was doing well for a while and then we got to the 70 mph area on 496 and he just let it rip.  WOW, WHAT A FUCKING RUSH!  Yes, we were hauling assssssssssssssssssssssss.  Top down, nice weather.  ZOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMM!  132 mph.  132!!!!  Yeah.  It was fast.  It's definitely a different feeling to go that fast with the top down.  the wind gets louder and as you reach 120 with the top down, the wind slowly quiets down.  You really can't hear anything else.  it's just silent.  There's a clear area in your field of vision and everything else is a blur.  Wow.  It was exhilarating.  We passed an Impala going 132 and the Impala was looking like it just stood still (at about 65 mph) yeah.  Crazy shit.  We actually had to wait till after we had passed the bridge and passed the dip before opening up the car.  Who knows what's after that bridge and bump, a car going slow, a car changing lanes, a cop on the side of the road?  A lot of shit could have happened if we were being stupid about it.  Good thing we really weren't.  If you going to go fast, go fast when no one is around.  Don't kill anyone else because you're being stupid.  Do it on your own and make sure no one else is around as to not be collateral damage.  Needless to say, we got from the outskirts of Lansing to Creyt's Road in about 80 seconds.  Yeah, fast as fast can be.  We got to Chase's and Ted was still shaking.  It was funny.  I guess he hasn't done that before.  he just stuck around the 120 mark (which I did manage to reach today driving back from MI).  We had a beer and everything was fine.  Hehe.  I'll never forget the sensation of everything being a blur and shit not having a sound.  It seemed as if things we're in slow motion, even though I was in the passenger seat!  Much nerdery was to follow. yes, way to much.  Played Worms 3D.  I named my team MIS and named my worms various IP addresses (local host, a machine at work, my weblog, default IP for a wireless router, broadcast IP address etc.) yeah pretty nerdy.  It was great.  we played and played and drank and played and played some more that was drank some more.  I eventually calmed down and decided to work on pop and water so I would be sober enough to meet Meghan's friends and watch "Into The Woods"  Drove back to Meghan's and met Leslie.  She's pretty cool.  Laid back.  Knows the Simpson's so it's definitely a bonus.  I took a shower and headed off to meet Jaime and Annie at Wharton.  we got there and found our seats.  I met Annie and Jamie.  I then told Jamie that I was sorry for not being able to bring Jamba juice to EL since it would have probably turned into some sort of liquid juice by now and not a smoothie.  I really didn't have a lot of time to interact with them since they had their own thing going.  I was just there observing everyone.  have you ever been in a situation where you don't know anyone and they're all talking and you really don't know what to say because you really don't know what to say and didn't want to look stupid.  yeah, it was one of those scenarios.  It was alright, I'm glad the musical was shared with me.  I enjoyed.  I really did and I would go to another one if given the opportunity to do so.  It was a parody on all a lot of the fairytales and I tied them all into one story.  From Cinderella to Jack and the bean Stalk.  It was great.  I liked the dialogue.  It was smart and funny.  I also liked the delivery of the actors.  They were pretty good.  I liked The Baker the most.  He was good.  Baker's wife also complemented the Baker nicely.  I also liked Little Red Riding hood.  She seemed to steal the scene every time she was on stage.  Cinderella was just not there.  Her voice sounded hollow and not enough air was going through.  Overall I thought it was entertaining, I was smirking and smiling a couple of times during the musical.  I would recommend it for people to see if they want to see something different and good.  After that I drove Leslie and Meghan back to her house so that the dear girlfriend can drive me back to the guys so I wouldn't have to worry about getting wasted and having to drive back. How sweet!  It was totally out of the way too and she had to be rude to her friends and leave them to pick me up.  That was really nice and I want to tell you that I appreciated that.  Thanks again for picking my ass up.  After that, I was glad that we were going to be hanging out with Jamie and Nilesh (Jamie's BF) and Annie and Leslie (well Leslie was sleeping already).  That was fun.  We played "The Typing of the Dead" for dream cast.  It's pretty much typing to shoot your gun at the zombies.  Yes, lame yet ridiculously fun.  I suck at typing but I get by at work.  It's all good!  We then played SORRY!  That too was also fun!  Man I can just think of so many ways to transform SORRY! into a drinking game.  I don't know if it would be fun but I am sure willing to try.  Annie won.  She got the lucky 7 and split the moves to two pieces and BAM! she won the whole thing.  Me and Meghan were actually the ones winning.  She was so close to winning and I was just a little bit behind (in board positions).  Yeah, that game started out slow but it got faster.  That was the first time I had ever played SORRY!  Cool board game.  I want to play again.  This time, for real!  After everyone had gotten tired and decided to go home, Meghan and I just spent the rest of our waking hours talking and unwinding.  It was relaxing.  Sunday:::::  Woke up and ate pizza, played some more typing of the dead and after Meghan had beaten the FINAL EXAM (which was hard, you had to kill 100 zombies and it's not just words you type, you also have to type random letters, phrases and sentences.  Wow!  It was hard for me but eventually Meghan was able to get it.  Good thing I don't need to type that fast or else I would be dead in the water.  We then used bit torrent to "bit-torrent" the latest episode of Smallville and we watched that.  It was where Chloe had some ability of being able to get the absolute truth from people.  Sounds like a fun ability.  Too bad you die in like 4 days or some shit.  Myeh.  She did more studying and I watched the Cubs.  (Cubbies won!!!) and after passing out for a nap, we went to P.F. Chang's and had Chinese for our dinner date.  Good food, I'd eat it again but it's really not the place if you want to have a nice talk during dinner.  I felt bad for Meghan too since she was severely affected by her allergies.  That sucked!  she had to take allergy medicine to be able to study and function but it made her all weird and a little off.  We then went back to her place so she can study some more and me to flip to channels (it's really all I do on Sundays, be it that I'm in Michigan or IL).  Watched a little bit of Futurama and Spider-Man.  Yada Yada.  We went to sleep.  Monday :::::  I got up early to go to work.  Showered and kissed Meghan good bye and went on my merry way.  Got to the gas station and looked in my wallet and no credit card!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  GREAT!!!  no fucking card.  Looked around the car maybe I left it around there somewhere but nope, not there.  Looked at my wallet again and not there still.  I gave up and figured that I must have left it at the restaurant last night.  Called the girlfriend up to inform her of the news and she was kind enough to let me stay till the place opened.  Fell asleep and woke up around 10.  Meghan got ready, I got my card from the restaurant and drove the Michigan girl to Wells hall for her classes.  Kissed goodbye and off to work I went.  Nice drive, weather was nice, I was able to spot the cops cars like crazy and yeah, I finally got my car up to 121 mph.  On this lonely stretch of highway on US 69.  A Saab 9-3 Aero came up behind me and I was already doing 85.  I just decided fuck it, no one around, it's straight, the lanes going the other way is blocked by trees, eh, let's go, so I downshifted and punched it.  Got up to about 95 and had to shift to 5th and got that sucker up to 121 until I came upon some traffic a little whiles ahead.  I didn't want to risk it anymore so that was that.  Got to work and my punishment was to work the rest of my 8.5 hours.  So here I am working till 10:30 PM.  If anyone is out there, gimme a holla.  Peace out.  I had a good weekend, I hope that you did too!  Thanks again to my wonderful girlfriend (yes I am gushing) for everything this weekend Thanks to all of the nerds and geeks of the Dungeon Crew (again I am gushing) for a fun night at Chase's place.  I enjoyed quite thoroughly as well.  See I told you this was going to be a long entry.  Sorry for that by the way!  Have a great week!

YEAH BABY!!!  hopefully it's not going to be too damn rainy.  Random updates through out the rest of the week and weekend.  Oh and a big HI to Nicole from the Lodge.  She's damn fine and can shake that ass.  PLUS she lives in WHEATON!!!  In fucking WHEATON!!!  Yeah baby!!! Do your thang!

      Well, I just found  urlLink this  and I think it's so true.  I personally don't hate any of these White Sox fans nor the White Sox but it's just damn funny.  Yay, more stuff that bringing me back to normal.

      So who's ready for  urlLink   this shit  ?   Here's a little excerp from the story linked above.   Beginning approximately five years after the events of the first Knights of the Old Republic, The Sith Lords takes players on an entirely new journey as they assume the role of what is believed to be the last Jedi in the galaxy. The game features a cast of memorable returning characters and sinister new villains. Using more than 30 new Force powers, players can turn weak-minded enemies against one another in combat with  'Force confusion'  or see through doors and view character alignment with  'Force sight.'  Assigned to protect the Old Republic and the Jedi Order from the terrifying Dark Lords of the Sith, players must explore and battle through seven diverse worlds while being challenged whether to choose the light side of the Force or surrender to the lure of the dark side.    Yes,  KOTOR II:  Sith Lords .  KOTOR, you know, Knights of the Old Republic.  Right, that one.  Probably the 2003 GAME OF THE YEAR for a lot of XBOX players.  SHIIIIIIIT!!!!  I gotta finish up the first on.  Holy fuck, I can't do this.  I gotta finish the first one and play it again a second time around as light side.  OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG  I am "flustered" about this.  Dare I say even a little bit "excited".  Who who am I kidding, I'm fucking  GEEKED  about this title.  Too bad it's not going to be till fucking Feb 2005 but till then, I have time to polish HALO 2 skillz and Half Life 2 Skillz and Doom 3 skillz and Call of Duty: Finest Hour skillz.  All of them coming out for XBOX later this year.  after all of those there's KOTOR II and Jade Empire SHIIIIIIIIT!!!    How about a few shots anyone...of screen (they're probably going to be too big but whatever)

      Yeah Cubs lost.  Very unfortunate.  Went to  urlLink North Beach  since it was just a shitty game.  The place was dead as hell too!  It was karaoke night and no one was there.  Actually the karaoke night just started so in a couple of weeks the shit should be filled with freaks and geeks.  Hmmm, I sure hope they're tasty!  Played darts there as well and surprisingly, I still have game with darts.  I am seriously thinking about going back to the dive bar that is The Gables and participating in some of the tournaments that I haven't been involed in for the last few months.  That should be cool.  I wonder if any of the cute girl dart players that were there last time I was around are still there.  Hmmm...  After North Beach (which was shitty) we drove by  urlLink Champs  to see what was going on.  Well nothing was going on there so we went to  urlLink The Lodge in Lisle .  Again it was fucking karaoke.  This one was pretty cool though.  No matter how bad someone was, they would sound absolutely incredible with a live band playing behind them.  My favorite was this one chick, Carissa or something like that.  She had a nice body and a nicer booty!  Ooo La La.  Nice rack too if I may say so!  Well she got up there and sang her own rendition of Marvin Gaye's Let's Get it On.  And DAMN she was good.  I wanted to get it on with anyone worth looking at right then and there.  Well I still do but that's something else.  Wow she was good looking and can sing.  I tried to say Hi but she was moelsted by her boyfriend that was there.  And guess what?  I learned my lesson with girls with boyfriends.  Hmmm.  So later on I just waved Hi and got a wink back and then I left.  I suppose that is my night.  No dates or anything but then again I wasn't really planning on going out with anyone anytime "soon"  Wednesday tough is CINCO DE MAYO.  I had plans and shit for this night but as we all know those fell through.  So now, since I am going on vacation starting at 6 PM Wednesday I am on vacation.  Albeit a short one, I'm still going to release as much stress as I can and possible be a HO (as my sister aply put it) as much as I can.  I doubt that it's going to make it to the blog for "protection" reasons. but we'll see how things go!  I'm "excited"  Possible going to the Lodge again for some drinks.  Still wieghing in on staying out here compared to going to Iowa.  I miss my little boy.  I want to play with him and take him to the Zoo or read a book for him or watch a cartoon with him or just play with him and his toys.  It should be fun.  I don't quite know what I'll be doing but I think I'm leaning towards going to see him this weekend.  If I do stay out here there should be enough to do like going downtown and visiting a club/bar like I used to and just living it up.  Vicki also mention something about doing something.  We'll see I guess.   Yah, no more rambling.  Time fer bed.

      So last night I tried to talk to myself.  I think this is how the conversation went:   Self:   "Welcome back man, how ya been?"  Gonzo:  "Been good.  I was just doing some things that I thought would make me happy and make other people happy."  Self :  "Oh yeah?  Like what?"  Gonzo : "Well there was this one chick that I really and I thought we hit it off and all was going to be wonderful"  Self :  "So what happened?"  Gozno : "Well things really weren't working out.  It got too much for her, the timing just wasn't right and the whole   thing was just for a season."  Self :  "Well you've been gone for a while man, you forgot about your family and friends.  I think sometimes you   forgot about yourself!"  Gonzo : "Yeah, well definitely I forgot about what I wanted.  I was too focused on the other person.  That's probably not too healthy.  I definitely didn't forget about family and friends.  I still talked to them and did         things with them.  Honestly though, I fell for the girl but the girl didn't fall for me."  Self :  "Yeah I hate it when that happens.  I'm sorry to hear that but you know everything has a start and end.  It just depends how long it's going to last.  Did you have fun?"  Gonzo : "Yeah, I had fun.  I learned a lot of new things that I am grateful for.  It gives me a new dimension to myserlf."  Self :  "So you're telling me that you've changed?"  Gonzo : "Well I wouldn't call it changing.  More like learning.  Well, lemme get that straight, I evolved.  I'm still here with a few additions.  I guess I grew up too.  So in the true sense of the word I have changed but I'm still the same."  Self :  "Damn dude, you have changed.  That's some fucked up shit right there!"  Gonzo : "Whatever man, I'm still me but besides the party loving, beer drinking dancing fool you see when you go out.   This brand new Gonzo also embraces that he is a geek.  This new Gonzo has a few different ways to appreciate things and think of things in a different light.  This new Gonzo likes to read.  This new Gonzo is yet another stage in the overall evolution."  Self :  "You're a dork.  What the hell are you talking about?  you always like nerdy things and you always had nerdy friends.  True you never used to read but you've read two books in 4 months!!!  Damn man, you must have really like this girl to do that!  When was the last time you read a freakin book?  I think it's been since fucking high school man!  That's crazy!  It's good that you have a better ability to see and understand things differently or from a different perspective.  So why did you guys break up anyways?"  Gonzo : "Well she pretty much dumped me.  Actually we have done this whole quit and try again a couple of times already but this time I think she's serious about not getting back together.  I heard wind that she has a date so I guess that's it.  Eh, that's alright, I used to fight it because I thought she wanted it still and she did for awhile there but I guess not anymore.  It definitely is time to let it go on my end and not let it consume me.  I did nothing wrong here.  I tried my best and gave my all."  Self :  "Didn't you see it coming?"  Gonzo : "I didn't see it coming but there was that feeling of doubt that she was getting bored and I was stressing out the last few days that really did the job."   Self :  "Well didn't she ask for space?"  Gonzo : "Yeah, I gave her a little bit of space and thought about things.  The more I tried to pull her closer the harder she tried to run away during this whole time.  I'm not happy about how things ended but I am grateful 	for the time we spent together."  Self :  "If you had given her space things would probably be better!  Why didn't you do that instead retard!"  Gonzo : "Fuck you!"  Self :  "Fuck you too!  why don't you go make like a tree and fuck off!"  Gonzo : "Whatever bitch, why don't you stop being a all wise and mighty son of a bitch and take care of your problems too!"  Self :  "I'm not the one who got dumped"  Gonzo : "Retard, we're the same person!"  Self :  "Oh yeah"  Gonzo : "Oh well, things would have ended the same way anyways.  She wasn't willing to give me the attention that I needed and I wasn't willing to give the space that she needed.  Both of us would eventually get frustrated at each other and things would definitely be ugly.  Self :  "That sounds good.  Did you make that up yourself?  Gonzo : "Hell no, I didn't change that much!  I heard it from the other party, thought about it and bought it.  See  if I was still the same me as I was like last year, I would b thinking that there was another guy involved.  She was just breaking up with me to go out with him.  sure it's plausible but I try not to think about it that way."  Self :  "You know, that's probably it!  She met someone new and didn't want to cheat on two people in the same year!"  Gonzo : "I don't know for sure, whatever.  She doesn't owe me anything, she can do whatever she wants.  nothing I can do now right?"  Self :  "Well laddy freakin' da.  He is back!  Gonzo : "Huh?"  Self :  "There you are taking everything with a grain of salt"  Gonzo : "Oh yeah, well you know how I am, once I let someone in, I'm like a damn marshmallow.  the closer people are the easier it is to hurt me."  Self :  "I know, I know you!  So what's next?  Gonzo : "Well I'm sick of the whole bar thing, maybe I'll try out the library.  I'll go check out and meet girls there or the grocery store, blockbuster wherever!  Hmm, what about online personal ads?  I might check that shit out.  That could be the ultimate experiment!  hehe.  not sure if I want to pay for that shit though.  In the mean time, I'm going to go do things that I used to do.  Basketball, darts, go out with friends till early morning.  Let myself get back into a routine.  It's going to be all good."  Self :  "online?  I would suggest staying away from those.  It's all freaks and geeks up in there!"  Gonzo : "Did you say 'freaks and geeks'?"  Self :  "Yeah..."  Gonzo : "Cute ones?"  Self :  "I don't know, I never checked that shit out!"  Gonzo : "Well there's always a first time!!!  HAHAHA"  Self :  "Oh deal..."    Yeah, I had a lenghty conversation with myself before falling asleep last night.  I'm not quite sure how to start the  personals ad.  any suggestions?  I'm not looking for love, just friends or someone to date, I dunno.  Fuck love for now.  I'm sure that's going to be there later.  I'm just going to go have fun.  Yeah, I'm pretty bored here at work.  I can recollect most of the conversation from last night.  Yikes, an I turning  neurotic?  MWAH HAH HAHA   p.s.  Sorry for the lack of any real posts here.  It should be over soon.  Things will be back to normal here, no more bullshit about the past relationship.  Just a little bit more and we will return to other things.  Thanks!

      Wow!  So I haven't really played any real basketball for a while for quite a long time.  Last time was sometime last month or something playing like 6 games of 21.  Yeah, not really up and down basketball that you see.  So tonight we played at this little school/church thing right of Butterfield Rd.  It was like an elementary school gym with bent buckets and shit.  It was fun.  Met some cool guys.  They really weren't that good but good enough.  Jerry dominated most of the games since he was probably the tallest and biggest dyude there.  I wasn't able to play offesively but was holding it down a little with the defense.  We played 7 games or so.  I was dead tired and wasn't hitting any shots till the sixth game or something.  I would miss wide open shots bank shots, jumpers, and even layups.  It was ugly.  It was like that till I fucking made a damn layup.  I woke up there and was able to play accordingly.  I finally made my presence felt in the last game when everyone was tired.  Well considering I am a smoker, I was tired too but I just had enough to be able to contribute.    Yeah, I really really really have to quit smoking.  My energy level is fine during the games but the stamina just isn't there.  I feel so awake.  This is great!  We got more games next Monday and I intend on doing a better job that this pathetic display of basketball shittiness.  Two more days and I am no a mini vacation.  Hell YEAH!

      So I got a LiveJournal now.  I guess I only really joined for the communities that are available.  Here are the communities that I joined so far.  I don't know if it's such a good idea to join a lot but whatever, we'll give it a shot   urlLink Chicago_Cheap   urlLink Chicago_Club    urlLink Chicago_Party   urlLink ChicagoCubs   urlLink DailyQuotes   urlLink LiteraryQuotes   urlLink LovingGeekLadies   urlLink WeLoveGeeks   I personally like the Cubs community, there's always something happening there.  i do wonder though if the place dies down during the off season.  I have a strange feeling that they don't.  I don't know what to expect from Chicago_Party, there might be a few happenings where a bar might be mentioned as a cool place to hang out or something  I'm more currious about the LovingGeekLadies and WeLoveGeeks communities.  It seems that there are really GEEK girls out there.  I thought that the last girlfriend was an apparition but it looks like they're quite a few of them.  Hopefull there are some in the Chicagoland area.  God forbid I find something out of the fucking state again.  YAY!!!  Looks as if I can keep myself busy for quite a while, hehe.

      Awww, vicki stopped by today at work.  She's on vacation and she wants to do something.  It was nice to see her again.  She made me feel better about my self.  Called Jenny to see if she can possibly bring Bryce out here this weekend.  Her car isn't working so that sucks.  She wants me to rent her a rental but that's just too much.  It'll be cheaper for me to go get them and drive them back Sunday.  I don't really know what to do with that yet.  That's on hold.  Ashli is back from her trip to Chile.  It's nice to talk to her again.  I miss hanging out with her.  She's so laid back and wise about things.  Cool chick.  Too bad she wasn't able to get me anything from there.  Oh well, she'll probably be back there sometime in the future.  Yeah...time to live again.  I will start by visiting random blogs and leaving comments on whatever attracts my attention.  YAY!  Another chapter done time to start a new one  wow it rhymes!!!  Whee!

      9 Things I Hate About Everyone    1. People who point at their wrist while asking for the time.... I know where my watch is pal, where the hell is yours? Do I point at my crotch when I ask where the toilet is?  2. People who are willing to get off their ass to search the entire room for the TV remote because they refuse to walk to the TV and change the channel manually.  3. When people say "Oh you just want to have your cake and eat it too".  Damn right! What good is a cake if you can't eat it?  4. When people say "it's always the last place you look". Of course it is.  Why the hell would you keep looking after you've found it? Do people do this? Who and where are they? I'm gonna Kick their ass!  5. When people say while watching a film "did you see that?". No Loser, I paid $12 to come to the cinema and stare at the damned floor.  6. People who ask "Can I ask you a question?".... Didn't really give me a choice there, did ya sunshine?  7. When something is 'new and improved!'. Which is it? If it's new, then there has never been anything before it. If it's an improvement, then there must have been something before it.  8. When people say "life is short". What the hey?? Life is the longest damn thing anyone ever does!! What can you do that's longer?   9. When you are waiting for the bus and someone ! asks "Has the bus come yet?". If the bus came would I be standing here, dumbass?

      So it's the day after.  I think she's over me already.  Wow, that was fast huh?  Oh well, my turn.  It sucks coming out of a relationship even if it was such a short lived one.  You tend to lose your game.  Yes, game.  I had a little bit of game going, actually I had some good game going at the bars and clubs.  Meeting girls, getting digits, meeting up with them in the future came so easy.  I was able to polish that for a little while and then BAM!  A special someone comes along and you forget about that thing you have and it gradually it becomes like a dull knife instead of that sharp thing you once had.  Sure it wasn't the best of everythjing but it did the job.  I wasn't out to pick up chicks for one night stands, just get digits and call them and have them call me or whatever.  My game was not perfect but it did the job and that's what counts.  So today, at work, I have deleted shortcuts to her websites, I removed all of our emails and placed them in an archive file.  Yeah, I'm a nerd.  I have a lot of bad poetry jotted down and they're all just saved here rotting.  They're about the good times and the start of the bad times.  Yeah, I'm still reeling.  I gotta move on, I have to.  I really don't have any time to go to East Lansing to give back her book.  Maybe during camping trip, I'll give it to Mark P and he cam give it to Meghan.  In other more news worthy events.  I was out helping one of my co-workers with thier problem with their computer.  It was still working but it was definitely not working correctly.  I just reformatted the whole thing.  It took longer much longer than anticipated but I got it done.  I received an envelope today with a card that was made by her daughter with $50 in it.  That made me feel better.  I felt appreciated.  I didn't ask for any money and I said that I would do it for free but they appreciated it enough to give me some credit for the job that I did.  Well at least I made some dough this weekend.  Hmm, maybe I'll get a date too!  $50 should be plenty for a first date right?  Yeah, starting over is one of the worst feelings in the world.  It's also great because soon enough you feel new again.  There is someone out there, there is hope for me.  In the mean time, all I can do is pick up the peices and move on.  I feel shitty but I'm sure I'll get over it someday.  There's always light at the end of the tunnel.

      Good bye baby.  No hard feelings here.  Even though I thought I was wronged by you not giving enough effort, I realize that I do love you and if I do love you I have to let you go if that's what's going to make you happy.  It was fun while it lasted and I would have liked it to last even longer but in reality, you have so many things going for you that I am not going to be an integral part of your life.  I understand now that things aren't going to work.  That's okay with me.  I leave it with giving my all into this relationship and I feel damn good about that.  If you're not going to take it then someone else will.  I guess we never fully understood each other but at the same time you can't really fully understand someone just by talking to them on the phone.  We tried it out.  It didn't work out and I can live with that.  I know that no one here wronged anyone on purpose.  We were just on different points in our lives now that for a while there, our lines were together and intertwined.  It has come to a point where out lives must diverge.  There were a lot of good times huh?  From the first time we tried to watch Memento to our last date at PF Changs in East Lansing.  It was fun.  There were good times as well as bad times.  I could say that my favorite would be you visiting me here in Chicago and when you met my whole family.  That weekend was the best weekend for that and the worst weekend as well (we both know why).  You were caught off guard by how my family was so welcoming of you and all the compliments that you were on Cloud 9.  We came back to my place and tried to watch the movie adaptation of The Unbearable Lightness of Being.  That was the night that you actually told me without speaking "I LOVE YOU" with your eyes.  I won't forget that.  There were other times too!  Like Mitsuwa, that was a surprise and a half for you.  You got soooo giddy over the stupidest things!!!  Like the bath soap and dish washer soap and a rice cooker.  It was so cute.  I also liked out trip to the Art Institute of Chicago.  That was definitely cool.  The next girl I want to be in a serious relationship with should be appreciative of art as well.  What about when we went to St. Joseph's and I got wasted and said FUCK really loud at the Mexican restaurant and they promptly cleared out the tables surround our table.  Sorry about that by the way :)  Another ritual that we had was Sunday nights.  You would be studying and I would be cooking dinner and watching TV.  I thought it was nice.  We were just hanging out and it felt like we were a real couple.  A real couple that lived close and doing normal things.  For those few hours I would forget that I lived in Chicago and just be at peace with everything.  I remember one of the first times that you were here too, it was cold outside and I took you to a frozen Lake Michigan for a very romantic view of the City.  I held you there and everything in the world seemed right.  I also remember one scary thiing when you called me and you got in an accident.  I was scared shitless.  I didn't want you to get hurt, actually that was the second time that you tried to push me away.  I also remember the first time I was up in East Lansing, Saturday morning when I was kicked out of your apartment, that hurt.  I remember talking to you for endless hours of the night.  I remember laughing a lot and not really a lot of bad things.  It was a short lived relationship that really made an impact on me.  I fell in love with you.  I really did.  For the whole package, the good the bad and everthing in between.  I love you Meghan and I still want this to work but it's unfair for me if you don't want it anymore.  Thanks for being honest and straightforward to me with a lot of things.  I always appreciated that.  I didn't like it sometimes but I still appreciated it.  There are other things that I can talk about here but it would take a day and a half to write them all down.    I think you're great and someone will make you happier.  I think I'm pretty good too and someone will be happy with me.  I'm not saying I'm over you or anything like that.  It's going to take a while obviously, but things end without any effort.  Since you quit this, there's no sense for me to keep watering our plant.  The decision to end this is your decision and I hope that you can live with that.  I know that I can live with the fact that I gave it my all.  I loved you with everything that I had.  I had a great time with you so far this year and it is definitely unfortunate that things had to end.  I thought we had something really special here that would last.  You've made up your mind that things won't work out.  Like you said, it's best that we just separate now.  I know you will be okay.  Things will get better sweetie.  After this week, you should be happy hanging out at your work with your new found friends, reconnecting again with your friends in Jackson and getting things ready for Japan.  Just hang in there.  This week will be over soon and life will deal you a much needed break.  I on the other hand, will try and pick up the peices of myself.  I'm sure someone else wants these feelings.  Good bye Meghan.  I love you.  Good luck with the rest of your life.  Keep at it and you can get your dreams baby.  Remember I won't always be in love with you but you will have a very special place in my heart and mind.  You have helped me appreciate a lot of different things that Ihave learned from you.  I love that.  I came out of this relationship having grown a little.  Having learned a lot and have been in your life.  I love you and I can't stress that enough.  I would like to hear from you from time to time and I think I can just do that through your web page.  Don't worry I won't comment or anything wierd like that.  I  love you baby.  I really wish things were different and you can still change that as could I.  I'm not shutting the door and burning bridges here.  I'm just leaving your life to make it not as stressful as it has been.  I'm still going to be across the bridge living my life.  I love you baby but it's time that I go.  Thanks for everything, I hope that I made you a better person after this.  I hope that I have shown you things that you appreciated.  I'm still here if you need me, in the mean time I have to try and move forward and keep on this journey that is my life.  Thanks again for everything and I love you!  Take care.  your loving ex-boyfriend Gonzalo C. Marte III

      I have been wrestling with this for a couple of days now.  It has something to do with the Berg video.  Incase you have been living under a fucking tree for the last few days, read  urlLink this .  I don't know if I am ready to watch the video.  Frankly I don't know if I will ever be ready to watch a 'real' execution.    Sure I've seen shit in movies where people's heads get cut off or limbs shopped off.  Sure there's  urlLink Rotten.com  and there are a few disturbing images there, no videos though.  An analogy that I want to use would be the accident analogy.  Traffic backed up and you see a wreck in the distance.  Slowly you come closer to the accident scene and you get more and more intrigued with the whole thing.  You don't want to look but you can't help -but- look.  It could be bloody, it could be messy but you're still curious enough to keep your eye on the road and glance at the general direction hoping to catch a glimpse of something.  Except this time (with the Berg Video) you know what is going to happen.  His head was cut off, actually it was sawed off with a hack saw.  A dull, rusty hacksaw.  I don't consider myself a squeamish person but this might be too much for me.  I want to see it but I don't think I will ever be prepared to see it.  Is that sick or just humanity's morbid curiosity with death.  I don't have a link for the video but I heard on the radio that on  urlLink Mancow.com  there's a video somewhere.  The site might be a little overwhelemed right about now because of other people's curiousity with it so if you can't see it and really want to see it, I would suggest sometime late in the evening or over the weekend.

      You know, there are things that you find out after you break up with someone that just makes you a little bit angry.  It actually makes you pissed off but glad that at the same time things are over.  Some people find it necessary to encode things for the other party's protection well guess what sweetie, the jig's up.  I guess you had a great time with the date huh?  There are also people who are close to the other side of the equation that say things that really make you think about what has happened.  No names mentioned but seriously, I was just something that someone could control during a very chaotic time in someone's life and thrown away like a bad habit?  I was a fucking puppet and I played my part masterfully.  The rebound guy I suppose.  I can't complain, I took the risk and played with fire and I actually got burned.  One would think that after the previous and the following that one would learn from that and I did.  This was just a little bit different.  It's really unbelievable that people could be so cold about things.  That people think very little of people.  Wow.  If this was really true then the whole thing was just a sham.  I was thinking about calling you to see if you wanted to meet up here in Chicago before you left for Japan.  Now, I don't know what to think.  I had a beautiful picture painted in my head where we saw each other in O'Hare for a nice talk and a perfect good bye.  Then again, I would just be putting the effort of missing work, driving up to the airport to see you while you just don't do anything.  Besides, I don't think you even want to see my anymore.  You did go on that date.  It sucks learning about what really happened and what really was.  It brings back old feelings.  Now I really feel wronged and for that, why don't you go ahead and fuck off.

      2003 Infiniti FX 45    2003 Nissan Maxima SE    2003 Nissan Murano    2003 Acura TL    See the "pimpiest" is the FX45.  It's also got the most power @ 315 HP.  Most Practical would be the Murano.  Besides probably being the cheapest high end model up there, it's got room for things other than people.  I still like the TL the best just because of it's refined manly look.  The Maxima was just thrown in for shits and giggles.

      So I was checking out this shit for  urlLink Blogger  and turns out there's profiles and stuff on there.  Wow, I never knew.  So my  urlLink profile  needs a little work I suppose.  Cool, I can search people like I can on  urlLink LiveJournal .  Well not really search per se but more or less look for people with the same interests that I put down.  So being me, I clicked on IL to see if there are a few bloggers that reside in the state of IL.  Lo and behold, there were a few.  So I guess that's my last post for the day, you can say that it has been a very uninteresting day for me that I had a lot of time to be able to put shit on the Internet.  Let's GO CUBBIES!!!

      So another change in the work schedule.  See it all started in August of 2002.  I got this job that I currently have after getting two other jobs that were farther and had lower pay.  When I first started, my schedule was from 8:30 to 5.  That was 8 1/2 hours everyday of work.  So I stuck to it.  get in at 8:30 and leave right at 5.  Well I guess they didn't like that.  They wanted me to stay longer, to see if there was anything else to do.  So I started working from 8:30 to 5:30 PM.  I was doing that for a while and then there was another person who got hired.  So we both were working the same hours for a couple of months and things were going well until one day around 7:15 in the morning, "the shit hit the fan"  So there was another change.  Well it was also since my boss and the other guy were going for thier certs that they thought a schedule change would be good.  So, for the sake of convienience and IT coverage, we went from 8:30-5:30 to alternating days of 7:00 to 4:30 and 9:30 to 6 PM.  Basically they wanted someone here from 7 to 6.  An 11 hour coverege.  So My early days (7:00 to 4:30) would be Tuesday, Thursday and every other Friday and my late days would be Monday, Wednesday and the Fridays that I wasn't early.  So it was confusing for a little while there but we all got used to it eventually.  So that has been going on for the last six months.  Now, since there's no more school for those two, another decision regarding schedules has been made.  I don't know if I want either but here they are.  One option is for alternating early weeks between the two of us.  See that's not too bad but I don't know if I can deal with getting up that early for a whole week considering I stay up pretty late.  The other option is for me to stay as the late guy, no more switching.  That could also prove bothersome considering I go to Iowa every month and I have a couple of trips to Michigan planned for the summer (relax it's not for Meghan, she's in Japan, this is for Weddings and what not).  My work is pretty flexible where I can switch my Fridays but I just don't like the idea that I can abuse something and jeopardize my job.  I dunno which option to take, they're both equally flexible and the other guy likes to get out early anyways to avoid the traffic so being the late guy all the time is a viable option.  I guess we'll see how being early for a week works out.  Besides, if I have to leave early one Friday I can switch anyways.  I guess we'll have to wait and see on this one.

      Okay so this is probably going to be the last post I have of the ex considering that I think I am finally healed.  HALEFUCKINLUJAH!!!  *Disclaimer - I know  -you-  still read this so don't take it personally.  It's too bad that you didn't see the relationship the same way I did.  Whatever, I live, learn and move on.  Thanks again for everything, thanks for nothing, and I suggest you don't read the rest of this shit.  So I was bored after playing some basketball and yes, I fared much better than last week's debacle.  I was able to hit some shots and find the open man for the shot.  It was fun and I wasn't as out of breathe as I was last week.  I feel alive again.  I feel great.  So after basketball, I looked up stages of grief and found some shit and here it is.  I really hate to sound like a little bitch discussing feelings and emotions because some might think it's a sign of weakness but whatever.  If you can't stand reading this crap then stop reading, no one is pointing a fucking gun to your head are they?  To begin, we're going to discuss the Stages of Grief and how people feel when they are at that particular stage after a break-up.  Sure what I was in was a short term relationship but it was still an important part of my life (not sure about the other party) and I learned a lot from it.  I'm sure people can relate to this on some level (I hope, unless you're some loser who has been living in the basement and have never actually talked to a girl that has a different set of chromosomes than you or any of your relatives, I feel sorry for you, get out there and fucking live).  With each stage, I have a particular song that I thought was fitting.  Again this is just all opinion, I may be wrong with a lot of this shit maybe I'm not.  If you are still reading, this is your last chance to stop and just skip this post.   First Stage of Grief:  In the beginning, you may feel in shock, denial, or numb. It may be hard for you to believe what has happened. It may be hard to make sense of it all. You may find yourself expecting to come home to your partner or for her/him to call at a regular time only to discover that's not the case any longer. It may take awhile for you to fully comprehend that the relationship is over.  At this stage, you may have trouble remembering things, focusing, and feeling a sense of purpose or direction in their lives - you may feel as though you are drifting through the day. This is a natural initial reaction to loss.    In this stage, the theme song was  urlLink Hoobastank - The Reason .  I couldn't get enough of that fucking song.   Second Stage of Grief:  The second stage involves feeling fear, anger and depression. This stage often lasts the longest and can be filled with feelings of insecurity, panic, worry, crying, anger, and feelings of depression. Some people don't allow themselves to feel, while others have trouble letting go of how they are feeling. Both are essential - feeling and eventually letting go.  In the beginning, you may think that you will always feel this way, but you won't. Your feelings will pass. You'll discover that the time between down periods increases. Too often with break-ups we don't feel that we have the right to feel upset much longer than a few weeks when the truth is it usually takes longer. I have found that grief tends to run a cycle of at least one year unless of course the relationship wasn't very important, was short-term, or you were grieving before you actually left her/him. But, if you spent a number of years together, and the person was important to you, even if you're the one doing the breaking up you can still be grieving for approximately one year. Of course with very long term relationships, it can take even longer to feel back on your feet but it is still possible to recover.   The theme song for this stage is  urlLink Usher - Burn .  It was a sad time with a lot of depressing thoughts but this song was just right.  It didn't exactly make me feel better but more in tune with my grief and was able to be honest with myself.   Third Stage of Grief:  This is the stage where you begin to accept that the relationship is over, and that you're going to be okay. You realize that you haven't thought about your ex-partner in awhile, and that without realizing it you are moving on. You've gained back some of your zest for life, and are beginning to see a future ahead of you.   In the acceptance stage, you've done a lot of thinking about the relationship and the break-up and you realize things that you hadn't before. You understand yourself better, and you aren't as angry or hurt. You find yourself laughing more, and feeling hopeful. You begin to notice that you're feeling better and that you are ready to trust again, or at least to try.  Sometimes letting go just happens after you've let yourself grieve and rage and whatever else you need to do. Other times, people have to deliberately and consciously focus on letting go. It is tempting to hold on, and scary to let go. Saying to yourself that you are letting go of your ex-partner can be helpful. Interrupting yourself when you get stuck thinking or talking about her/him and redirecting your focus onto something else is all part of letting go.   Filling your life with activities that you enjoy - creative, playful, sociable, soulful activities - are all ways to nurture yourself back to health   So right now I can't get enough of the song  urlLink Roses by Andre 3000 of Outkast .  This isn't anything personal.  Personally I like the beginning of the song with the upbeat piano playing.  Yeah this is the song that I am currently listening to.  I like it, no hard feelings.  I especially like the part in the song below:    I know you like too thank your s*** don't stank but lean a little bit closer and see that roses really smell like boo, boo, boo, roses really smell like boo, boo, boo.     So that's enough of me writing.  I told you it was going to be kinda long.  Well I'm sore (not as sore after playing basketball last week but still sore.  It's a good feeling to use your lame duck muscles again.  Yeah.  It's definitely good to get back into the groove again.  Thank's for suffering through that shit.  No promises on is this sort of bullshit will be making a return apperance but for now, hopefully this will be the last of the sort.

      So last week, there was a huge media blitz regarding Van Helsing.  I was home Thursday and Friday and all I really saw on TV were commercials and specials that had something to do with Van Helsing.  Van Helsing this, Van Helsing that.  Grrr.  I even saw the making the movie special on one of those specialty channel.  I guess they had a lot of fun making the movie.  That was about it.  From the very beginning with the techno-classical music to the shot of Kate Bekinsale (sha-wing!) as she swings to the other tower in the end was just pure cheese.  I think it had more cheese than Wisconsin.  There were also so many other shots and lines and scenes and just bullshit that weren't needed.  Stupid one liners like "Don't Die!" (or something like that, were all over the place.  It was a good cast of interesting characters.  Dracula, Frankenstein, Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde, etc. etc. etc.  CGI effects were spectacular.  I really liked the fight scene with the werewolf and Dracula's natural form.  That was fun.  Oh and  urlLink Josie Maran  also played the last surviving wife of Dracula.  She too is another hottie.  Ahh yes, dirty thoughts of Josie Maran and Kate Bekinsale are just swirling about in my head that I can't concentrate.     Okay so back to the damn movie.  The Good - CGI special effects - Kate Bekinsale - Josie Maran - The story  The Bad - dialogue - music - too much CGI, not enough acting  The Ugly - the cheese factor - bad camera work - more fucking cheese  I really don't mean to be snobby here but it was just a cheesy ass movie.  Sure the little kids liked it but it was billed as this "adult-ish" movie that had a little bit of hype going into it's release weekend but failed to deliver.  Sure this movie will gross big and make the studies some money but it's not going to be "a classic" as one of the critics claimed that it was.  Good detail on the CGI not enough on dialogue and putting substance behind what looked good.  It was all fluff.  How's that for a one liner movie description.  Van Helsing = All Fluff  Unless you are a HUGE Hugh Jackman fan, this movie isn't worth paying full price for.  Now for the CGI and a couple of nice shots of Kate and Josie I would probably pay $5 for that or even rent the movie on DVD.  Otherwise the old school Dracula or Frankenstein would probably offer more.

      HAPPY MOTHER's DAY TO ALL MOTHERS OUT THERE! especially to my Mom, my friends Mom's and gasp! even Jenny (Bryce's Mom)  Ahhh yes a much needed weekend with my son.   Well things started out nicely and ended nicely.  People Met:   Krisitin  - Kristin is one of Sam's friends, she's a cutie with an ass and boobies.  Cool girl, she's got that southern type accent but not really southern because she didn't sound stupid.  She was about 5'4, big tits, nice ass, shoulder length curly hair.  Very friendly personality and it jus shows when she talked.  A genuinely nice girl, kinda shy but will still talk to you.  She also had this voice that would just melt you and wow.  If I saw a huge tidal wave coming from afar and she was right there with me telling me that things were going to be okay, I would be as calm as a sleeping baby.  Oh yeah I got her number too!  Yay!  too bad she's in Iowa.  Oh well.   Mindy  - I actually met Mindy some time ago, well the last time I was out there.  She's kinda shy but she's not.  The last time I was there we kinda got off the wrong foot.  I said something as a joke but she took it seriously.  She's got a nice figure with a nice booty.  She's got short blonde hair, that wispy type that drives me wild.  Hmm, she was a definite cutie.  She's got a cute laugh and a sense of humor more my level (retarded and not snobby).  She's also a good sport and enjoys XBOX video games.  Yeah, I got her number too but, again, it's no use since I live in IL and she's from Iowa.  Grrr... Oh well.   Chris  - Met Chris at Hyvee where me and Sam went for some fucking food.  I was hungry and needed to pee and this kid was there.  He seemed cool enough.  Didn't really interact with him much but he wasn't a nuisance either.   Random Mexican  - Dude, this guy came up to me and told me that I was weird.  And then he proceeded to tell me that I was cool and then he was asking for the time (I think he was just scoping out my watch) and he wouldn't leave me alone for like 10 minutes.  Damn fucker.  Needless to say I didn't want, nor get that number.   Waitress from Vieux Carre's  - I forgot her name but she was a cutie too!  Blonde hair to the middle of her back, about 5'4 and she had a healthier than I like it booty.  I asked where other places to go and she was not as accomodating as I would have wanted.  Still a nice girl but really not that much interaction.   Friday   So Friday I ate lunch at my parents house because I had to fix my sister's computer so it could join the network at home.  After eating and relaxing while watching some stupid shit on TV I went on and left to go to Iowa.  I was only doing 80 the whole way.  Pretty relaxed drive.  Thought about what has happened throughout the week from Meghan to work shit.  Well who am I kidding, it was mostly about Meghan and just bullshit thoughts that were going through my head on what could have been, if it was better like this etc. etc. etc.  Got to Sam's place and it was still light out.  Walked in, said hi to Sam and Laura and sat down at the computer and cracked opened a beer.  Played Far Cry and Painkiller or something like that, good games.    Mindy walks in a couple of minutes later and we just kinda laughed at each other as we both said "I don't hate you..."  It was funny.  It was good that things went better this time around.  After a few more rounds of PC FPS, Sam and Laura went to the store to go buy shit for dinner.  That left me and Mindy all alone.  So we talked for a while.  Talked about movies and music and what she liked to do, you know the usual BS small talk.  I asked her if she wanted to go see and movie and she agreed since Laura and Sam were going with.  I then wanted to see if this girl was a geek (since that's what I'm into now) and I think she's just competitive.  We played XBOX and flirted.  We played Need for Speed:Underground.  She's actually not a bad driver either, I was surprised.  We then switched gears to Soul Caliber 2.  She played that too.  She had to learn a little first but she was able to beat me but in a not so alarming ratio.  Who ever loses drinks was that game and she was losing quite a bit.  HeHe, Of course I laid down a couple of times but I won enough to get her juices going.  More flirting ensued with a little shoulder bumping and physical contact.  It was fun.  We ate dinner (good tacos by the way, thanks to the host) and we went to go see Van Helsing.    It sucked.  I didn't like it.  The women throughout the whole movie were damn fine and that was enjoyable.  The eye candy was also breath taking but besides that it was just a goofy ass multi million doller hollywood goofy scary movie.  I would absolutely treasure a night with  urlLink Kate Bekinsale .  She's a hottie.  I didn't like her with her black hair but it was still hot.  I like her much better with her natural hair with blonde streaks!  Yummy Yummy.    After that we played a little three man.  It was funny because at one point there was a rule that said "everytime you say something you have to end it with 'IN MY PANTS'"  Yeah, that was funny.  Just imagine certain phrases that would come out when people have been drinking.  For exaple: "You gotta drink - in my pants" or "Who's turn is it - in my pants"  Well from there I hope people can imagine.  It was funny for a while but it eventually got old and we had to kill the rule.  We played some more three man and switched to asshole.  After that we retreated to Sam's room for a little dance party (with four people, whatever! it was still fun) among other things.  It was too bad that Mindy had to work the next day.  Hah, it was a fun night.  It was as much fun as I had had in a long time.  I hate passing out, it ruin's my plans!  SHIT FUCK BITCH GRRR  Saturday  Woke up around noon.  Mindy was still there, I had to get ready to go visit Bryce so I jumped in the shower real quick, got some Taco Johns (again I manage to spill the contents of my taco onto my pants but this time I was able to save my pants from getting ruined)    I get to Bryce's current residence and he had just woken up and was a little groggy when he saw me.  It was cute.  His hair was all sticking up and he had a sleepy face but it perked up as soon as he saw me.  Hehe, he said "DADDY!"  It was good to hear that again in person.  Man, the boy is potty trained already!!!  2 and some odd months and he can do decide if he wants to go number 1 or number 2 (sorry to the people who don't have kids but for a two year old to go potty on thier own is pretty damn good.  His 2nd birthday was just this past February and he can do this already.  He doesn't even pee on his brand new bed that his grandparents bought him.  Yeah, he's got his own twin size bed to sleep in.  He can walk his sleepy ass over to his bed and climb up and sleep as well as climb down when he has to go potty or wake up.  What a kid!) it was just amazing to see this little person doing things that's not average.    Much love and thanks to the grand parents.  They were nice to me too as they gave me dinner and told me all about the things that he has been doing and learning and conversating about.  He's on this little race car kick.  His bed is all race cars, he's got two big organizers for his Hot Wheels and we played with those.  We played catch out side.  We played kick the ball out side.  We picked up sticks and chased squirrels and birds.  We played in my car, he was pressing buttons.  He also took my toll money and put it in his piggy bank.  He then rifled thorugh my wallet and he took a couple of bills and put it in his piggy bank himself.  I think it added to to like $40 and some change.  That was fine.  He's him with a dollar.

      from  urlLink Sushi Queen   Blah! I Vant to Suck $7.50 Out of Your Vallet! Van Helsing was seriously one of the worst movies I've ever seen in the history of...FOREVER. It was laughable, and by that I mean I seriously laughed through the last fifteen minutes of it. It started off okay and everything, but suddenly got exponentially cheesier.  Cheesy Moment #1: Van Helsing fights Mr. Hyde. Why it was cheesy: Mr. Hyde looked like some Special Effects guy sat a monkey at a computer, ran photoshop, and let the monkey come up with a really crappy animation. It was bad. It looked like a really shitty 3-D cartoon character.  Cheesy Moment #2: The Horses pulling Van Helsing's carriage jump a 100-foot crevice. Why it was cheesy: Take a guess, Sherlock. I wanted to just smack myself for spending $7.50 on this piece of garbage. Horses won't even jump hurdles unless you whip them sufficiently and threaten to take them to the glue factory, so they're sure as hell not going to jump a 100 FOOT RAVINE. Unless I was mistaken and they were actually a band of WILD PEGASUSES. Hey, Frankenstein, Igor, Mr. Hyde, Dracula, Werewolves, little vampire babies, why not PEGASUSES?  Cheesy Moment #3: Dracula's Children Emerge! Well, well, apparently Dracula had some damn potent sperm because he had approximately A BILLION KIDS. You would have sworn the dude was Puerto Rican. I bet the County Welfare Dep. of Transylvania is buyin' their blood. Why it was Cheesy: Um, Dracula's babies? No matter how you look at that, it's cheesy. Dracula isn't supposed to have babies, especially not ones who look like a bunch of bats with Down Syndrome.  Cheesy Moment #4: Frankenstein makes a friend. Why it was cheesy: This is where I started to belly-laugh. Kate Beckensale is fighting the last of Dracula's brides when Frankstein bursts through the window to her rescue. He urges the young Gypsy woman to leave and rescue Van Helsing, as he pummels the vampire chick. On her way out, though, she pauses, turns to Frankenstein, and utters a "Thanks." The look on Frankenstein's face made me want to piss my pants. He totally cried a single tear. At that point my companions eeked out an "Awwww!" and then I thought maybe if I hit them in the face hard enough, they'd cry a single tear too. They actually cried more than one, though.  Cheesy Moment #5: Gypsy girl dies! Why it was Cheesy: Earlier in the film she mentions how much she'd like to see the sea, so it's only appropriate for her to be buried there. As she's being cremated, this really cheesy chime sound plays. And I totally was like, "That's the sound of her spirit floating to heaven!" and people were like, "SSSH, THIS IS THE SAD PART." Then, Van Helsing looks up into the sky only to her face materialize out of the Cumulous Transylvanian clouds and she reunites with her diseased family in the sky. How poignant.  Cheesy Moment #6: Frankenstein rows off into the sunset. Why it was cheesy: Okay, so at the end of the movie, when Van Helsing is burying Gypsy girl and drooling over her face in the sky, Frankenstein's monster (though he's referred, inaccurately, as Frankenstein throughout the entire movie) sets sail on this little shitty hand-built raft, and floats into the sunset. Where you going, pal? Monster Island? You're a freak of nature, so it's not like you can just stop anywhere and be like, "Hey, I'd like to become a citizen...I can speak Spanish, and I know the Anthem." That was seriously the most retarded part in the movie. How's he going to get there? It's the fucking ocean, there's no signs that are like, "Yo, this way to land!" I guess his strategy was to just float. God, that was stupid.  Also, I've come to the conclusion that Dracula is Muslim for three very valid reasons. 1. His Aversion to crosses. Like Muslims, Dracula is repelled by the sight of a crucifix, and upon touching one, will burst into flames. 2. His abundance of wives. In this movie he had three, but, according to Islamic law, he's allowed to have two more. He can perhaps barter goats to acquire the other two. 3. His tendency to only feed at night. Many Muslims forgo the practice of Rhamadan, a traditional fasting that forbids its followers to eat during the day. Sound familiar? I think so.

      Sorry for a ridiculously long post but this was a good read.  Yay for pink elephants!  Many years ago, I was so innocent I still considered it possible that we could become the humane and reasonable America so many members of my generation used to dream of. We dreamed of such an America during the Great Depression, when there were no jobs. And then we fought and often died for that dream during the Second World War, when there was no peace.  But I know now that there is not a chance in hell of America’s becoming humane and reasonable. Because power corrupts us, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Human beings are chimpanzees who get crazy drunk on power. By saying that our leaders are power-drunk chimpanzees, am I in danger of wrecking the morale of our soldiers fighting and dying in the Middle East? Their morale, like so many bodies, is already shot to pieces. They are being treated, as I never was, like toys a rich kid got for Christmas.  -------------------------  When you get to my age, if you get to my age, which is 81, and if you have reproduced, you will find yourself asking your own children, who are themselves middle-aged, what life is all about. I have seven kids, four of them adopted.  Many of you reading this are probably the same age as my grandchildren. They, like you, are being royally shafted and lied to by our Baby Boomer corporations and government.  I put my big question about life to my biological son Mark. Mark is a pediatrician, and author of a memoir, The Eden Express. It is about his crackup, straightjacket and padded cell stuff, from which he recovered sufficiently to graduate from Harvard Medical School.  Dr. Vonnegut said this to his doddering old dad: “Father, we are here to help each other get through this thing, whatever it is.” So I pass that on to you. Write it down, and put it in your computer, so you can forget it.  I have to say that’s a pretty good sound bite, almost as good as, “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.” A lot of people think Jesus said that, because it is so much the sort of thing Jesus liked to say. But it was actually said by Confucius, a Chinese philosopher, 500 years before there was that greatest and most humane of human beings, named Jesus Christ.  The Chinese also gave us, via Marco Polo, pasta and the formula for gunpowder. The Chinese were so dumb they only used gunpowder for fireworks. And everybody was so dumb back then that nobody in either hemisphere even knew that there was another one.  But back to people, like Confucius and Jesus and my son the doctor, Mark, who’ve said how we could behave more humanely, and maybe make the world a less painful place. One of my favorites is Eugene Debs, from Terre Haute in my native state of Indiana. Get a load of this:  Eugene Debs, who died back in 1926, when I was only 4, ran 5 times as the Socialist Party candidate for president, winning 900,000 votes, 6 percent of the popular vote, in 1912, if you can imagine such a ballot. He had this to say while campaigning:  As long as there is a lower class, I am in it. As long as there is a criminal element, I’m of it.  As long as there is a soul in prison, I am not free.  Doesn’t anything socialistic make you want to throw up? Like great public schools or health insurance for all?  How about Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount, the Beatitudes?  Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the Earth.  Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.  Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God. …  And so on.  Not exactly planks in a Republican platform. Not exactly Donald Rumsfeld or Dick Cheney stuff.  For some reason, the most vocal Christians among us never mention the Beatitudes. But, often with tears in their eyes, they demand that the Ten Commandments be posted in public buildings. And of course that’s Moses, not Jesus. I haven’t heard one of them demand that the Sermon on the Mount, the Beatitudes, be posted anywhere.  “Blessed are the merciful” in a courtroom? “Blessed are the peacemakers” in the Pentagon? Give me a break!  -------------------------  There is a tragic flaw in our precious Constitution, and I don’t know what can be done to fix it. This is it: Only nut cases want to be president.  But, when you stop to think about it, only a nut case would want to be a human being, if he or she had a choice. Such treacherous, untrustworthy, lying and greedy animals we are!  I was born a human being in 1922 A.D. What does “A.D.” signify? That commemorates an inmate of this lunatic asylum we call Earth who was nailed to a wooden cross by a bunch of other inmates. With him still conscious, they hammered spikes through his wrists and insteps, and into the wood. Then they set the cross upright, so he dangled up there where even the shortest person in the crowd could see him writhing this way and that.  Can you imagine people doing such a thing to a person?  No problem. That’s entertainment. Ask the devout Roman Catholic Mel Gibson, who, as an act of piety, has just made a fortune with a movie about how Jesus was tortured. Never mind what Jesus said.  During the reign of King Henry the Eighth, founder of the Church of England, he had a counterfeiter boiled alive in public. Show biz again.  Mel Gibson’s next movie should be The Counterfeiter. Box office records will again be broken.  One of the few good things about modern times: If you die horribly on television, you will not have died in vain. You will have entertained us.  -------------------------  And what did the great British historian Edward Gibbon, 1737-1794 A.D., have to say about the human record so far? He said, “History is indeed little more than the register of the crimes, follies and misfortunes of mankind.”  The same can be said about this morning’s edition of the New York Times.  The French-Algerian writer Albert Camus, who won a Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957, wrote, “There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide.”  So there’s another barrel of laughs from literature. Camus died in an automobile accident. His dates? 1913-1960 A.D.  Listen. All great literature is about what a bummer it is to be a human being: Moby Dick, Huckleberry Finn, The Red Badge of Courage, the Iliad and the Odyssey, Crime and Punishment, the Bible and The Charge of the Light Brigade.  But I have to say this in defense of humankind: No matter in what era in history, including the Garden of Eden, everybody just got there. And, except for the Garden of Eden, there were already all these crazy games going on, which could make you act crazy, even if you weren’t crazy to begin with. Some of the games that were already going on when you got here were love and hate, liberalism and conservatism, automobiles and credit cards, golf and girls’ basketball.   Even crazier than golf, though, is modern American politics, where, thanks to TV and for the convenience of TV, you can only be one of two kinds of human beings, either a liberal or a conservative.  Actually, this same sort of thing happened to the people of England generations ago, and Sir William Gilbert, of the radical team of Gilbert and Sullivan, wrote these words for a song about it back then:  I often think it’s comical How nature always does contrive That every boy and every gal That’s born into the world alive Is either a little Liberal Or else a little Conservative. Which one are you in this country? It’s practically a law of life that you have to be one or the other? If you aren’t one or the other, you might as well be a doughnut.  If some of you still haven’t decided, I’ll make it easy for you.  If you want to take my guns away from me, and you’re all for murdering fetuses, and love it when homosexuals marry each other, and want to give them kitchen appliances at their showers, and you’re for the poor, you’re a liberal.  If you are against those perversions and for the rich, you’re a conservative.  What could be simpler?  -------------------------  My government’s got a war on drugs. But get this: The two most widely abused and addictive and destructive of all substances are both perfectly legal.  One, of course, is ethyl alcohol. And President George W. Bush, no less, and by his own admission, was smashed or tiddley-poo or four sheets to the wind a good deal of the time from when he was 16 until he was 41. When he was 41, he says, Jesus appeared to him and made him knock off the sauce, stop gargling nose paint.  Other drunks have seen pink elephants.  And do you know why I think he is so pissed off at Arabs? They invented algebra. Arabs also invented the numbers we use, including a symbol for nothing, which nobody else had ever had before. You think Arabs are dumb? Try doing long division with Roman numerals.  We’re spreading democracy, are we? Same way European explorers brought Christianity to the Indians, what we now call “Native Americans.”   How ungrateful they were! How ungrateful are the people of Baghdad today.  So let’s give another big tax cut to the super-rich. That’ll teach bin Laden a lesson he won’t soon forget. Hail to the Chief.  That chief and his cohorts have as little to do with Democracy as the Europeans had to do with Christianity. We the people have absolutely no say in whatever they choose to do next. In case you haven’t noticed, they’ve already cleaned out the treasury, passing it out to pals in the war and national security rackets, leaving your generation and the next one with a perfectly enormous debt that you’ll be asked to repay.  Nobody let out a peep when they did that to you, because they have disconnected every burglar alarm in the Constitution: The House, the Senate, the Supreme Court, the FBI, the free press (which, having been embedded, has forsaken the First Amendment) and We the People.   About my own history of foreign substance abuse. I’ve been a coward about heroin and cocaine and LSD and so on, afraid they might put me over the edge. I did smoke a joint of marijuana one time with Jerry Garcia and the Grateful Dead, just to be sociable. It didn’t seem to do anything to me, one way or the other, so I never did it again. And by the grace of God, or whatever, I am not an alcoholic, largely a matter of genes. I take a couple of drinks now and then, and will do it again tonight. But two is my limit. No problem.  I am of course notoriously hooked on cigarettes. I keep hoping the things will kill me. A fire at one end and a fool at the other.  But I’ll tell you one thing: I once had a high that not even crack cocaine could match. That was when I got my first driver’s license! Look out, world, here comes Kurt Vonnegut.  And my car back then, a Studebaker, as I recall, was powered, as are almost all means of transportation and other machinery today, and electric power plants and furnaces, by the most abused and addictive and destructive drugs of all: fossil fuels.  When you got here, even when I got here, the industrialized world was already hopelessly hooked on fossil fuels, and very soon now there won’t be any more of those. Cold turkey.  Can I tell you the truth? I mean this isn’t like TV news, is it?  Here’s what I think the truth is: We are all addicts of fossil fuels in a state of denial, about to face cold turkey.  And like so many addicts about to face cold turkey, our leaders are now committing violent crimes to get what little is left of what we’re hooked on.

      "All we had was your blind fascination with me, and that could only get us as far as all shallow things can allow."  Meghan  Fuck that. Blind facination huh? would blind facination be enough to call every night while you were struggling on cheating on your boyfriend to make you feel better? would it be enough to drive four hours every chance that I got to see you? would it be enough to have you meet my family and have them accept and like you? would it be enough to have you hang out with the best of friends that I have in MI? would it be enough to keep me around even though the whole time you've been lamenting your ex? would it be enough for me to drive there to pick you up, drive back to Chicago for a car show to hang out with my best female friend and then drive you back? would it be enough for me to stay the night especially when you couldn't sleep and drive back early monday morning? would it be enough that I would want to share my everyday with you? would it be enough that I kept you company when you were alone? would it be enough that I actually told you to tell him but you were satisfied on lying to his face about it. would it be enough that I forgave you for blatantly lying to MY face? would it be enough that I forgave you for setting up those traps? would it be enough that I wanted to share things that I liked with you? there are so many other things that I could list but in the end it doesn't really matter.  you never cared and I cared too much.  My "blind facination......and all shallow things" yeah FUCK YOU.  Fuck you for teeling me how I felt.  All that talk that you had for me it was all fluff.  You were just all talk.  You were, you are and you will be.  All the things that you said really didn't mean anything to you.  It was all lip service.  I thought you were better than that.  I guess not.  You're still a fucking kid.  As old as you might like to portray yourself, you are still a fucking child.  You better grow up because California will eat you alive if you don't.  Well, wait, you will probably just get another poor sap like me and use him up and then toss him like a bad habit.  Whatever bitch, I would wish you a good life again but whatever.

      SO last night there was a bunch of shit on the boob tube.  *  Cubs vs. Giants - Cubs won!  Hell yeah.  Alou hit a walk off homerun to win it for the Cubs in the bottom of the 10.  Hell yeah baby, still a game out of 1st place but that's quite alright.  *  Wolves vs. Kings - Wolves won!  Oh yeah, besides the crappy Bulls, the Wolves are one of my favorite teams.  Kevin Garnett is for fucking real man.  He "imposed his will" (taken from David Aldridge of ESPN) on the game and I haven't seen anyone do that for quite some time.  If anyone deserves MVP in the league it's definitely him.  Now if he can get his team past the Lakers...That's going to be a tough series.  If it goes to a game 7, I go for the Wolves otherwise, it's going to be the Lakers in 6 tough tough games.  *  Season Finale of Smallville - So Clark sees this chick and she has powers and shit like Clark.  Lana left for Paris.  Lionel is behind bars.  Clark finds out that the girl is someone who dies a long time ago as she leads him to the cave where Jorel is talking to him.  He gets sucked into the wall and then wait for next year.  I would have liked it if it ended a little differently.  Like him running away and living in Metropolis.  See he's only a junior and with his senior year coming up I think it would be a good change of scenery if he just up and left for Metropolis.  Lana, the love of his life, is gone.  Pete is gone as well.  The only person left if freakin Chloe.  She can get very annoying.  She is a geek and I like geeks but sincerely, she's one of those geeks that might be a little bit too cheery for me.  I love her hair though.  Just the right length for err...never mind, sister reads this ^^  Yes, senior year of HS in Metropolis.  New characters introduced, old ones revisit.  He makes a new fast friend etc etc etc.  A whole new angle where he's trying to be good but still bad but good because he doesn't have the red kryptonite on him.  I dunno, there are more directions to go with if he was in the city compared to Smallville, Kansas.  Anyways, still enjoyed the show.  The Karen chick was a hottie.  I'd take her any day of the week.  I think I need some sweet sweet alone time with her.  *  Series Finale of Angel - Well, what can I say.  It was good, it was kinda bad, it was just in between.  Yeah.  I like Angel.  I try to watch it after watching Smallville but I really couldn't get into it.  The ending was kinda crazy with all of them (the ones who survived after they tried to kill the Black Thorn) were up against a few buddies of the people they killed.  Pretty much hell was coming after them.  Through deceiving the people who trusted him he was able to get inside the Black Thorn and become a member.  He knew each person's identity and hatched a plan to kill off each of them.  I enjoyed the last few moments of Angel.  I wish I had gotten into it earlier than I did but oh well.  It's gone, I suppose a box set rental would be cool to do.  *  Star Trek: Enterprise - I didn't get much out of Star Trek because of the other shows I was watching but it had something to do with the Xindi fighting each other to save humanity's hide.  Of the 5 races of Xindi, all were up for building a weapon that would destroy Earth and kill all Human kind.  Enterprise was sent to this mission because of a Xindi probe that killed 6 million people.  It was a test to see the destructive power of their new creation.  Although that was just a test with a prototype, the much larger version was only a few years from completion.  So enterprise set a course for the expanse to search and destroy this weapon.  To make sure that it won't happen.  In this episode, one of the hotter characters on the show, this Asian chick Sato was captured and she was to decrypt the arming sequence and get the ball rolling (so to speak).  I think she did.  I don't remember, all I know is that the other Xindi who were in the plan backed out and are now fighting the Reptilians (the race who actually hates the humans because they think the humans will end their world in the future).  That's where I left off.  I don't know if anyone can help me out and tell me what happened with the weapon, that would be great!  For a little bit of nerdy thinking now, see the problem is that I need fucking TIVO or some sort of Personal Video Recorder.  actually I would much rather have 1 big TV with several screens that can be divided up (kinda like the ones at BestBuy stores by the video games section) and hooked up to an audio selector that goes with your eye focus to select which TV you would have to hear sound.  did I explain that right?  Here, let's try again.  I want a big TV.  a TV where I can have up to 4 displays of shows.  With that, I want earphones that selects the audio through where my eye watches TV.  Now that would be a great invention!  Think about the possibilities!  Let's keep it simple with 4 divisions for example.  top left would have the Cubs on.  Top right would have Smallville on.  Bottom left would have enterprise and say you are just really bored, you can hook up an XBOX to the bottom right.  Say Smallville was on a commercial, you can switch and look at Enterprise and listen and watch there.  The cubs would still be playing and you can casually glance to see the score.  If all are on commercial, you can keep playing your game of KOTOR or HALO and not miss a beat with all your shows.  If you only want to watch on show, then turn of the screen divider and wala! you got one big screen to watch your sports event, show or play video games on!  Alright, enough rambling!

      Yeah Gout sucks, missed work yesterday because I couldn't even move let alone put a sock on not to mention a fucking shoe.  Back at work now and here's a little something to start the day off.  ==================================  A young man enter the confessional in an Irish church.  "Bless me Father, for I have sinned. I have been with a loose woman."  The priest asks, "Is that you, little Tommy Shaughnessy?"  "Yes, Father, it is."  "And, who was the woman you were with?"  "I can't be tellin' you, Father. I don't want to ruin her reputation."  "Well, Tommy, I'm sure to find out sooner or later, so you may as well tell me now.  Was it Brenda O'Malley?"  "I cannot say."  "Was it Patricia Kelly?"  "I'll never tell."  "Was it Liz Shannon?"  "I'm sorry, but I can't name her."  "Was it Ann Morgan?"  "My lips are sealed."  "Was it Fiona McDonald, then?"  "Please, Father, I cannot tell you."  The priest sighs in frustration.  "You're a steadfast lad, Tommy Shaughnessy, and I admire that. But you've sinned, and you must atone.  You cannot attend church mass for three months. Be off with you now."  Tommy walks back to his pew. His friend Sean slides over and whispers, "What'd you get?! "  "Three month's vacation and five good leads."

      1.  It's crappy outside 2.  There's discrepancy with my bank account 3.  I forgot my lunch 4.  I haven't had a smoke for two whole days 5.  On top of everything else, I am in the middle of a fucking gout attack.  How great is that?  I can't miss work either because I have to work Saturday.  To get a bonus day's worth of pay for this Saturday, I have to work 5 consecutive, at least, 8 hour days.  Now that's some shit.  I am in some serious fucking pain right now and I really can't stand being at work.  I don't know if anyone out there has ever had gout.  In my case, it's like having a million needles peircing the ball (not heel) of your foot everytime you move it.  Gout is like that, well it's actually crystalline induced arthritis.  It sucks.  Crystals form in the joints of one's lower extremeties and as two joints "rub" against each other, the whole joint gets inflammed.  With gout also comes a slight fever as well as a general lousy feeling.  I feel really shitty right now, kinda like a lazy, sleepy state where I don't want to do anything except lay in bed and just wait this gout out.  It's not going to go away anytime soon.  I already took a couple of pain killers as well as shit to help reduce the saturation of uric acid in my system.    Uric acid is what starts gout.  Remember those chemistry kits that you had when you were a kid?  The one where you could make crystals?  It's like pour the liquid in a jar and put contents of this package with it, wait a week and at the end of the week you will have crystals.  It's pretty much like that.  Too much uric acid in your system will cause gout.  Crystals will form in your joints, you feel lousy and shitty for a couple of days (maybe longer) and back you go.  It could be from slow metabolism or a huge intake all at once.  I think it was from this past weekend.  Actually I'm pretty sure that it was.  Friday we went to 602 and had a few beers.  That's no big deal but Saturday in Milwaukee and Sunday's dinner was what probably did me in.  Saturday was a huge drink feast.  I probably had about 3 pitchers all by myself while I was drinking with Jerry's family.  They drank a whole lot too!  Probably more than I did.  So that's number 1.  Too much beer.  Another factor was the beer nuts.  Yep, there was this huge thing of nuts at the bar and we just kept getting more and more.  It was the one that had the shells and you had to crack it open.  Yerah those, it was good.  So in Milwaukee, uric acid came in the form of beer and nuts.  I knew I was going to get this gout too!  I called it.  After the Cubs game and the 2nd bowl of nuts, I figure I was going to be dying sometime this week from gout.  Well I am pretty much dying right now.  It hurts like a bitch.  See red meat also has a lot of uric acid.  Guess what I had for dinner Sunday?  I had a nice huge steak.  Yeah.  So I had steak yesterday for breakfast and for dinner last night.  SHIT!!!  This sucks.  Yeah, I was just writing to get my mind of the pain for a little bit.  Man, I just know that this is just the beginning.  Tonight will be terrible and tomorrow will be unbeliveable.  on a pain scale of 1-10 with 10 being the worst (meaning you can't even stand) right now I have a 7.  It hurts but I can still do it.  I know as the day goes on it will slowly reach 8-9 and by tomorrow a 10.  I probably won't even be able to put a sock on.  God I wish I had a girl here to pamper me.  That would be great!  Sorry to bore everyone with a very ridiculous entry about gout and feeling lousy but this really sucks!

      Last work week was my late week at work.  I didn't have to go to work till 9:30 AM.  It was alright but the thing was I didn't get out of work till 6 PM.  That's not really an issue except it's fucking summer and there are places to be on certain weekends and things to do on certain weekends.  Friday we went to 602 North, there was some crappy band, we played darts and shit it was cool.  I learned that it was Stacy's 2nd to last Friday there so I will probably be back next Friday to say good bye.  She always took care of me and my friends.  It was a fun run but as we all know, most things come to an end and this is one of them.  After 602 we were bored as hell so we went to Cadillac Ranch.  See the thing was, the last time I was there was the weekend before I first saw Meghan at her apartment.  Yeah, that first visit to MI.  I dunno it was still a ghetto place to be but there were girls there our age so I was having fun.  On our way out I ran into this kid Jerome who I knew from college.  Haven't seen the kid for a while, actually since fucking graduation 2 years ago.  He was with a few Filipino girls so that's a possible future hangout buddy I suppose.  We stayed there till about 3:30 AM and got home around 4:30 or something.  What a long night.  Saturday we went to Milwaukee.  It was Jerry's cousin's graduation at Marquette.  See that town is a little weird.  It had the feel of a big city but there wan't any huge buildings/sky scrapers so it was like having the Bulls with out Michael Jordan or something like that.  It might take me a while to get used to but eventually it will happen right?  Milwaukee was fun.  We went and partied it up with pretty much everyone in Jerry's family as well as a few girls from there (actually one girl was from MSU, go fucking figure!)  It was a fun time drinking with people you don't really know.  Oh and again, I was the only brown kid there, hehe.  I made it there in an hour and 10 minutes and I guess that's pretty fast.  We started drinking at 8:30 PM and didn't stop till about 3:30 AM.  I was still wide awake so instead of sleeping on the damn couch, I figure we'll be home in an hour and a half on easy driving anyways, might as well go fucking home.  So at about 5 AM we got home.  Before that I almost blew by a state trooper on the on ramp to 88 from 294.  Yeah, good thing for the cop vision.  Fun night and Summerfest never looked so good in Milwaukee!  I will be back in that town sometime.  It was a good time.  I was trying with one of the servers but I got too distracted by other things that she left before I could get her number.  It's an hour away, I can do that right?  But then again she was still a student.  Maybe I should look for a professional.  That might prove to be a challenge considering that it's summer and the clubs/bars have more girls in theme.  Hmmm, Fun Fun Fun.  It will be a good summer.  Remember it's my year right?  Year of the Monkey!  Today I woke up to Vicki calling me.  We talked for a little while.  She said that she wasn't a good swimmer.  I said that that's not good because if we ever got married we were going on our honeymoon somewhere where there's going to be water.  Besides, if she does go to camping trip this summer, she better have fun in the water with and everyone else.  I made my steak and rice lunch for tomorrow.  I think for breakfast I will be making steak and eggs and for dinner it will be steak again.  Yeah, I suppose you can say that I pretty much bought half a cow.  Yeah!  I should stop by the store tomorrow to go buy more steaks!  hehe.  I'll go try the Atkin's diet or someshit.  Cubbies won again today.  4 in a row!  Hell yeah!  Swept the Padre's!  wOOt!  Ahh, yes  Hope that everyone had a great weekend and wish all of you (friends and random readers) a very good week ahead!

      You know, those guys at  urlLink Microsoft  fucking suck!!!  Well especially the Gamertag team that monitors them on  urlLink XBOX Live  because they changed my fucking gamertag from  mikeoxlong  to  mikeloxlong .  I know for a damn fact that I put it in correctly.  I double checked because I know this name isn't very popular.  I guess someone at microsoft is retarded enough and found it out.  So to who ever that fucking guy/girl is, FUCK YOU for changing my gamertag.  Bitches!  click  urlLink here  and seach for my gamertag to see my latest stats.  I just started thus the shitty ranking and stuff but whatever, sooner or later I will be up there with the 31337.

       People come into your life for a reason, a season, or a lifetime. When you figure out which it is, you know exactly what to do.   -Michelle Ventor   Wouldn't it be wonderful if our first love could be our one and only love, forever and ever, amen? Well, surely you know by now that life is not like that. People come and go in our lives, taking a little piece of our heart with them. As difficult or painful as it may be, that is exactly what they should do. We have more than enough love to share and spare, and we should give it freely. When we love for a reason it feels good to give love, because we get what we give. When we have seasonal love, it is a whirlwind love, preparing us for something better. When those very special people come into our lives, we can and do love them forever. Loving is not what causes our emotional damage, it is the attempt to throw people out of our hearts and minds. When we love reasonably for the season we are in, we will undoubtedly enjoy a lifetime of loving.   A REASON.....   When someone is in your life for a reason, it is usually to meet a need you have expressed outwardly or inwardly. They have come to assist you through a difficulty, to provide you with guidance and support, to aid you physically, emotionally or spiritually. They may seem like a godsend, and they are. They are there for the reason you need them to be. Then, without any wrongdoing on your part or at an inconvenient time, this person will say or do something to bring the relationship to an end. Sometimes they die. Sometimes they walk away. Sometimes they act up or out and force you to take a stand. What we must realize is that our need has been met, our desire fulfilled; their work is done. The prayer you sent up has been answered and it is now time to move on. NEXT!   A SEASON.....   When people come into your life for a season, it is because your turn has come to share, grow or learn. They may bring you an experience of peace or make you laugh. They may teach your something you have never done. They usually give you an unbelievable amount of joy. Believe it!! It is real! But only for a season. In the same way that leaves must fall from the trees, or the moon becomes full and then disappears, your seasonal relationships will end at the divinely appointed time. When that times comes, there is nothing you can say or do to make it work. There is no one you can blame. You cannot fix it. You cannot explain it. The harder you clutch, the worse it will feel. When the end of a season comes in a loving relationship, the only thing for you to do is to let go.   A LIFETIME.....   Lifetime relationships are a bit more difficult to let go of. When a parent, child or spouse is involved, the wounds are very deep. When the end of lifetime relationship comes, you may feel that you would be better off dead. The pain seems to grow, the memories linger, and a part of your life is dying. You relive every painful moment in an attempt to understand. You job is not to understand. Your job is to accept. Lifetime relationships teach you lifetime lessons; these things you must build upon in order to have a solid emotional foundation. They are the most difficult lessons to learn, the most painful to accept; yet these are the things you need in order to grow. When you are facing a separation of the end of a lifetime relationship, the key is to find the lesson; love the person anyway; move on and put what you have learned to use in all other relationships.   Just have faith that a new life begins when a part of life ends...     -Author Unknown     I found this a long time ago online but stumbled upon it again today.  Now we won't get back into the whole Meghan thing again but I can't help but mention that she was a season.  So enough of that.  It's a good thing that I didn't go to New York with her or else I wouldn't have enough PTO left to go to the Philippines during Christmas.  Sadly, that means that I won't be spending New Years here in the US either.  That might suck but then again it's been eons since I have been back to the mother land and reconnected with old friends and family.  I really am looking forward to the trip.  It's going to be a sweet Christmas and New Years celebration over there.  This also means that I gotta save some money to be able to party it up like a rockstar as well as pay for part of the air fare.  Go around shopping at the cheap places, see if there are any cheap bootleg games (hopefully they will work with a US Spec XBOX.  It'll also be a good time to check out the 'real" Manila nightlife but then again I think I will be supporting my cousins and their friends if we all decide to go.  That might be a little tough on the wallet because there's probably a lot of them.  I will have to acclimate myself again with having no car.  That's going to suck (yes I am definitely spoiled).  I wonder if we'll be staying at the penthouse again this time around.  That's going to be fun.  It's going to be right in the middle of the metropolitan area and all the Ritzy hotels where all the damn foreigners hangout at will be with in walking distance.  Hell Yeah!  Well I guess that's the most news worthy thing that I got right now.  A season...

      Hmm, I think not but the equations listed below seem to be pretty solid with respect to some sort of fuzzy mathematical/logic equation.  What the hell do you think?        See I'm no man basher femenazi here.  I just found this thing online and it baffled me that the logic seemed solid.  It sucks but the math is correct here ladies and gentlemen.  What the FUCK!!!  Bitches are still bitches.  Someone make up a better equation for this!

      Season finale of The Simpsons.  Read  urlLink this .  Especially true is this excerpt.    By episode's end, Lisa's example inspires many of the residents of Springfield to start their own newspapers. "Instead of one big-shot controlling all the media," Homer says, "now there's a thousand freaks Xeroxing their worthless opinions."    It just made me think about blogging.  A lot of blogs out there, like mine, are truly worthless.  It really doesn't deal with anything important or life changing.  Sometimes it will feature something regarding current events but mostly it's just a stupid blog about what is going on.  I guess that is all I have for now.

      So Friday was fun.  Went to 602 for a little happy hour gathering.  It lasted for a few hours and then we went to Circuit City for a free copy of Rainbow Six 3 if you bought three months of XBOX Live.  So we did.  Hell Yeah, time to sharpen some skillz and dominate online (except for when there's fucking LAG with our cable modem, that sucks.  Gamer Tag: mikeoxlong)  Saturday we went to Mark's graduation party.  It was fun.  Again, as with a lot of social events with my friends, I was the only brown kid there but it was still fun.  Mark and Dave's family was friendly and the food was good.  Didn't have a lot of beer there since I am still hurting from the gout.  After that we went and closed down North Beach.  It got wierd after that.  Sunday was laundry day as well as home cooked meal day.  MMMmmm, sinagang, it was good.  Weekend was fun.  Next weekend is memorial day weekend so that should be fun as well.  Have a great week friends, family and random people.  I will make sure to put a more meaningful entry in the future.  For now, you get this BS.

      Faces to the Gamertag!!!  Alright, so I was bored last night playing RS3 when I created my own game and waited for the people on my friends list to go online when  urlLink this  chick started playing with me.  She's cool and all but she's only 16 and she lives in NY.  That might be a little too far for weekend driving besides the fact that she is jail bait material.  So in my search for girls in my area that play RS3 I have located 15 girls that play RS3 on XBOX live.  There are 15 girls who listed RS3 as their favorite game and 27 total girls in IL that play on XBOX live (that posted their pics on  urlLink the site .  Here's a few of the ones that look good.   urlLink GSPOTCHAOS  plays Ghost Recon: Island Thunder   urlLink JEN2U  plays Project Gotham Racing 2   urlLink LILBLONDIE11  plays Counter Strike   urlLink LONGDONGSILVER0  (I don't know if she's a real person but nice picture eh?   urlLink SASSY  plays MOTOGP   urlLink VIRTUALRACER  plays Midtown Madness  I guess that's about it for the chicks in IL.  I looked at MI and IA too but there really isn't much there.  I'm not saying that these chicks listed here are grade A but whatever I guess.  Wisconsin has some cute ones though.  like:  urlLink JV32 .  What a hottie little asian.  I guess she belongs to a gaming clan as well.  The  urlLink PMS Clan .  Hehe, I thought it really stood for the real PMS but apparently it stands for Psychotic Men Slayerz or something.  Whatever.  In Indiana there are a few as well like:  urlLink JEN N TONIC .  Clever I guess.   urlLink TIMIDDRAGONFLY  is kinda cute too!  RS3 was alright last night.  My gaming started out really slow.  I was getting killed left and right but gradually I finally was able to get going and start killing people.  Last night I also got my very first 5 kill round.  WAHOO!  hehe.  That was pretty cool but on average I would get 3 and then get killed.  Damn fuckers.  There goes my ELO.    Well that's it.  I should get back to work (HA!).  Alrighty

       urlLink This  is crazy!!!  An XBOX emulator???  Can anyone tell me if it works?  I don't have a kickass machine that will be able to run the thing.  I wonder if you will be able to play XBOX Live games.  I don't think you can but that would be cool if you could.  In other news,  urlLink eHarmony  is making a splash with  urlLink this  article.  SO matchmaking is just boiled down to a few equations here and a database over there?  I don't know about that.  I filled out a questionare for eHarmony and it took like 40 minutes.  Shit, comprehensive might be the word but seriously folks, has anyone every tried this shit out and actually stayed in a long lasting and meaningful relationship?  So in more meaningful news, on the front page of  urlLink CNN.com  there's a story about how the US has cracked the secret code of Iran's intelligence agency.  Pretty crazy and I guess there were things leaked that shouldn't have been leaked.  Read on.  That's really all I got for now.  I'm actually looking forward to playing a little RS3 since I didn't play yesterday.  Not to sound like an addict,  SHIT I NEED MY FUCKING FIX!!!

      So I called Jenny yesterday.  I've been thinking about Bryce and her for a little while now.  I was still at work so I said that I would call her later in the night.  We talked for a couple of hours, catching up and shit.  It was nice.  I don't know if these feelings are real or just flare ups of just missing someone being there for you.  It actually all started when I found more old shit that we used to write each other.  Old love letters old notes when we were in class.  It was cute.  I sounded like a complete idiot but so did she.  So many letters full of such sappiness.  At one point I couldn't help but bust out laughing out loud because of the ridiculous shit that we used to call each other and write each other.  I also found some of her old art work that I actually kept.  She's an artist.  I don't think that she has made anything new as of late but I kept a lot of her old shit.  I guess she's not with anyone right now.  Her and her ex-boyfriend still live together and I don't know how I feel about that but at least I know that they sleep in separate rooms.  She lost her job and her car is in dire need of repair.  She moved out of the shitty apartment in the middle of a shitty neighborhood and moved to the next town over and now lives in a townhouse with three other people (ex-boyfriend (Jack), best friend and best friend's boyfriend (Courtney and Joe?).  I'm sorry to say but I could really give a rat's ass about the rest of those people.  She's still pretty ghetto.  She still likes to portray herself as some sort of hardass that no one should fuck with but I know her better.  She's still a fucking softie.  There was some light flirtation here and there but no serious getting back together talk.  I really don't know where this is going to go.  I have no idea what her intentions are and frankly, I have no idea what my intentions are/were.  I guess I just missed her.  I don't know, I'm so confused.  On one side I want to be a family.  A real family with Bryce and her.  Do the whole being poor while young thing.  I would really give up my entire social life if I could be happy as a family.  On the other hand, I don't know if she has changed.  If she has grown up.  I don't know if she wants to work for shit now because she didn't.  It was a nasty break up and we were both at fault for that.  We were young back then.  When we fought, hurtful things were said that can never be taken back.  I guess we each held the other person on a higher standard but when that person didn't quite live up to that expectation both parties were equally frustrated with each other.  I don't know what the hell is going on.

      So in my search for more all girl gaming clans and girl gamers I ran across  urlLink this post  on  urlLink planethalflife.com .  Apparently there are some people out there with really way too much time on their hands.  This kid especially made a little experiment to see if girls get treated differently in a predominantly male gaming environment.  It would be a little harder to pull that shit off on XBOX Live considering they use voice.  Sure you can get a voice scambler or even turn on voice mask but that might be too much effor you know?

      WAAAHOOOOO!!!  So I went on training last week for networking downtown Chicago last week at IBM.  It was cool.  It was prety much a review of the shit that I took in college.  It was nice to see that I remembered whatever the hell I learned there because if I didn't that would be pathetic.  We discussed everything from what a network was to IP addressing.  Going into the class I was just cringing on what the class would look like.  Let me digress.  I had an image of what my next girl would be like and she would be as follows.  She had to be cute, geeky and smart plus shorter than me.  Very superficial indeed but then again I was just discussing looks.  So going back to the class.  I was cringing because I thought it would be all guy geeks and nerds and yeah, it would be bad.  Lo and behold I get there and take my seat reading the text provided when this short asian cute geeky girl walks in.  So damn cute.  Face was cute, had a killer body.  She was short and oh my, just soooo damn adorable.  I had a crush that very moment.  So we got to talking and I found out that she works for IBM as a technical sales person for their product line for Tivoli Storage Manager.  So class started and blah blah blah.  Lecture upon lecture upon lecture.  Lunch time came and I invited her to go to lunch.  We went to this little bistro down the street.  She seemed like a good girl.  Very polite, had a cute laugh.  Smile was adorable and man.  I just wanted to take her home and have her meet the family.  She was training for a triathalon so that is why she had a kickin' bod.  Found out that she couldn't ride a bike yet.  funny considering I thought everyone could ride a bike already.  Turns out she lives in Austin, TX.  That's a little far for weekend driving huh?  I what she was doing for Thursday night but I didn't have the balls.  Damn it!  Friday came and we talked some more during break.  I asked is she was staying for the whole weekend but I guess not.  She said normally if it wasn't a holiday weekend she would be here till Sunday but oh well.  Lunchtime came and I asked what she was doing but she was going to lunch with one of her girlfriends that just recently moved to Chicago.  DAMN!!!  She was going to do the tourist thing.  Man, I missed out on that one.  She said that she was going to be back in Chicago for the summer for more training so I gave her my email address for when she comes back.  I won't hold my breath.  Friday night was all about Rainbow Six 3 (RS3).  I played till fucking 3 in the morning.  Yes, I turned into a bigger geek.  There are a lot of good players out there and it's amazing how much you learn playing with them.  From peeking around corners to pressing the cround button while reloading, yeah there are definitely a lot of little things that will help you stay alive in that game long enough to contribute to your team (I play mostly Team Survival).  I did the exact same thing Saturday night after getting home from the bar.  Played till about 4 AM.  Sunday night I played till fucking 4:45.  There was already light out when I quit playing.  It was bad.  Interesting thing though is ESPN did a little story about gaming and how it is turning into big money these days.   urlLink Team 3D  is one of the top teams with a lot of spnsorship money and prize winnings that this is what they do.  They play video games for money and live off their winnings and sponsorships.  They travel the world to compete against other nerds!  Speaking of which, I found a great little all girl team  urlLink Angels of Impact .  An all girl gaming clan that plays Counter Strike.  I guess they are pretty good since their record reflects that (unless they play against shitty teams...).  My favorite so far is this cute blonde  urlLink Brittney .  I mean that smile and the hat cocked sideways and plays a FPS game.  Shit!  So cute.  there are other girls there that are cute as well but she is my favorite so far.   urlLink Ani  is damn fine as well.  This weekend was filled with a lot of eating and RS3.  I also lost like 10 pounds since last weekend.  I don't know what the hell is going on but hey, I'll take it.  Another 10-15 and then I'll be happy.  So a brand new week is here.  It's a good thing it is Thursday.  I gotta get back into the swing of things here at work considering I had Thursday and Friday pretty much off.  Yay for my boss for scheduling me to go to class the two days before Memorial Day weekend.  Thanks boss!

      Hey, I'm over you.  I sent you a text message to wish you a good and safe trip.  I will probably never see you again nor speak to you again but I figure I should still be nice to you.  That's it.  I really had nothing else to say so I don't know why you were waiting for me to say something after you called last night.  That was really it.

      Sweet!!!  Derek is getting XBOX Live!!!  TODAY!!!  Your turn Ted.  sam, you need to get some dough to get cable and broadband.  Last night was another long night of XBOX Live.  I definitely think it's a good thing that my XBOX isn't in my room considering how late I fucking play!  Damn it!  I was about to get off line last night at 12:30 when one of my buddies, BMW JAY popped in.  See I was hosting and I hate to host because people always want to keep playing into the damn wee hours of the night.  I wasn't doing too bad, but when I first started I did.  I think I have to do some terrorist hunts or something before playing for real.  Today, my aunt is coming in from the Motherland.  She's arriving at 3 and should be at my parents house by 4.  I don't get off work till 6 so I get home just in time for dinner!!!  Hell yeah!  I don't think I will be going to North Beach tonight.  That place is starting to get lame.  Once in a while it's cool but sincerely I am getting burnt out by the bar scene.  Besides, the drink special tonight is for beer and as we all know, I have gout and beer is my number one enemy.  How can something that taste so good be so bad.  *sigh*  Well, I will be on XBOX Live ASAP after the dinner at my parents house.  That should be around 8:30-9:00 PM if anyone cares.  It's a good thing that that's when my roommates go to North Beach.  Yeah...three hours, maybe even four hours of straight gaming.  playing with  urlLink JMV 624 ,  urlLink BMW JAY ,  urlLink WARMOOSE77 ,  urlLink FOUR RUNNER ,  urlLink THEPRODUCT23 ,  urlLink BLADE1000 ,  urlLink BIGGERGUNZ ,  urlLink INBREDBOBAFETT ,  urlLink DORNY ,  urlLink CAMBO86 ,  urlLink DONKEYPUNCHINYA , DEREK  urlLink     this should be fun as heck!

      I was looking around yesterday here on my blog when I noticed that there were some comments added to a previous entry that I had regarding some gaming and Team AOI (Angels of Impact).  They were from two of the clan members.   urlLink Kilikina  and  urlLink Sapphire .    Yeah, real live girl gamers that commented on my blog.  Wheee....hehe.  Anyways, here's a little update on my stats and progression in Team Survival for Rainbow Six 3 on XBOX Live  This is Cummulative  Rank    Gamertag      ELO    Kills Deaths Playing Time 28499   mikeloxlong   1098   812   1181   21:58:00    Monthly  Rank    Gamertag      ELO    Kills Deaths Playing Time 17400   mikeloxlong   1043   387   471    08:34:00    Weekly  Rank    Gamertag      ELO    Kills Deaths Playing Time 14097   mikeloxlong   1041   103   117    02:08:00  As I said, in the beginning, I had no idea how to play, I didn't know where the spawns where nor did I know what the hell they were talking about "box room" for or the layout of the maps (Trainyard, Carnival etc.).  I also didn't know where most of the points of entry are and where good sniping positions would be located.  Besides that my roommate likes to play sharpshooter where they are just out to kill everyone and with that, my deaths clib because he doesn't play a whole lot.  Now with that said, I played much more and am more familiar with the guns, the maps, how people play (i.e. where they would throw grenades, rushing etc.).  I'm still not good but I try to be as competitive as I can.  There are a few good people on my friends list and everytime I get an invite from them I am weary to join their game bcause I know they are probably playing with good people.  I still join it anyways to learn as much as possible.  Ted, you really need to get a computer.  After that, get freakin DSL since you already have "The Dish"  Then let's fucking tear it up in RS3.  Sam, stay at your job so you can finally get cable and broadband and then get XBOX Live.  It'll be one brotha.  Derek needs to get broadband and XBOX Live.  You all should have that shit in time for HALO 2.  Here are the stats with the guys that play with (monthly stats)  Rank    Gamertag    ELO   Kills Deaths Playing Time  80317   BLADE1000       781   180   396    06:03:00 33610   JMV 624         990   585   968    18:24:00 62920   Zerro G         908     3    14    00:14:00     58283   Four Runner     924    89   100    02:13:00   15257   BiggerGunz     1054    80    53    01:42:00   49547   WarMoose77      951   183   248    05:48:00 78376   TheProduct23    813    65   136    03:09:00     39078   Silversable x   977   269   321    04:23:00   17400   mikeloxlong    1043   387   471    08:34:00  Yeah, not that good but getting better.  That's it for now.  Lunch time (late lunch here in Chicago (3 PM)

      Well my friend is giving away cats.  He's actually got three and they're all for free.  Very playful and curious kittens.  I personally don't like cats (dog person) but these were just adorable.  There are four I think that are available.  I belive that two are already called for for there are two left.  There are three gray ones and a black cat.  The gray ones have blue eyes and the black one has black eyes I think.  The shyest one is the black cat.  He/she likes to hide from people.  All of the grey ones are pretty playful and relaxed kittens.  Here are a few pics.        So if you or anyone you know likes cats or wants a cat, feel free to email me and I will go ahead and give you some contact info.  P.s. these cats aren't for eating!

      I got this from my mother.  I sent her an email because I talked to Jenny and she doesn't want to go to the party this Saturday because she is uncomfortable because she thinks that everyone in IL hates her.  This is what my mom said.   she should not care less on what others think about her. it's all about bryce.. that she should open his world to the love of the other half of Bryce's being.  we are his family.. whether she likes it or not.. whether we like her or not.. whether she likes us or not.   Amen Mom, Amen!  I already know what Jenny's response would be.  It's gonna be along the lines of:   it's not my job to bring Bryce to IL, if they want to see Bryce then they can drive here to Iowa and see him   what a retard.  I was going to pick them up and bring them back to IA.  She's not doing anything.  If anything she's gettign her fucking ass fed and taken cared for while she is here.  I think this is why it will never work out.  I don't know why I missed her, I guess it was just a fluke.

      Well it was an uneventful weekend.  It was nice and relaxing actually.  Friday was cool.  Went to a little gathering at my coworker's house.  Had beers, burgers, brats and dogs.  Met some of the people that played Rainbow Six 3.  Biggergunz, Blade1000, BMW JAY, TheProduct23.  I already knew FourRunner and WarMoose77 (I work with them) so that was cool.  So after drinking and eating for a few hours and talking RS3 I headed home to open up a server.  Apparently I have a pretty good connection so I am the designated host for the games.  I guess my cable modem connection has a pretty good upload speed so I can host up to 16 people.  I benchmarked and performed a stress test on my connection by having 16 people and playing the Trainyard map.  Trainyard, being the largest of the maps available, always gave a lot of servers some problems.  It ran fine except when someone joined and had a shitty connection (like one star or something).  When people had crappy connections and wasn't on my friends list, I would boot them.  Oh well, they know it isn't personal.  Now when people are being jackasses, I won't be holding back to boot them even if they are friends of the friends on my friends list.  So back the Friday, after I had met everyone, I went back home and started a server.  Everyone was on.  I invited some other people who were on my friends list and were online and BAM!  We had a game in 3 minutes.  It was 8 on 8 and it was a lot of fun because our Clan (DDS or Doing it Doggy Style) went on a tear early on.  We rattled of 5 straight games and it was just a lot of fun.  I was able to bring my ELO up to 1100 which was the highest it has ever been.  I was averaging 2-3 kills and dying every other round (yeah some people would get lucky).  Over all it was a good night.  Too good considering I played till 5:30 in the AM and I was playing against people from the fucking UK.  It was pretty cool.  Saturday I woke up late and helped my parents with the house.  Saturday night I went to Alumni Club and had a few drinks and danced a little.  I made fun of people again.  It was hilarious.  Yes I know I am a jackass but whatever.  hot tip here.  If you don't want me making fun of you, go out there and have a good time.  don't be pretentious about your dancing.  I only pick on people who dance and think that they are good but in fact, they suck.  after the bar I got back home and played more XBOX Live.  I know I am a nerd.  It's awesome!    By the way, for the people that are close, there's a party for my parent's 25th wedding anniversary this Saturday, June 12th.  If you can make it email me.  It's from like 4 till 12 or something.  I guess that's it for now.

      Well, there has been a lack of posts here for a few reasons.  I've been pretty busy here at work and I've been playing a lot of Rainbow Six 3.  At work we're trying to get all the Macs onto the same network that the rest of the company is on so that they can access and use the same resources that were once only made available to Windows machines (network drives, netowrk printers, shared folders, back-up of their data etc).  Last week has been hectic around here as well as the start of this week.  I've also beel playing a lot more RS3.  Last night I played till about 12:30 AM.  Not bad really considering the night before I played till 3.  I had no idea it was 3 till dies 10 straight times without a kill.  I was playing against a bunch of XTC people on their server.  Monday really screwed my stats up.    Tuesday was a diferent story.  After going home to help clean the party for my parents, I ate dinner there and took the rest of the alchohol to my apartment.  I have almost a case of Corona and almost a case of Sam Adams in the fridge in my apartment.  I also have a half of the half gallon of Cuervo margarita mix with the Cuervo in it already sitting in the fridge.  Me thinks that some of that will be drank today.  I've also been playing a lot with  urlLink Porkchop55 .  She's a girl and she's not too bad.  She's got a great voice and a good sense of humor.  I don't really know what she looks like but it's fun to talk to her online.  She's half Filipino and half white, short and thin.  Usually, these mestisas are pretty hot.  Of course I don't trust everything people say online but it's a nice picture she painted thought.  She has a kid and wew talked about our respective kids.  That was pretty cool.  She has a 2 year old and so do I.  Eh, whatever, I'm just having one of my crushes like usual.  Seems like I have a new crush every damn week or every few days.  Well Again I have reached the greater than 1 kill ratio.  I finally had a round where I killed everyone on the other team all by myself.  YEAH!  12v12 and I got 6 kills.  I don't know if anyone here plays RS3 but we were playing the Map City Streets Large and I rushed the big box room killed two people there.  Camped for about 15 seconds waiting for more people to go through the box room.  One came in and I sniped him with my M16 right on the head.  After that I went back towards red team's base and came up around the bunker area and shot the sniper that was hanging out by the windows.  That was 4.  Went back downstairs and as soon as I turned the corner there was a member of the green team that was walking towards read team's underground access way and I just stalked him for a while and shot him in the head as well.  After killing the 5th guy, everyone on my team died so I decided to make a rush for their spawn.  CLimbed the ladder and no one was there so I went up to the upstairs spawn of green team and found a guy sniping in the window.  I shot him in the back of his head.  Six kills no deaths baby.  My weekly stats are  urlLink here .  Not bad eh?  I plan on improving upon that tonight when I get on and on Thursday when there's a supposed "live journal Rainbow Six 3 online gathering"  That should be fun.  In sports news, Cubbies have won two straight against Houston.  FUCK YEAH!  Handed Clemens his first loss of the season and then the Cubs had an amazing 9th to finish of Houston!  fuck yeah, Cubbies for Life baby.  The same time that was showing the defensive minded Distroit Pistons beat LA.  FUCK YEAH!  It would have been a sweep if it weren't for a breakdown in the final minutes of regulation in Game 2.  Oh well, they won it all.  Good for them.  Defense and good shooting propelled Detroit to their first championship since the Bad boys era.  I hope Detroit doesn't burn down.  Well that was about it.  Oh and Sam the answer to the logic problem was the German.

      I got this from a Blog buddy ( urlLink Kilikina ).   Below is a quiz written by Einstein last century. He said that 98% of the people in the world cannot solve the quiz. Are you among the other 2%?  Here you go.  Facts:  There are 5 houses in 5 different colours. In each house lives a person with a different nationality. These 5 owners drink a certain beverage, smoke a certain brand of cigar and keep a certain pet. No owners have the same pet, smoke the same brand of cigar or drink the same drink.  Hints:  The Brit lives in a red house. The Swede keeps dogs as pets. The Dane drinks tea. The green house is on the left of the white house. The green house owner drinks coffee. The person who smokes Pall Mall rears birds. The owner of the yellow house smokes Dunhill. The man living in the house right in the center drinks milk. The Norwegian lives in the first house. The man who smokes Blend lives next to the one who keeps cats. The man who keeps horses lives next to the man who smokes Dunhill. The owner who smokes Blue Master drinks beer. The German smokes Prince. The Norwegian lives next to the blue house. The man who smokes Blend has a neighbour who drinks water.  The question is … WHO KEEPS FISH?

      So I called Jenny to see if there was any chance that they could make it here this weekend.  Well, there was but it was going about it a very wrong way.  She said that she could go because she told her mom that I was putting them up at a hotel when they were here.  Well, I know here and she's a terrible liar.  I don't want that shit to blow up in my face and with her dumb ass, anything is possible.  Not to mention that I work 11 hour days now, she wanted me to leave for Iowa at 6 get there by 10, pick them up and drive back here to Chicago so that would mean that we got back to Chicago at 3 AM.  Do things Saturday and drive them back Sunday early morning.  What the fuck?  Next weekend is not going to work either because her friend is getting married.  The weekend after that, he parents are probably doing something and that's also one thing I fucking hate is that I have to go ask if her parents are doing something for me to do shit with my own kid.  Sure I am thankful that they are taking care of him but seriously, that's not their kid and Jenny isn't really a mother.  All I know is the 11th she better not be working and have Bryce ready so I can see him here for the WHOLE weekend.  I hate not having my son around.  I now remember why I broke up with her and why I don't really like her anymore.  I would give up everything if I could have my son.  Right now I could be a fucking janitor and live in a rundown one bedroom apartment for all I care as long as I can support myself and Bryce then it's going to be alright.  I don't even care if he is the only person that I see after a long day of scrubbing toilets or picking up trash.  I don't care if it's just the two of us going to the beach or the zoo or whatever.  I just want Jenny and her family out of the picture but it's turning out that I am slowly being taken out of the picture.  Oh and I bet that the child support that I am paying for Bryce is going towards Jenny's fucking townhouse that she is renting.  Isn't there some sort of legal action that I can take where I get the receipts on whatever the fuck she is spending the money that I work hard for on?  I mean that's fucking child support, i.e. FOR THE CHILD.  She has no job and her room mates are inbred fucking idiots who can't get/keep a job and have no education so how do you think the is able to pay for that crap?  Yeah, probably me.  So, is there something out there that makes it possible for me to take Bryce considering he's not even living with her and I'm paying her fucking child support?  Fuck Fuck Fuck.    I know I made the decision to have unprotected sex and playing my cards on making a baby.  There really isn't much I can do but to just tough it out.

      Yes yes, getting there.  Damn I just needed 8 kills last night to get to 400 kills for the week and it's only Wednesday!  Could've done it last night but eh, tired.   urlLink TEKFREEK  is getting better.  He's been managing to get a couple of kills every other round or so but he keeps on dying.  He's getting better that's for damn sure.  Played with a lot of Chicago people again.  It was fun.  I hate being the bad guy and booting people.  I should just start appearing offline and making a room for just friends to avoid the random people.  Played with  urlLink PORKCHOP55  again but she was kinda being wierd.  I don't know what is up with that but whatever.     Here are my  urlLink stats .  Doing alright, getting a better hang of the maps and I also wrote a little thing about maps that I've managed to do good in.  It's is located  urlLink here .  It's not eerything but it's something for other people to use.     So the Taste is starting this friday (6/21).  That should be a good time.  Going to try to go this weekend if it's not too hot.     Cubs won again, fuck yeah!  hopefully by tomorrow they're going to be in first or at least tied for first

      So, when was my last post?  June 17?  Damn that was a long time ago there.  nothing really much happening here.  I've been playing a lot of Rainbow Six.  Definitely making progress in getting better but not at the same level as these nerds out there.     So I finally got a pic of Porkchop55.  She's cute I like very much.  She's got a cute little kid too!     Okay, so the last time I posted was thursday last week.  Hmm, okay, well Friday, what did I do...Shit I already forgot.  I know I was probably nerding it up on XBOX Live.  Yeah, that's right i was.  I was playing all night Friday and finished off the rest of the margarita mix and tequila from my parents party.  I was definitely feeling good.  Woke up around 2 or something and watched my beloved Cubs rally in the 9th to win against the A's!!!  Fuck yeah, Michael Barret's 2 RBI single to right field scored Walker for the win.  they also won Sunday.     Going on the Cubs tangent here.  Look at their week.  Roger Clemens, Wade Miller, Roy Oswalt, Mark Mulder, Barry Zito.  That was a tough week right there.  On top of that they didn't even have Grudzie and Sosa in the same game till Saturday!!!  Yeah, things are just about to heat up for these Northsiders.  This series against the Cards shouldn't be an exact barometer on how they are doing since Grudzie and Sosa just jumped back in the line up.  With them back, the bench looks even stronger!  Walker, hollandsworth, Goodwin, Macias just to name a few are RESERVES!!!.  That's right, RESERVES!!!  Wow, when everyone on this team gets on the same page it's hard to imagine anyone stopping them.  hopefully they run the table against these Cards and building a lot of momentum going into the Cubs-Sox series this weekend.     Speaking of this weekend, it's the opening Friday of the Taste of Chicago.  So if anyone out there wants to meet up and go visit the Taste let's do it.  Taste runs from the 25th of June till the 4th of July.  There are some great deals at the Taste.  For example, for a nice Lamb Chop dinner it's $15 at the regular restaurant but at the taste, it can be had for $5.  Strips of tickets of eleven are sold at the Taste for 7 dollare I think but it's only $5.50 at Dominicks.  Let me know if you want me to pick some up before the weekend.     New news, my Boss just got XBOX Live and his gamertag is WickedLester67.  He's going retty good according to his  urlLink ">stats .     Sam, purpotedly will be getting XBOX Live soon as well.  I dont know his gamertag.  My damn friends list is getting filled and, not to toot my own horn here, I got a pretty good server and everyone wants to play on my server so sometimes I have to be the bad guy and boot people off to make room for my buddies online.     Well that's about it, I sucks yesterday, fucking hate it!  275 Kills, 256 deaths.  It needs to be like 300:200 or better damn it!     More killing later

      Okay so I downloaded and installed  urlLink Firefox  from Mozilla and I have mixed reviews about it.  First it's got this cool thing with the tabs so it's just one window open.  That's pretty cool.  I like how themes and shit can be installed and all that crap.  I'm sure it's secure and all that shit.  It's just a fucking hassle to switch broswers to do windows updates and then use IE to listen to launchcast internet radio.  What the fuck?  another issue that I got is that I can't use Firefox to control my virtual machines.  Maybe I gotta install the right plugin/extensions and what not.  I'm still using it for when I do my bullshit browsing but for work stuff I have to stick with IE for VMWare stuff, Oracle stuff and of course, Launchcast radio -IS- work.  yep it's a damn boring day at work today.  I hope that it stays like this for the rest of the day (it's 12:50 PM and I hope that the next 4.5 hours will fly by like it was nothing.  I need a nap.  Northbeach was lame last night.  I was the only one dancing, again.  I was too tired though.  Tonight I think I will most likely be staying in and playing more video games.  I'm just too tired to go anywhere.  Tomorrow is the supposed party at Jerry's cousin's apt.  I don't know if I want to go.  I am feeling a bit under the weather lately.  I think it's the lack of sleep and the long fucking days man.  I dunno.  2 weeks and I turn 24.  Wow I am getting old.  In two weeks, 30 is only going to be 6 years away.  I just want to leave work right now, buy a 12 pack, take a nap, eat dinner, fuck some people up by shooting them in the face in RS3.  Yeah...I'm a loser but whatever, I'm fucking tired.

       Acceptable public conduct  Maintaining cordial relations at all times is essential in this culture; making only positive comments is a good place to start. Negativity of any kind can cause loss of face, which has unfortunate consequences in this culture, including loss of reputation as well as the severing of friendships and other meaningful bonds.   Although there are many social inequalities, there is a belief that everyone must be treated with civility. Moreover, as people rise in importance, they are expected to behave with heightened modesty and graciousness, especially in their dealings with the poor. For example, beggars are politely refused with the phrase "Patawarin po," which means, "Forgive me, sir." Snubbing a beggar may result in loss of face.  Visiting businessmen should expect to shake hands firmly with other Filipino men, both upon introduction and subsequent meetings.  There is not supposed to be physical contact between men and women in public. Rather than initiating a handshake, men should wait for a Filipino woman to extend her hand.   Foreign businesswomen may initiate a handshake with Filipino men or women.  Close female friends in the Philippines greet each other with a hug and kiss. Similarly, close male friends may exhibit close physical contact, such as holding hands or walking arm in arm around a friend's shoulder.  Filipinos often greet each other by making eye contact, then raising and lowering their eyebrows.  When someone raises his or her eyebrows at you, it is often a way of indicating that you have been understood.  Raising one's voice is unacceptable in Filipino business culture. Moreover, it's important to maintain a low, yet controlled tone of voice at all times. Striving to speak this way can help you conduct business with greater effectiveness and may even allow you to project more of an authoritative, confident image.  Don't assume that a smile is an indication of amusement or approval. Frequently, smiling is used to mask embarrassment, nervousness, and other feelings of distress. This is why you will sometimes observe Filipinos smiling or laughing during inappropriately somber or tense moments.  Avoid staring at Filipinos, who can easily interpret a stare as a hostile gesture. If you are stared at, it will be in your best interest to look away.  It's recommended that you break eye contact several times in the course of a conversation. When you look at a Filipino too intently, it is often interpreted as gawking rather than a sign of attentiveness.  When it is necessary to walk between two people, lower your head with your hands clasped in front of you as you pass them. This gesture confers respect.  Because of the years of U.S. military presence in the Philippines, most North American gestures are recognized and understood.  Pointing a middle finger at a person or thing is considered the most obscene gesture in the Philippines.  Since pointing can easily be perceived as an insulting gesture, Filipinos rarely indicate objects or directions by pointing with their fingers. Instead, they indicate with a glance or by pursing their lips.  To beckon someone, hold your hand out, palm downward, and make a scooping motion with the fingers. Beckoning someone with the palm up and wagging on finger can be interpreted as an insult.   You may observe people hissing in restaurants; this is a common way of beckoning servers.  Indicating two with the fingers is done by holding up the ring and little finger, instead of the forefinger and middle finger. The thumb is not used to count numbers in the Philippines.  Don't put your hands on your hips when talking. This gesture can be misinterpreted as challenge to another person, which can be especially dangerous considering the violence-prone nature of this culture.   A Filipino may try to get your attention by brushing a finger against your elbow.      Food Culture  If you leave a clean plate, it will be assumed that you haven't been provided enough to eat.  Dessert is especially popular in the Philippines at both lunch and dinner.  To beckon, use your entire hand, with the palm facing down. In any case, do not use your index finger and move it toward you.  Consider it a tremendous honour to be invited to Filipino weddings, anniversaries, baptisms, and other intimate family events. Being included in these occasions is an important part of solidifying the personal aspect of a business relationship.  If you are hosting a gathering, it is not enough to invite someone only once to a dinner or a party, since an invitee will usually say yes regardless of his or her true feelings. It will be necessary to reconfirm the invitation a couple of days in advance. Moreover, an invitee will often decline through a third party as a face-saving measure.  When you interrupt a Filipino during a meal, he or she will feel obliged to invite you to join in. This offer is made only for the sake of politeness; just thank the person and decline, insisting that you have already eaten.  Consider it a tremendous honour if you are invited to a Filipino home. This kind of invitation shows that the host has developed a genuine rapport with you, which is crusial to business success here.  Arrive 15 to 20 minutes after the time given in the invitation. You will be perceived as overanxious if you arrive early or on time, and perhaps even inconsiderate if you cause your hosts to feel rushed.  Never refer to your host's wife as the hostess. In the Philippines, hostess is another word for prostitute.  Social events tend to revolve around food, since Filipinos are extremely proud of their cuisine, which blends South Asian, Chinese, and Spanish influences.  "Have you eaten?" is a popular greeting, equivalent to "How are you?" in North America. Simply answer "Yes" even if you haven't actually eaten.  For both business meetings and social occasions, seating arrangements are based on the hierarchy. Consequently, it's recommended that you wait to be seated.  At any social event where food is being served, allow the host to ask you several times to sit down. In this culture, appearing overly eager to begin eating is perceived as a sign of greed and vulgarity.  Before eating, wait for the host to initiate these proceedings.  A fork and spook are the standard utensils. Keep the fork in your left hand and use it for placing food onto the spoon, which should be held in your right hand.   The source for all this info was ExecutivePlanet.com.  Some are so true and others are really true and other are just retarded.  I like it.

      Damn, so last night I went out instead of playing video games and just absolutely fell in love with this one girl who was out dancing.  Wow, she was super cute, long blonde wavy hair, she was wearing those nice tight low waist "dirty jeans" with a white belt and white shoes.  She had a sleeveless top on but it was more of a tight fitting t-shirt.  She was wearing a khaki form fitting jacket and a teal and white trucker hat.  She had a rock solid body and one of the cutest warmest faces and smiles I have ever seen.  She was a god send.  Besides being that attractive, yes I have quirky high standards, she was an amazing dancer.  He friend was also good and wasn't bad looking.  Her friend had long black hair, wearing similar jeans and white indoor soccer shoes, white belt and a black sleeveless formfitting top.  They were probably the best girl dancers there.  Sure there are those stripper dancer girls that were there too but they just do one thing.  These two had skill and they polish it on a regular basis.  Tight moves and they hit the beat like a pro.  I was admiring their footwork since it was excellent.  I need to improve my foot work.  It's not bad but it's not as good as these girls.  Yes, a new crush.  I wish I didn't have to work so damn early everyday and stay so late.  I would have gotten their names at least.  SHIT, I was on stage with those two girls busting moves, shaking off the rust for a good 20-30 mins.  I am so sore today from trying to keep up with those girls.  No other guy wanted a peice of that action up there.  It was just me and the girls for a while there.  FUCK FUCK FUCK.  why didn't I even get their damn names at least?  I'm retarded.  I did get a number though.  Filipina girl named Joy.  She's from the south side of Chicago and from Cebu.  I don't know if I will call her.  She's not completely my type.  Sure she was short and asian but that was about it.  Cute to an extent eh, I am being to critical.  I will probably call her to invite her to the bar for my party and to bring a bunch of her friends.  Yes, after not going out and not dancing for a good month now, I am fucking sore.  Oh and I left my damn XBOX on all last night.  I didn't realize I just fucking passed out and woke up this morning to a few fucking invites.  I just turned that shit off and ate my breakfast and went to work.  Not really hungover, just tired and sore.    Anyways, have a good day.  It's probably going to be a boring day.  I still need to buy the big game here.  I gotta pick out numbers and shit

      So I finally got confirmation for that free party at North Beach in Downers Grove for the 17th of July.  I did this thing last year and it was pretty fun.  This year though I think there will be a bigger turn out than last year.  Don't get me wrong, I had a few people there last year, somewhere around 30 people but I played volleyball and got all sweaty and shit; fun and all but not conducive to picking up the girls (well unless they play with you too I suppose).  Anyways, it's the same deal as last year, 9-11 free cover and 10-11 free drinks as long as you say  GONZO  at the door.  So for anyone who's going to be in town that weekend or want to come up that weekend, it's all good.  I got a big living room and I'm sure it's not going to be a problem for people to passout there and leave the next day.  The night would probably start out at my apartment, meet there for those who are in the area.  Nerd it up by playing a little HALO or Rainbow Six 3 online while polishing off a case before heading out.  Get to North Beach around 9:30 or so to avoid the rush and shit.  Probably stay there till close and then head over to an after hours bar or whatever.  If anything, just head back to the apartment and party it up there.  Sounds like a plan to me.

      "and I just can't hide it...."  FUCK FUCK FUCK  okay, just to demostrate how retarded I still am....I got to Ulta right (yes I go to fucking Ulta to go get mens products and if you think that's gay fuck off) and try to go buy a new bottle of cologne since I'm getting sick and tired of CK.  I was browsing around and finally narrowed it down to 3 brands.  Polo Blue, Aqua di Gio, and Dolce and Gabana.  All of these smell good and all and all of them are pretty much in the same price range so it really didn't matter which I bought.  I finally decided on some Blue since I haven't bought a bottle of that for a while now.  I pick out the box and pay for it.  So I unwrap it and stash it in my car so I can put it on on my way to work Tuesday.  So today on my way to work, I pull out the bottle, untwist the cap and realize that there's no damn spritszer there.  Thinking it was one of those bottle with out a spritszer, I tilt the bottle to get a little bit of cologne and nothing!!!  So I look underneath and BAM!  There it was, it says AFTER SHAVE GEL!!!!  Well laddy freakin' da!  I don't even shave enough to fucking use this shit!  Don't get me wrong, I still used some to smell all nice and stuff but fuck man.  How often do I shave, probably like once every 5 days or something ridiculous like that.  Yes, I have not hair on my damn body.  The last girlfriend I had said that I was as soft and smoothe as a baby's ass.  I can still use the damn thing but whatever, I should have checked the fucking box first!  Spiderman 2 opens tomorrow.  I think that will be a Thursday night showing.  I don't think I am ready to fight with nerds of all sorts tomorrow just yet.  Oh yeah, in a Rainbow Six 3 related post, I finally caught up my  urlLink kills vs deaths  in that damn game!  finally I can sleep faster after playing it.  I just play to play now.  I accomplished my goal and will savor it for the time being.  I already accomplished my goal after that and that was 100 kills vs. deaths.  Currently, I am 120 kills over.  That was pretty easy.  Now it's going to be 500 over and then 1000 over.  Ultimately I want to reach 1000 kills over deaths before Black Arrow comes out.  Im back at work now...another 4 days till the big weekend eh?

      I need help here.  I am tired of not being able to see my son and not being able to take him to see my family by himself/myself. I am sick and tired of this baby momma drama. I fucking hate it.  Is there a law out there that states a mandatory time spent with the child's father?  I don't like being limited on not being able to see my own blood because of some stupid reasons (ie. the latest one being she had a birthday party to go to so she can't make it out to chicago {they live in Iowa}. that means that I can't take my son by myself). What the fuck do I do? Are there Federal Laws stating that I should have mandatory time with him?  Any ideas?  I really don't know if this is the proper channel for this sort of stuff but I won't know till I ask right?

      *sigh*  Well it was a nice long relaxing weekend.  Went out with friends and family and had a good time.  I could've done with out the storms though.  Friday was just a freakin' geek fest.  Played Rainbow till fucking dawn.  It was a good ole time.  Bought a 12 pack, stayed home and nerded it up.  What's that?...I'm a geek?  Well hell yeah I am and I'm damn proud of it.  Saturday was a planned day at the Taste but that didn't really happen considering it was fucking raining for most of the day.  It sucked.  By the time I was able to go out we just went to Ribfest in Naperville.  That was a good time too except we got there a little too late.  Ribs were good except for one where it smelled so damn good but in the end, the ribs weren't that juicy.  It was also damn expensive!!!  Fucking $4 for 2 ribs!!!  $4 dollars?!?!?  I got robbed!  Anyways, there was one booth where they said it had the hottest barbeque sauce around so I took a fork and dripped some sauce to try it and DAMN! it was hot!  I mean it wasn't hot at first but about 5-7 seconds later it started to get hot and then hotter and it was just freakin hot.  I'm not a puss either, I can eat hot stuff like it was nothing but this was hot.  It had the flavor and everything.  Smokey, think bodied and sweet all at the same time and then in the tail end it was just like a brush fire that turned into a freakin forest fire.  Soo good!  so after bumming around ribfest for an hour it closed down.  We then went to Bar Louie for a beer or two.  Had a beer there and left.  I was a little tired from all the freaking walking.  That just sucked and I think that it took a lot out of the people I went with.  I just went home (it was about 12:30 by then) and hopped online for a couple.  Sunday I woke up late.  I didn't realize that I was that tired but I guess I was.  Made some lunch, watched the Cubs sweep the Sox in the cross town classic.  Hell yeah, Sox walked in the winning run.  Fuck yeah baby!  Bragging rights till next summer.  Derek called and he and Carmie invited me to go watch some fireworks in St. Charles.  So I did.  I had to get out of the house again.  It was sorta raining early but it didn't so it was good.  After that we went to St. Charlie's for some $2.50 Coronas.  Had a few there checking out the St. Charles hotties.  DAMN!  I don't know what is up either but the fucking girls of St. Charles were looking so fine Derek was having problems not checking them out in front of his GF.  I also don't know what the ell it is about pink this season but every damn girl is wearing pink.  most of them wear that white belt too.  Now I don't know if that's just because of the two girls that I was dancing with last week or what not but shit, the white belt with the low rise jeans and a pink top is just HOTT!  Carmie got wasted.  I guess not eating and having two bloody mary's in a hour will do that to you.  Derek talked about offering a room in their house for rent.  That's cool, I might just take them up on it sometime next year if I need to move out.  After that what else?  Some Rainbow was in order.  Played that for a few, took a break to eat and hopped online again.  I was playing with a bunch of fucking kids late at night though.  That was some BS.  Whatver, I was mopping the floor with them.  It was all good.  Monday woke up around 12.  Saw Matt Clement pitch an incredible game but he gave up that one homer and lost.  That was fucking BS.  He's becoming the Kerry Wood of last year where he is not getting the run support.  I mean, the other team isn't even scoring that many runs.  His record is 7-7 but if the Cubs scored at least 4-5 runs in 5 of the games that he lost his record would have been 12-4.  Oh well, I guess that's how it goes.  He's still a good pitcher and I'm glad Hendry didn't trade him.  Ben sheets also pitched a great game (for Milwaukee) gotta give that guy some credit.  While doing that I was doing my laundry at my parents house.  I gotta pick the rest of that stuff up today so that I have some clothes tomorrow.  So I am finally 350 kills over deaths.  I just can't seem to get to 1000 over fast enough!  I mean I kill 3,4,5 people and in looking for the last few guys I always end up getting shot.  I got my damn rush down to a science but I just gotta play smarter.  Take last night for example.  Map was warehouse 6v6.  I rushed the catwalk and shot three guys right off the bat.  One was in the lower small box room behind one of the boxes, and two were still throwing grenades into the big box room.  I got throw two with two shots.  After wards, I was informed by someone on my team that there were two headed to own spawn from the stairs behind red team's spawn.  I started to head towards their spawn and they just peeked by the door, shot two of them down.  5 kills in under a minute.  The only person left was Boyd ( urlLink EAT ME SUCKA ).  (if you clicked on the link, he is pretty good so that is why I was getting scared)  He took out two before he took me out.  I was about to turn the corner to go down the stairs but as soon as I turned, I saw gun fine and next thing I knew I was dead.  I really need to start playing smart every round.  I just can't keep dying like this.  I don't know if I will reach 1000 kills over deaths before Black Arrow comes out but I will surely give it my best.  This Friday I hope to be going to Iowa to pick up Bryce for the weekend.  this weekend is the company picnic.  It's going to be held at Cougar Staduim (of the  urlLink Kane County Cougars ).  that should be a good time.  Free food, sun and baseball.  I hope that  urlLink Bryce  will be there.  He can hang out with my family for once in a long time.  I guess that is what I have for now and what I am looking forward to for the weekend.  Even though it's a lot of driving, it's well worth it.  Hope everyone had a good 4th and have a great week as well.  Remember if you are in the General Chicago West burbs area or will be the weekend of the 17th.  I have a free party at North Beach.  Say GONZO at the door and it's free to get in from 9-11 and free drinks from 10-11.  Should be a good time.

      Signs of impending doom people.  What the fuck?  All that shit in the Bible is starting to take shape or some shit?  Though I don't literally believe in the leteral translation of the Holy Book, I just think it's a little eerie to have  urlLink this  sort of stuff start happening already.  666 and all that shit.  Yikes!     urlLink This  is already in use in this country.  sure they're trying it with Animals but soon enough, it'll be small enough and self propagating (like replicators in Stargate SG-1) they're going to be making themselves and keeping trak of everyone.  They'll know when you take a shit or pick a fucking booger out of your left nostril, or...well we won't go into that "adult oriented stuff"  Pretty soon they can count how many beers you had in a year and be able to market you shit...wow, I am just rambling now.  anyways, back to work.

      Well today was a little slow.  I've just been made a project lead to add the lab computers into the domain as well as making sure that the MAC machines are in the domain a well.  It's been a little hectic here at work.  Especially today.  Since there were a few things that didn't go as planned I had to do some juggling here and there.  I don't think that it will be any different tomorrow.  Regarding the LAB computer shit, I had a problem with the SHELL32.dll not having some crap as I was installing some Windows Updates.  It just craps out on me when I try to do it.  I mean this is Microsoft shit that I am dealing with.  Granted it's Windows NT, it might be a little tougher considering they stopped supporting the damn thing.  So while I was doing that the user who works on that damn workstation needed the box back so I had to stop what I was doing and work on something else since that machine will be doing some testing till about 4 tomorrow afternoon.  Whatever, I can deal with that crap tomorrow and the next week I guess.  Now with our graphics department I ran into a few snags as well.  First of, the eMac I was working on had a lost password.  It was set to auto-login and the person who set that shit is not with the company anymore.  I had to go make a new user, install some shit, show the current user how to login and move files and all that jazz.  Next, I was going to upgrade OS 9.2.2 to Pather.  That fell through since I had to research a few things regarding disk copy (so that I can make a bootable clone of a MAC machine.  See that's not a problem with Windows machines because of products like Norton Ghost and shit but for Mac I feel like I'm back in freshman year at MSU not knowing a damn thing about anything.  I hate that feeling but it's also that challenge that I can't walk away from.  I suppose I better do it considering I get paid to do this sort of shit (read="thinking").  Hmm, Vicki just called.  She wanted to go to the Cubs game.  No tickets though, she was just going to go there with her boyfriend and walk around and buy scalped tix.  I'm not about to do that.  I got a long day ahead of me tomorrow and I will probably get freakin wasted if I went.  Not to mention driving back that same night all half drunk and shit.  I got tomorrow and Saturday for that.  Speaking of which, party this weekend.  Chicago Suburbs, North Beach, Downer's Grove.  Say you are there for Gonzo's party and you get in for free from 9-11 and you get a wristband and a cup for free drinks from 10-11.  Should be a good time.  Tomorrow is Fragging Friday.  he whatever, it helps me save money and I don't have to drive drunk and all that shit.  I just want to go home.  Till tomorrow.  Holla Holla

       (I stole this one)   Everybody I know who has a dog usually calls him "Rover" or "Spot". I call mine Sex. Now, Sex has been very embarrassing to me. When I went to the City Hall to renew the dog's license, I told the clerk that I would like a license for Sex. He said, "I would like to have one too!" Then I said, "But she is a dog!" He said he didn't care what she looked like. I said, "You don't understand. ... I have had Sex since I was nine years old." He replied, "You must have been quite a strong boy." When I decided to get married, I told the minister that I would like to have Sex at the wedding. He told me to wait until after the wedding was over. I said, "But Sex has played a big part in my life and my whole world revolves around Sex." He said he didn't want to hear about my personal life and would not marry us in his church. I told him everyone would enjoy having Sex at the wedding. The next day we were married at the Justice of the Peace. My family is barred from the church from then on.  When my wife and I went on our honeymoon, I took the dog with me. When we checked into the motel, I told the clerk that I wanted a room for me and my wife and a special room for Sex. He said that every room in the motel is a place for sex. I said, "You don't understand. ... Sex keeps me awake at night." The clerk said, "Me too!"  One day I entered Sex in a contest. But before the competition began, the dog ran away. Another contestant asked me why I was just looking around. I told him that I was going to have Sex in the contest. He said that I should have sold my own tickets. "You don't understand," I said, "I hoped to have Sex on TV." He called me a show off.  When my wife and I separated, we went to court to fight for custody of the dog. I said, "Your Honor, I had Sex before I was married but Sex left me after I was married." The Judge said, "Me too!"  Last night Sex ran off again. I spent hours looking all over for her. A cop came over and asked me what I was doing in the alley at 4 o'clock in the morning. I said, "I'm looking for Sex." -- My case comes up next Thursday.  Well now I've been thrown in jail, been divorced and had more damn troubles with that dog than I ever foresaw. Why just the other day when I went for my first session with the psychiatrist, she asked me, "What seems to be the trouble?" I replied, "Sex has been my best friend all my life but now it has left me for ever. I couldn't live any longer so lonely." and the doctor said, "Look mister, you should understand that sex isn't a man's best friend so get yourself a dog."

      I hate the Lakers.  I admit they are good and I hate them for their dominance but at the same time I have a fondness for them that I cannot deny.  I like winners.  Winners make it work no matter what.  The Lakers used to be winners but now they are reduced to almost nothing.  With that being said, I couldn't help but rejoice and lament, at the same time, in the fact that Shaq is leaving the once mighty Lakers and will be heading to the Eastern Conference with the Miami Heat.  Kobe, on the other hand will either be staying with the Lakers or just bolt to the other LA team, the Clippers.  How fucked up would that be.  Sure I know that no one here really pays attention to basketball but whatever.  The Lakers stars bolted and rivals rejoicing.   urlLink Here's  a really good story.  I won't really make much sense unless you know who Magic Johnson, Kareen Abdul-Jabar, Bill Russel, Wilt Chamberlin, Dwayne Wade etc.  I'll just figure that you know who Michael Jordan is.  I suppose that is that for some really juicy NBA stories for now.

      What a weekend.  Friday and Saturday was just nerdery.  Fun times indeed.  I can't recall any highlights or whatnot but was still a fun.  Oh I do recall one, Saturday I was able to get  urlLink 5000  Kills and 500 over my deaths.  Yep, what else but Rainbow Six 3 baby.  I played videogames over the weekend yes, it prevents me from spending way too much at the bar and then risking driving drunk as well.  I just buy my booze and then nerd it up.  Yeayuh!  Oh and I was setup with a date with Emily,  urlLink t=0&ld=1&gtype=3&tp=1&gtag=driftkillz">DriftKillz  girlfriend's friend.  More on that later.  Sunday was a different story though.  I mean what a busy ass day.  See Sunday was the company picnic and Bryce and Jenny were supposed to be there with me to hangout.  Well, the fickle little -BITCH- decided that she wanted to spend that weekend, that was planned a month and a half ago, with her "new" best friend.  whatever, let's not get into that shit.  Anyways, I invited Vicki Thursday after finding out that Jenny wasn't going to make it but she said no too because she had a final this Tuesday (today I guess) and she wanted to study.  Anyways to make it short, I got a call around 10:45 AM - 11:00 AM from Vicki and she was wondering if I was still going to the company picnic.  Well it's a good thing that she did because I was about to sleep till fucking 2 and that's when the game started.  So I just took a shower, bought a shirt on my way to her house because I realized I was wearing a ratty ass shirt and didn't want to look like a bum next to Vicki at the ballgame as well as for my blind date later that evening.  Damn Vicki was looking good.  Short shorts and a nice little baby blue top that was perfect for getting some sun.  Hmm, yeah, she was looking fine.  She just got a cat and that damn cat was like a dog.  I would bring back his toy wagging his tail a freakin' dog.  Left her place and started to drive out to Geneva for the picnic and the ball game.  Good times indeed.  Ate some burgers and a salad and waited for the end of the first inning for some brew.  Surprisingly, one of the head honchos already got beer before the game even started.  Everyone quickly followed suit.  It was hot as hell so the beer was going down smooth and good.  I was sweating my fucking ass off.  So were were just chilling eating and drinking some beer and two people, who will remain unnamed, checked Vicki out like it was going out of style right in front of her.  It was crazy, the boobs got more eye contact her her eyes hehe.  Who can blame them?  I surely can't.  I am guilty of peeking a look here and there.  I couldn't, wouldn't, won't, can't help it.  Oh and there was also this fucking hot tub that was full of old wrinkly people, ugh!  After the game we went over to a co-worker's house and had a little get together.  It was fun.  Goof troop as Vicki put it.  Millet Lite and Bud Lite were at hand as well as some burgers and brats.  Threw baseball around with Vicki as well as the Frisbee (that was actually a plate).  Wrestling was fun as well.  Hehe, even if I lost I still won "per se"  Let's see, who was there, Dave, Tom, John, Suzette, Natalie, Jim, Derek and a couple who I don't know.  Good times.  Here's the only pic my phone took at Dave's house.

      Well it's friday.  I guess that's good except I gotta be at work Sunday morning at 7.  It might not be cool considering I might have to be there till fucking 7 or something.  ESPN NFL2K5 = $20  Going to buy it during lunch.  Holla Holla.  I really don't care if Madden is going to be out in 3 weeks, shit, two games for $70 it's all good!  Black Arrow is out in two weeks and I heard that it's only going to be $40.  Going to pre-order that shit today too at Game Crazy.  Got the bonus for the quarter so I got some loot to throw around.  Gotta renew my XBOX Live subscription.  Not sure what my gamertag will be.  I kinda want a new one but at the same time to keep it simple, I'll just renew the damn thing, fuck it.  I just can't wait for HALO 2.  Might even pre order another one and sell it or some shit.  Nothing planned for the weekend.  Might go hit up a bar tonight since I really can't do shit tomorrow.  Dinner sounds good as hell already.  Going to make some hotdogs and fries...or just make some prok chips.  Had some hot wings last night, good stuff.  I really don't have much to update on today, just really busy at work.

      Holy shit!!!  It's already Thursday.  Well this week I will have worked a total of three days.  Tuesday, Thursday and Friday.  although I have work this Sunday, I count that as next week's work day even though it counts during this pay period.  Whatever.  It's all good to me.  I guess after Sunday's work day where I will be running around the building getting all of the thin client and fat clients to be 100/Full I get Monday off.  I will probably need that.  Some days I am sick of this 4 day work week thing that we have going here but most days it's working out just fine.  It's that god forsaken game Rainbow Six 3.  We won't talk about that.  I've been recently mulling about what to get first as a big purchase.  A big TV or a sweet little desktop computer.  Granted I use both religiously, I don't know which I will enojy better.  I have a littl 19" in my room that I play XBOX on and I have a peice of shit laptop that keyboard works in sporadic times.  I know that I will be playing XBOX a lot more than the computer and computer games because of Halo 2 and XBOX Live.  Then again, Half Life 2 and Doom 3 are coming out this year, that's a coupel of highly touted games right there.  I've also been wanting to play counter strike against all these supposed gamer girls but my laptop probably won't run it.  TV or Computer.  I originally wanted a laptop but for a sweet gaming laptop, it's going to cost me $3000 at the very bottom of the scale.  For that much, I might as well go buy a 52" DLP HDTV with a HD receiver.  I will probably enojoy it that much more.  I don't want to buy a TV because where the hell am I going to put the damn thing?  I don't own my own place yet so it'll be a hassle to have it in my tiny ass room.  Besides that I have to save some moeny for my trip out to the Philippines in December.  That's going to cost me a little bit and on top of that I gotta take my cusins shopping and all that crap.  Yeah...  Halo 2 on a big TV or Half Life 2 on a good computer or going on a trip to see blood cousins?

      I guess I am in some sort of fucking video clip craze today but  urlLink holy shit !!!  I want one.  what about a new twist on the damn thing.  Let's say there's 4 people on a table.  by each player's area on the table there's a little hole where the ball would drop.  The object would be to drop it to their cup per say and it would eliminate them, then it would be 3 people playing against each other.  Imagine taking on 3 people who all teamed up against you and they are all trying to get the ball in your cup and you are able to deflect it to go to another player's cup.  Yeah.  Dude, leave it to me to make it an interesting game.  MAKE IT A DRINKING GAME!  It would have to be a bigger cup and more metal balls on that table.  I dunno, I guess I am just bored.  Anyways, off to setup another wireless home network I go.  Peace out!

      Okay now that I am 24 I feel older and wiser than I did last year.    So let's see, where do I start here.  Friday was a geek fest, again.  Watched Stargate SG1 and Stargate Atlantis and Played Rainbow Six 3.  Lots of Holla holla there.  Stargate is such a good show I don't know why not a lot of people watch that thing.  I guess I'm just such a big scifi geek I can't get enough of it.  I'll even watch episodes that I've seen numerous times.  From the Gould, Sagard, Replicators, Nocks to the new formidable foe in Atlantis called the Wraith, yeah, it's going to be a good season.    Saturday spent the day with the family.  Got drunk with them.  I went home and showered and changed and waited for Vicki and Carol to show up.  Wow, this is the first time I met Carol and she's a damn fine red head.  Vicki was also looking good but I don't think she looks bad ever (at least I haven't seen her look bad).  We went to the party at Da Beach and waited for everyone.  It was a good time.  Let's see, people who were there were Me, Vicki, Carol, Inbred, Drift with Bobbi and Emily, Mark and Patti, Blade, Tom, vito, Helen and friend, Phil with more than a few friends, room mates and friends.  It was a good time.  It was packed when the free shit was going on but it thinned out right after the free shit stopped.  We then went to Phil's house for a little after party and Derek came out to meet us out there.  After that we just went home.  Good birthday but I really felt older than I ever have.    Sunday was a boring day.  I just hung out at my parents house and just bummed out.  That night though Emily was supposed to call me so we can go out but she didn't so I called Derek and he didn't have work monday so we went and saw I,Robot.  Good movie, not very deep but visually spectacular.  We went back to his place and played a lot of Rainbow six 3.  I got used to the Big TV and I sucked when I got home.    Monday was grocery shopping day for me as well as the room mates.  Shit, everyone bought food and the fridge is packed to the hilt of crap.  Just bummed around all day after that, payed some bills and played.    It was a boring but not really boring weekend.  This weekend I think Emily will be coming down going out to see a movie and maybe even dinner.  Not quite sure yet.  can't go out too late Saturday since I got work on Sunday and that's going to be a long day. probably a 10 hour day Sunday.  Eh, that's a short version of the weekend.  Too much shit to do at work to type more.     have a good one everyone.

      well it,s Friday and there's really nothing much on the weekend front.  Going over to Dennis' house, please some football and RS3.  Drink beer and eat pizza.  Going to go visit Bryce tomorrow, Figure I'll leave sometime in the morning and just head straight to Waterloo.  Not even going to tell stoopid bitch because I really don't want to see her.  I just want to see Bryce.  I'll probably go back the same day since Sam is going to some retarded cult camp.  Fuck that shit.  That's all I got planned for this weekend.  Next weekend though is bachelor party weekend.  Yay.  Too bad it's Black Arrow Weekend as well.  Oh well, I guess I would rather hang out with my MI buddies than play video games all weekend.  Although I will probably play mad football at Ted's house when I get there Friday night.  I don't think we can make it to Lansing in time.  So anyone out there willing to go to a wedding on the 21st of August and 4th of September with me?  Friday Frag Fest is upon us.  too bad I was a little late therefore I will e stuck here at work till about 6-6:15PM  Damnit.  It also sucks that I will have to get reprimanded because I had to take care of my fucking leaking room.  Ready to go at 6:30 and it's raining, ceiling starts to leak, had to go get pots and pans and was able to leave at 7.  But hey, still going to get written up for that shit.  Whatever.

      Well it's Tuesday again.  Wow what a lazy day yesterday.  I had to work Sunday, that really blew but it was some good food at my parents house though.  My mother had a few friends from Vietnam for her business and this one chick from Turkey.  It was a fun time.  I was pretty much stuffed after getting there from work.  I had to go get my wasabi and kikkoman from my apartment for the sushi so while I was there I just picked up my XBOX and played at my parents.  I hate playing on my little black and white tv (9") it really makes it hard to pick out people from the background especially on maps where the light is bright.  Went home and dicked around online for a few more hours.  Monday was a lot more lax.  I didn't really do anything.  I was about to do the dished in my apartment but I realized I've beed doing the fucking dishes every Monday for the last mont or so.  I said fuck that.  I don't leave any dirty dishes on the sink because I wash that shit right after using it.  It's about time someone else did that shit.  It was football and rainbow six all day yesterday.  I got my ass whooped in football.  It's a little different that Madden which was what I was used to but eh, I will get better that's for damn sure.  For $20, ESPN is one good looking fucking game!  The stats are so deep, for $20 it's definitely amust have.  Now it would have been a ddferent story if it was $50 or $40 but for $20?!?!?  I think that even non-football fans should buy the damn game.  I guess it's only $15.99 at Target in Iowa but still, $20? for a game that looks this good and the replay value is amazing?  I don't even think I will get Madden 2005.  Black Arrow comes out August 4th and Madded comes out three weeks after that and then it's fucking HALO 2 time.  Just really looking forward to Black Arrow.  It's just too bad I got a bachelor's party to go to that weekend.  DOH!!!!  Every motherfucker will have a headstart on the maps and find the rushed and the fucking camping spots.  Oh well.  I'll catch up sooner or later anyways.  Wow,  urlLink here's  a list of games coming out

      Why?  For a person who thinks the world regarding promises, I was really shocked when you told me that you didn't even remember that you promised me that.  I was disappointed then and I'm even more disappointed now.  You gave me your word.  You seem a little less clear and a lot blurier to me now.  Plans that I have made based on what I knew about you just don't seem possible now.  I thought I could trust you.  Maybe I still can., who knows?  Right know though I think I will keep my distance for a while.  I have said everything that I needed to say Saturday morning before leaving.  There really wasn't anything that you could have said to make me feel better nor defend your actions.  That is fucked up.  I don't like that shit.  It's one thing to drink but to get sober using another drug?  That's the most pathetic excuse I have ever fucking heard.  I don't mean to be selfish or be thinking about myself here but who the fuck am I to you?  Who the hell do you think you are?  Did I really mean that much that you would actually forget something that meant a lot to me?  That you could just fucking forget it?  Sure I break promises but I know what I promised and I burn it in my damn brain.  At least I make an effort to make it work.  What's going to happen to our plans now?  I don't like the idea of something that we were supposed to share and having people over like that.  I don't want to get mixed up in shit like that.  It sucks that this happened.  I don't want to distance myself from you but if I have to then I must.  Don't worry all other arrangements from before are still there.  We're still this, we're still that, just not as much I suppose.  I still love you but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.

      Okay, so I was playing around trying to get 1000 kills over and I got it when my buddy online sent me this crap.   urlLink http://zed.cbc.ca/go.ZeD?user_id=31109&page=content   On the lower right hand corner, click on each of the titles and then click on watch and laugh  S. Mofos R63 SM 2T Bathroom Bit Explosive $#!T Retarded RainbowSix3  These are hilarious!!!  I was fucking rolling after watching this crap.  If you don't play video games it won't mean anything to you.  If you play Rainbow they will even make more sense.  BLACK ARROW TODAY!!!  (hopefully!!!)

      alright so this is what happened this weekend.  I guess I should have called the bitch to see if Bryce was going to be in town.  As I feared, he wasn't.  His grandparents took him to see his great grand parents all the way out in Colorado.  My fault there.  I should have called.  I did call but no one was answering the phone at their house so I had to break down and call Jenny to see if he was around.  So it turns out that he wasn't, I still tried to make the most of the weekend.  I borrowed this little thing from work called a projector.  It was awesome.  HALO was just unbelievable.  Resolution was maxed out at 1024x768 for the computer but XBOX looked damn good!  Lets see, I brought with me the following games:  Rainbow Six 3 HALO ESPN NFL 2K5 Need For Speed: Underground Soul Caliber 2  They all looked awesome.  It's like having a 8 foot TV screen.  Sharp as a TV and the only thing lacking was surround sound.  I saw everything I needed to see in Rainbow Six.  I was able to get through the first two missions but got stuck in the third.  Halo was amazing multiplayer.  You could really see where people would be.  Football was also awesome.  I could see wide open receivers.  I also tested out the 1st person perspective and damn, it's hard being a quarterback.  Especially if you're short.  Soul caliber was just an amazing experieince.  Need for speed on bumper view was awesome!!!  So I think, instead of a big TV I will just hook myself up with a damn projector.  Portable and just as clear as a regular TV.  I can go get some HD lens for it to really make it sharp as can be but that can wait.  Besides being able to play XBOX on it, I can also hook it up tomy computer and play Counter Strike, Half Life 2 and Doom 3 when I finally get a decent box that'll run that shit.  For now I will be on XBOX Live playing Black Arrow, Football, Basketball, HALO 2 etc.  So In Iowa, we had a little fun with the projector.  Some of the pics here a little graphic so I should warn you, we were wasted when we did these.   urlLink XBOX with Projector Setup   urlLink Soul Caliber 2 action   urlLink Rainbow Six 3   Then we really had some "fun"   urlLink Sam with girls   urlLink Sam with girls again   urlLink Sam likes the puss   urlLink Moe likes it too!   urlLink Josh likes girls   urlLink Halo action to cap it all off

      My parents got a new car.  I didn't even know they were going to get one.  Apparently the van just fucking died so they went ahead and just got a new car.  Cool color and they only pay $180 a month lease.  It's a nice economy car for around town.  My mom's office is only 10 minutes away and my sister works 10 minutes away.  I guess no one is really going to use it when both my sisters are out of to college.  That's it for now, more on the bachelor's party later.  Here's pics for the car.
