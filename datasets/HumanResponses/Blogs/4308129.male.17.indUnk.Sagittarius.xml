      It was so sianz in skul 2dae... plus i feel quite sad too... wana noe juz read on...   During biz fund lecture, i ask mi mei,Adeline, about making the honey flakes... i ask her if she cant nake it then i wil do it wiv han and chong hu... i know she is beri tired as she stay on late the day b4... but insttead of answering me, she turned away... its like showing me faces... i was sad... i tot dat i've done sumting wrong... i kept on asking myself wad i did dat she iwas like dat... i tink too much about it that i cant concentrate on my studies at all... after dat lesson, we nebe tok much at all... mebe around 3 to 4 short conversations...   Then after skul, we had a board meeting where we discuss about our CCN... our CCN is like shit... especially wen sim chuan is the CEO... during the meeting, i was bored to death... at first they spoke in english... but after awhile, they spoke in chinese... i feel like i was being left out... although han tol dem to speak in english, dey juz spoke awhile and  then back to chinese language... i fed up and sat on the opposite bench... at least i got Han to tok to... he is ine of my bez frens... i did not blame Chong Hu 4 speaking in chinese as others spoke to him in chinese...   After the CCN meeting, we walk to to bus stop... on the way, i was so quiet... i didn't even get to say goodbye to my mei mei... no1 cares to ask me wad happen... but wad to do rite... mebe they dun c dat i felt dat way... but no matter wad life stil has to go on...  Niwae, i keep miself strong... dun wana reali let it affect myself... so juz 4get it and star afresh... HaIzZzZ.............
