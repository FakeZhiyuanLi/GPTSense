      I truly hope I will write more frequently than I have so far proved.  Today was a lovely day.  I had worked 6 days in a row, the joy of retail, so I finally had a day off and decided to enjoy it.  First, but not the best, I went to the gym.  I finally used my complimentary personal training season.  Oh my, she kicked my ass.  However, she said I was in pretty good and just needed some toning and not to even really worry about cardio!  She did criticize my diet though.  Yeah, I still eat bad.  So, I went to the store and got some fruit and veggies.  Let's hope I can keep that up.  After the gym, and much better, I hit the beach.  It was bloody hot here today, so the beach or inside in cranked air is the only place to be.  It was very nice.  I have spent a good amount of time on days off there, so getting quite a nice tan going if I do say so myself.   Next it was time to get my hair cut.  I like it.  If ya have seen me recently, it's nothing drastic.  I did add the "Kelly Rippa" side bangs though.  Now, I'm just lounging around my apartment taking in the nice air-conditioning and loving my premium cable channels.  Now, if I only I had a guy to enjoy my "skinemax" with.  Oh well, in due time I guess:)

      Okay, finally decided to get off my lazy a$$ and write one of these blog things.  Hopefully, you guys will actually check it now and again and see what I've been up to.  Things are going well here.  Work is good, keeping me busy and busting my butt.  I'm finally starting to get some sort of social life going.  Developing a social life here was harder than I imagined, lots of people already have their own life, own circle of friends and it's hard to break into that.  At least when going to Tulane, there were a ton of people in the same boat I was.  There two people I work with that I really like, and we all hang out now and again.  I'm liking my apartment, liking Chicago.  I think a lot of ya know, I've always loved this city.  I don't see how ya could ever get bored here, there's sooo much to do.  I don't think I'll ever see everything the city has to offer.  It has a lot to offer, including a beach right by my apartment:)  I'll give ya one guess to where I'll be spending a lot of free time during the summer.  If ya need more than one guess, ya are just sad!haha  Anyway, that's all for now.  I'll think of more to write later!

      Okay, I know I start a lot of entries this way, but I am exhausted.  I've gone out two nights in a row, and the kitten hasn't let me sleep in too late.  So, most definitely staying in tonight.  Good thing I have tomorrow off!  Yipppeee.  Anyway, had a very nice visit with Lizz.  I probably won't get to see her for awhile, cuz she's going to Cincinatti for student teaching for 4 months or so.  Sugar was awesome. I basically had a $10 S'more and Lizz a $12 ice crean sandwich.  However, most definitely worth it.  The food was absolutely heavenly.  I never thought I'd say I like green tea ice cream.  Sugar is expensive, but gotta check it out.  The decor is fantastic, the food is fantastic.  We didn't try drinks, cuz of fundage shortage, but sure those would be spectacular as well.  It was the choolest looking place I've ever been in.   Well, we couldn't just sit there all night sipping water.  I had an idea.  I had seen in UR an add for Spy Bar offering free admission/no cover.  We decided to move unto there.  Good thing...It was free drinks til 11:30, excelllllant.  Plus, wasn't too crowded when we first got there so chilled in the VIP area.  NIIIIICE.  All $0!  We boogied down a little on the dance floor there.  Oh, play an excellant mix of music.  Very impressed with that.  Although not as cute as Sugar, it was a cute looking place.  Definitely couldn't beat the price.  So a fun night out and got to explore more places here.  I have tomorrow off, as stated earlier, so might check out the MCA, as Lizz and I never got around to it.    Quote of Lizz's visit:  "Make sure the skirt rides low enough so ya can see your pearl thongs."

      Uhm, these comments make me feel the need to defend myself.  Firist, I'm not a whore Rolando.  I'm proud to say I can count the number of guys I've slept with on one hand.  It's most definitely quality not quanity.  I'm whoever not Ms. Innocent either, as Alex would like to portray me.  Alex, you're just jealous (and don't deny ya told me many times) that we never got it on.  Anyway, enough of that.  Today should be a nice day, the beach and Navy Pier.  But most importantly, we're checking out Sugar tonight.  What could be better than a dessert bar/lounge.

      Another good day at work, by that I mean more excellant deals!  I got a Marc Jacobs skirt and Diesel all purpose black pants for $20 total.  Can't believe it.  Uhm, I guess that is definitely a perk of my job.  Lizz comes into town tomorrow for a few days.  Tomorrow plans  to be a day of culture and shopping (aka looking)  We're going to the Art Institute and Museum of Contemporary Art.  I adore the art institute, one of my favorite places here.  I've never been to the MCA, but looking forward to checking it out.  We'll probably do lunch at Rosebud's.  My favorite restaurant here so far.  Everyone I take to it enjoys it a lot.  The chicken saltimoco is outta this world!  Thanks Hoffman for introducing me to that wonderful place!  Hopefully we'll meet up with Rolando at Piece later.  Friday is up in the air pretty much yet.  Hopefully, we should be checking out Sugar on Friday night.  It's supposedely on of the hottest and newest places.  Anything less than the best is not acceptable for me.haha  Anyway, love ya all and take care.

      So another day passes at Fields...On a good/bad note Sex Pistols are coming to Chicago.  Ugh, love them.  Got two friends from work interested in going.  Bad news, tickets are $45.   Not to mention that lovely ticketmaster fee.  I guess I got spoiled by New Orleans.  I miss paying like $30 and getting to see all sorts of band.  Or better yet, getting into Jazz Fest free.  Anyway, Sex was good tonight.  I'm kinda wanting Carrie and Berger to break up for some reason.  I'm getting bored with him.  Bring Big back!

      Uhm, a nice day.  I was planning on going to the beach, but didn't feel like it so I didn't.  It's nice living on my own, being an adult.  I get to do pretty much what I want without too many people to answer to.  I feel like my proverbial butterfly, free.  I went downtown and got some cool fabric for that shirt.  It's vintage, whatever that exactly means, probably just old.  It's this little fabric store off Michigan Ave.  The guy was super nice and helpful.   I didn't hear from Christiana yet this afternoon, so I decided to just go by myself to see Legally Blonde Two.  Very independent of me, huh.  I've only done that once before, for Frida.  I studied Frida some in school, so wanted to see the flick, but no one in the Bend wanted to.  Anyway, Legally Blonde Two was very good, funny.  I luv, luv Reese.  She's just plain adorable.    Oh forgot to mention a cool compliment I got at work yesterday or maybe the day before.  There's a pretty cool chick that works there, Geri.  She, like Rolando, is a fashion design student.  I love her sense of style.  She can combine colors awesomely.  Like put a military green pant with a light pink shirt.  Sounds funky, but it works.  Well, I complimented her on that.  Told her how I like her sense of style and what not.  She then was like, "Whatever, you got a great sense of style yourself."  It made me feel good.   Man, I sound shallow in some of these, going on about clothing and what not.  It's just, it all does play a fairly important part in my life now.  Oh, I talked to the buyer for what's called our "28 Shop," where all the REALLY expensive stuff is, to find out how to take steps to becoming a buyer.  Basically, I'd have to do some time in Minneapolis.  I don't know about that...Although, I hear it's a cool town.  I really don't want to have to deal with moving and what not again.  But I know, the sacrifice would probably be worth it.  I mean, that is what I really want to do, or at least I think.  Maybe I need to talk to Saks, their program is in NYC.  I could deal with that.  Well, signing off.

      Okay, so I'm tired, but not really feeling like sleeping.  Weird, huh.  Maybe I should've gone out for that drink after all.  Anyway, I just noticed the adds on my blog are for Laundry and Marc Jacobs.  They must somehow search for keywords in the blog to match it up.  Anyway, if ya have a sec click on the Laundry link just to check my line out.  It's very cute, I promise.  Guy, you probably don't care about the clothes, so do it to humor me:)

      After a long day at work, I'm exhausted and too tired to do much of anything.  So, I decided to stay home and just relax.  I won't be able to do that for awhile.  Anyway, also decided to update the blog.  Like the new color?  Still olive green and blue to the core.  "Olive Green and blue we love thee...."   Sadly, those are some of the only words I remember of Tulane Alma Mater.  Huhm, what else could I have been doing during those four years?  Any of ya remember?  Lots of quality nights at The Boot!  Man, there's something about that place I just miss.  Anyway, work was really slow for awhile.  The sales were really sucking.  Then 15 minutes before I'm suppose to leave, it gets crazy busy.  I sold as much in that last hour, as I had the other 7 hours or so.  I ended up leaving almost an hour late, but it was worth it to get those extra sales.  I got quite a bit to do tomorrow on my day off.  I gotta go to the grocery store, oh joy.  Then there are some fun things I wanna do.  I wanna spend some time at the beach.  I also wanna go fabric shopping.  Rolando (aka Big Ro) said if I buy some fabric, he'll make this poncho style shirt we have at work for me.  Oh, those that don't know, Rolando is a friend from Field's and is a fashion design student.  So, gotta get some cool fabric.  I also need to go into Fields on my day off.  I got a few Laundry pieces, for my May allowance, and didn't like them.  I'm gonna get better things.  I'm gonna get that Prade-esque skirt we have that I've been lusting after.  I'm also gonna give good ol' Christiana a buzz to see if maybe she wants to do Legally Blonde-still haven't seen it.  I just may go myself if I can't get ahold of her, or if she can't go.  I got a Marc Jacobs coat on Wed (for $#0!!!) that Reese wears in the movie, or so I've been told.  Gotta see my coat on the big screen!  I also hope to spend some quality time chilling on the couch with Nola.  She punished me for leaving her alone longer than normal.  I came home and she dumped my living room trash.  Nothing major, just scattered some papers.  Silly kitty!  Anyway, love and miss y'all.  Hopefully, I'll get more stable here and be able to visit the real NOLA sometime soon.  It's been tooooo long.  I need a real fucking hurricane.  Not these things Fridays and other places try to pass off.  Also, y'all better leave comments.  Beth and I worked very patiently on them!  Oh, one little question in that regards, how do I put them at the end of the entry?  Since I changed the template, they got moved to the start of the entry.  URGH!

      Okay, after reading some posts from other blogs.  I've gotta make some comments.  First of all, Sean, I understand ya aren't fond of ND students.  Hopefully that will give some insight to those that wondered why I didn't go there.  Most ND, notice use of most, tend to be pretty damn stuck on themselves.  Sorry, there are better schools than ND.  The world does not end and begin there, contrary to what Regis Philbin says.  Second, Bacon oh Bacon...First, don't diss the tax cut.  At least it is something!  Something is better than nothing.  Also, as a proud alum of TU, I must say GOOOO JERRRRRYYYYY!  Ya gotta respect the guy.  If ya have ever seen him in real interviews, he is quite intelligent.  His show is just a way for him to make money, and he won't deny that.  All talk shows do not need to be as life affirming, informative as Oprah.  He was able to get himself elected as the youngest mayor of Cincy.  Okay, so yeah he got in some sex scandal, but hey I can think of another big politician that got involved in a sex scandal or two, not to mention commiting perjury.  Okay enough ranting.  I just think Jerry gets knocked too much.  Gotta stand up for my fellow alums! Anyway, I'm very annoyed with UPS lately.  Because I don't live in a ritzy apartment with a doorman and have to work m-f they are holding my package of clothes from my lovely Laundry hostage!  Hopefully, I'll get them tomorrow.  I neeed to see if USPS can deliver them.  Anyway, gotta get ready for work!

      Notice my nice lovely comment ability now!  I would like to say a big thanks to Beth for helping me with that!  Gotta go to work later.  Hoping UPS comes with my delivery before I have to leave.  URGHHHH  Anyway, that's all for now.  Don't feel like writing much right now.hehe  Coming soon to my page though-links!  Oh, and if I don't write again before Friday, everyone give congrats to the Patout.  He's tying the knot this weekend!

      I am utterly exhausted today.  Vince, Toni, and Mallory came to visit.  I forgot how tiring it can be to keep up with a three year old.  First we went to Rainforest Cafe.  I thought Mallory would like it.  I think it scared her at first, but then she liked it.  She especially liked the elephant.  Next it was off to the aquarium here.  It was kinda cool, but kinda a rip off.  I got passes for us from my library.  Ya can like rent passes to the various museums.  So, it was nice considering it was free.  If I had paid the $21 I would've been upset.  Mallory got to see her Nemos, and other fish.  Then we came back to my apt and relaxed for a bit, and then it was time for them to return to the land of the Bend.  So tonight I'm definitely just relaxing.  I'm too tired to even think about going out.  Hopefully weather will be nice enjoy my next two days off.  I'm really hoping to spend some quality time at the beach.  Anyway, hope everyone out there is well.

      An interesting day at work.  We work on commision, so needless to say things can get heated at times.  Well, I had my first real argument with a fellow co-worker.  She's notorious for being sneaky, trying to get others sales.  Well, we got into it today.  I'm proud to say, I handled it well.  I stayed pretty cool, while she got all upset and pretty much yelled.  A customer later said she had acted very unprofessional.   I felt pretty darn good, cuz I held my own, and stayed calm.  My mother would be surprised at this.  Anyway, got home from work and talked to mom.  All kinda news.  She got a new/used car.  ) got damaged really bad when a neighbors big tree feel on it.  Fortunately, my grandma has tons of insurance, so that's not a problI'm not sure of the year, but it's a Grand Prix, and apparently loaded.  Go mom!  Then I found out some bad news.  My grandma's lake house got hit hard in the recent storms.  Apparently, the living room, dining room, and screened porch (the best part of the houseem.  It's gonna be a lot of stress on my grandma, though.  Then my brother Vince and I chatted online for a long time.   That was nice, something we rarely do.  We don't shot the shit a lot.  No doubt we love each other and would be there in a second if the other needed, we just don't communicate quite as much as I'd like, but that's siblings for ya.   I guess.  Oh yeah, as you may possibly have noticed I am home tonight instead of at Legally Blonde 2.  Urgh...Christiana got sick, so we're gonna have to reschedule again!  So, right now I'm just typing away at my blog and watching the Osbournes.  Anyoen looking to read a good book needs to read "The Devil in the White City" by Erik Larson.  It's about Chicago during the planning of the World Fair in 1893.  It may sound like a dull topic, but very interesting.  It even includes a serial killer.  Amie, I found out from the book the S and I Museum is one fo the buildings for the fair, the only that remains.  Also, the architect built a lot around Chicago, but very few things remain, and one is a hotel right across the street from where I work, so I thought that was kinda cool.  Anyway, I guess that's enough rambling.

      The last few days I've been feeling very unenergetic, lazy.  I think part of it is going out after a case of insomnia.  Two nights of little sleep takes some recovering.  I haven't done much, didn't go to the beach, didn't go out with Christiana.  Her and I are planning to see Legally Blonde 2 tomorrow.  Ugh, loved the first one.   Anyway, watched Sex and the City last night.  I realized something.  You know who is my Mr. Big.  Unattainable, and I don't even really want him, yet I do.  I need to find a Berger to make me forget all about my Mr. Big.  I'm sure it'll happen, just not soon enough.  Now watching For Love or Money, what a messed-up concept that is.  What are reality shows gonna do next?  Matt, ya work at Fox, the king of reality tv, what's the next generation?  Just what are they gonna pull next?

      Happy 5th of July!hehe  Thursday night was lots of fun.  I went with one of my friends from work to this pizza/brewery place called Piece.  Oh, have to interject for one moment, I dare anyone to find better pizza anywhere outside of Chicago.  Chicago pizza rocks!  Anyway, Thursday nights at Piece are karaoke nights.  Interesting...Besides Cat's Meow, I have never been to a karaoke bar.  Lots of people singing on stage that had no business being there.hehe  I did not get that drunk.  I met up with Rolando, who's a big sweetie.  I met his boyfriend Rob, who also seems very nice.  Rolando did a nice rendition of No Doubts "Sunday Morning"  He tried to get me up there to sing Christina Aguilera's Dirrrty, but I didn't.  Next Friday I don't have to work, so he says he's gonna get me trashed enough to sing.  I don't know, it's gonna take a lot.  I had to work yesterday during the day.  It was so slow, the day totally dragged on.  I was planning on going out with Christiana, another friend from work, but I was sooo tired.  I just came home and chilled.  Today, my bro Vince, his wife Toni, and the most wonderful niece in the world were going to visit.  Due to circumstances beyond anyone's control, loooooong story, it's being put off to next weekend.  So, I think I'll give Christiana a buzz, and she what's she's up to tonight.  As of right now, decided whether or not to hit the beach!

      I'm currently suffering from a case of insomnia, so figured I'd write.  I do want to get to bed soon though.  I have tomorrow off, but a ton of stuff I have to do.  Hopefully, I still can manage to get at least 6 hours!  Anyway,  today was somewhat an odd day.  I just could not focus at all.  It all started when I went into the shower this morning with my glasses on.  I should have just gone back to bed then and there.  My sales at work stunk today, because of my lack of ability to focus today.  Lucky for me, I've had a kick butt week so far, so one bad day won't hurt a thing really.  For those of ya that don't know, I work in sales for the huge Marshall Fields here in Chicago.  Connected with that, I'm a specialist for an awesome line of clothing called Laundry by Shelli Segal.  Being a specialist just means keeping that area nice, making sure the new stuff is prominentally featured, and fighting with our merchandising dept that keeps fucking the stuff up.  It's not too much extra responsibility, and no extra pay.  I do get free clothes though-a lot.  I placed my first personal order today, and basically I'm getting $1,200 in clothing for free!  I'll get that every month.  Very exciting for me.  Soon my wardrobe will put Sarah Jessica's to shame.  At work we have these called "zero'd outs"  Basically they're stuff that we've had for awhile and never sold.  Well, designer expensive stuff doesn't sell well in our dept.  So, I've been able to buy things by huge designers uber uber cheap.  My closet now is home to Marc Jacobs, Diane Von Furstenbert, Moschino, and Dolce and Gabbana.  Rock on!  Soon, I think I'll have to buy my beloved shoes-my Manolo Blahniks.   I visit them at Neiman Marcus regularly.haha  Oh man, do I sound shallow!  The next few days should be excited, so hopefully I'll write a little each day for awhile.  Anyway, I think I'm finally sleepy, so gonna go to bed.  First, I'm actually gonna send my blog out to y'all.  I wanted to write a few entries before I did.

      Urgh, I hate wasting money on things like cabs.  It seems so pointless to me, for some odd reason.  I'll get to that in a minute.  It was a pretty dull weekend totally, because of work and allergies.  I had almost no energy to do anything.  Thankfully today I'm feeling better.  Hopefully, I won't have a relapse or anything.  Anyway, so yeah I worked Friday and Saturday.  Then today was somewhat productive.  I had today off.  I tried to do a little grocery shopping, but the store was closed for Labor Day weekend.   I might have to take a quick run there Tuesday before work, since I don't go in until 12:15.  Then I took a stroll to the Belmont/Clark area.  I bought some stuff to spiff up my apartment, for that mod living room I mentioned.  I bought two poster size frames at Linens n' Things for some art prints I ordered online.  One is a shoe print by Warhol, so Jessica!  Anyway, this was a lot more cumbersome than I had planned.  I thought I'd be able to manage everything back on the El.  It was like a block away from the store, and then from my stop about 4 blocks to my apartment.  After walking half a block, I realized this was not gonna happen.  So, I took a cab.  It was only about a mile to my place, and it cost like 5 dollars.  Okay, I realize that really is not a lot and definitely worth the convenience, but ugh.  I don't know why, I just don't like spending money on cabs.  I know, dumb.  Hopefully, a few of you out there will get what I mean.  I'm very excited though that my living room is getting a move on!  I can't wait to get those prints, then it'll look a lot more together.  Ciao for now!  Quote of the Weekend: "Damn allergies!"

      My queen is back! Okay, I'm feeling like crap right now, allergies, but I had to write.  I left work a little early today, cuz I was so outta it with my allergy medicine.  So, I'm home as we speak and watching the VMA's.  Gotta admit, I love my MTV.  Oh my god, the opening kicked ass!  I've been kinda dissing Madonna as of late for the Gap ad.  I never thought I'd see that day.  I mean, the performance was HOOOOOT!  Although, I gotta admit didn't like Christina Aquilera and Britney doing a cover, but...For all ya guys there was even a tiny, tiny bit of lesbo action.  I love Madonna, and pretty much always have.  This woman has influenced so much in our lives.  I still wonder to this day what my parents must have thought of me being in kindergarten and singing Like a Virgin.  I still remember one of the coolest compliments I have ever received in my life.  I was in first grade, and just got my first perm.  Don't laugh-it was the 80s after all!  I wanted to show it off, and went to the neighbors.  Katie was my best friend then, and she had an older sister Kelly.  I really idolized Kelly, the big sis I never had.  Anyway, I go over there.  Kelly tells me I look like a mini-Madonna.  I was on cloud nine.   Obviously, I still remember that to this day.  There's this skirt at Nevermind I am eying, totally 80s Madonna style.  Could be fun!  Mom's visit went well.  Suprisingly, we got along pretty splendidly.  She even ordered my birthday present, like 2 months early!  It's a women's Packers jersey.  Of course it's #4 for the god that is Brett Favre.  Now that I am in Bears country, gotta represent my cheeseheads!  Anyway, I fear the medicine is making me ramble, so gonna go before I say anything really stupid.  That is if I haven't already.

      Ugh, can we say just a fucked up day at work.  I spent almost all morning on the phone trying to find a coat and bag for a guest.  Then to find out, for reasons I don't feel like typing it'd take too long, I might not even get credit for it.  I was/am pretty pissed.  I'm off til Thursday now, so when I go back I'm gonna have a nice talking with my manager.  Hopefully things can get settled.  Anyway, then it seems like I spent the other half of the day on the phone with my Laundry by Shelli Segal rep, Yvonne.  The little time I wasn't with the guest on the phone or on the phone wiht Yvonee, I was trying to fax a report to Laundry hq's in New York.  This was the first report I had to do, so ugh  it was a pain in the ass.  I was told I could use the fax machines in Human Resources.  I'm up there half an hour trying to figure it out.  Then come to find out those fax machines only take incoming faxes.  So I had to go to another floor and do it, luckily that worked.  By the time all this was done, it was almost time to go home.  Fortunately somehow, I managed pretty damn good sales.  How that happened, I don't know, but not complaining.  Anyway, I'm home now.   YIPPPEEEEE.  Gotta do some cleaning maybe tonight.  My mom's coming to visit tomorrow and wednesday.  It should be nice.  NOt sure what we're gonna be doing, but...So anyway, probably won't post the next few days.  Ciao for now!

      Are the fates trying to tell me something?  Okay, first of all Matty and Lauren get engaged last night. By the way, big congrats!  I wish I could've been at Pat O's for the "after party"  I better bloody well get an invite!  Anywya, so last week I find a designer for my future wedding dress.  Tonight Amber tells me, she was looking through books and found a shoe cake for me.  SO, I got the dress and the cake, everyone else is getting to that stage in their life?  I just need to find my groom now.haha  Honestly though, I joke about it, but marriage right now is the furthest thing from my mind.  Yeah, I'd like to eventually, but not for awhile.  I'm single, pretty new in big city and I'm enjoying it!  And no, that doesn't mean I'm sleeping with all kinda random guys, Bruno!  Anyway, kinda a blah weekend.  I had to work a lot.   Anyway, ciao for now everyone!

      So I did an IP search, and Anonymous is definitely Bruno.  It comes from San Fran, and he is the only one I know out there.  Funny, huh.  That's it.  Bruno, ya know ya are looking quite mental to people.  I can't tell ya how many people I've had ask me what you're on.  Maybe I should've told them about what ya snuck into Aussie.  But I'm not that much of a bitch.  Anyway, just give up the act now.  If ya are gonna continue to post comments just use your name.  YOu're not fooling anyone.  That's it.  No more will be said in regards to stupid comments, and hopefully others will refrain as well.  Nite everyone!

      Such a lovely lazy day.  I haven't done much at all:)  Did a little cleaning and some grocery shopping and that has been the extent of my productivity.  As of right now I'm engrossed in an I love the 70s marathon on VHI.  It's a crazy, trivial show, but I can't quite seem to change the channel.haha  They talked about Sea Monkeys, and expressed my point of view exactly.  Did any of ya ever have them?  I was so excited, looked so cool on the box.  Then ya get them, and they are just bloody brine shrimp.  There was a really funny South Park episode about it.  I think it was one of the greatest disappointments of my childhood.  Anyway, back to the tv.  It's fun being such a bum every now and again!

      Ugh, I hate this time of year-allergy season!  My eyes have been itchy all day, but yet I didn't go to Walgreens to get eyedrops.  I didn't want to go after work, I just wanted to get the hell home and relax.  I didn't sleep to well last night.  I woke up with my nose dripping for awhile.  Then Nola (the kitten) decided 6am is a great time to play!  I swear, a kitten has got to be ALMOST as bad as kids.  Who knows maybe I'll eventually change my mind, but I know as of now I'm tooooo selfish for kids.  I enjoy my close to 8hrs of sleep at night.  Most importantly, the freedom I have to do almost anything I want when I want.  Anyway, yeah.  So, basically when 8am rolled around and it was time for me to get up.  It was rough.  I dressed way cas for work too, just wanted to be comfortable.  I may as well have stayed home and slept, cuz it was dead there today.  I didn't make much more than I would have if I stayed home and used personal time.  GROWL.  Damn me for being such a dependable employee!hehe  At least I have tomorrow off.  Don't reallly have too much I have to do!  Oh, today was Vanessa's last day today, at least for awhile.  She's going back to school on Friday.  I'll miss her.  She's one of the few people I enjoy working with.  So after a long day at work, I came home and finally watched the DVD of Chicago!  If ya haven't seen it, rent it!  It's absolutely fantastic.  Just remember to give 'em the old razzle dazzle, razzle dazzle 'em.

      Ah, so relieved when I woke up this morning and there were not a ton of comments!  Maybe things will return to normal:)  It's gonna be fun day at work.  Todya is the big launch of the Chicago DVD.  In our store windows, we're gonna have dancers!  Can't wait to buy it and watch it.  Anyway, the dilemma of the day.  I find out Bloomies is gonna have a special Juicy Couture event.  I can get it on sale, because of a coupon for the store that I have.  ANyway, if ya don't know what Juicy is, it's those velour running suits that all the celebs and stuff wear.  I've gotten a few pieces at work on sale, and they are wonderfully comfortable.  I live in them on my days off.  Anyway, Bloomies is doing a think were ya can get them monogrammed for free, like lots of celebs do.  I believe Madonna's says Mrs. Ritchie.  Anyway, I was thinking of doing it and getting "Polish Princess" monogrammed.  Don't quite want to do my name.  What do y'all think?  If it makes a difference, Chicago has a hgue Polish population.  Anyway, gotta start getting ready for work.  It's gonna be aw weird day.  I have to work at the store, then I'm doing something in Grant Park for Fields.  Anyway, ciao for now.

      Sorry for all the posts, but as ya know some crazy stuff has been going on this site.  Anyway, it has made me do some thinking and has built stronger bonds of friendship.  I never realized a few of ya cared so deeply about me.  Yada yada.  So Mr. Anonymous was Bruno.  He has a wicked sick sense of humor.  Bruno, what ya don't realize most people knew all that crap about me anyway.  THe only thing that sucked was when ya dissed Alex and kept putting Brent's name into it.  That sucked hardcore.  Alex has been an awesome friend throughout all of this.  It's so funny, most people probably thought he and I would never really talk to each other again, yet I think we've become pretty tight.  But years ago, and I've told him this he didn't break my heart, just bruised the ego a bit.  That was hard to take, but ya get older and wiser and get over it.  So Alex, I love ya and as you are proud of me, I am proud of you.  Although, if ya ever diss Blahniks again there will be absolute hell to pay!!!!!  I'm also kinda realizing how fucked up my life has become, it's something I wanted for myself but never thought it would happen.  I've kinda started living the "glamorous life"  I mean Saturday night I was surrounded by future fashion designers and ny models.  Crazy!  Although, I gotta be careful not to get too caught up in it.  Point is, I like my life, like the direction it is heading.  Sure I've made some mistakes in my life, but it has helped form me into the person I am today.  I'm pretty proud of that person.  I hope y'all are too, cuz I'm proud of y'all!  So I guess enough of that, so without further delay (cuz it's already belated) it's time for QUOTE OF THE WEEKEND: How do they get boobs like that?

      Ah, so far a nice day off.  Got a lot accomplished.  I've done all my running around, and now it's time to relax.  Yesterday was an okay day work.  I was dreading it, cuz I was tired as hell.  Fortunately it went by pretty quickly, until the last hour or so and then it dragged.  Jennifer and I, the girl I worked with in my area, and I were both kinda on the grouchy side.  It seemed like it was crazy kid day.  Quite a few little kiddies running around and hollering.  It made me remember why Idon't plan on having kids.  I came home and as usual on a Sunday watched my Sex and the City.  Can I tell ya how much I love that show?  Last nights episode was so perfect.  I decided when/if I should ever marry I'm registering at Blahnik and Jimmy Choo. hehe  It was a perfect Jessica episode.  I was talkign with Alex during it, and said it was a Jessica show.  Then right afterwards, Amber called and said she thought of me.  Do ya think I'm obsessed?haha  Anyway, it was great talking to both of them.  I got a plan up my sleeve for Amber:)  Then I watched the Nefertiti show on the Discovery channel.  She would've been one cool chick to know, I think.  Anyway, gonna go chill and continue to enjoy my day off!

      If ya couldn't tell from the pst below, I had an awesome time.  Vanessa made my decision of what to do easier, because she wasn't able to go.  Her family is selling their house, and she had to clean or some sorry excuse like that.haha  Anyway, so after work I met up with Geri.  Along with another friend of hers, Maytae (sp) we went back to her place and freshened-up a bit and then headed out for night of craziness.  We went to this bar called Lolita's.  It's a hispanic gay bar.  On Fridays they have drag shows, so we went for that.  There is nothing like a bunch of drag queens to make a woman feel inferior.  Some of them were really awesome.  We all drank a lot and were feeling quite happy.  I never really felt that drunk, just really good.  I tried shooting tequila, but that didn't go so well.  I think I'll stick to it mixed.  I almost puked from it.  Somewhere during the evening, I told Geri she could design my wedding dress when I get married.haha  I think I mentioned I wanted it purple:)  I don't know if I still want purple, but maybe a ribbon or some purple detailing would be cute.  I would love and be honored if she really would, when if that day ever comes.  Anyway a funtabulous night.  I didn't feel too messed up til I got home, and then it kinda hit me.  I was really wound up and probably didn't fall asleep til 4:30, which absolutely sucked since I had to get up 4 hrs later for work.  I don't have to work tomorrow, so I can recover from it all then. It's my favorite time of the week, Sex and the City tonight.  Ugh, looove that show. A little blurb here, I have already spent too much time on Anonymous Friend, but want to say one more thing and then hopefully I will never mention anything about it again or respond to any comments he/she may leave.  I said ID yourself below, but don't.  I think if I knew who ya are, I would honestly never be able to talk to ya again.  If ya think I'm the kinda girl that can't even remember the names of the few guys I've been with, ya are mistaken.  With the exception of Brent, I even still know all their middle names and occasionally still talk to most of them.  Sometimes exes make the best confidants.  Right Alex?  Even though, ya know he and I never went there.haha  Luv my coonass!

      It's after 2am, and I'm fucked up, but I'm gonna respond.  Mr. Mardi Gras name was Brent last name being left blank for privacy, but I do remember it.   Pardon me if I mispell....Tonight was fantastic.    Will write more tomorrow.  Geri, you rock girl.   P.S.  Anonymous Friend if ya have the balls ID yourself!  I'm not ashamed of what happened with Brent.  It's just amazing you're bringing it up a year later.  No real friend would write stuff like you have.

      A crazy day.  Work was kinda icky at first.  It seemed no one was buying at all.  I was there an hour without selling anything.  Fortunately, it picked up in the evening.  I managed to make a pretty good day out of it.  I just don't like closing tonight, and having to be there at 9:15 tomorrow!  It means a night in!  Tomorrow could be problematic.  I don't know what I'm going to do.  I had talked iwth Vanessa, and we were planning on going to see Uptown Girls tomorrow.  I talked to Geri today, though, and she invited me to do something way fun.  Her birthday is tomorrow.  Some friends and her are going to a Mexican restaurant after work.  However, it's not just any restaurant.  I don't know if it's like a gay bar, but apparently there's a drag show there tomorrow.  Sounds interesting.  Ah, memories!  Matty and Beth remember that night at 735.  I recall someone thought a queen was cute, won't name names though.   Anyway, hopefully Vanessa and I will be able to see Uptown another day.  So, I get home.  Check my blog.  Someone left a not so nice comment, not sure who it was and don't really wanna know.  I somewhat deserve it, but also feel I somewhat don't.  I'm gonna defend myself once and forall.  I'm not a virgin (duh) but not a slut.  Not being a virgin does not equal being a slut!  Yeah, I've done a few (and I do mean a few) stupid things.  I think pretty much damn near everyone our age has.  I'm not a total Ms. Innocent, but if ya were to compare me to most people my age, I would be somewhere ont he innocent end of the spectrum.  In the words of the wise Forrest Gump, "That's all I got to say about that."  One last thing, go CUBBBIIIIESSSS!!!!

      Sorry for two posts in a day, but it was kinda a wacky afternoon.  It was a pretty uneventful day at work.  It was pretty busy.  I liked that very much, cuz it kept me awake and I had a good sales day.  I had an unexpected visitor,  Mrs. Aragones!!!  It was pretty cool.  Then I went to lunch/dinner and heard about the blackouts.  All I can say is crazy.  For any of you who have read Atlas Shrugged, it almost seems as though it is coming true.  I mean look at the train derailments and now this.  A lady who was sitting by me in the employee lounge kept saying it was terrorism.  She's positive even after it was reported there's no way it was.  She was kinda freaking, but I guess there are those paranoid people out there.  I can get cases of paranoia, so can't really fault her.  Anyway, gonna get to bed soon and hopefully get a full 8 hrs sleep!

      I am such a dork.  I had a hard time falling asleep last night, cuz I just kept thinking of things to do to my living room.hehe  I think it'll be cool looking.  It's gonna be mod but not over the top.  I think next week on a day off, I'm gonna take a trip to the Ikea store to check it out.  I've never been to one of their stores.  I got a catalog of theirs a few weeks ago, and it is just so awesome looking.  In other news for all of ya who may remember her, I'm going to visit Anne-Marie in early September.  She's living in Lexington, Kentucky now.  It's kinda weird how this all came about.  The first semester of soph year, I'd go home sometimes on weekends with her to Slidell.  Anyway, I got to her know her parents pretty well.  Her dad and I always joked around and what not.  Well, when she'd go home she'd have me on her dad's IM buddy list to chat sometimes.  Her dad and I would even sometimes chat.  He's coming to Chicago in early Sept for a conference or something.  Well, he's gonna rent a car, and we're gonna drive down to visit her.  I'm  excited to see her.  It's been way too long.  Anyway, gotta go and start getting ready for work.  I'm pretty tired, so hopefully I can manage to keep up some energy and hustle.

      Okay, I've lived here for awhile now.  I decided my living room needs some help.  It's just so boring now.  My bedroom I love.  It's done in late 2002-early 2003 Pottery Barn.haha  I decided in the past week or so, I want to do the living room in kinda a mod style ala Austin Powers, not quite that nutty though.  I already know the Andy Warhol print I want to use.  It's shoes:)  I had today off, so decided to do a little more exploring of this great city.  There's this great area near me with all kinda funky shops, lots of vintage stuff.  I went there to look around and get some inspiration.   Boy, did I find it.  There's this fantabulous store called Hollywood Mirror.  First of all, they have a kick ass Sex Pistols t-shirt like I've been looking for.  Then I found a cool light, and a some kinda shall we say decorative art.  Then I went to ebay and bid on this really funky chair I could use at my computer.  The mind is going.  It'll take me awhile to get it down how I want.  I'm gonna have to buy things slowly and convert it slowly, because of the fact that moey does not grow on trees.  It'll look pretty cool, though.  I need to talk to my landlord to see if I can paint.  I'd like to paint a wall red or something.   So yeah Matty, the Shagsta's pad will soon be shagadelic!  hehe  Gotta love my salami.   Speaking of which, I want to talk to ya matty on the phone when is a good time????   Okay, I've heard that money doesn't grow on trees argument my whole life.  I have a response to that, in which moeny does grow on trees.  Money is made from paper.  No one can argue against that, well except that coins aren't.  Paper is made from wood pulp.  Wood pulp comes from trees, so therefore money does grow on trees!

      Hola!  Today was definitely a better day than yesterday.  For all the New Orleans crew, Bobby Flanders has a blog now.  I'll add that to my links very shortly.  Today was pretty good day at work.  I sold a good amount for a Tuesday:)  Definitely made up for the icky day yesterday.  Nothing too exciting happened.  Oh, a Ben and Jerry's shop opened up about a block away.  Those that know me, should know i love B and J's.  Well, to celebrate the grand opening they gave out free cones!  Yummy.  I tried chocolate fudge brownie and it was heavenly.  Today passed pretty quickly, which is always a good thing.  So, I come to relax and watch some MTV.  Tonight was the Osbourne season (series?) finale.  Oh my god!  What can I say but it was absolutely fucked up.  I'll give a summary, but the summary can not show just how fucked up it was.  Kelly and her mom get in a huge fight, and it looks like Kelly moves out.  Then Jake talks about waking up violent from sleep walking.  Then in one of these violent rages, he accidentally kills one of the dogs.  I am about to flip out at this point.  My sweet little (okay somewhat demonic, but only I can say that) kitten is laying right next to me, and I am ujst imagining that happening to her.  But in the end, it all ends up being fake, set up.  I liked the Osbournes, enjoyed the show.  That was a bit too much for me though.  The dog thing was too much for me.  My heart like seriously almost stopped when the poor dog was supposedely being strangled.  I think the Osbournes pushed it a little too far for me!

      I'm just having a very blah day today.  Rough going back to work after a three day weekend.  Work kinda dragged today, but it was slooow.  I just heard something pretty crazy on the news.  Arnold Schwarzenager (sp) had to release his tax records, since he is running for governor.  He made like 32 mil last year, and paid 8 mil in taxes.  Can ya imagine?  I think a person could live pretty comfortably on 8 mil for their life.  To him that was just his taxes for a year!  I don't know, I was pretty damn amazed.  I don't think I want to even know Bill Gates' tax bill!  Anyway, just food for thought.

      Glamorama was kinda a disappointment.  I thought for volunteering, we'd get to see some of the fashion show.  NOPE!  If I had known that, I'd have checked out the rehearsal.  Fields employees were allowed to do that.  My duties basically meant standing right by the coat check and telling people were it was if they couldn't find it.  DUMB!  It did make for interesting people watching.  People came in all kinda things.  From Abercrombie to couture.   One word of advice, if ya are going to a fashion show and party titled Glamorama, DO NOT WEAR ABERCROMBIE!  Say lots of people in stuff we sell in our department as well.  I got to know some ofther girls that work there better which is nice.  Erin from French Connection and I decided to go see it as paying people next yeear.  Didn't even get to see the few celebs that were there, though.  Apparently Pamela Lee, Chris Judd, and someone else were there.    Tracy Ulmann was the host, I would've liked to have meet her.  I think she's one of the funniest women around.  It really wasn't too horrid, but I don't plan on volunteering again next year if I'm still around.  So, I just hope the fashion show on Thursday is better.  It'll be a smaller, less glamourous but hey.  A pretty relaxing day today is planned.  I have a few things to take care of, but nothing that important or time consuming.  Hope y'all ahve a good one! HAPPY BIRTHDAY VANESSA!!!!

      Glamorama day! Had today off, so basically lounged around.  Uhm, I love a lazy day.  I got some stuff from Laundry by Shelli Segal today.  I love what I got.   It's awesome.  Anyway, gotta get going soon.  I'm sure I'll have some kinda interesting story about tonight.

      1 day til Glamorama! Today was just a messed up/unusual day somehow.  My Laundry by Shelli Segal rep was meeting today to go over our area and to discuss the big floor move.  See they are redoing the whole store gradually, and part of our floor is being redone so everything is reallly squished right now.  It should be done Monday I'm told, but we'll see.  Anyway, we did the floor in like 40 min, a record.  It usually takes 1.5-2 hours.  Part of that is because I had it looking good already.  So, we have things to discuss, such as the new merchandise we'll be getting and we need to go over the August lines and pick my clothes!!!  So, we go to lunch on Laundry by Shelli Segal.  We go to the Walnut Room (oh lala) and I have Lobster Ravioli.  What can I say, but excellant!  Love a gourmet meal not paid for by me.  Well lunch took a long time.  That means, I didn't get to spend much time on the selling floor which is kinda a downer.  Gonna have to kick some ass next week.hehe  I didn't even get to work with any of the "fun" people today.  Anyway, I'm home now and that's all that counts.  I don't have to go back til Monday!!!  Then I get home and speaking of Laundry, UPS tried to deliver me more clothes but I wasn't here.  I'll be home tomorrow though:)

      2 days til Glamorama! AND ALL THAT JAZZ! Did ya ever have one of those days where things just seem wonderful?  Well, it didn't start off that way, the El was having issues, so I walked a little bit to work, got off one stop early.  Instead of being pissed off, I was struck with just how beautiful the city is.  It really is gorgeous!  Reaffirmed my belief that I'll not be one of those women who gets married and moves to suburbia.  it's not bad, just not me.  Then the windows at the store are currently beautiful and so fun.  For those that don't know, Fields is huge.  Second biggest department store in the country.  The windows currently are filled with costumes and props from the movie Chicago.  Why?  Fields is gonna be the launch site for the DVD. Pretty darn nifty.    So, Catherine, Renee, and Richards costumes are there.  I need to take a better look to see how big or little Catherine and Renee are.  I'll update ya lata.  I don't think they have any Latifah outfits though.  Her character was the best.  If you be good to momma, momma be good to you.  Then things just flew at work for some crazy reason.  I talked to my pal Geri this morning.  She invited me to go to a fashion show iwht her next week.  Is that awesome or what?!  It'll be my first fashion show, or my second since I'll be at Glamorama on Friday.  I'll be volunteering at that, but will hopefully get to see it.  Tracy Ullman is the host, and I love her.  Have ever since her show on Fox when I was itty bitty.  So the fashion shows should rock.  gotta figure out what to wear next week, though.  Don't know quite what the scene is, but I think it calls for a special pair of shoes:) Oh, forgot yesterday.  Yesterday was a celebrity filled day.  Aaron Carter made an appearnace at our store, so got to hear tons of little bitty girls screaming, one even threw up I hear.  I guess I can't knock them too much, was a huge New Kids fan.  Then we found out Sheryl Crow was shopping at the other Fields about a mile away.  I don't think she's too smart.  Our store is the best.  That's not biased, as we are the flagship Fields store and have more merchandise then any store whatsoever in the entire city.  But anyway...Oh Saturday is Vanessa's bday, even if ya dont' know her click on her link and leave a happy bdeay comment.  It should be a lucky one for her:)

      Two posts in one day!  Whoo hooo!  Anyway, Beth I loved talking with ya tonight, definitely gotta make a habit outta it.  Gotta take advantage of all those minutes I get on my cell.  I miss the Tulane/New Orleans crew so much.  Ya made my four years unforgettable and helped to shape me into the person I am today.  Work was somewhat fun today.  Vanessa is becoming my little protege.  I'm a bad influence.  We took a break together, and she wanted to stop at shoes.  Well, she ended up walking with a pair of kick ass Jimmy Choo's.  They were such an awesome deal, though.  I think they were like $450 originally and got them for like 150 or something.  Ya can not pass that deal up!  I'm so bad.  But that is why y'all love me, or at least I hope ya do:)

      3 more days til Glamorama! Work was pretty dull yesterday, but thankfully it was a somewhat short shift.  Cute security guy came down, still don't know his name.  We're not really suppose to talk to them, or at least those undercover.  So we just exchanged hi's.  After he left Vanessa said, "I hate you, I hate you, I hate you.  He was checking you out!"  So apparently there is some sort of mutual attraction, but that's all it really is.  We have yet to have a real conversation, and like I said earlier don't know his name even.  So anyway, that was maybe the most exciting thing to happen at work.  It was a pretty dull day, and I was just so tired at the end of the day.  The place just sucks the energy outta ya at times.  I had to stop at the grocery store on the way home, which I hate.  The lines were long, and this dude cut in line a few people in front of me.  He only had a few things, so didn't bother me too much.  Then however he apparently didn't speak English or something and couldn't understand how much he owed.  He ended up taking as long as say a person with 20 items or something.  It annoyed the hell outta me.  Normally it wouldn't have been too bad, but I was tired, hungry and just wanted to get home like most of the people in line I'm sure.  Oh yeah, it was an interesting trip home too.  I went down to the El.  It wasn't coming yet, so decided to walk to the next stop-a block away through this little walk way thing they have.  A guy was right there taking a piss-gross.  Not that I gave him a good look, but he was somewhat younger in a nice suit, so definitely should've known better.  Well, anyone should've known better.  Then as I'm walking home from the grocery store a guy is on a corner grabbing his crotch hard core.  Double gross!  I think I'm starting to loose faith in humanity.  People are becoming moer and more animalistic it seems.  I don't know, just don't know.  Talked to my bro again last night.  He got his bike.  He's only taken it around the block, cuz he doesn't have a helmut yet and isn't used to it.  Smart!  He said it's wicked fast.  It's got 115 horseys behind it.  That's a lot for a little bike.  I think some cars have that.  Anyway, it looks and sounds hot.  I so can't wait to go home and get a ride on it!  That's all for now, have to head out to work in a little bit.  Happy, happy, joy, joy!

      5 more days til Glamorama! Hehe, cats are so funny when high on catnip!  Work was interesting today.  I think Vanessa and I almost annoyed poor Rolando to death today, but he lived and will continue to live.  Other than that, it was work as usual.  Oh wait...there was an interesting development.  There's this pretty cute security guard at work.  Amie and Beth, if ya read this it's not the Louis lookalike, it's a different/cuter one.  Well, I walk out the lovely employee door and step out to head to the El.  Well, someone punches my arm.  It's the cute AP guy!  BTW, AP is Fields talk for security.  So we play fight a tad and then I continue on my merry way.  Just got off IM with Vanessa, and she thinks he's a cutie.  R and V, much better than your hanger boy!hehe  Anyway, I don't know.  I don't even know his name!  Plus, let's say he did like me (which at this point is not a given) I dont' even know if we can date.    Probably some dumb Fields rule about AP associates dating regular associates.  I don't know.  I get home, it's almost time for Sex, and my mom calls.  Among other things, she tells me my bro Vince is getting a Harley.  He gets it tomorrow.  I saw a pic of it online, and it is fucking hot.  Check it out www.harleydavidson.com   His particular bike is called a VRod.  It still looks like a Harley, but a bit sportier/modern.  So, mom is worried to death.  I told her not too, he's wised up a lot about speed since Mallory came along.  He sys the only place he goes fast is on the race course.  Speaking of which, gotta see if my boy Jr. won the race today.  I hope, he needs to pass up Kenseth.  I told mom the only thing I was worried about is getting all the Harley clothes like his inlaws.  Ugh, they were freaks.  Even got their 4 year old grandson $50 harley boots.  Anyway, Vince said not to worry about that.  Vince is smarter than that.  Anyway, time for Project Greenligh.  I love Sunday night HBO.

      Went last night to see American Wedding with a few friends from work last night.  What can I say but hilarious!  I laughed my ass off.  Yes, I know that's quite a accomplishment.  I'm gonna have to watch it again on video when it comes out.  I missed lots of dialog, cuz everyone in the theater was laughing so loud.  Steifler stole the show, the shit scene tops it all!  Anyway, excellant, hilarious.  For the Field's people that read this, Vanessa really can eat all that she says she can.  I never would've believed it.hehe  I have today off, so looking forward to a nice lazy day.  Don't even have too much around the apartment to take care of.  I've also decided to try and institute the quote of the weekend. QUOTE OF THE WEEKEND: "Whose the prostitute here?"

      Damn fine game last night!  Although, the score should not have been as close as it was.  The Bears got really lucky with that call that should've (even Madden agreed) been a fumble.  If that call had been made properly, the Bears would not have gotten that last touchdown.  Things were scary for a tad in the early 4th quarter.  Favre came through, though.  He likes that kinda pressure.  No way Favre was gonna give the Bears' fans a nice homecoming win!  Keep your fingers crossed for the Cubbies tonight!!!!!

      It's time for an update on my lovely, fun-filled, and interesting weekend.  After a long and boring 2.5 hour train ride, I arrived home in the Bend.  After a quick trip home, it was time for a run to Grape Rd (Bend's version of Vets) to run a fun errands.  Got a beautiful album for Terry and Joe.  Came home and then hit the road with Amber to meet Jenni at Hacienda.  Uhm, yummy.   No one can make a better margarita then Hacienda.  We went through a couple liters:)  It was awesome to catch up with Jenni.  I hadn't seen her in a couple years.  Since I know she's a regular blog reader, here's a big shot out to Jenni and her "kids"haha  Oh, we decided not to go to the game cuz it was rainy.  However, my cousin's team still played.  They lost, but Jake had a fantastic game!  He made a 73 yard catch!  It made the news play of the week!  Watch out for Jake Manuszak.  He should be playing for the Pack one day:)  Onwards to the wedding.  The actually ceremony was very informal and short, but very nice and touching.  I don't think Aunt Terry lasted a minute before she started crying her eyes out.  The reception wasn't quite as crazy as I hoped, but still a good time.  I decided as wedding photographer, I had to take a "family" pic.  My aunt has two kids, and Joe has one.  So the five of them are by the bar hoisting their drinks.  It's very fitting.haha  It was weird, though.  My aunt's always been kinda crazy and free-spirited, but I never realized quite how much.  She let my cousins (15 and 17) drink up a storm, and also allowed their friends.  That's not too bad I guess, cuz it was a wedding.  However, she was also okay with the 15 year old and her buds sneaking off to get high.  There are no rules at all in that house.   My mom wasn't strict by any means, and this stuff was going on in her own home, but she never knew.  Okay, she knew we drank there now and again and if she wasn't home the boys would smoke up.  I guess the question is, is it better to be clueless or let this stuff knowingly go on all the time?  Also, I think the 15 year old is allowed to have her boyfriend stay the night.  No way would my mom have let that happen!  I don't know, I just couldn't get over quite how open that family is.  I don't know, am I making any sense?  THen today it was over to Terry's again for leftovers.  YUMMY!  THe chicken was to die for!  That's all I can think of to write for now.  If I think of anything else to write, I'll write lata.  Oh yeah, Nola was an angel.  She didn't get into anything the whole while I was gone.  Anyway, Ciao for now!

      So, yeah it's Thursday.  I'm not feeling well, not quite sure what I have.  It's some kinda annoying bug or just a major case of burnout.  Anyway, I was suppose to work 12-8 or so tonight.  I left around 3.  I wasn't feeling all that swell this morning, and kept feeling worse.  All I gotta say is I'm definitely looking forward to getting away this weekend, even if it is just to the Bend.  I've been in a big rut lately, and I'm thinking that's probably at least part of my problem.  I just haven't had the time, energy or money to go out a lot.  I'd just work a lot, and then come home and go to sleep.  As ya may have noticed my entries have not been that interesting lately.  It'll be nice to go home, get away from the city for a bit and even have a little fun.  It'll be great to see Jenni and Amber tomorrow night.  It's been awhile since I've seen Amber, and probably a few years since I've seen Jenni!  The Pink Ladies live!haha  The wedding is sure to be a blast as well.  It promises to be a good time, and lots of drinking will be had by many.  Anyway, on a bonus side to coming home early, I'll get to see the last season premier of Friends-second favorite show next to Sex.  I went to Jewel (the Winn-Dixie of Chicago for ya Southerners) and got some Campbell's Chicken Noodle.  That really does make ya feel better.  It's a miracle in a can.  I have plans for the left over can as well.  Let's just say it'll go with my "pop art" theme.hehe  I'm going to go for now.  I'll update Sunday night or Monday about the wedding of the year.haha  FYI, Terry and Joe wedding of 2003. Amber and Brandon wedding of 2004.  Matt and Lauren wedding of 2005.  Ghee, guess I can't get married til at least 2006.haha   Anyway, ciao for now!

      Blah, it's been too slow at work lately.  Hopefully, it'll be better today and tomorrow.  Not too much has been going on lately.  Interesting work story from the weekend.  I think I need to be a stylist!  I'll get to that in two seconds.  Anyway, I was helping a guest.  She tried on a dress, and I thought it looked really nice on her.  She goes back in her room to try on some more stuff, and I walk away to do something else.  I come back to check on her, and this lady is telling her this skirt looks horrible on her, it cuts her off.  I assume she's with her, like a mom (since this lady was older) or friend giving her opinion.  Then my guest comes to me and asks me who that lady was.  Apparently this lady told my guest that dress looked horrid on her as well.  My guest was upset.  I tell her I don't know, and I had kinda assumed they wer together.  A tad later, I find out this lady is a stylist who was there shopping with a client.  Okay, this lady had absolutely no room to talk.  She looked horrible herself.  I don't like to knock peoples style, but this lady for being a stylist had none.  So, I tell my guest and we have a good laugh.  Anyway, it was annoying and I felt bad for Ebonie who had to help the stylist and her client.  I just couldn't believe the nerve of that lady, just totally dissing random people.  Anyway, sorry had to vent about that whole thing.  This weekend I have to go back to the Bend, and I'm actually really looking forward to it.  My aunt is getting remarried.  Friday, I'm going with some of my gals from back home to our hs football game.  We're playing a big rival, and it's some kinda of alumni thing to celebrate St. Joe's 50th anniversary.  Then we'll hit Hacienda and have a lovely margarita or two probably:)  Sat is the big wedding.  It should be very interesting, to say the least.  Two families that like to drink and party coming together as 1.  A good time should be had.  Everything is gonna be at my aunt's house, which is kinda on the small side.  Well, she's expecting 200 people.  I don't know where they are all gonna fit!  It should be interesting.  So look forward to an update on that:)  Plus, sometime when I'm home I gotta find time to get a ride on Vince's new Harley V-rod.  God, it looks and sounds like a hot bike.  Even better than a Ducati!  I just hope my little Nola behaves herself while I'm gone.hehe  Gotta get some lunch and head off to work soon.  Ciao for now!

      Okay, I have to work tomorrow morning and am tired, so decided to stay in tonight.  I caught the last hour of the Ms. America pageant.  I'm in shock and awe.haha  Supposedely this is more prestigious than the Ms. USA pageant.  It's not a beauty pageant, but a scholarship competition ya know.haha  Some things just struck me as crazy, though.  A part of the contest I caught was a US history contest.  Okay, I'll admit some of the questions I wasn't quite sure of the answer.  I didn't know the name of the Secretary of Labor.  But you'd be amazed at some of the stuff some of them didn't know.  One of the questions was about who said "Give me liberty or give me death."  I've known since like grade school that was Patrick Henry.   I just couldn't believe they didn't all know that.  Also, the plastic smiles on their faces was scary.  Another realization hit me tonight, part of this contest (any pageant for that matter) is about pose.  If that is the case, why does the winner always freak out?  Even if it is their life long dream, ya'd think they'd be posed and controlled.haha I really am not anti-pageant.  If they want to do it, that's their deal.  In fact, I loved watching them growing up.  I still kinda do, otherwise I wouldn't have had it on tonight.  Maybe I'm just in a kinda cynical mood, since I'm exhausted.  Anyway, I just felt like writing about this all.  Ciao for now!

      Sorry I haven't posted in awhile, but not much has really been going on.  I've basically been busy working.  The infamous H and M opened up on Michigan Ave.  I went with a few people from work on Saturday.  It's pretty cool, but there is almost too much stuff to look at.  I got a prety cool Mod style dress, but I might return it.  I figure that money would be better in my darkroom fund.  I don't know!  I was a good girl and went to Church on Sunday.  I registered with a Parish.  My mom would be so proud.  She was very excited to hear I went to Church on my own.  The last few days at work have been slow, but I manged some good numbers:)  I'm looking forward to Thursday.  This is for everyone.  I think I mentioned something about Field's undergoing major renovations.  Well, let me explain a little better.  Field's is taking a major risk, and doing something no department store has ever done.  They are doing a bunch of little shops within shops.  Yeah, I even have a little Laundry shop:)  It's pretty damn amazing actually.  We even have a GM concept car area.  Many things are exclusive to Field's State St.  We carry somethings ya can't find anywhere else in the US.  So, Thursday is the Grand Reopening.  It's even gonna be televized on Good Morning America.  So those of ya that can, watch it!  The night is gonna be like a huge party.  They are gonna be passing around drinks and hors douvers (sp-too tired to spell right tonight)  Plus, gonna have some live bands going.  I'm pretty damned psyched, and it should hopefully mean some good money.  Tonight was pretty cool, too.  I helped this one girl, who's a doorwomen at this cool club Domaine.  I've never been, cuz I hear it's pretty expensive.  SHe gave me her card, said to stop by and she'd hook me up:)  I love connections.hehe  Anyway, I'm tired.  Still studying my darkroom book:)  Ciao for now.

      Yesterday was an okay day at work.  After work I went with Geri to Barney's.  Ugh, love that store.  I just wish I had the money to spend there.  So many beautiful things.  There was this absolutely gorgeous sweater, kinda like something you'd find in your grandma's closet, but it cost like $700.  Ughhhh  Then we went to Chipotle's for some chips and salsa.  Yummy!  Even the mild salsa is somewhat spicy.  I'm not used to spicy food too much anymore, so my tummy got kinda funny, but nothing bad.  Man, got me thinking though about how I miss New Orleans food.  Nothing tops a good crawfish boil.  However, next time I am in New Orleans I'm due a very nice dinner at Alex's dad's place.   Alex dared to challenge me on Sex and the City today.  Alex baby, you so should've known better.  So anyway, a wager was placed and I won.  So now, next time I'm in the Big Easy I'll have a lovely dinner at Alex Patouts:)  Today was day off.  I didn't do too much, really.  It's damn humid here today, so my allergies acted up again.  Growl, just when I thought I was better.  Damn hayfever season!  Had to go to my Osco's and get some Claritin.  Can't think of too much else to write right now.  Gotta go read my book on darkrooms!hehe  Ciao for now.

      Kinda a lot to write about, but I'm gonna try not to make this too long.  Yesterday I went to Indianapolis.  Anne-Marie's dad was in town for a conference.  He had never been to the Speedway, so we went down there to check it out.  It's about three hours away.   It was kinda weird, being stuck in a car with a friends dad for that long, but not too horrid.  It was really nice to see him again.  I just wish we could've met up with Anne-Marie.  I think it's been almost 3 years since we've seen each other.  The trip was pretty uneventful.  It was just weird being in Indiana again.  It's so close, yet it feels like a whole different world to me.  I dont' belong there.  That's not my life.  It may have helped make me who I am, but I am not Indiana.  If that makes any sense.  Hopefully y'all understand.  I do.  So that was yesterday.  Oh yeah, my Fighting Irish won yesterday!  I luv Ty.hehe  I had today off of work.  I was excited, Packers first game.  Damn Favre, he couldn't throw for shit.  He better wake up!  It seemed like he could not complete a pass for the life of him.   They can loose one game, but better not let too many more slip by.  Ugh, being a Packer fan is exhausting.  As to Matty's comment about them winning a lot, here's what I got to say.  Yeah, it's true since the Favre era GB has been doing really well.  Even a Superbowl:)  However, not too long before that the Packers basically sucked.  Yet, my family still rooted for them.  Yeah, call me a cheesehead if ya want, I don't give a damn.  Cheesehead and proud of it!  At least the Bears got creamed.  My poor Saints lost as well. I spent today being lazy, watching TV.  I was a little productive, though.  Sex and the City made me cry.  Carrie has basically given up on Mr. Big.  She can't!  Those two are meant to be.  I am too emotionally involved in that show.  Maybe a few of ya out there understand.  If not, it's my little secret:)  Oh yeah, it's because of the shoes.hehe  Oh, I got some excellant news, at least for me.  I've told a few of ya out there.  I've done some research, and well I can make a darkroom for like 200-300 dollars.  I thought the enlarger alone would be like 500.  Go me!  I'll soon be ready to kick some Avedon ass!  Ciao for now!

      I always knew South Bend raised nothing but "freaks."  I just learned Michael Alig was from South Bend.  For those of ya that don't know who he is, he is the big "club kid" from NYC that became famous for all his crazy costumes and entourages.  Vanessa, don't let Patrick stay there too long!!!!

      Warning, I have a feeling this is gonna be a long and rambling post.  My allergies are somewhat better, but still taking medicine so I'm kinda out there (more so than usual) right now.  Today was one of the better days at work I've had in awhile.  It was still slow, but I have my reasons.  There was lots of eye candy today:)  The Diesel rep, Freddy, was in today.  Oh my, he is one of the hottest guys I've seen in awhile.  Too bad he lives in New York:(  Then the cute Diesel wearing security guy and I talked a bit.  I still don't know his damn name!  Okay, I don't know what it is, but damn Diesel jeans just make a guy look oh so yummy.  Girls out there, I highly recomend ya spend the money and get a pair for your guy.  They are expensive (about 120 a pair) but well worth it.  Yum, yum give me some.  I went throught my surfer guy phase, the Italian phase, so I guess I must be on a Diesel jean phase.  Although, Mark Schwab (had surfer look down to a T) is still the hottest guy I have ever seen in person.  He was divine, absolutely divine.  He could've worn $1 jeans, and still...And to think he probably liked me too, and I blew it.  A certain assholio (hehe) named Louis told me Mark was a jerk, so I backed away.  I shouldn't have listened.  Maybe he was, but I shouldnt' have taken his word as gold, and I should have found out for myself.  Couldn't hurt a girl to be seen hanging around the hottest guy then at Tulane.  Ugh, after he graduated no guy there compared.  I think that's one of the few regrets I have from Tulane.  Kinda crazy, I know.  But I digress.  Anyway, Freddy was here, cuz we are doing a little Diesel kboutique thing in the store, and he was there to oversee it.  I've only seen him once before, so I want them to build a Diesel shop all the time!  He asked when I first got there if I remembered him, and I wanted to be like "hell yeah!"  It was slow, so I got to spend lots of quality time looking at him.haha  He has this unique look, kinda the cute dork look/italian look.  I don't know.  Wow, I wrote a lot about him, but I'm not that crazy over him.  It just made the day a little brighter!  Then I hung with Geri over lunch.    Watch for her, cuz Geri I expect great things from ya gal.  Ya better, cuz ya said ya'd hook me up with some of your stuff.hehe  Oh yeah, she's a fashion design student-graduating later this month.   So that as well made for a good day.  Let's see what else...Okay, so I don't want to be doing my job the rest of my life, so I've been giving thought to what I'd really like to do.  There are two things...becoming a buyer or a fashion photography.  I don't think I mentioned, but at my Aunt's wedding, I'm the photographer.  I'm so afraid I'm gonna fuck up.  I shouldn't but still.  I've been reading this book I have on photography to see if I can get any new tips.  So far nada, but I just started.  Anyway, I'm gonna start looking into going back to school next fall for photography.  Columbia College (here in Chi-town) has a really good department I hear.  I can't imagine the Art Institute being all that bad either.  Geri, if ya are reading this, does your school have a photo dept?  Just leave a comment, if ya don't mind.  I'm pretty confidant in my composing and developing bilities, but I have no studio experience.   I need to learn how to use that lighting and all that kinda stuff.  There's two cool magazines around Chicago-Chicago Social and Chicago Scene.  I'm thinking of trying to contact their photographers and see if maybe I could shadow a shoot or something.  I was suppose to be off tomorrow, but I'm gonna go in sometime in the afternoon for some even their having.  Shayna, my manager, said I should make good money.  I gotta stick around and wait for UPS.  I'm expecting several things.  Then I'll hit the office.haha   Sorry this was so long, but that's all for now.   Gonna go watch I am Sam.

      This damn dreary weather has definitely given me a case of the blahs.  Why does weather have this kinda effect?  I think I should listen to Audrey.  The only solution to a case of the mean reds (aka the blahs) is a trip to Tiffany's!  Work dragged forever.  It was super slow.  Hopefully tomorrow will be better.  Nothing else to really talk about.  Ciao for now!

      So today begins just like most days.  I go to work, and walk into the building.  This is were things get messed up.  I walk into the store and Christmas stuff is all over already!  Okay, I know I'm in the retail world, and Christmas starts early for retail, but this is a bit much.  Let Halloween get over with first, at least.  So then I'm on the phone with my mom tonight.  The neighbors have their Christmas tree up already.  Not only that, but Toni (my bro's wife) has her Christmas shopping down already!  I just can't believe it.  I'm gonna be sick of Christmas by the time Thanksgiving roles around.  Hopefully, the holiday money will start kicking in:)  Anyway, don't know what else to write.  Don't wanna get emotional today.haha   Ciao for now!

      Y'all would be so proud.  Your Polish Princess has finally learned how to make the Polish noodles.  Yummy!  For those of ya that don't know, they are just about the bestest thing in the whole wide world.  The Church my family belongs to, also has reception hall (where Amber will have her reception.)  They do the Polish buffet better than any place on earth.  I could eat those noodles and chicken til the cows come home.  Mine didn't quite compare to St. Hedwigs, but I imagine after another attempt or two they should be pretty darn close.   My grandpa would be proud, because that is something my grandma (the best cook ever) does not even know how to make.  I also feel good for taking an interest in my heritage.  Ya can make all the Polish jokes ya want, but we know how to cook!      Sunday was my Al gal's birthday.  Damn are we getting old.  It seems like just yesterday we were sitting in her dorm room, drinkng Mt. Dew and watching Days of Our Lives.  Or else taking turns going to the different sections of biology, so we could go lay out:)  We don't keep in touch as much as I would like, but she is still my best friend and I love her to death.  Shortly after we met, I went through the worst time ever in my life.  She was there for me like no one else, even though we just met.  I will forever be grateful she's in my life and she'll always be my best friend.  I doubt ya will read this girl, but I luvs ya and miss ya!  Geez, my entries have been soppy lately.  Maybe it's getting extremely close to the 2-5 that is making me emotional and reflective.haha    Ciao for now!

      Reflection Okay, some of ya reading this may have no clue what I"m talking about.  I do want those to know what I'm talking about to hear/read this though.  I had this weekend off, so quite a bit of time to kill.  I went through and read a lot of the blogs I haven't read in awhile.  I must say, it made me nostalgic reading all the entries about Tioga.  I'm glad to hear Tulane's club is still going!  My years in CKI meant so much to me, and helped me form into the person I am today.  At times I wonder, and maybe only a handful of ya will understand this, how my life would be today if that van hadn't broken down in Jackson.  That can definitely be defined as a turning point in my life.  CKI taught me a lot.  It taught me the value of service, the value of friendship, and the value of believing in myself.  It really helped form me into a better person.  A lot of people I met had a great impact in my life.   I feel I need to give some shotouts here.  Beth, what can I say but I luvs ya.  We went on some wild rides together and thankfully our friendship has flourished.  If we can survive the election of 2002, we can survive anything.haha  Flanders, your Jezebel will always have a soft spot in her heart for you.  Long walks on the moonlight beach...romp in the hotel room.LOL  Matty, and to think our friendship began over discussion of a "fucking kiss" and finding a half naked guy in Beth's closet, not to mention the dreaded knee tickle...Ted, we drove each other insane at times.  I know we don't keep in touch much anymore, but I'm the better for knowing ya.  Alex, my coonass, my Austin.  I think our friendship has gone through everything a friendship can.  I'm proud of what you have done with your life.  I don't know what else to say Alex, just remember your Payless promise to me!  Don't feel because I didn't mention you, ya aren't important.  I love all my CKI buds deeply.  You are all such wonderful people, never forget it!  Okay, sorry to be so cheesy.   Does anyone know how to get ahold of Songy?  I'd love to say hello and see what that crazy cajun is up to.  Although, I must admit I'm somewhat disappointed to learn it's kinda calmed down some.  I loved the craziness.  I'm sure it still attracts great and wonderful people, though.  Luvs y'all!!!  I do just have one question-does the Circle K hook-up still exist?  haha

       Business first, haha, sign up for friendster.  I guess some people have been objecting, cuz they see it as a dating service.  I guess that kinda is one intention, but I was doing it to kinda experiment in the six degrees theory.  So, join today.haha  Last night, for some damn reason, I didn't sleep well at all.  I so hate that!  I had no energy when I woke, so I called in work for the first time ever.  I went to the thing at the Mart, called StyleMax.  It was alright. Pretty cool getting to see stuff before most people.  So, other than that, I've pretty much been spending quality time on the couch.  Currently, I'm watching a kinda dumb movie, Super Mario Bros.  However, it did make me think about a couple things.  Observation 1, John Leguizamo is great actor, even a decent job in this.  I think he's way under-rated.  He can play anything from a video game character to a messed-up, dwarfed artist.  He should've gotten the Oscar for that!  Observation 2, the great days of video games are over.  Atari and classic Nintendo were simply the best.  Give me Qbert or (haha) the original Super Mario Bro any day.  I think I need to check out ebay, see what old atari systems are going for.  Anyway, must get back to the couch.  Oh, hot Diesel rep will be making an appearance at work tomorrow:)  Ciao for now!

      Okay, I think I got y'all out there invited to join, but if not, ya better sign up for friendster.com.  It's pretty cool.  It just takes a few to sign up.  It's somewhat hard to explain, but it's kinda a six degrees of seperation experiment.  I heard about it on the news, but I think Jeri told me about it before.  Sign up!  If I somehow missed ya, leave a comment and I'll get it to ya.  Anyway, have today off so just chilling.  I was suppose to go to the Merchandise Mart to check out Laundry's Spring collection.  However, Yvonne has appointments all day, so I have to go before work tomorrow.  Ugh!  That means getting up about an hour earlier.  Grumble....It's weird.  I'll just be chilling out, vegging out on a tv show then I see clothes we sell on TV and it makes me think of work.  The clothes in my area are pretty trendy and popular, so pop up on TV a lot-anywhere from soap operas to Trading Spaces!  It's kinda cool.  Oh, new Laundry by Shelli Segal stuff came in-the holiday line.  The new Laundry by Shelli Segal stuff is hot!  I want it all.  I just can't wait til they send me a piece or two of it.  Anyway, gonna get.  Remember to sign up on friendster!  Ciao for now!

      Okay, I take back what I said last night.  After a good (somewhat) night's sleep, I've decided to pull for the Marlins.  They deserve it.  They have a great young team.  Beckett is an amazing pitcher, especially for only being 20. Although, admittingly I probably won't watch it now.  Which is good, as I've spent too much time glued to the TV watching baseball.   As sad as I am for the Cubbies, if they can't win one of 2 games in their home field, with using two of their best pitchers, they don't deserve to go to the World Series.  I look forward to great things next year.  As for that fan, I do feel bad for him.  I feel most people in his shoes would've done the same.  If ya look at the footage everyone else around him was trying to get the ball as well.  He got caught in the moment, and did something stupid.  Although, it goes to figure he's a Notre Dame alum.haha  Anyway, off to work.  Ciao for now!

      Argh, both my teams lost today.  Can't get to mad at the Pack, the Chiefs are undefeated, so a good team.  I really wish the Cubbies had won, but I somehow knew it wasn't gonna happen.  My theory is they wanna win it home in Chicago on Tuesday.  The pitcher the Marlins had in today was nothing short of awesome!  Oh well, hopefully within 48 hours the Cubs will be on their way to the World Series!  Anyway, had a nice and very lazy weekend off.  Spent lots of quality time with my TV.haha  I saw The Ring for the first time, creepy!  I had planned to give my apartment a really thorough cleaning this weekend, but the couch was just calling my name.  I have Tuesday off, so I'll definitely clean then.  I've been thinking of changing my hair color lately.  I'm getting bored.  Right now, it's just got highlights in it.  I think most of ya have seen it like that at one point or another.  I'm kinda thinking about going a dark brown.  Give me your feedback!  Gotta get to bed soon.  Being lazy is hard work.haha  Ciao for now!

      I don't know what team is worse being a fan of the Packers or the Cubbies.  Both have a tendency for nail bitters.  I almost had a heart attack watching last night's game.  It was very stressful to watch.  Thankfully, the Cubbies pulled it off.  I admittingly didn't pay a ton of attention until the post season, but I had never heard anything about Lofton until the post season.  Man, he is nothing short of awesome.  He has a way of making it happen for the Cubs, either getting an important catch or getting home.  Lofton for MVP!  There is one thing that annoys me about baseball, though.  Okay, so a foul usually counts as a strike unless there are already 2 strikes.  My gosh, sometimes a person could've been out three times!  One thing I saw happen confused me, though.  Maybe a sports enthuisist out there can explain.  A Marlin player had 2 strikes.  Then he swung and missed, which I thought that meant he'd be out.  Instead, he was able to run to first.  What's up with that?  Going to go and continue being a lazy bum on my day off.  I'll have to be pretty productive tomorrow and clean and stuff.  Oh joy!  Ciao for now!

      Pretty boring day at work today.  We did get some yummy pizza for a contest thingy we won.  There was also some filming going on, but no one got to see any of it.  The lovely Gwenyth (Ms. Paltrow to you) was filming for her new movie.  It took place in the 28 Shop.  For those of ya not familar with Fields, I'll explain.  The 28 Shop is right near by my department, but in reality it's kinda a million miles away.  The Shop is where all the really expensive stuff is.  Amie, that's where I showed ya and we touched the $5,000 dress.  Part of her movie Proof is being shot around Chicago.  It sounds like an awesome cast-Anthony Hopkins and Jake Gellenhal (sp) are also in it.  It was totally closed off, though.  Not only was temporary wall built up so ya couldn't see anything, but there was also security standing by that wall.  Anyway, it'll be interesting to see it, see the 28 Shop on the big screen, although I see it almost everyday.  Otherwise, work was dead. It's been realllllly slow the last few weeks.  Not good!  I"ve been told it should pick up real soon for Christmas already.  Anyway, tired so gonna watch the rest of ER and go to sleepy sleep so I can do it all over again.  Oh, Geri congrats on you new position with Pink!  Hook me up girl!  Gooooo Cubs!  Ciao for now!

      I know I haven't written as much as I usually do, but I've been busy.  Busy doing what ya may ask.  I have been busy watching my Cubbies kick some booty.  Right now they are beating those fish 8-0.  If they blow it tonight, I will so be not happy.  So let me give one big GOOOO Cubbies!  Last night I had to stay up later than I intended.  I had to watch the Cubbies blow it in over time.  ARGH.  There's still hope!  "I believe in 2003."  I also was addicted to cnn.com.  I was constanstly refreshing the home page iwth the California recall results.  I must say, go Arnie!  I am sure some of ya are probably freaking, but I think he'll do a good job.  Can't do any worse!  I'm quite impressed with his cabinet pick of Warren Buffet as financial advisor.  Ya can't go wrong with that!  Maybe Bush needs to recruit Buffet.  Anyway.  Yeah.

      That post below is lyrics from my favorite song "La Vie Boheme" from Rent.  It's an 8.5 min song, and I know it pretty much by heart.  That musical brings outall the emotions in me!  Anyway, good sports day.  ND didn't play, so that means they couldn't lose.haha  Packers wamped Seatle.  I didn't get to watch it, wasn't on TV here.  URGH!  It was suppose to be on Fox, but Fox had Cops on. Double URGH!  So Matty, what's up with that?haha  Then "Cubs win, Cubs win!"  I think I'll have a heart attack if they make to the series.  They just need to let Woods and Prior pitch every game.hehe  Anyway, I plan on getting a Cubs shirt tomorrow.  I'm not a late fan!  I've been rooting for them the last couple years.  GOOOOOOO (or should I say Geaux) Cubs!

      Had a good day at work today, for the first time in a long time.  Thank goodness I actually had a nice sales day, for the first time in a long time!  Things have been slow the last couple weeks,but that's not the only good reason.  Matty likes to boast about how well he is doing at Fox, so I'm gonna do the same for a brief moment.  Two Laundry by Shelli Segal (gonna try to get an ad for them again.hehe) bigwigs were in today.  One was our account executive, whose responsible for getting us our clothes and allowing us to carry as much Laundry by Shelli Segal.  Yvonne's, my rep and kinda sorta not really my boss,  boss was there as well.  Both were really nice, and seemed impressed.  It wasn't until later I found out just how impressed.  They told my real boss Shayna this was their best store, even better than Neimans!  I like to think it has a little to do with the kickass specialist they have for Laundry by Shelli Segal at Fields.hehe  Yes Vanessa, I do my job much better now that we have a real space!  So good sales and a great compliment from the higher ups!  Puts a smile on my face I tell ya.  Also, got a pair of $315 pants for $27!  Gonna go get some dinner and watch Must See TV!

      Last night was interesting, and I learned a little about myself.  I found out there was a YSL (Yves Saint Laurent) party at Domaine (hot club) after work.  I was under the impression it was a little training session, then free drinks and a goody bag.  The goody bag made the decision to go easy.hehe  So I get to Domaine.  It ends up this is a fragrance launch party!  I get there about when it's suppose to start, and most people are already on their third mini bottle of champagne.  I felt kinda outta place.  I wasn't that dressed up, cuz I didn't know about it, and everybody else seemed to know everyone.  I realized my social skills suck.  I didn't have the nerve to go up and mingle with people.  I never realized I was that much of an introvert.  Crazy!  So anyway, the training thing was just like a 2 min little speech by the YSL regional guy.  So, I drank a mini bottle or two of Moet myself.  Champagne is definitely my weakness.  So yummy.  I didn't feel that buzzed at first, but I got home and was totally messed up.  It was crazy.  The goody bag was pretty good, though.  It's two full-sized bottles of parfum/cologne-his and hers.  Not to shabby.  Domaine is really cool.  I so want to go back.  Any Chicago folks out there up for that?  I also learned I need to try and be more outgoing in circumstances like that.   I had today off, so spent a far amount of time being productive.  Although, I did also spend a far amount of time on the couch:)  Gotta go watch my Cubbies!  Ciao for now!

      Okay, this may be rambling, because I am bored and have quite a bit of time to kill before hitting the town.  Today was a good day, the first real good day in a long time.  First, and maybe most importantly (hehe,) it was a good hair day!  I even got lots of random compliments.  Craziness.  I had to take a pair of jeans to work to get altered today.  FYI, Paper and denim for $16!  Edith, the alterations lady, said "Oh, Jessica looking so sexy today in her jeans."hehe  Kinda funny coming from a middle aged Asian woman with a thick accent.  I don't mean that demeaning or anything, it was just cute for some reason.  I think I would've laughed if anyone said that to me.  Plus, we were actually busy today!  It's been really slow lately, not good!  Now, I plan on going for a nice little chill drink at my local bar.  Bar on Buena is just a cute little place to go and chill.  Plus, it's like a block away!  It almost kinda reminds me of the Boot.  Maybe I should get a Woo Woo for old times sake!hehe  Thanks Alex for reminding me of that lovely drink, as I have taken to Cosmos in the last few years.         Okay, now my thoughts on Jacko.  I gotta put my two cents in.  Geez, can't a weird ass glove wearing dude just be left alone!  Just kidding.  First of all, we must remember innocent until proven guilty.  Although, his behavior would leave few surprised if he is found guilty.  I just watched a Dateline special on this tonight, yeah I'm bored.  Jacko would give his "kids" parents his credit cards and let them do whatever.  While the parents were living it up on Jacko, Jacko would...uh....entertain the children.  I found that very interesting!  Apparently, he woos the children and parents.  Absolute and utter craziness!  Let's say he is innocent for a second.  He is still a very strange dude.  If I found out Vince and Toni left my lovely niece alone with Jacko, I would kick their asses.  They could normally probably kill me, but I'd be sooo upset with them I could take them.  I know I"m not a parent, and not in these parents shoes, but I don't think there is any way in hell I'd let my kid be alone with him for a sec.  It'll be interesting to see how this unfolds, especially since his lawyer is also the "alleged" murderer Scott Peterson attorney.  Okay, yeah sorry I know what I just said innocent until...I heard on the Today show some of this lawyers past clients, I don't remember any others now, but they are a very sleazy, I mean illustrious group.  Okay, nuff of dat.       Also, on a lighter/fluffier note.  I broke down and bought the new Britney cd.  Okay, make fun if ya want, I'll let ya.  I haven't listened to it all quite yet.  From what I've heard, I really like it.  There's a few really hot songs on it.  Breathe on Me is awesome.  If ya are the downloading type, I would suggest hooking it up.  I'm not a huge fan of Britney herself, but I do like her music.  I don't see anything wrong with some good, ol' fashioned senseless pop music.  But I do wanna add, my music taste does go outside of the mainstrean.  One of my favorite groups is New York Dolls.  If ya know who they are, you are amazing, comment and ya will get a prize.hehe  Okay, now I'm not promising it'll be super cool.hehe  NO GOOGLING EITHER!  So almost time for TLC "What Not To Wear"  That's another Jessica fave.  Ciao a tutti!

      Urgh to stupidity!  I'm watching MTV"s Rich Girls, the show with Tommy Hilfigers daughter and her best friend.  Okay, I know they've probably lived a really sheltered life, so I'm trying to be some what sympathetic and not too critical.  They pissed me off tonight, though.  Jamie, the best friend, made this comment that really pissed me off for some reason.  Here it is!   "People in the midwest don't buy cargo pants to wear with a cute top and stilletos, like I was going    to tonight.  They buy them, because they need all the pockets to wear to work in the fields." Okay, first of all, people in the midwest know how to work it.  I know plenty of people (myself included) that sport that look.  It's hot!  Secondly, the number of people in the midwest that work in fields is pretty slim.  I don't imagine it being any higher than any other region in the country.   Who knows, maybe it's their age.  I don't remember being that ignorant.  I don't remember anyone else that I associated with being that ignorant.  I would enjoy comments on this.  Am I just over-reacting outta my love for the midwest?  Anyway, ciao a tutti!

      A nice relaxing day off.  It was actually a pretty productive day, but more on that as the days progress.  I got a question for some of ya healthy people out there.  What's a good, healthy snack?  I'm trying to start watching what I eat more.  I've realized I'm not too bad, except for the dreaded late night snack.  Any ideas?  Matty, Amanda?

      So, I've just been chilling today.  I watched the 80s classic, 16 Candles.  I like the movie a lot, but it's kinda whack.  First of all, the character of Long Duck Dong (did I get it right?) is funny, but not very PC.  That somewhat bothered me.  While we all root for Jake and Samantha to get together, Jake does something very dickish.  He sets up the Anthony Michael Hall charater to sleep with his still girlfriend.  Not very cool!  That really bothered me.  Congrats to my Packers for a nice win today!  Even if Gruden is a South Bend boy, I'm not a fan.  This win was all important to keep the Pack alive and well for the Playoffs.  I hope Favre's thumb gets better!  I was cheering them on from my couch with my lovely jersey on.  Cheesehead and proud!  Anyway, not too sure what else to write.  Oh, getting my hair cut tomorrow.  Just a trim, since I have some lovely split ends.  If anyone wants to know what to get me for Christmas, the Split Ender would be nice.haha  Ciao for now!

      Okay, gonna make this short.  I want to address a couple things about the entry below.  No, Matt was not the gentleman!  Yes, that alcohol comment was a joke!  Okay, now that that's outta the way...Thanks for all the Happy Birthdays!  It makes me feel loved.  I miss y'all.  My social life here is still building, and I have not formed the bonds with people yet like I have with many of the SJH gang and the CKI crew.  Thanks for making me feel loved, and I miss ya more than ya can imagine.  Today was the big day, don't feel any older.  Although, I am closely approaching old fartdom.  I didn't get to go out tonight, cuz I had to work til close, and I have to open tomorrow.  Tomorrow I should be getting a little drink on though:)  Matty, 25 really isn't sooo bad I guess...Anyway...Ciao for now!

      So, I was talking to a certain gentleman (who shall remain nameless) the other day.  He happens to mention, he racked up quite a high debt on internet porn.  I won't say how much, but it would have been enough for a pair of my beloved Blahniks.  I point this out to him.  He then responds, "If I did buy them for you, would you sleep with me?"  I reply, "Nooooooo!  That would make me a whore, and I only sleep with guys that buy me a ton of alcohol."haha

      It was a nice trip home, with one exception.  I was on the train ride to S. Bend.  One of the stops is Gary, IN.  Gary is a dirty city (steel mills cause it) and the people kinda tend to be as well-dirty and mean.  I know that's a generalization, but it's pretty true.  I'm sure there are decent people there, though.  Anyway, a guy gets on there.  The train has luggage racks above the seats, so he buts his bag up there right above me.  As he is doing that, though, he has no concept of other people.  His coat keeps hitting my face, and he recks (sp) of smoke.  So, I look at him and say (nicely) excuse me.  He then replies real snottily,"excuse me."  I go back to reading my magazine and listening to my cds.  He then goes to sit across the aisle next to his girlfriend or whatever and I hear him say, "Bitch."  Ugh, I so wanted to say something, but decided to be the bigger person.  Ya just gotta love the human race at times!  Anyway, nice trip home.  Had a nice coffee with Amber.   Saturday, got a tiny bit of Christmas shopping done, and then family came over for Vince's and mine birthdays.  My aunt got me a crock pot, so now i just need to learn how to cook with it!hehe  Sunday visited with Grandma and then went on a little nature walk with some of the family.  Yeah, that was Ben's idea.  When we got home, I tried making my noodles again.  Oh my, they turned out sooooo good.  They totally tasted like St. Hedwigs!  Mom was quite impressed, and I was impressed with myself I must say.  It was such a nice little trip, I stayed a little longer than planned.  I was gonna leave Sunday evening, but left Monday morning.  I had today off.  I was worried about that cat.  I was so afraid I'd come home to a turn up apartment.  She was so good!  I'm proud of my little Nola.haha  I guess that's about it for now.  I'm gonna check out that Average Joe show tonight.  I saw the girl on an interview, and she actually seems pretty intelligent.  Maybe that will give me comment material tomorrow.  Ciao for now!

      Okay, I'm gonna try to lighten this up, but I'm glad I was able to inspire some great discussion.  I will have to agree wtih Paul, I feel mature.haha  My birthday is the 14th, so I'm going home this weekend.  It should be pretty nice and chill.  Friday is gonna be a crazy day though.  I'm gonna have to get up around 6:30, cuz I have to be at work for 8!  Ugh, I never have to go in that bloody early.  Then I have to make sure to get outta there right on time.  After I leave work, I have to rush home eat some dinner and grab my bags.  Then I gotta go catch my train for what is one of the most boring 2.5hours.  Ugh, I dread the train.  Then, Amber is meeting me at the airport and we're gonna get a drink or something.  Yeah, it's gonna be a long day.  THe fact that Indiana is an hour later is gonna make it seem even longer.  But fortunately, the rest of the weekend should be pretty chill.  It'll be nice to see the fam.  Absence makes the heart grow fonder.haha  Hopefully, get a present or two and some much needed cash.  That's about all the good this birthday is to me.  I do not wanna turn 25!  UGH!  Anyway, Ciao for now!

      Ghee, that book is sure getting lots of press lately.  I'm sure the author is loving it!  Anyway, watching the Tonight Show right now, and Leno is even joking about it.  "If Jesus was married, what would their arguments be like?"hehe   I read all the comments on Amanda's blog, and am gonna comment on them here.  I agree, if a book can make ya lose your faith, it wasn't very strong to begin with.  Yeah, there are some women heroines, but generally I think women get kinda a bad wrap in the Bible-starting from the moment we're made outta a rib!  Granted, I find this theory very interesting, but what does it really change?  I must say add something interesting here.  I went to the Library yesterday as well, to get the book.  It was out.  I talked to the librarian to reserve a copy.  Her response, "This book has been really popular.  I think people just like to see the Church brought down."  How exactly does this bring the Church down?  In the report I watched last night on it, they mentioned the Gnostic (sp) Gospels.  They are books the Church decided to omit from the bible.  I remember learning a little about these in H.S.  I wanna find out if they are available in a book or anything to read.  I bet there are some interesting stories in there.  Anyway, can't wait to read this book to really see what it's all about.  Oh, one thing the report did mention, and I also did a report about it back in the days at St. Joseph's HS (Catholic) there is ABSOLUTELY no biblical evidence Mary Magdalene was a prostitute.  The introduction of Mary just happened to come after the story of "Let he among us..." where Jesus saves a prostitute from being stoned.  Other evidence points to the fact that she was very important to Jesus, maybe not wife.  She was the first person he appeared.  I think Mary Magdalene is probably one of the most ill-portrayed people in history.  Geesh, I almost wrote in fiction there!  Anyway once again, sorry to get religiously.  I'm just really intriqued by all this.  I'd love a time machine to go back and see what really happened.hehe  Sorry if I bored some of ya.  I'll try not to be so preachy.hehe   I am a survivor of Catholic school, though.hehe  Ciao for now!

      I had today off, and it ended up being pretty thought provoking.  I recently found some Blockbuster giftcards, I forgot about.  I went there today, intending to get Lord of the Rings to see what the big deal is.  They only had one copy, and it was out.  I ended up getting The Pianist.  It was so good, it blew me away.  Adrian Brody definitely deservec the Oscar.  I imagine he went through a rough time filming that.  Now, I've read Anne Frank and seen Schindler's list, but it never quite brought the reality and horror of the Holocaust home to me.  I was younger then, so that probably had something to do iwth it though.  This movie made me realize how horrible it was for many, and not just those sent to the concentration camps-labor camps my ass.  This movie and a childhood memory kinda made it seem more real (for lack of a better phrase.)  A lot of ya probably know when I was younger, I was fortunate enough to travel to many cool places.  I was about 4 years old, and we went to Germany.  It was still East and West Germany then.  We visited one of the camps, Dachau.  I remember seeing this big ovens and saying something like, "Well, at least they ate well."  I think then one of my parents tried explaining what those ovens were really used for-getting rid of the bodies.  But how does one explain that to a four year old exactly?  Crazy the stuff ya remember.  Then I watched a special on The Da Vinci Code.  For those of ya that don't know, it's a theory that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married and there was a secret society to protect that secret.  Leonardo was supposedely a member.  It's a very interesting theory.  I want to read the book now.  Now remember, I am a born and breed Catholic.  Honestly though, I don't see what the huge deal is.  If Jesus was married and heaven forbid had sex, what difference would that really make to our faith?  We are to believe that Jesus was human afterall.  A priest, from ND actually, was on and basically said the same thing.  Should this theory ever be proven correct, it would not do a thing to change my faith.  Anyway, sorry to get all religiousy, but it's whats on my mind right now.  I've written enough.  Ciao for now!

      Happy New Year!  I had a great Christmas, and I hope y'all did as well.  So, tonight is New Year's Eve in Chicago, and what am I doing?  I, unfortunately, am probably just gonna end up chilling at home.  A few friends are going to big club things, and that costs like $100.  I just can't justify spending that much on a night out right now.  I may go to another friends and just hang, but I'm kinda thinking no to that.  Wanna know why?  I have to be at work at 9:30 tomorrow!  That means I have to get up aroun 7:30!  Mental note to self:  If by some forsaken reason I am still at Field's next year-request New Years Day off!  So yeah, welcome to the damn real world.  FYI, MTV's Real World is such a misnomer!  It's not nearly that cool.haha  Anyway, I'm gonna be adding a link here soon.  I'd do it now, but blogger is being dumb and not letting me access my template.   A relative of Amie's, her cousin's 3 year old son, has recently been diagnosed with leukemia.  Her family is organizing a nice and neat sounding fundraising event.  The event is in Conneticut, so I know there is little chance of any of us going to it.  I still wanted to put it on my blog, though.  I don't know if any of ya could maybe find something to donate for the raffle or something.  I basically just wanted to help spread the word.  Hope y'all have a great New Year.  Hopefully, 2004 will kick a little butt!  Oh, Packers kick some booty on Sunday!  Ciao a tutti!

      I've come to a conclusion about cute security guy, who will be here on be referred to as csg.hehe  When leaving for work yesterday, he blocked my way outta the door.  I pushed him aside, and said he better not block my way from getting the heck outta there!  He and I seem to have this very bizarre form of junior high flirting going on, lots of play fighting.  Funny thing is, I never even acted like that in junior high!  So yeah, I still don't even know his bloody name!  If I see him in the next few days, I'm just gonna ask him myself.  Otherwise, I might take the mature route and ask another security person I'm kinda cool with for the 411.  I'm telling yeah, this is the most mature thing I've ever done.haha  But yeah, somehow I'm gonna take a kinda proactive approach.  Anyway, I leave tomorrow night after work for the Bend.  Fun time with the family!  Unfortunately, my brother Ben won't be able to make it in from Florida.  That kidna sucks.  I feel mostly bad for him, but at least his girlfriend is there with him.  I love Christmas, and not just because of the presents, but that's also very cool.  My family has always made a big deal outta it, and it just represents a great time of togetherness.  It's just a fun, nice time.  So at that, I want to wish y'all a Merry Christmas!!!   Wesołych Świąt!  Ciao a tutti!

      Okay, so a pretty good day at work.  We were busy, which made time go by fast.  Vanessa is back in town, so we went to ymmy Mickey D's for lunch.  We both decided we are going to hell.  After work, I'm just kinda chilling around the apartment.  I flip to the Packer game occasionally.  They, at least as of now (halftime) are kicking some Raider ass.  I call my mom, and say something to the affect of what a boring game.haha  My mom then says, "Well, you know why, don't you?"  I don't!  Turns out Brett Favre's dad passed away yesterday in a car accident.  It appears he had a stroke or heart attack.  Tonight Brett seems to be playing of his best games.  Yeah, a day after his dad dies, he's out there playing!  I just can't imagine.  I guess ya gotta do what ya gotta do.  As my mom said, the next few days(especially with the Holidays) will probably be rough.  I just can't even imagine.  Some of you may not know, my freshman year at Tulane my dad passed away.  It was the most horrid time of my life.  I was out of school for maybe a week.  It was rough going back, but ya do have to get on with life.  I just can't even imagine having to, although the coach left it up to Favre, go out and play a pro football game a day later!  Not to mention the fact that he is not just playing, but playing awesome.  I guess he has someone up there looking out for him!  So yeah, I"m all emotional now.haha  I think Favre is awesome, and this just proves his awesomeness (is there such a word) more to me.  On a lighter note, now that his dad is up there looking out for him, does that mean they have a shot at the Super Bowl?haha  Anyway, my thoughts are with the Favres during this sad time, especially during the Holidays.  Ciao a tutti!

      I had today off of work, and was pretty darn productive if I do say so myself.  First of all, no Packer game to watch:(  They are part of Monday Night Football this week.  Go Pack!  I did some grocery shopping, wrapped my presents, did laundry and cleaned my apartment.  Oh, I even gave myself a manicure something I've been bad about lately.  My nails look beautiful now.haha  In between doing all this, I watched the first two LOTR movies.  Sorry folks, but I just can't get too into them.  I don't hate them, butthey just arent' my type of flick I guess.  I'm not anti-action flick, but for some reason it just kinda bored me.  I'll probably check out the new one when it comes out on DVD, though.  Work was crazier than heck on Friday.  I made some good cash money.hehe  Saturday was actually somewhat on the slow side.  It wasn't horribly slow, but I thought it was gonna be crazy.  Oh, I also made yummy chocolate chip cookies today.  We have Secret Santas at work.  Deanna, the girl I have, put homemade chocolate chip on her list.  I got her something else, but decided to make her (and me) some cookies.  They were yummy, but I only ate a few.  There was definitely another benefit to baking, my apartment smelled soooo good.  I think I need to bake more!  There was something else I wanted to write about, but am blanking out now.  Ciao a tutti!

      Ah, so much to update. In news, I am so excited they got Sadam.  Yippeeee.  So, as some of ya may know, Bruno visited this past weekend.  Oh Lord.  I am not quite sure how to write about this.  So, we met up and go to a bar near my apartment.  Okay, mind ya we meet up at 11.  Due to work and being nervous about seeing him, I hadn't eaten since 4:30.  We have a nice time at the bar.  The conversation is going well, especially for not seeing each other in like forever.  I have just two drinks, which normally doesn't really affect me.  Here's were things get kinda fuzzy.  I don't remember walking home from the bar, and don't remember too much what happened afterwords.  Once we are back at my place, I end up throwing up.  It was horrid and embarassing.  I've had that happen a few times, but not often...thankfully.  So he kinda takes care of me, helps me out and thne goes back to his hotel.  I haven't heard from him since.  So, if he's willing to through a five year frienship away because of this, I don't need him in my life.  I realize what I did was not cool, but I wouldn't think it's unforgivable.  So yeah, that's that story.  Then Sunday night Amber came to visit.  It was a really nice visit.  Monday we did a little shopping and enjoyed the Christmas Market on State St.  It's a pretty cool thing.  Monday night, we went to a spa night at Domaine.  Domaine is that really cool club I've written about before.  They turned it into a spa for the night.  So nice!  We get manicures, eyebrow waxing, facials, got our hair styled and make-up down, a massage, and a hand massage.  I don't know if I ever felt so pampered and relaxed in my life.  After Domaine, we went to Whiskey.  That's pretty cool lounge.  I'd never been.  It's a nice place.  I highly recomend the Flirtini.hehe  Cindy Crawford's husband owns it.  We did a little more shopping today.hehe  So, yeah.  It's been quite an interesting last couple days.  Oh yeah, we got our first little snow that stuck the other day.  Fortuntely, it wasn't really more than a light dusting.  Sorry this was so long.  Ciao a tutti!

      There really isn't too much to update with.  My life has been pretty uneventful as of late.  My mom visited on Sunday.  We had a really nice little visit.  I got some cool butterfly ornaments to put on my Christmas tree.  This weekend I'll have another visitor or two, but I'll write more on that later.  Right at this moment, I'm indulging in one of my guilty pleasures.  I'm watching Trista and Ryan's Wedding, from the Bachelorette.  I hope it is real, cuz marriage definitely is serious and not meant to be for publicity.  Anyway, I've been kinda pondering while watching this.  Why is it when the guy has chosen on the Bachelor, with the exception of the latest, they have all broken up.  Yet, when the girl was the Bachelorette, they are now happily (hopefully) married.  Is it because us females are smarter?hehe  Anyway, food for thought.  Leave your thoughts!  Ciao a tutti!

That magazine, with the shiny seductive cover sits there, beckoning to me.  I smile, thinking of the contents of that magazine excites me.  I take it up to my apartment, open the plastic cover, and quickly flip through enjoying the pictures.  So yeah, got the latest Vogue today.  What were ya thinking?  Ciao a tutti!

      I'm sensing a new trend coming around, and I am gonna be the first to write my prediction.  I am predicting Courtroom Red Carpets!  There are a few reasons, I'm watching the actual news (not entertainment tonight or something like that) and they mention Martha Stewart going to court for jury selection.  They actually basically just say, "Martha Stewart was in court today for jury selection."  Then they add, "She showed up with two designer handbags, one of which is an Hermes bag."  That was the story!  Now, lately so many celebrities are going to court it seems only natural.  America wants to know, Will Kobe Bryant wear an Armani or Zegna suits for his appearances?  Will Michael Jackson wear a nose or go noseless?  I'm telling ya, soon we'll see Joan Rivers outside of the California court houses!  Ciao for now.

      I don't wanna post the story here, but please keep my bestest friend in the world, Alessia in your prayers.  She's going through a really hard time right now.

      I have decided that some people just have too much money.  I was watching MTV Cribs recently, and the showed the home of the people that own Phat Farm and Baby Phat.  Oh my God, it was ridiculous.  They just have too much money.    The woman owns a crazy amount of clothes, shoes and bags.  It's sick.  As part of her handbag arsenal, she has 9 Hermes Birkin bags-9 of them.  For those of ya that don't know, those bags cost a minimum of like 5,000!  Not to mention, I saw a ton of Blahniks in her closet.  I am all about having nice things, and as many as possible.  Those that know me at all, know I love this expensive shit.  I am even admitting this is beyond ridiculous.  Maybe I'm just jealous, but...Seriously, though, her closet could probably buy a small country.  Craziness.  Now this next story is just plain envy.  I'm helping someone at work the other day.  She spends about $200 with me, on a pair of jeans and a shirt.  She makes a comment how she really shouldn't be spending more money cuz she just bought a wedding dress upstairs.  Okay, sorry I must digress a bit here.  For those of ya that don't know much about Fields, it has a pretty impressive history.  It was the first store to do things we take for granted now-first window displays, first elevators, and other "firsts" I can not think of right now.  They used to be especially known with being on the front of the fashion trends and what not.  We are the 2nd largest department store next to Macy's Harold Square.  However, in recent history Fields kinda lost it's focus.  This summer Field's on State went through what they called a "renaissance."  The store itself underwent a great makeover and we added many great, hot lines. One of these lines was the Vera Wang Bridal Boutique.  So yeah, if I get married and am working at Field's I can get a discount on a Vera Wang dress:)  Okay, back to my story.  The girl makes a comment about how impressed she is with the changes Fields has undergone.  I ask then, since she mentioned the wedding dress, if she checked out the Vera Wang Boutique.  She then says, "Yeah, I got a Vera Wang."  Ugh, I am so jealous.  Cuz as I once mentioned to Alessia, I won't get married til I can have my Vera Wang dress and Blahnik bridal shoes.  hehe So yeah, that's it.  Nothing too else to exciting to write about.  Ciao for now!

      One of my new years resolutions was to get to the gym more often.  I decided to make that task a little was a good mix cd to listen to.  I need help coming up with some good motivational (aka fun) work out music.  It doesn't necessarily have to be a work out related -a la Let's Get Physical by Olivia Newton John.  Help!

      After a recent online conversation with Amie, I am posing this question to all my many (haha) loyal readers.  Why have we become so cynical?  My junior year, in a poli sci class, the whole Elio Gonzalez fiasco was going on.  We were discussing it, and basically came to the conclusion it was all about the economy-money.  My prof, who was a recent grad school graduate, made a comment how she wasn't as cynical as us to she was almost done with grad school.haha   Are we so cynical because people simply do more bad thing?  I would bag to differ, although that might also be part of the reason.  I have a couple reasons why I believe so.  First our generation has seen a lot of horrible things-many cases of corruption, lying and what not.  I'm not going to make a list here, most of us can name quite a few I imagine.  Another part of the reason is the media.   Face it, the media loves a good scandal.  You can't blame them.  Bad news sells.  Good news tends to be "boring."  I know many people that read this are fellow CKI'ers.  We did lots of good stuff, how much of it ever got media attention?  I don't mean attention to be like oh we're so cool and got on tv (although that's always fun), but just to let people know there are some good people out there doing good!  Also, you never hear a news story about a politician doing something good.  Yeah, I'm sure it does actually happen!!  So anyway, would it kill the news to show some good stuff now and again, besides the cheesey human interest story in the last 10 seconds of the broadcast.  Food for thought.  Ciao for now!

      I'm amused by the whole Britney wedding fiasco, I must admit.  Go the www.thesmokinggun.com to see her marriage license and annullment papers.  I think the girl is giving a big cry for help...or attention.  Anyway, another fun filled day at Fields is in store for me.  Ciao for now!

      So, today was a good an interesting day.  Those Packers will give me a heart attack one of these days.  They pulled out a nail bitter, for sure.  I guess, especially at playoff time, a win is a win.  Indianapolis won too!  That Packer game was way stressful.  I couldn't move.  Then, tonight was the season premiere of the last season of Sex and the City.  It was a really good episode as well.  Afterwords, Alex called.  Apparently, I'm a "good time girl."  What exactly that means, I don't wanna know! I guess if it means I like having fun, then yes I am!hehe  Anyway, watching LSU right now.  It's halftime and LSU is winning.  Go, or geaux, Tigers!

I'm not gonna reflect on all that happened, cuz those of ya that read my blog know what's gone on in my life and too many tv shows do retrospectives on all the other stuff.  On interesting thing about New Years is resolutions.  Here are mine  1.  Lose the 5-10 lbs I have gained since moving to Chicago, aka go to the gym regularly.  I gotta be a bridesmaid in June, so wanna be hot.hehe  2.  Focus on my photography-get darkroom and website up.  Those are two of the main things I want to do in 2004.  WHAT ARE YOURS?

      I just need to vent a little.  I'm really not that upset, but just gotta write about it and get it off my chest.  So, I have today off.  First, this afternoon my cable goes out.  I was told by RCN it may be back on later tonight.    So, I decided to head to the gym in the afternoon versus lata tonight.  I was heading to the gym.  I was going to the mega gym, like I did last time.  Anyway, the best way to get there is the El, our subway system (although it's elevated.)  I get there and there is a message due to a fire, the trains are going to be delayed.  So, this train ride would normally take me about 10-15 min.  It takes an hour!  So I get back home, and the cable is still out.  I call RCN again, to see if they have anymore info.  They didn't know too much earlier, cuz the outage was so new.  Well, basically some cable got cut somehow.  Wouldn't ya know that cable was were the fire was, so they at the present time can't even get to it!  I might be without cable for a few days!  I wouldn't care too much normally, but without cable I can't get a good pic on my TV and tonight is Must See TV!  One the train, I could see the damage from the fire and it was horrible-totally burnt.  Now, I do have some sense and perspective and am grateful that was not me.  Compared to having my stuff destroyed, my problems are merely inconveniences.  However, if I hear that fire was caused by a cigarette or something stupid like that, I'm not goiing to be happy!  Oh one weird and somewhat good thing...somehow I still have cable internet!  Go figure!  Ciao a tutti!

I don't know what else to really say but that.  I've had a cosmo, so bear with me.  It was just excellant.  I don't think it could've ended any better.  Totally leaves room for a movie, like I've heard talk about.  Would I like that?  Abso-fucking-lutely:)

      I had today off, and had a pretty nice one at that.  I did a little bit of running around this morning, nothing too exciting there.  This afternoon, I hit the gym.  A new "mega-branch" of my gym (Crunch rocks) opened about a week ago.   I can go there for the rest of the month.  It's really cool.  It's in a really cool part of Lincoln Park too.  There's lots of neat shops around there.  Amie and Beth, there's a Restoration Hardware.  I really like that store.  If I had money, I could blow a good amount of it there.  I didn't know there was one in Chicago.  Plus, and I've never seen this anywhere but Chicago, there's a store called the Container Store.  I've seen adds and stuff for it, but have never been there.  So, I decided to stop in.  It's pretty cool.  Has almost anything and everything ya could manage for organizing.  Monica Geller-Bing would go crazy there.hehe  Wow, I just realized how many times I used the word cool!  But anyway, that was my fun filled day.  It's always exciting exploring a new part of the city-even if it is just to explore new shopping opportunities.hehe  So, that was my day.  I don't know what's on tap for tonight yet.  Unfortunately like most of ya, I won't be seeing parades and getting beads.  I'm jealous.  So for all of my southern folk, hope ya have a great fun-filled and beadiful Mardi Gras!  Ciao a tutti!

      Quite an eventful trip home.  First and most importantly, my brother Ben is now engaged!!  He and his girlfriend Carrie have been dating quite awhile now and seemed very well suited for each other.  We all figured this would eventually happen, and are happy.  There is one drawback, sometime this spring/summer they plan on moving to Fairbanks, Alaska.  They want to have the wedding there.  Their reasoning is to get us all there, so we can all see Alaska.  However, that plan has a flaw.  Very few of us, probably myself included, will probably not be able to make it up there.   FYI, her family is in South Bend too.  There is plenty of time left, she doesn't even have a ring.  We're all hoping we can talk them into having it back in the bend or something.  Secondly, my niece made me so proud this weekend.  I don't think it's possible for Mallory to get anymore adorable.  Mom and I took her to do a little shopping at Target-love Target!  My mom was gonna let Mallory pick something out and get it for her.  So, we walk all through the toys.  Mallory didn't see anything she wanted.  We look at books, and no go there either.  Finally, we walk by clothing and stuff.  Then it happens!  Mallory see's a pair of shoes she has to have.  They're pink, sparkly flip flop looking shoes for spring.  So, mom gets those for her.  We get out to the car and she has to put them on right away.  Did I mention there's still quite a bit of snow on the ground there?  Yes, my niece is a shoe freak like her aunt-even wearing impractical ones for the sake of fashion.haha  Not to mention later her saying, I love Aunt Jessica!  That's the first time she's ever really said that.  She is an absolute doll.   It's kinda sad coming back sometimes.  These trips back home  I've taken since I've moved have all been nice.  My mom and I don't spend enough time together to get on each others nerves, so we get along really well.  Going home makes me realize how much I do miss my family.  I'm glad I'm close enough to home somewhat often.  Anyway, hope I didn't bore y'all.  Ciao a tutti!

      I remembered what I wanted to write about a few days ago!  This week was the anniversary of a very important event in US History.  No, not Washington or Lincoln's birth.  Although, I guess that's almost as important.hehe   I am talking about the 40th Anniversary of The Beatles appearance on Ed Sullivan.  Some of you may or may not know, Amber I know ya do, that I am a huuuuge Beatles fan.  I guess I'm just not as obvious about it anymore.  I think they helped greatly shape part of American culture, not to mention music as we know it.  I don't think anyone could argue what a large influence they had on music.  To think, 40 years later they are still known all around the world.  Do ya think that could really be said about must musical acts we have around today?  I know, I'm sure there are a few that'll still be well known and believed.  It just makes me sad that two of the Fab Four (can't believe Queer Eye kinda stole their nickname) are no longer with us.  So thank you, John, Paul, George and Ringo!  Especially to Lennon for being on of the sexiest guys to ever live, next to James Dean.  Although, I must interject I don't agree with many of his political views.  Anyway...Had to mention that!   Tomorrow I leave on a fun filled trip to the wonderful city of South Bend, Indiana (affectionately or not known as the Bend) for my mom's birthday.   Hope y'all have agreat Valentine's Day and Luvs you guys!!  Ciao a tutti!

      Okay, y'all I need some lovin'  I'm seriously starting to get depressed.  I was talking with my Laundry rep on the phone and as usual got chit-chatting.  The conversation turned to Sex and the City.  It hit me hard-only two more episodes left!  It really makes me sad.  I absolutely love that show.  Anyway, sorry had to vent a bit.

      Nothing really exciting has been happening lately.  I had some stuff I was going to write about, but can't think of what it was right now.hehe  Going home to the Bend this weekend for my mom's birthday.  While home, I'll hopefully get to hang out with Christine.  I haven't seen her since I've moved.  I have got to start planning a Bacholerette party for Amber.  Oh yeah, it should be good.  I just gotta figure out what to do exactly.  I know the location so far, and I"ve told Amber that already.  We'll reserve at room at 100 Centre Hacienda.  YUUUUMMMMYYYY AND DOUBLE YUUUUMMMMYYYY MARGARITAS.  After that, maybe Rum Runners unless something else cooler has opened up in the Bend.  Yeah, I know the likelihood of that is very slim.hehe  But as any bachelor/bachelorette party there has to be some craziness!   So, I have to and will come up with somethign awesome and fun with a hint of embarassment for Amber.hehe  Amber, I do have a partner in crime in this....lol   So yeah, May 8th should kick a little butt.  Then a little later hopefully Beth will be visiting Chi-town.  So, April, May and June will be busy months.  I guess I should enjoy the calm before the storm.  I guess I'll post later if I remember what I wanted to say earlier.  Ciao a tutti!

      So a few things to update, yeah actually a tiny bit of excitement.  First, Aunt Terry visited last week.  She's my crazy aunt, for those that dont' know or remember.  She's 44, going on 18 I swear.  We went to Buddy Guy's concert on Thursday and got our drink on.  Hijinks insued-my aunts doing.  Then we did some shopping and eating on Friday.  She talked me into getting a crazy top and shoes.  If I go to Vegas in August, it's a perfect Vegas outfit.   Then we went to an awesome Italian restaurant for lunch.  I'm tempted to say it puts Bravo to shame.  It was excellant!  A good visit, fun was had by all.  Then pretty uneventful until Sunday, oh joyous day was Sunday, but I'll go into that in a sec.  Today at work was okay, pretty slow, but actually had a good sales day.  One exciting thing did happen-I got business cards!!!  Yeah, so official now!  Hehe  I am Jessica Niedbalski Laundry Specialist.haha  Okay, Sunday...Sunday I did a little shopping before the Superbowl.  I went to Neimans, since they are having their hugest sale right now.  Okay, y'all better sit down for this one....I bought a pair of Blahniks!!!  They are beautiful, brown suede sexy strappy shoes.  Ugh, gorgeous....I got an excellant deal.  Okay, normally $600 and I paid about 175.  I know still a ton for shoes, but ugh if you could only see how pretty they are and how just I can't even put into words.  Anyway, it totally made my day to become $175 poorer.   THen Superbowl time. I thought it was a fairly boring game until like the 4th quarter.  All I have to say about halftime is I guess Justin really did mean it when he said, "I'm gonna have ya naked by the end of this song."  Ciao for now!

      Okay, I'm watching Millionaire right now, before heading off to work.  Now, I know some questions can be somewhat tricky and what not.  I'm usually really good with those questions up until 16,000 or so.  I'll admit every now and again, there's an early question that gets me.  However, I could not believe a lady had to use her lifeline on this.  For 200 (yeah 2nd question) In order to convert 75% into a decimal, 75 is divided by what number?  A.  5 B. 10 C. 25 D. 100.  Oh my god, that should be a give me for anyone!  I'm not even gonna post the answer.

      Hello on this bright and rainy day.haha  Actually, most of the day was pretty nice, but was pouring this evening.  I had a fantabulous day today.  I had off, first and foremost.  I did a few quick things (grocery shopping and what not) that I had to do.  Then, I headed downtown!   I met up with Caroline for a fun-filled day of shopping and drooling.  Oh my, I've never really spent much time in the Gucci store.  I now know why.  Oh my, all the gorgeous things!  The shows and bags are absolutely phenomenal.  Oh, if only I had a g or two to blow.haha  Louis Vuitton was also nice.  Vuittons are being over done, though.  Too many fakes out there now.  Why pay the money for a real one?  Too much of a status symbol now.  While a Louis is always a classic, it's overdone for the time being.  I'm trying to convince Caroline to get Manolos, but so far she is being too sensible.  I came home and eat and do laundry.  I watch the Britney concert on Showtime.  It was actually pretty good, for the most part.  Near the end though, some of it got pretty racy.  I feel bad for the moms taking their preteen daughters to it.  Anyway, I know I'm kinda babbling today.  Although, is hat really different from any other?  Ciao a tutti!

      Saw this on Michelle's blog, and of course had to take it.  I must admit, somewhat surprised at the result.   Ballet shoes- beautiful, graceful, and creative, you enjoy dancing writing and music.  You are often very poetic and sometimes dramatic.  You keep to yourself aside from a few close friends that you can relate to.

      Sorry it's been a bit since I've posted.  I've actually been going out quite a bit lately.  Today was a day off:)  I meet with Vanessa for lunch and a little shopping today.  After trying it a few times, I've come to the conclusion I'm not a sushi fan.  I've tried it a few times and just don't like it that much.  Although, the company was nice.  I was good and only bought one thing.  I finally bought my New York Dolls t-shirt.  It's wicked cool, I might add.  Then I came home and after a little relaxation, hit the gym.  I had to watch the Top Model finale.  My pick, Yoanna, won!  Anyway, gonna go relax some more:)  Ciao a tutti! Quote of the day: We can get two poodles and walk them in our Manolos. .

      Part Two Okay, so I ended up writing most of what I wanted to write about last night.  I guess I'll continue from where I left off.  Amber, Brandon and I met up with Caroline at her apartment building.  She still lives with her rents, but I totally see why.  Their building is awesome.  We then continued on, after meeting up with a few of her friends, to a bar called Shenanigans (sp.) Another co-worker also works there now and again.  It was packed to the max.  St. Patty's is basically the closet thing Chicago has to Mardi Gras.  Nothing all that exciting happened while out and about, but had a really good time.  Hehe, funny shirt guy!  Today, I had to work early.  THat sucked, big time.  I wasn't hungover, but just exhausted.  I will hopefully pass otu like a baby tonight.  Caroline was not so fortunate, wasn't feeling so hot today.hehe  Anyway, tired so gonna go veg.  Ciao for now!

      Part One Have quite a bit to write about, but will have more to write about tomorrow, so this is part uno.  Monday, first had to check out Laundry by Shelli Segal's fall line.  It's so stellar.  Then met up with Amber and Brandon.  We walked around downtown for a bit, and then went to Wicker Park.  I found a cool vintage store I'll have to check out now and again.  Then it was home to relax for bit.  After some needed relaxation time, off to Sugar!  Oh that place just so rocks.  I had a chocolate beignet thing for dessert.  It was absolutely delicious.  I do miss my Cafe Du Monde.  That is just one of the best ever.  I had a chocolate rasberry martini, but didn't care for that this much.  Tuesday we went out to Woodfield Mall(basically biggest mall in Chicago-area) and Ikea.  I hadn't been to either, so it was excellant.  I love Ikea!  Today, we did a little more shopping around the Mag mile.  Then we went to see The Passion.  I had a few little issues, which I'll discuss, but thought it was excellant.  First, don't see how it was anti-semitic.  I thought the way it was done was great.  However, Mel needed to do a tad more research.  My soph year at St. Joe we had a lecture on crucifixion and how it was really done.  I remember it vividly, cuz it's quite gruesome.    Now, from what I could see the other two being cruxified were done "correctly" but Jesus was cruxified the "artistic" way.  I don't wanna go into that here, but just wish that had been portrayed accurately.   Also, once again Mary Magdalene was portrayed as the sinner.  There is no evidence for that damn it!  I remember in the whole DaVinci debate, a pope in the early 20th century even decreed she was not.  Historical evidence points to the fact she was a young widow of a business man.  When he passed, she took control.  That was a very big faux paus then.  It just irks me!  Anyway, it's out to celebrate St. Patty's tonight.  I'll hopefully update about that tomorrow!  Ciao a tutti!

      Nothing too much to really report.  The last few days at work have been busy-yipppeee.  That means, my next pay check should be pretty phat:)  MAC Cosmetics has been having a special promo for their new spring line.  They've had a dj the last couple days.  Cosmoetics are on the 1st floor, and I"m on the 3rd.  Let's just say the music was so loud, I'd even get a headache.  Oh well, it's better than that normal elevator/lounge music they play.  There is a new girl in my neighbor dept.  She seems really cool so far.  Caroline is just an inch taller than me, but probably about half my weight.  She is tiny.  She's also just as crazy as me.  Yeah, there's another (but blonde) Shagsta out there.haha  All we need is to get Tre to go otu with us, and it'll be the invasion of the little people.haha  We're thinking of passing a rule that ya can't be any taller than 5 foot to work in our area:)  The next few days should be really fun.  Amber and her fiance Brandon will be visiting.  I have to get up a little after 7, so I can meet my Laundry by Shelli Segal rep.  I have to check out our fall line.  I can't believe I have to look at fall clothes already.  Gotta love retail.  Then after meeting with Yvonne, I hopefully will have time to get my tall Cafe Mocha at one of the numerous Starbucks on the way to meet Amber and Brandon at the train!  It'll be a busy, fun-filled couple of days!  I may or may not be able to update while they are here.  Ciao a tutti!

      Okay, I've been trying to write light, non-deep things lately, but I'm gonna change that today.  I'm loving the Apprentice, and was happy to see Omarosa voted off.  Although, I will admit she did make for good tv.  However, something has come up that has me seriously perturbed.  Okay, now I know I'm definitely a white chick-some of my family even has dubbed me as a yuppie.  I do find the n-word very repulsive.  On The View Omarosa accused Ereka of calling her a n.  I did not see this particular episode.  I did see yesterday and today's episode thoygh.  Ereka was on defending herself yesterday.  She did make a very good case, but at that point it was her word against Omarosa.  This is were reality tv comes into play, though.  One of the cohosts is Elisabeth from Survivor.  Elisabeth talked to Mark Burnett about it.  Mark Burnett said there is nothing on tape to support Omarosa's claim, and those cameras are rolling 24/7.  Plus, the Don himself was on today and said there is no evidence to back up her claim.  The only thing worse than using the n-word is wrongfully accusing someone of using it!

      I'm addicted to Newylweds on MTV.  I was watching it tonight, and had to laugh during the beginning.  A cockroach (aka NOLA's finest pet) was in their limo.  Oh, forgot to mention this was in NOLA when Jessica performed at the Sugar Bowl-Sean should remember that:)  Ah, I almost miss those little buggers.haha  Beth and Amie, as long as I live I don't think I'll ever forget that one night in Aron.  All I gotta say is that was on smart roach.haha   Also, Jessica Simpson (and Nick?) are doing a show for ABC this fall.  Well, guess what a large part of her wardrobe is supposedely going to be-LAUNDRY BY SHELLI SEGAL!  Laundry is making a big push to get on more shows and just more celebrities in their everyday life.  Very cool!   Speaking of Laundry by Shelli Segal, they changed the way our clothing allowance works.  I know have to order it online.   Before, they just basically sent me whatever.  At least now I have a say in what I get.  Only prob is, the selection (particularly sizes) is somewhat limited.  Well, I wanted this suit, but they didn't have a 0 in the skirt, only a two.  I tried it on at a store, and the two was too big.  GROWL.  Yvonne being the wonderful rep she is, called and talked to her boss.  They are gonna order the 0 from one of Laundry by Shelli Segal's three retail stores for me.  Yvonne just told me this on the phone.  She also said, she wouldn't do this for just everyone, but since I do such a great job, she did.  It always makes ya feel good to hear that.  She's been gushing about me a lot like tht lately, and it kinda is embarassing.  Still makes me feel good though:)  Enough on that...My two guys made it through American Idol!haha  Ciao for now!

      Ah, another productive day off.  I feel good when I get stuff down, instead of laying on my booty all day.  I finally got my invitation dilemma taken care of.  Amber, you'll just have to wait til I mail them out:)  I think it'll be cute!  As part of my productive day, I went to the main library downtown to look for a few books.  Oh my, I've never seen such a mess.  One book I was looking for, supposedely there were 4 or 5 copies in, I couldn't find.  I went to the info desk in that area.  She had me go through all these stacks of books that needed to be sorted.   Needless to say, I still couldn't find it.  I could not believe how many books they had set back to be sorted.  There were literally thousands!  Now, this is the main library of a huge city and this was just one floor out of 9.  I could not believe how back logged they were on getting books back, though.  Ugh, very annoying.  Anyway, back to American Idol.  Go George and John Peter!  Ciao a tutti!

      With all the Oscar stuff and what not, I keep forgetting to write about something that happened about a week ago.   Diesel rep was in, and that was good for a few reasons.  First, good eye candy.  Secondly, he gave us all a mixed Diesel put together.  For free music, it's very good.  Thirdly, and most important to my fragile ego, he totally checked me out.  He's kinda a name dropper and what not, so not my ideal.  However, he is hot and getting checked out by a hot guy is not a bad thing.  Today was my day off.  I was bad and didn't go to the gym, just totally didn't feel like it.  I ran some errands downtown, including checking out invites for a certain someone's bachelorette party.  Oh yeah, Amber, also checked out the Bachelorette Party Store today and got some good ideas:)  Ciao a tutti!

      Help!  Okay, I need some help here.  I'm hoping my fellow readers will think of something!  Okay, as most of ya know, I'm Amber's maid of honor.  One of my duties is planning the bachelorette party.  I must say, that may be my favorite!  Anyway, trying to get around to working on invites.  I was going to use my printshop program.  However, I haven't used it forever and realized why.  It's from like 1997 and kinda cheesy.  Does anyone out there know of any good programs online or anything like that?  HELP!  Ciao for now!

      As promised, here's my two cents on the Oscar's.  Overall, I thought the show was kinda boring.  Lord of the Rings, Lord of the Rings....I admit haven't seen it, but not a huge fan of the first two.  I was glad to see Sean Penn win.  He has such a range.  Spicoli wins an Oscar dude!  I was kinda glad to see Lost in Translation didn't win a lot.  I was not a fan of that movie at all.  Although, Sophia probably did deserve her screenwriter Oscar.  Now for my forte-fashion!  Overall, as with the awards, not all that impressed.  Very few stood out in my mind.  My faves were Charlize (gorgeous, just like hte glamorous movie star she is), Naomi Watts could've light up a room (get the pun?) and Holly Hunter (could've shocked me) were my faves.  Many of the usual red carpet goddesses did somewhat disappointment-Julia Roberts just didn't do it for me, Nicole Kidman could've done better.  I didn't like Renee's dress, just way too much going on in back!  I'm not a fan of Renee's, but usually she is gorgeous on the carpet and last night just disappointed.  Okay, now for the fun category-my picks for worst dressed.  Scarlett Johanson goes on this list.  Her dress itself was not bad, but the fit was horrid!  That is unacceptable at this kinda of high profile event.  Okay, and for the absolute worst (probably no surprise) Uma.  Uma, what were ya thinking?  Were ya thinking of yoodling after the awards or something!?  Anyway, there ya go.  Ciao a tutti!

      Can't believe it's been a week since I last posted.  I'm usually much better than that.  There's not really a lot to report.  I've been working and then trying to maintain some sorta social life.  Although, I increasingly feel like an old fart.  I come home most nights tired and not wanting to do much.  Saturday though, we're going out and getting sauced.hehe  I like that word for drunk, and want to try and spread its use.  Weather here is finally warming up nice.  I was able to walk around today without a coat!  I'm so ready for summer.  I'm definitely ready to hit the beach.hehe  Oh yeah, thankfully John Stevens got voted off!  Ciao a tutti!

      I forgot about one thing that happened this weekend, that I wanted to write about.  So, Sunday night my mom and I are just chilling flipping the channels trying to find something on TV to watch.  We end up mainly watching the new Divas show on VH1.  One of the highlights, at least for me, was watching Blondie perform.  They still rock.  Debbie Harry has got to be one of the ultimate rock goddesses.  She's gotta be getting up there in the years, but she can still sing.  One of the songs she performed was a new one called "Good Boys."  Not that I am condoning this, but should you happen upon a downloading site, I recomend downloading this song.  It's really good, and stil lhas the Blondie sound.  Anyway, yeah.  A boring day at work.  It was raining, so we were slow.  Uhyeah, Blondie rocks!  Sorry, getting tired.  Ciao a tutti!

      So, it was back to the Bend for a bit this weekend-AGAIN.  Sorry, but I think most of ya know the Bend is not my favorite place.  This Sunday was Amber's bridal shower.  I must say, it was the biggest one I've been too.  I thinlk there were like 60-70 people there.  As a bridesmaid, I had to help serve the lunch.  Amber, wish I woul'dve know, so I wouldn't have worn the Manolos.hehe  Serving food and wearing Manolos not a good combo.  I guess there are worse problems in life;)  It was nice, and nice being home.  During this nice, short trips my mom and I get along real well.  So, as much as I dislike the city, I do like being with my family.  This was a pretty quick trip home, so I didn't get to see Mallory (the cutest niece in the world.)  I'll be home again in about 3 weeks for the bachelorette party.  Now that I am very much looking forward too.  Just wait Amber!  Anyway, not sure what else to write about.  I feel like there was something I wanted to write about, but am blanking out.  Ciao a tutti!

      Quite a bit to update...First, Jocey got in Friday night as planned.  We had a nice dinner at Potbelly's and then just came back to my place and chilled.  Saturday was an early start.  I went and got my hair cut.  I love it.  It's a short bob, think Catherine Zeta in Chicago.  I'll try to somehow get a picture posted eventually.  Jocey and I then did a little shopping on the Mag Mile:)  I got her to get pointy toe shoes!  I got a cute pink pair myself.  Anyway, yeah...Saturday while out and about get a call from Caroline.  Some dumbass stole her purse (Gucci) at the bar the night before.  That really sucks.  Oh forgot to mention, while I was getting my hair cut, Jocey got a call from her mom.  The train we take to the Bend had a "minor" derailment that morning.  Isn't that crazy??  What exactly is a minor derailment?  So anyway, after a nice day of shopping and what not, it was time for the train ride home.  Fortunately, all was fixed and got home with no problem.  Easter of course was nice.  The food at my grandma's was absolutely yummy.  Monday morning, did some shopping for someone's bridal shower:)  Then it was pretty much time to get the train back to Chicago.  Yesterday was work as usual, although for a Tuesday it was crazy.  My co-workers all liked my hair.hehe  Anyway, speaking of work, I gotta get ready for it.  Ciao a tutti!

      Ugh, so annoyed at my manager right now, but I don't really wanna get into that.  I just wish she'd get over worrying about the nit-picky stuff and worry about that bigger stuff that's wrong.  Any-who, not to much to really write about.  Other than my manager annoying me, work has been going well.  Went out to a yummy italian restaurant for dinner last night, Papa Milanos.  I think it's some of the best Italian I've had yet.  Best of all, it's not horridly expensive.  Tomorrow after work, I've gotta kill some time downtown.  My 16 year old cousin Jocelyn is coming to visit Friday night and Sat.  I have to met her at the train station.  Then we'll both take the train to the Bend on Sat night for Easter.  It should be cool.  She hasn't seen my apt yet.  I may use that down time to do some shoe shopping:)  I know most of ya are probably thinking, like I need another pair.  HOweer, I seriously could use a cuter pair of shoes for work.  I have two pair I wear most of the time and they are boring.  Something pointed-toe and kitten-heeled is in my future:)  Anyway, don't know if I'll update before I get back from Easter.  Everyone have a great Easter!!  Ciao a tutti!

      Oh my, what a crazy weekend!  I haven't had a weekend this crazy in quite a long time.  So, Friday night starts out okay.  A group of us go to this club called Sauce.  It's alright, but we get tired of it after awhile.  I'm going to use initials, cuz a lot of these people I don't know real well, so might not like name out on the web.  Just when we're about ready to move on, K (this Barbie doll type) starts talking to this guy, let's call him D. D invites us to this private party at Crobar-a hot club here where cover is usually a nice $20.  So we go.  I maybe met a really nice guy, but this is still to early to say much about it at all.  Crobar is your typical loud, techno blaring club.  After awhile, some of us leave and go to D's house for a night cap.  For a 29 year old, his place is freaking nice as heck.  J, the nice guy, and I spent it sleeping on the couch there.  That was comfey.haha  So we all (K stayed there too) took off.  K and I stopped for Starbucks, and then it was back to home to shower and rest.  I spent the rest of Saturday vegging on the couch.  I was suppose to join J for another party, but I was too tired.  Today met up with Caroline for lunch.  Then we had a little picnic.  That was cutsie.haha  Then we went to another friends to watch Sopranos.  That show rocks.  So yeah, that's my crazy weekend.  Oh, here's a link to a photo.  THe one of us is near the bottom.hehe  See if ya can play "Where's Jessica."  http://www.surrealchicago.com/site/epage/16173_319.htm Ciao a tutti!

      Not much has been going on lately.  Just working and going out now and again.  Man, sometimes I feel like I'm 50 and not 25.  Actually, and this is sad, it seems my 56 year old mother has more energy than me at times.  When I go home to the Bend, it's like we gotta go here, and here, and here...I'm like can't I just go home and crash on the couch.haha  I have this coming weekend off, a rarity in retail, so hopefully will be up to a little trouble:) I don't know what else to write right now, kinda tired.

      Am not feeling all that hot.  I think it's just allergies or something.  I took some Claritin and am currently drinking OJ, so hopefully will feel like a million tomorrow.  Speaking of Survivor...I haven't watched the past few seasons.  However, I did watch a lot of the Allstars season.  Okay, I realize this is all kinda part of the game, but I did not like how Boston Rob played it.  He seemed to do quite a large amount of backstabbing.  So, when it came down to him and Amber, I'm glad Amber won.  I wasn't a huge fan of hers either, though.  I did like the twist CBS threw in though, viewers voting for a winner.  Yes, I actually did go to teh website and vote (once.)  I voted for Rubert, and am extremely glad he won. For those of ya that don't know Rubert, here's a little bit of info.  He a big ol' Teddy bear.  He's from my home state in Indiana.  He's a high school counselor and only makes about 18,000 a year.  I admire people who do that (along with teachers.)  That's gotta be one of the most underpaid jobs, like teaching.  He also played the game without all the backstabbing and what not.  I like a clean game.  Anyway, sorry.  I just felt like rambling about all of that.  Sorry if I bored anyone out there.  Ciao a tutti!

      Reasons I pay the big rent 1. It's a big city, rent don't come cheap.hehe 2. My neighborhood is very safe. 3. For a little more a month, I have a decent sized place, instead of a     cubby-hole. 4. The beach is just a 20 min walk away!  So, I had today off.  Today also happened to be gorgeous, at least until dinnertime. So, I did some grocery shopping.  After 2.5 weeks, my kitchen was looking pretty empty.  After that, I decided since it was so nice out, I'd hit the beach.  It was a nice, relaxing time.  My skin is a little pink, but it'll be brown tomorrow:)  I love chilling at the beach.  It's so relaxing.  Then went to IHOP for an early dinner-yeah had to fit the munchies later with some yummy strawberries.  I love strawberries.  So, it was actually a really nice day.  A day were it's good to be the Shagsta.haha  In attempts to destroy this nice streak-I have to work nice and early tomorrow.  UGH.  Ciao a tutti!

      Huhm, blogger has a new format, interesting...Anyway, the trip to the Bend was quite nice.  Saturday was an absolutely crazy busy day. Although, non of it was bad. First, I had to leave the apt a little earlier than I would've had to.  Lizz needed me to get her some Garret's Popcorn.  For those not familar with Garrets, it's the best popcorn in the world.  Hard to explain if ya haven't experienced it.  Then I get to South Bend.  Mom decided we need to visit Vince, Toni and Mallory-not a prob.  So we get home, and it's about time to take mom to work, so I can borrow her car to run some errands.  Man, most of ya probably won't appreciate this, but it's weird driving again.haha  So, I start running my errands.  Then Vince calls and wants me to watch Mallory a little bit, before the party.  Oh man, is she funny-always has to be doing something.  Amie, I still say she's the most adorable 4 year old.  I'll add girl in there for ya though:)  Then it was time for Hacienda and the festivities to begin.  We had a nice time at Hacienda, with the exception of our horrid service.  The turn out was nice. Then some of us went to Heartland, the best club in the Bend.  I met a third cousin of mine.  I knew her older sister from St. Joe and thought she was her sister.  So, not only did I get some drinks, I got to meet some family.haha  Today was a nice Mothers Day with my mom and some other family.  I got my mom a really beautiful orchid plant, she doesn't like me to spend much money on her.  We hung out again with Vince, Toni and Mallory.  Then we visited Grandma and then went to Aunt Terry's crazy house.  After all that it was time to catch my train.  Geez, this is a long post.  I better end for now.  Ciao a tutti!

      Of course I watched the Friends finale.  I've been a fan of that show for a long time, pretty much since the beginning.  I wasn't surprised at Ross and Rachael getting together.  I don't think it could've ended any other way.  Otherwise, people would have been rioting.haha  The twin twist was neat.  There were two sad scenes for me.  The first is when Rachael came back to Ross.  Oh my gosh-tears.haha  Even though I know it would happen, I still got emotional.  The other part that made me kinda sad was the destruction of the fusball table.  I don't know, but that made me kinda sad.haha  I'm happy they kinda reincarnated chick and duck.  One thing that annoyed me a tiny bit is how emotional they all were leaving.  I mean, Chandler and Monica are only moving to the burbs not Syberia-although those can be almost the same.haha  I liked them going for a cup of coffee at Central Perk, seemed very fitting.  Over well, golly good show.haha  Thank you Friends for providing a good deal of entertainment-and a good excuse to take a study break while in school.  Anyway, tired going to go for now, but had to post my thoughts on the show.  Ciao a tutti!

      What a crazy 24 hours or so.  Yesterday, I met a friend for lunch and a little shopping.  I got a cute dress for Amber's rehearsal dinner.  It'll go perfectly with my new Pucci print Nine West shoes.  See, I'm not a total shoe snob.  So that was all nice.  A few weeks ago, I volunteered to work inventory at Fields-a once a year thing.  This involved showing up at 6pm, and staying til 2am-actually clocked out at 2:03.  I walked in my apt right at 230.  Thankfully, I had a ride-no late night el for me!  While working that late, would not normally have been so bad, it ended up being bad.  I could not fall asleep til forever-probably like 4.  Then to make matters worse, I woke up at 8 and could not fall back to sleep.  UGH!  To make matters worse, I have to work at 12:30 today, so no nap to help catch up.  On a somewhat happy note, I don't have to work tomorrow, so hopefully can sleep in.  Next year, if I am still at Fields (ugh), I wouldn't mind working it again, but will be requesting that next day off!  Anyway, gonna go relax a bit before I have to go in.  Ciao a tutti!

      I love Madonna and all, but even I have to admit I think this is too much.  Apparently, Madonna does not want to be known as Madonna anymore.  She wants to go by Esther-a Hebrew queen.  Madonna, why can't ya just be the crazy ho ya used to be?!haha  Anyway, off to work.  Ciao a tutti.

      So this so called productive day quickly became lazy day!hehe  I went downtown to put in a few aps.  I got one done and had to call it a day.  It was absolutely pouring outside.  So, I come home.  Naturally, as soon as I'm home it clears up and the sun is shining bright!  By this point I decide to make it a lazy day.  I've been really busy lately, so figured I deserved it.  I do walk to Jewel to get Nola some food.  In line, I see the Coke C2 (low carb) so bought it.  It's very good.  I highly recommend it.  The rest of the evening was spent watching some of the new summer tv.  Fox's Casino was pretty interesting.  I especially liked the part where the big gambler dude tried hooking it up with Tina.  If ya didn't see it, let's just say Tina was more like a Tony.haha  Matty, I think I may have to make that a regular part of my viewing.  It could definitely be good.  Don't know what else to write, felt like there was something else.  Anyway, go out and try C2!  Ciao a tutti!

      A pretty boring weekend.  I spent most of it working.  I guess that's what I get for having a 5 day break, and having this weekend off.  I was real tired when I got home Friday, so just kinda chilled.  I watched a lot of coverage about Reagan.  For some reason, this thing has me really depressed.  I don't know why.  I guess because it is sad.  I don't wanna write too much about this.  However, I do wanna add I can not believe the composure of Nancy.  Tomorrow's my day off.  Hopefully, it'll be productive:)  Anyway, don't know what else to write.  Ciao a tutti!

      Blah!  Sorry, have to whine a little bit today.  This rainy weather has got me totally bumming.  After a nice, sunny fun filled weekend this crappy weather depresses me.  Why can't it be sunny and 80 degrees all the time?  Is that really too much to ask?  In other news, work has been pretty darn slow the last couple days.  It was wicked rough going back yesterday after a nice 5 day break from that place.  I'm getting over Fields.  I want a new job, I think.  At least I have a new manager now, Rhoni.  So far, so good...Although, it wouldn't take much at all to be an improvement.  I've just been so damn tired.  Last night after work, I went with Caroline and Deanna for a drink.  I didn't take more than a few sips, just wasn't in the mood.  I think I just had such a nice break, it's big time sucking going back to "normal" mood.  Sorry, it's really not that bad.  I just need to kinda get it out there, and outta my system.  Tomorrow will better!  Ciao a tutti!

      Okay, I hate feeling like a dumbie.  I, as you probably noticed, did change my blog.  I'm having a few issues, however.  1.  How do I add my pic to the profile.  I signed up for that bloggerbot thing, but I'm confused as to what to do from there.  2.  How do I even make my profile visible on the blog?  HELP!

      I wanted to comment on the passing of Ronald Reagan quick.  This really saddened me.  I felt he was a pretty good president.  He helped to end the Cold War and renew a sense of optimism in this country.  However, in watching some of the news coverage, there is something else that really impressed me.  A lot of the coverage, that I saw anyway, talked about the fantastic relation between him and Nancy.  It seems like those two were deeply in love, and had a great relationship.  I hope someday to have something like that.

      Okay, a ton to write about.  I think the best way to write this all is chronological order.  I get in Friday and have some stuff to do before the rehearsal, then it's off to the rehearsal.  Everything went smooth, and the dinner was nice.  Then it was home to do some last minute stuff and get to bed somewhat early.  I got to bed by like 12, only to wake-up at 3am.  My cat back home, I've had since I was in kindergarten, and she's about 19 years old.  She's starting to loose control of her bladder.  Anyway, woke up to her scratching on something.  To find out, she uh lost control in an old suitcase of mine.  Then I got all depressed, cuz I have a feeling sometime within a year my mom is gonna wanna put her to sleep.  I was so upset, I couldn't fall back to sleep.  Eventually I went downstairs and watched tv.  Surprise, nothing is on at 5am-but amazingly I coudln't fall asleep.  So, go ready and Ambwer got me and we went to the salon to get our hair done-and have a mimosa:)  Then before ya know it, it was wedding time.  The ceremony was nice, except for a few little glitches.  Sorry Amber, but not a fan of Fr. Cam.  First, he called her Amy twice!  I know it was jsut a mess up, but...Then, communion time-apparently I was suppose to move Amber's train so no one would step on it, but Father failed to tell me that in rehearsal then he looks at me like a dumbass.  Blah!!  But anyway, other than that, it was a lovely ceremony.  I must say, Amber's train always looked good.haha  THen after the ceremony, we were suppose to lim around.  However, the limo died!!!  I must say, I'm quite impressed with how well Brandon and AMber handled all of this, had a very good sense of humor about it all.  I don't know if I would've.  So, between the weddign and reception we took a million pictures.  The reception was nice.  As usual, the food at St. Hedwigs rocked.  It was lots of fan, danced a lot.  So, that was the wedding.  I may think of more things to say later.  Sunday, I went to the lake house.  Man, I love it, love it there.  It's seriously a piece of heaven on earth.  Mallory came up and played with another little girl.  They were so cute together.  We got home, dropped Mallory off.  I got to see Vince and Toni's new house.  It's really nice.  Mallory has a bedroom and a play room!  Then to AUnt Terry's to watch Sopranos.  Love that show!  Today just hung around home with mom.  Laid out a bit.  I got lots of sun.  Tomorrow I'm off to the beach with Vanessa and her little brother.  I think we're gonna prepare a little picnic. Anyway, I've wrote enough for now.  Hopefully tomorrow, I'll change my blog.  Ciao a tutti!

      It's wedding weekend!  I leave bright and early tomorrow morning to start the wedding festivities.hehe  To prepare myself I got a manicure and pedicure today.  My toesies look cutsie.hehe  It should be fun-filled, and I'm sure I'll have a lot to write about when I get back.  Two words-open bar!  Just kidding-I need to slow down on the drinking.  I'm regressing to my college days.  I do get the pleasure of cruising around in a limo all day on Saturday:)  So like I said, I'll definitely update that later.  So, I worked adn it was slow, so the day drug along.  After work got my mani/pedi.  Now, I'm getting everything together.  I am pretty much done packing.  I keep feeling like I forgot something.  The dress is already home, and I guess that's the most important thing.  So keep your fingers crossed that I don't forget anything-at least anything I can't pick up at Osco's.  I also have my camera-since I get to play candid photographer.  Ugh, I still just hate that feeling.  Oh, I got a comment the other day about not updating my links.  I know I"ve been a slacker.  However, I've decided to hold off a bit.  Sometime real soon (hopefully in a week or so) I'm going to overhaul the site again.  I am jealous of some of the new looks out there-like the little side profile and picture.  So look forward to Sex and The City (or not) version (season) 4.  Oh, breaking in my Pucci-esque heels tomorrow night.  Man, I love those shoes ALMOST as much as my Manolos.  Anway, let me be the first to congratulate Mr. and Mrs. Brandon Watson!  Ciao a Tutti!

      On tonight's episode... So, last night go to a friend of a friends house for a little Memorial Day party.  We then move onto a bar.  We're only there a few minutes, and this group of guys (2 cool, 1 scary old guy) comes over and starts talking to us.  Eventually, I end up at a table with these guys.  Don't worry, my friends are nearby.  I end up really talking with one of the guys-S.  We hit it off and joke around a lot.  The guys have to leave-poor saps had to work today.  I was lucky to have today off.  S gives me his number.  So now, I have to call.  That's weird.  I don't think I ever called a guy, first.  Maybe, I just need to get over that.  I just feel weird calling and being like, "Hi, this is Jessica.  We met at Sluggers (yeah near Wrigley Field) the other night."  I feel dumb, and am tempted not to even call.  I know I should, but...Help, give me some advice people!  Being single in a big city rocks, but sometimes things like this make it not so fun.  Anyway, gotta get to bed soon.  Ciao a tutti!

      So, I got the news today that I've been dreading for awhile.&nbsp; My mom did put Dottie, my cat of 19 years, to sleep today.&nbsp; Apparently, she hadn't been eating the last few days.&nbsp; My mom thought, and I think rightfully so, it would be more humane than watching her starve the death.&nbsp; Poor thing had gotten to be almost skin and bones the way it was.&nbsp; I was pretty upset.&nbsp; I got the call a little before I was to leaving for work.&nbsp; Naturally, my make-up got messed-up.haha&nbsp;&nbsp; It's jsut really sad.&nbsp; She was 19 years old, pretty much part of the family.&nbsp; I mean, I've had her the majority of my life.&nbsp; I almost took her with me when I moved to Chicago, but didn't think she'd handle the change.&nbsp; The only place she had lived was in my mom's house.&nbsp; She was a good cat.&nbsp; She never bothered anyone-unless they were eating chicken.hehe&nbsp; I had some very turbulent years in my childhood, as some of you may know.&nbsp; She was one of the few constants.&nbsp; She'd almost always sleep at the foot of my bed.&nbsp; Somehow, it was always nice knowing she was there-kinda like a security blanket.&nbsp; She was our "gift from God."&nbsp; When we first moved into our house in S. Bend, we had started talking about getting a pet.&nbsp; I was in kindergarden.&nbsp; One day this little kitty showed up on our porch while we were leaving to go to school.&nbsp; My brother Ben (probably about 8 at the time) was already a persuasive dude.&nbsp; He told my mom, "Can we keep her?&nbsp; God knew we were looking for a pet and sent her to us."&nbsp; Yeah, he was already that much of a suck-up, what parent is gonna say no to taht!&nbsp; So it became the joke that she was our gift from God.hehe&nbsp; So anway, yeah.&nbsp; Sorry, for this tangent.&nbsp; She was a great cat and I'll miss her.&nbsp; Ciao a tutti!

      So, interesting story in the news today.  Apparently, Linda Ronstadt was kicked out of the Aladdin Hotel in Vegas.  I guess she praised Michael Moore during her performance.  Some of you may disagree with this, but I'm getting to the point where I'm all for punishing celebrities for getting political.haha  Okay, before y'all have a cow-let me explain.  If they want to get political while on a talk show, or something along that lines, that's a-okay with me.  However, I'd be pissed off if I was going to a concert and the performer started getting all political.  I go to those things to be entertained, not to be lectured on politics and hear about how great OR BAD Moore, Kerry, or Bush are.I do admit, I kinda feel bad for Whoppi.  I mean, she was at a Kerry fundraiser.  Was she suppose to praise Bush there? Although, I don't know exactly what she said.  All I heard was it was raunchy.  Now remember, I am a republican.  So yeah, for all ya celebrities that read this site keep your mouths closed while performing.hehe   Anyway, ciao a tutti!

      It's been awhile since I've really written.  I'll start with today.  For the somewhat shallow part of me...Caroline and I went to Neimans after work today.  They have started preselling (basically reserving) for their twice yearly Last Call sale.  For my loyal readers, that's how I got the pair of Blahniks cheap.  On Thursday, I will be the proud owner of a pair of Prada slides.  Mummy (Fields humor) would be so proud.  They are very cute.  Unlike the Manolos, they have a kitten heel so I can wear them to work.  In other news, on a recent day off I went to the Museum of Contemporary Art.  They had a really cool exhibit on avant garde fashion.  Fashion can definitely, definitely be art.  Two things were particularly cool.  They had a few big screens up that showed a few fashion shows.  One was of Viktor and Rolfe (sp?)  The clothes were all blue screen blue.  Next two the runway were to screens and on them the clothes would ghave images projected on them, like blue screen.  I don't know if I explained it well, but it was really cool.  Another was a table and four chairs and all that converted into something wearable-way cool.  For a fashionista like me, it was definitely cool.  Some of it was a bit out there, but it was interesting.  Anyway, ya can't take fashion too seriously.  It was a really cool exhibit and I hightly encourage those in Chi-town to check it out.  I've spent some other free time at hte beach of course.  Ugh, I love it, love it.  I'll let it end here, and will write more lata.  Ciao a tutti!

      Sorry it's been awhile, but there hasn't been really that much to write about.  Work is work.  I'm just ready to retire.hehe  Yesterday I had an appt with an emloyment agency, so we'll see if anything comes of that. Last night I went to the Taste of Chicago with some friends.  For those you non-Chicagoans, the Taste is one of the biggests festivals held here.  Basically a bunch of restaurants sponsor boths.  You buy tickets and then can get food from the booths.  Many offer a "taste" portion, so ya can just sample it.  I had grilled lobster tail with potatos (yummy) and fried dough (similar to a beignet.)  Okay, and there might have been a beer somewhere in there.  Afterwords hung out some friends and watched the end of a movie.  Oh yeah, we also went for ice cream, because we didn't get enough to eat at the Taste.haha  I had today off.  I hit the beach and gym.  It must have been little kids day at the beach or something, cuz there were a zillion little ones running around.  I would've gotten a headache, but thankfully just turned up my walkman.  Which leads me to my next thing...I've seen on Rebecca's site and read about the lyrics.  I think now and again I'll post some that just amuse me.  Today's will be from one of the great groups and albums ever, Outkast-The Love Below.   " Ah, God you're the greatest.  Well, I guess I'll talk to you later. Amen.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Alady."  I thought that was just cute.  Anyway, that's all for now.  Tune in same bat time, same bat channel.  Ciao a tutti!

      So, let me explain that last post.  A little over a month ago now, Caroline and I went out for a drink after work.  I met this guy, we'll nickname him P1-some of ya that know the story will understand.  P1 isn't the hottest guy, but he's not bad either.  Most importantly, so far he seems like a really nice guy.  He is a investment banker for a big nat'l company.  Aparently, normally his hours are 7-4 or so-goes with the market.  Apparently, things have been chaotic there lately and he's been working like 12 hrs a day.  Between our two work schedules and things, we haven't been able to get together since then.  We were suppose to met for dinner or something last night, and I was pretty confident that would actually occur.  However, he called and had to cancel.  He got stuck going out to the burbs and helping his parents with something.  He was very apologetic and what not.  I don't know what to do, this is getting old.  However, I really would like to see what if anything develops.  Should I just give up or try sticking it out a little longer?  Oh yeah, on top of this all I have no land phone temporarily.  Stupid RCN, my company, can't get out here to fix it til who knows.  This is utterly ridiculous and I'm totally pissed off.  Ugh...Ciao a tutti.

      I've tried to stay from politics on this, since it can incite quite passionate feelings, but I can't hold back. Kerry is really, really starting to piss me off. 1. FYI Kerry we all know by now you served in Vietnam, and want to report for duty. So did many men, including my father. So you served your country. While that is very admirable, get over yourself.haha 2. Nice to know after you and your wife got Frosty's, you went back to the campaign bus and ate a gourmet meal. I'm sure Bush contrives photo ops as well, but this is kinda dumb. Let Edwards and his wife get on with their tradition. Don't pretend your just some normal guy. You're just as bourgeois as Bush-if not more so.  3.  Please do remember your voting record.  You voted for us to go into Iraq.  While, I also wish we were out of there, we can not leave the job half done.  Ghee, didn't Bush 41 get racked over the coals for that.  Okay, sorry ranting done.  I guess feel free to comment.                                                                                 On a lighter note, Alessia was here the past few days.   A good time was had by all.  We had some drinks Tuesday night after her and her new man Jason got in.  It's the first time I went back to Bar On Buena since the Bruno debacle.   I had two vodka/cranberries and didn't puke.  I think I may be allergic to well/cheap vodka.  I had absolut this time and felt absolutely fine.  Wednesday, Alessia and I took in the Art Institute.  I love that place.  I love staring at the Pollocks.  Then it was lunch time and some shopping:)   By the time we were done, it was time to met up with Jason for a late dinner.  We went to Rosebud's.  I had my pollo saltimpocca.  I love, love that.  I still can't quite say if I prefer Rosebud's over Bravo's, but it definitely gives Bravos a run for their money.   They had to leave earlier today.  I'm hoping to fly to Cleveland sometime in the not so far future and see Al's new house.  She bought it all herself, I'm very proud.  Today, I was suppose to interview at Neimans.  Something somewhere got screwed up, and the manager was on vacation.  It sounds like she might ohave decided to extend it or something, cuz the people seemed very shocked to hear she wasn't there.  So, I'll have to wait through another week of anticipation.  So, that's it.  Ciao a tutti!
