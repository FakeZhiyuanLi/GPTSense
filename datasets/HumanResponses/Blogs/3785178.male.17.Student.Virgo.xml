      I cant believe that im actually making another online journal/diary thing. The last time I had one of these I was in 7th grade. Seems a little immature to go back and make one. But like I told Matt, I enjoy typing a lot more than I like writing. I remember back in Middle School, EVERYONE who was anyone had an online journal. I still don't really get why people write about their secret issues like they would in a private journal/diary online, on a PUBLIC journal thing. Doesn't really make sense to me, but hey...im doing it aren't I? Anyway...I remember I had my online journal till the middle of 9th grade, then after two incidents I decided it wasn't worth it anymore. The first one occurred at the end of my 8th grade year with one of my close friends at the time, Teresa (she moved away, up to West Palm Beach). She obviously had an online journal as well and was actually one of the people that talked me into starting one. Well, to sum up Teresa, she was never the cool cheerleader that everybody liked or even the nerdy art student who everybody knew but pretended not to. She was apart of our little "click" at school that everyone seemed to stay away from. And of course, people always made fun of us for the way we dressed and the music we listened to. It was so immature, but I guess that's middle school. Its funny cause I look back on it now and I think to myself...God damn was I a fat little idiot. And I see my sister going through the same fazes and changes that I did in/at her grade/age (wow, that's confusing to look at). Anyway, so we were all made fun of a lot and whatever. So Teresa writes about it in her online journal. And I think this was all about one or two years after the Columbine incident. And she's writing in her journal that she's gonna get these kids back before the end of the year and blah blah blah. But of course, all of us know she means just like make fun of them behind their backs because that's Teresa. She doesn't have the balls to walk up to one of them and hit them in the face. Or for that fact, bring a gun to school and shoot everybody up. So somehow somebody in the school reads that entry and decides to turn it in to the School board. And of course my journal has a direct link to hers and vice versa and I wrote stuff like that too in mine, so im not the little innocent angel either here. Well, we are both brought down to the office and blah blah shit happens. They talked to us about the "seriousness" of this situation and all that other garbage, whatever. In the long haul, Teresa gets expelled and I get suspended, for like a day and then my dad goes down there and raises hell. And well, that's the reason Teresa moves up to West Palm. I feel kind of bad sometimes cause we promised we wouldn't lose touch and I guess we really haven't, but we aren't nearly as close as we once were. I think that might have to do with the fact that she's doing drugs and drinking now, but whatever. Well, that pretty much sums up the first incident. The 2nd one happened with my first girlfriend. The summer right after 8th grade, I meet this incredibly hot girl in my neighborhood through my friend at the time, Johnny, who is actually her brother...go figure. She was such a nice person to me, knowing that I had never had any past experience with girls or anything. This was the girl I lost my virginity to...the sick part was, another girl was involved. That was the one weird thing about Jennifer, is that she was bi-sexual. She had this friend who lived down the street named Megan who was such a little whore and she was only 14. I think I was like just turning 15, so I guess im no better than she was. And Megan would come over and just hit on me non stop...I don't understand why, I was so fat and stupid then...still am, but...a little better. So anyway, we dated for about 3 months and then she broke up with me for some bogus reason, I forget why. I was completely devastated by this too, being my first girlfriend and all AND the girl I lost my virginity to, I was pretty fucked up by it all, so anyway. I knew the real reason behind it. It was because she wanted to date other people cause she was a whore. So yeah, I wrote about it in my online journal. And I called her a whore in it and blah blah and how we had sex in a threesome with another chick blah blah. And im guessing she knew what the address of my online journal was cause she showed her new boyfriend at the time who was this 6ft tall, in shape, knew martial arts, black guy. Yeah, bad news for me written all over that description. Well, I used to ride the bus home back then, cause I didn't have a car and Freddy hadn't moved down yet so I couldn't ride with him. So, one day I get off the bus and he for some reason rode our bus that day. Well, I have my headphones on and im walking home, and this guy decides he wants to fuck with me. He gets in my face and I take my headphones off. This dude doesn't say anything, he just hands me this piece of paper, which I find out later is my diary entry. And when I look down at the paper I look up right after and he fucking hits me in the face. He fucking sucker punches right in the face. Me, never being in a real fight before (only instances with which I've punched a kid out and held one up against a locker with one arm, I had never actually been in a fight with another kid swinging at me) fell to the ground like a ton of bricks. Woke up, walked home with a swollen face and that was that. I never saw the kid in school again though. I wasn't sure if he transferred or whatever...and Jennifer ended up moving so yeah. Those are my two reasons for not having an online journal anymore. Wow...I ended up writing a lot more than I had intended to. Well anyway, till next time...

      So today was boring. Woke up at 9am...ate breakfast (which Lyn made for me and Amanda...it was goooood) then went swimming and then I went to work. Nothing exciting happened at work so im gonna flash back to yesterday, which actually was fun and im gonna re-title my entry right here. Also im going to speak in the tense as if it were yesterday...or is yesterday...i dunno...   My Fun Day With Matt!!  Today was awesome. I really need to hang out with Matt more often. I love it, cause even if we dont do anything, if we are just sitting around, we always find something to talk about, no matter what. If its music, movies, video games...doesnt matter, always enjoyable. The only somewhat not enjoyable part of the day is when Roxy and Manda decided to come over and have a sit down talk. Which we found funny because I had suggested it earlier, before they came, to do something like that later in the night. So, we all sat down and tried discussing everyones feelings on everything. I  kind   of think it may have helped, but then again...its easy to say something like that wont happen again, but its a lot harder for it to not actually happen. I dunno. Well, after that we all decided to try and patch things up by having a quick lunch together at Taco Bell before parting our seperate ways. After that Matt and I went over to Circuit City to check out some games that Matt was thinking about buying cause he heard that they were selling them for cheap. They ended up not having any that he "needed" so went over to look at the music section, looked around there for a while where Matt spotted a three disk deal for only $20...he bought it and then we left and went over to Target. He got the stuff he needed and then we picked up Amanda and drove around looking for something to do but ended up just going back to his house. Stayed there till we had to go pick up Jason and then we went back to Matts and played some video games. It was a very enjoyable day. Im hoping Wednesday will be just as fun, cause thats my only other day off this week. Im also really excited about next week though...I get to go up to Port St. Lucie to visit my cousins who i havent seen for like over a year or two. The only downside is that my moms living there now and its gonna be extremely gay. Welp, till next time...  By the way...I LOVE THE MOUSE! ITS AWESOME!

      What a shitty 4th of July. I guess it wasnt too bad...except for the awkwardness between certain individuals. Of course i had to ditch work to have this "fun" day, and for that i got bitched at from my dad AND had a guilt trip given to me from my manager. Then me, Amanda, Roxanne, Matt and Courney drive down to Matt Harpers house to light off fireworks. That was actually a lot of fun, its really funny how afraid of fireworks Amanda really is. After all that, we (me and Roxanne really) decide we should go down to the beach, and Alex decides to come along too. So we get down there and its great, the waters so warm and me and Roxy give each other this look of "Oh god we wanna go in!" So finally we do. I actually took my shirt off...ewwww...and i somehow talked Roxy into taking her pants off. All she had on was a pink thong...jeez was that hot. I felt bad for looking since Amanda was there, but she has been pissing me off lately. Well, to make a long story short, Matt doesnt come in cause he doesnt like the beach to begin with and then of course Roxy and Amanda call him anti-social and all that, he gets pissed blah blah, everyone ends up pissed at each other. Then we drive back and Amanda decides to go with Alex and Roxy back to his house and leaves me home by myself (cause i had to be home early because of my dad), fucking god she pisses me off sometimes. I dont even know why i listen to her. She only ever thinks of herself. Of course she always does the lovey duvey shit. Oh i love you this, i love you that. But thats all it is. She can never compromise a situation. Its either her way or the highway. And she wonders why i get pissed off sometimes. Ive gotten to the point that i just want to punch her in the face, just square in the fucking face just so she would stop talking or laughing or whatever she was doing at the time. I wish things were the way they used to be when we first started going out. But i guess everybody wishes that from time to time. She doesnt get how things work sometimes though. If i ever make her feel bad for any little fucking thing, im a dick. And then all this drama with Matt and Roxanne. They talked...that did a lot of fucking good now didnt it?! All Matt wants to do is make everything out to be his fault, i keep telling him it isnt, but he just wont listen. And then Roxanne just doesnt understand why things happen when she does stupid shit...its like Amanda in a way...just she sometimes thinks things through a bit more...sometimes...UGH! I love them both though, i really do. I dont think i could think about life without them as friends...even though i havent really known either of them for very long, i feel so close to them. I just wish they could get past this fucking...THING between them. Its so frustrating. God this sucks. I havent felt this way in almost a year. Having so much shit on my mind that I just wanna cry 24/7. Of course thats a real pussy thing to say, but who cares...no one reads this damn thing anyway. First my mom decides she wants to come back into my life. And of course my asshole dad constantly getting on my case all the damn time. Then theres the pressures of money and thinking of how im gonna pay for college...what college im gonna go to. I dont even know anymore. Now all this other shit with two of my best friends AND more frustrations from my own girlfriend of a year. I wish this thing would give me some kind of feed back for my problems. I guess that kind of defeats the purpose of a journal though, huh? I mean, in a real book one you wouldnt get any feed back. Eh, whatever...im done writing, till next time...

      So today was pretty damn uneventful. I had to wake up early this morning to go down to my dads old shop in North Miami. The place is called Aamco, its kind of funny that even though my dad doesn't actually work there, he can go in and use the shop for whatever he wants...and the guy who owns the place still pays him $150 a week...FOR NO REASON! Well, there probably is a reason, since my dads a fucking gangster, he more than likely owes him money or some shit and he's paying it off slowly, lol. So im there till about 11:30am then my dad asks me to do him a favor. He hands me $10 and tells me to pick up my sister and her friend from the house and then drive down to Sheridan Street. Which is like a good 10 minute drive one way, and I was exhausted to begin with. The really shitty part is, that on the way back, I got fucking lost...and then it starts to down poor. Like cats and dogs down poor, it sucked. I ended up having to call my dad to figure out where I was. I hate the high-way sometimes, its not descriptive enough. Like one sign will say, "North," but the street you're already on is going North. And then there's no other sign saying that the road you are on now, is going to start going in a completely different direction then the one you were going in. ITS SO CONFUSING! Maybe im just dumb...or not...who knows. So anyway, I get home, take a nap, and go to work. And work is fine, no problems, lots of conversation, not too boring...but when we close Chris comes up to me and tells me my fucking drawer is $6.05 short. I don't understand how that happen, its never happened before. Well, good news is we made a tip cup that night and I made $3, so I gave him the three and he said he would cover the rest for me this time. God damn did that suck, lol. Wow...what an exciting day...and now I have to hope that I can somehow talk Rich (the new General Manager at the store) into not making me come in tomorrow ::wishes self good luck:: Welp, till next time...

      GOD DAMN IT! This is another major reason why I hate writing online. Because if you have a shit computer, like I do, and it freezes when you are in the middle of a very long entry...YOURE FUCKED! Cause then you lose everything you just said! GRRRR! Well, I guess I'll just sum up everything I said before...basically I was saying how Friday nights suck because usually I have to work. And then I went on into how I get confused with my thoughts. Mostly due to the on going struggle between good and evil inside my head. I guess it wasnt all that much...but it seemed like a lot since I went into such deep detail. Fuck it, thats enough for right now. Maybe I will write later...till next time.
