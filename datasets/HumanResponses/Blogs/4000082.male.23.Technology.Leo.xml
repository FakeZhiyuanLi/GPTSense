         That is a rather odd topic, you think. How can anyone like being imperfect? You maybe a person who is strict, following the rules and if someone is irregular in his work, you fire that person. You begin to think everything should be perfect only then you live a life worth living.      But is that true? Should everything in this world, every action you do, every place you see be perfect. That was not the ultimate creator's plan. Let's take an example. You go for a vacation in some hill station. You go to the viewing point and look at the hill ranges. Its a beauty you think. What if the hills were perfect, is that, some rectangular, some triangular etc.. You would not prefer a sight like this. Now what makes you generate the thought that you do not like perfect objects in the world. There is a sense of feeling in our mind that reminds you of getting bored of similar, continuos and perfect things in Life. Perfection comes out when you expect something to be the way and imperfection boils up when the particular action or thing does not meet the expectation or the image you have in your mind. If you are slightly imperfect that means you have learning more. How was your reaction when first saw the diagram of a circle. You would have complained, why its not rectangular and not perfect...but internally you have learned something being imperfect and you would have really loved the diagram because its your first time and first time is always beautiful.      Another thought...The next time you meet a person, try to be perfect...try to be a person who follows etiquettes by the rules. Your guest might hate you of being perfect and monotonous. Why? Because they want to see something different. That is the whole psychology behind the idea of not being perfect completely. If you are, then there is no difference between you and the robot. GOD has made nature not 100% perfect. GOD has made a world filled with wonderful things like Human beings, Animals, Trees, mountains, great seas, cool places and the like. He has not made it perfect, but that does not mean the creator is clumsy...the creator has done this with a reason.       Why do you visit so many places around the world, Why do you explore unknown things, Why are trees and leaves not same across the world and why do you behave in a different way every other day? Imperfection brings a sense of not being a repetitive. If you behave the same way every day then you are titled as "not an interesting person". Take the example of "The Leaning Tower of Pisa". Will people visit the tower if it would not have been tilted a little? I think now you are trying to realize something. Perfection does not always lead you to a great Life. Well it may give you a high and respected life but it will not be exciting. That's what people talk about...the excitement of experiencing which is out of the normal, which your brain has never conceived before.       This brings us to another sub-discussion. Imagine you are given a Leaf which is, say, yellowish green and you are put the statement  (A) "Is the Leaf, Green or not?". If you are a perfect guy then you would say green, since it should be either green or yellow. That's how computers work, right...its base on 1s and 0s, true or false. Well that is perfect.  What would a normal guy with a tinge of imperfection do? He would say that the "Degree to which the leaf is green must be somewhere between 0.4 and 0.6?". Which means that the degree to which the statement (A) is true depends on a certain factor which determines how much its true or false. Well computers cannot do such reasoning because they are so perfect and we have the ability to think "FUZZY". In other words this imperfection was the foundation of "FUZZY LOGIC".       Lets come back to the less technical discussion.The point where both Imperfection and Beauty merges is seen here. The thing or sight you call beauty wouldn't be perfect...you would think it is perfect but it isn't. Because its the first time you see it and you never saw anything like that before, then it has a tinge of imperfection, as perfect things are already witnessed. There wouldn't be that variety, there wouldn't be that spice and there wouldn't be that sense of enjoyment in the Life you live.      So what message I am trying to convey is that don't expect everything, every event, every being and every action you do to be perfect. Its always okay to be a little imperfect. This gives you a oppurtunity to live a life full of surprises, to meet lot of interesting people, to visit lot of interesting places and a Life where you could do a lot interesting things.  Such is the beauty of imperfection.

          Last blog we discussed the importance of TIME as a term used by human beings and I asked a very important question. Where are you in TIME...PAST, PRESENT OR FUTURE??      Let us discuss this for sometime.You are living in this world at some instance of time which cannot be measured. You are moving through TIME but are not stopping. You are standing still in space according to one reference plane but you are moving in time. You must have seen the sun (not with the naked eye). It takes light to reach here in a few seconds. You have also seen stars. But stars are so far that the distance has to measured in Light Years. That is you are seeing the past with your eyes. Confused !!!? If you see the star from earth, you are not seeing at the instant of time as it happens. Its probably a reflection from the past because Light should have reached days ago.        So you are a human being who is neither in the past, present nor in the future. You are continuosly going forward according to TIME. Imagine you are a giant photographer and that you can cover the whole world in one shot. Suppose you take a snapshot at one instance of time. What if you take a snapshot every x period ( take it as the smallest unit of TIME known to human ). Take those snapshots for say 100 x units. Develop those photographs and arrange it in a flipbook. Flip those pages through. You can actually see the whole world in action but slowly. Flip it at the rate you took those photographs, you can see the worldly action normally. Flip it very fast simultanaeosly doing everything mentioned and you see things moving fast. What if you had a guy who develops and another guy who flips it.      Let us do the thought experiment once again. You take the photographs in a period 100 times less than x. One guy develops and another guy flips in the same speed. Will you expect to see the future since you see light, capture it, develop it and flip through it at a speed which is 100 times faster than light. Maybe you would have increased the frequency of flip, thus increasing the clarity of the action. This we have to think. What we are doing here is we take the shot at only place. Suppose you are taking the shot and covering y  distance (which is the smallest distance know to humans). Do the same procedure as above. The next time do it at 100 times more than y. So you cover more distance than necessary and you end up taking the picture of the same place as before but faster. And that you arrive at some instant of time in the same place but you have reached there before light can reach the same place. You compete with time and take those photos before light can actually reach there.     The point I am making here is, Are you sure the past vanishes forever? Are you sure that the future cannot be seen in any instant? Its all a matter of travelling faster or slower than light. But how does this explain TIME? There should be relationship between Light, Space and Speed and TIME. Humans have the capability to see the stars (past), its all a matter of seeing it faster than the event  occurs. You have to witness the event before it takes place. If past of the stars vanishes you may never see the star or the reflection of it again. So past according to the star is the future existence of the star when you take at the instant of time you see here. If you continuosly see the star, that means there is a future for the star because you are seeing the past as a reflection of the future. The moment you think that the star has no future the past reflection vanishes and there is no future. So Past and future always coexist.      Let us take another bizarre thought. You thought of moving from place A to place B in some period of TIME. But if you go faster than light. You can actually see (standing from place B) yourself coming at a normal place from place A to B because you reached there before light reached place B.       When I mentiioned photos, I think there must be multiple universes which represent each of the frames captured. Its only that you see the flipbook. You are free to go to any frame or universe provided you have the infrastructure and the mindset. You are currently in a universe, say you are reading a book. In another universe you may be jogging. All these universe exists simultaneously. Its only that you move through the universes when you do some action and reach another universe later than light did. So TIME is not a constraint.  Our mind is trained to see an object at a slightly lesser speed than light reaches there. If you cheat light you can actually move faster or go  backward to any of the universes based on your preferences. You will find that you are doing the same thing over and over again at any particular universe.     So my friends to cut the discussion short and keep the rest to some of the later blogs, I would say TIME is not constrained andimmeasureable, but TIME exists. Maybe the world is already over and the universe does not exist at a far later instant right now, its only  that we would see the reflections of it later on when we travel at a lesser speed than light and witness the event after it happens.       Take this on a positive note. Maybe you are a millionaire in the future and you are already living through it at a later point of time in another universe in the distant future, its only that you experience it later. Who knows?   :-)

      &nbsp; There I was getting up from my bed (usually from the right side) and immediately what would be my first reaction? Look at my watch. It is almost a habit for me and I am sure for everybody. They look at their watch and say "Oh My God! I am late for office&nbsp;again". Everybody would go in panic, some go to office, some to school, college, important meeting are based on time, events are recorded based on time, some say its good time, some say its bad, for some time is too long (college lectures), for some its too short (a date), some make great discoveries (Einstein) base on it, some scorn at the transport because its not maintaining time.  &nbsp; NOW, WAIT A MINUTE  &nbsp; Just stop and think about who invented time, when did the first second start, who divided time, who gave each unit of it weird names, when does it stop and plenty of other questions.&nbsp; TIME has been there from time immemorial. Nobody knows when it started. &nbsp;&nbsp; What is TIME? Here is how I think of it.  &nbsp; When the cosmic egg broke, that was considered to be the start of time as some scientists say. But there was time before that also. Let me explain this way. This is an thought experiment so you have to do most of the part.  &nbsp;"Stop looking at your watch or shall I say the one that ticks at your right hand bottom of your screen.&nbsp; Think that there is no time. What will be the world if there was no time. Imagine you are doing your daily chores.&nbsp; Go to your office or wherever by following your instincts. Wake up from the bed, go to your office, come back from your office and&nbsp;&nbsp; take rest only by following your instincts. Does the world stop rotating if there was no time. But let me contradict my own&nbsp;  &nbsp;statements. What if everybody started following the same procedure, that is without looking at the watch you do your work. You do&nbsp;&nbsp; your work great. But does that match the instincts of your fellow human being. "  &nbsp;&nbsp; You are going to meet somebody at a hotel. How will you convey the message to your friend. Will you say to him to follow his instincts and come to the hotel. I am not saying that you or your friends instincts are wrong. All I am saying both of your instincts do not sync up. TIME is a feeling, an instinct that GOD has built in you for doing different things in one human day.Say you are cooking and you have already started it. If there is no time how will you end it, you will be doing the particular activity continously. But on the contrary you will end it. That period of you doing a specific acivity is called a Period and that can be TIME.  &nbsp; So some smart human being maybe to solve the problems of syncing up the instincts, giving a specific name to an activity you do at one particular period which is again driven by instincts, gave a name to all of this. Guess what...TIME? He must have divided the whole idea of time into very little pieces. OR let us say the smallest amount of period a human being can possibly do a specific work or the smallest amount he could probably imagine and put to use in his work.  &nbsp; The word TIME is flexible my friend.  &nbsp;Here is another "exagerated" illustration.   Some guy told to another guy," I will meet in you in an minute". Probably that was the smallest unit known some ages back. That guy came before a minute and had a quarrell that he was not specific. So the people decided to divide minute into seconds and so that everybody could sync up with other's instincts more accurately and that meeting will now take place based on seconds. Another guy said "Hey, Watch out for that rock is going to fall on you in a second". But before that the man was dead. Again the council decided to break seconds into smaller pieces and so on and so forth."  &nbsp; Like the illustration, TIME had many forms like days, years, light years and on the other extreme a milli second, a nano second, etc.  &nbsp; Believe it or not you can also name TIME in any way you want. Suppose you need a term called ONE KINGKONG YEAR to say a thousand billion million years. You can go ahead and name that. But do you really need it? Will you really use it? If put in use how many people will need this term. There might be a council to decide this for what terms are more generally used. They also make sure that these terms are imaginable and conceivable by the human mind.  &nbsp; All I am saying is TIME is a term which gives meaning to your instincts, constraints you daily activity, plans your life, syncs up other's instincts. NOW TIME has become so great that our instincts have to sync up with TIME, so that everyone follow the general rule. TIME is a very big term, there might be know start or no end as the humn mind can think of. So you simplify it such that it can be of use to a normal human being.  &nbsp; So if you know what is TIME, you are the ultimate person....NO THERE IS STILL MORE.  &nbsp; Can you answer this question?  &nbsp; At what point of time are you now? PAST, PRESENT OR FUTURE.  IF YOU SAY PRESENT...you have already gone through all three of them HOW? HERE'S HOW.&nbsp;When you were about to say "PRE", that maybe the PRESENT.&nbsp;When you were about to finish "PRE" and start "SE", you may have been in the present now, but "PRE" is past now and&nbsp;"NT" is the future.When you were about to say "NT"...you have already thought "NT" in your mind...and what goes on after saying"SE" and before saying "NT" that may be the future.and "PRESE" may be in the past and when you spell out "NT" that might be the present and you are already for the next word.  &nbsp;So where are you? PAST, PRESENT OR FUTURE ???  &nbsp;We explore more deeply in my next blog. ;-)

      &nbsp; I was walking down the streets towards the market, casually going through the fresh vegetables. Suddenly I tried an experiment.   &nbsp; What&nbsp; if was from a different planet who has come to earth on a school assignment, the topic being "Why human beings are human beings and not any other species"?  &nbsp;&nbsp; I witnessed a lot of human beings in the market, some buying, some bargaining, some&nbsp; fighting, some happy, some dissatisfied. Why am I a human being and why should I walk through the streets experimenting people,&nbsp; Why should I have the ability to talk and think more than the other species. Out of the 1,84,000 (maybe more) different species in planet earth why am I chosen to be born as a human. Why are you chosen and why are you reading this?  &nbsp; These are some of the questions that raise through my so called brain. There must be some reason behind this. There is a higher being above us who constantly takes care of creation and the super infinite being is responsible for selecting me as a human. Why?&nbsp; Because I am the ONE...the chosen ONE.  &nbsp; We are all the chosen one. Each one is embedded with different characteristics, skills, mindset and body. We are born in this earth to do something. To help our fellow beings in some way. We are not here to waste our time. Human species is a wonderful creation and GOD takes pride in it. So GOD selects a particular soul to be a human only if one has the right privileges. One must have done something super good in the past lives as other creatures. Being a human is a reward in itself. Being a healthy human is an added advantage.  &nbsp;&nbsp; We are all sent to earth, each with a different purpose. Each one's destiny is already charted out. Its only that when if we achieve something, we feel great that we have changed destiny. Its a simulation that GOD provides. If you don't choose to take the path of what destiny has provided that itself is your destiny. Each one contributes to the society in some way. Some are doctors, engineers, industrialist, sports person, movie star, Law breakers, Law enforcers and the list goes on. When you take you and your profession, you are also contributing to one unit to build the future. But there must be a balance in this. What happens if world is only full of engineers, there is nobody to save precious lives. What happens when the world is full of Law Enforcers, there would be no theft, no job for the Law enforcers and eventually no news and no Information. Everything would seem stolid.  &nbsp; So think, ponder, comprehend, contemplate that what you are doing currently is in some way going to affect the future. You are doing your bit to help GOD maintain the balance. Whatever you need to do your work correctly, GOD provides you. It may seem that you are tried and tested with many challenges in Life, but that is only to make you more experienced and more dedicated to the work you do, so that you can contribute that one bit extra to humankind for taking us more near to the future. Such people turn out to be architects, scientists, innovative thinkers and world leaders. They are a kind on its own. Not anybody can be a president. There can be only one of a kind people like these. There can be only one Eistein, one Teresa, one Lincoln, one Galileo and the list never ends.  &nbsp; You can also be in the list of extra contributors in the future, who knows?   &nbsp; So what I am saying is, since we are all human beings and have the special privilege to help our fellow human beings and other living beings we should be more responsible for what we are thinking, doing or saying in order to contribute to the society. I am not trying to tell you that you should be a world contributor, just be a contributor to your nearest society and your nearest beings and contribute to humankind how much little you can.  &nbsp;&nbsp; If everybody does that little to the world then we would have a great place to live and a better tomorrow.    &nbsp;&nbsp; So what are you doing sitting there, go out there and do something ;-)

      &nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes I feel so lonely that I sit by the window and gaze at the stars. I also felt someone talking to me even though nobody is near me. I had felt the same voices which have saved me from difficult times and telling me not to give up, I have felt the same voice when I saved many lives in a bus accident years ago, I felt the same voice congratulating me when I won my first award and I have felt it when I am always alone and telling me that somebody is there to take care of me. Who is this? Why is it following me? What good does it get when it&nbsp; helps me, encourages me, Warns me of danger, loves me, protects me and takes care of me 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days in a year.  Could somebody tell me what is happening to me?  &nbsp; STOP...I really know who it is? Do you also want to know or share the same excitement that I am going through.? Its none other than the warrior inside you...the ultimate war machine which nobody except god can stop it.  &nbsp; Every person has a warrior within waiting to be called, waiting to be kindled, waiting to give it control to destroy the negative forces that overpower you and harm you. Everybody has a hero inside which can save many lives, everybody has a child inside that cares and everybody has warrior inside who is highly trained, only that you have to call it, seek help and give it the control.  &nbsp; What happens to a person who is&nbsp; in deep trouble. He has no way out and he has nobody to take care and nobody to take help from. What is last thread of existence, who will you rely on? ....YOU....ITS ALWAYS YOURSELF  who you can rely on, trust and seek guidance. Just be silent for sometime and hear the voices inside you...hear the warrior telling you something....hear him and merge with the warrior to fight back and show the world who you are.  &nbsp; Its all a matter of listening to yourself. When you decide something the inner voice will help you to make the perfect decision because the warrior knows, the warrior has already laid plans for you to be a success...All you have to do is listen closely, attentively and with full sincerity. What pushes you to save people when you witness a disaster. Even if you are a young guy, old guy or a coward you will suddenly feel the rush of power within you, the urge to save people. Who gives you that power. It is GOD who is giving you the power in the form of a warrior inside you. GOD has implanted a hero in everybody just in case you turn out to be a chicken.   &nbsp; Warriors within do not wake when you cry to yourself and plead it to come out. It does not like cowards. The only way to awaken the warrior is to convince it that you really want to acheive something you desire no matter what, no matter how difficult it is and no matter who you should confront to acheive it. Only then the War machine wakes up and surprises people with the new found ablility, the sudden rise of power that comes within you, the feeling you get when the warrior wakes up.   &nbsp; GO AHEAD...LISTEN TO THE WARRIOR AND GIVE THE WARRIOR A CHANCE WHO IS WAITING TO HELP YOU.&nbsp; GOOD LUCK.  &nbsp;

      &nbsp; The other day I was travelling in the bus from home to office. As usual I was the first guy to board the bus and that day was special to me in some way. So I chose to sit in the Last seat available in the bus to get a good view of the passengers boarding. I noticed something very interesting. People boarding the bus do not always choose "any" seat in the bus, they choose "the" seat in the bus which satisfies them based on some parameters. So how does the selection occur...what makes a person not to choose the first seat available in the bus&nbsp; and what makes them decide that the seat they have chosen is best for them.  &nbsp; Let us think abou this scenario for sometime. Take a simple bus which has some seats (say 30 seats) and the window in every seat is either open or closed. I am going to brainstorm ...so here goes  The Parameters (not an ordered list) that race through a simple guy's brainif the weather is pretty sunny:  The place in the seat... 1) ...should be comfortable. 2) ...should be near to the window. 3) ...should not be near to the door to avoid taking a hit from people rushing in 4) ...can be the first seat near to the driver so that one can get a good view of the road. 5) ...can be the last seat so that one can have privacy while, say reading a book and to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; avoid curious people taking a peek from your back. 6) ...should not be over the tyre of the bus to avoid a bumpy ride 7) ...should not be near a fat person who takes 3/4 th of the space leaving you enough space&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to keep your toe. 8) ...should not be near a place which is surrounded with people who talk loudly and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; keep interfering with what you are doing. 9) ...should not be near a pole so that if you are in a jam packed bus you do not get pain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because a person was leaning on youu all the time and when confronted, shouts at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you and says "Hey this is not a god damn airplane but a stinky bus". 10) ...should not&nbsp; be near a person who keeps coughing right in your face and if adviced&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; would reply back that his disease would come back to him if he closes his mouth 11) ...should be usually in the left side for right handed people and vice versa so that&nbsp;the active hand is not hindered by keeping it on the window and if you give change to the conductor the window sill might hit your working hand and cause injury. 12) ...more to come...it must be your contribution  These parameters vary according to:  1) ...your gender (male or female)...females usually don't like to be seated near males&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who keep staring at them. 2) ...your region of socialism, that is you can be a person who is comfortable&nbsp; in a crowded place, or you may need some extra space. People in thickly populate countries&nbsp;are comfortable with crowd and in scarcely populated place cannot handle the crowd. 3) ...your body size...compact or extra large...you might not fit into the whole seat. 4) ...the weather...summer, winter, rainy etc...for example in the rainy season you&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; may not prefer the seat near the window and cleverly offer the seat to a person&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so that he/she may think you are doing it because you are compassionate ;-) 5) ...the character...you do not care which seat...you care for the best seat. 6) ...the proximity of your place...suppose you are travelling long distance you may&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; select the last seat so nobody disturbs you while you are sleeping. 7) ...your familiarity of the place...if you are a new guy to the city, it is best to select the place&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; near the window so that you get to know the place better and remember landmarks and also&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to avoid getting down at the wrong stop. 8) ...availablity of seats...if there is only one last seat left you should be selecting that or else. 9) ...the list never ends.  &nbsp;These parameters are selected, ordered, priortized, weighed the pros and cons andgiven input to the brain in fraction of a millisecond. But its still a mystery to most of us of what goes in our brains.  &nbsp;&nbsp; The seat selection psycholgy varies according to the environment whether its in a bus,a cinema hall, while selecting a job, while travelling a train but some of these point would holdgood.  &nbsp; I don't know why I wrote this, but I surely captured what was racing throught my mind. Till the next interesting blog...au revoir. :-)

      &nbsp; The other day I was thinking really hard for my next blog, my head was totally blank and I decided to play a video game "MAX&nbsp; PAYNE". &nbsp; I played it for an hour or so and suddenly realised I should blog this...WHY?Because there is an important lesson embedded into the game. Only you have to look through it and not just play the game. &nbsp; Max Payne is the lead character in the game...a honest and upcoming police officer living with his beautiful wife and his healthy  baby. Everything was so perfect...his family...his friends...his job and all. But what happens when a man is scraped out with all that  is perfect in his life...what will he do if his wife, child and his dearest friend dies and what happens if he was purposefully framed  and lost his job...What would you do in such a situation. Turn to an astrologer...Wait until the next big oppurtunity comes...Cry over  your misfortunes...Hurt everyone by sad words. That's the typical mindset. &nbsp; Let us take another scene from a famous movie "PAYBACK" by Mel Gibson. He was cheated by his girlfriend...shot by his friend,  stripped of his money and washed out his dreams and came to a near death experience. What else is left in his Life? He is lying in  the road with blood oozing from his viens and half unconsious and witnessing his own girlfriend running away with his dearest  friend whom he had put all his trust...What will he do now? What future can you predict at this guy...What can be recovered and  What hope can you give a man at this stage of Life??? What is common in both their lives...they are at the bottomest pit of their lives with nobody to help...nobody to catch when they fall  back and nobody to give hope. &nbsp;But what do they do...they decide not to cry over&nbsp; spilled milk or broken eggs...they decide to fight back...they decide to come  up....they decide to overcome their fears of future and overcome their weakness. &nbsp; At this point a guy has nothing to lose...he gets up. His only goal in his Life is to find who did this to him. That's it...he is  concentrating so much in his goal that he ignores or removes whatever hindrance comes in his path...no matter whom...no matter  what...,and no matter when the negative force strikes you. &nbsp;People should have this ability to bootstrap with nobody's help and come up in Life. There are times when you are pushed to the limits...pushed against the wall...dumped into a ditch and made to eat the dust from  your peers and higherups. These times are oppurtunites to get to know "Who you really are?" and "What material you really are  made up of?". &nbsp;What happens to a buoy (which&nbsp; is floating alone in the sea) when you push it. It comes back....push it down harder...it will come  back with double the force...push it to the depths of the sea bed...IT WILL COME BACK WITH A JUGGERNAUT FORCE that you  don't know what happened and you don't know what hit you. &nbsp;Such is the power of setting goals and to be one-tracked like a horse in a race where it can see only one direction...When you set a  goal...focus and go for it...your path is clear there is nothing in this god damn world...no creature...no power...no human being and  no physical thing that can stop you from attaining it. &nbsp;I am not saying that something bad should happen in your life to be successful...All I am saying is that at difficult times this blog  may help you to rise and remind you that there is always hope when you set a goal and pursue it with dogged determination and  dedication and that you have many facets of your life still to be explored...all you need to do is channel it in the right directiion and  ignore and fight back the negative forces that hinder your path and influence your goal. I think I got you pumped up such that you can face any worst situation in your life and still stay on track Until the next blog..See ya and BEST OF LUCK

                                 In   SOME THOUGHT ON CORPORATE WORK PSYCHOLOGY - PART 2   we were analyzing &nbsp;the roles a        person plays in a meeting        &nbsp;        This blog is a continuation of that subject.        &nbsp;          ROLE 2 ANALYSIS:          &nbsp;        &nbsp;This person has more knowledge and less contribution.        &nbsp;        Seems to be fine because he has to let others participate and ask questions.        This role is played by experienced people attending New Guy training.        So again if we take Role 2 Scenarios we come up with:        &nbsp;         Scenario1:    This person has more knowledge and less useful contribution.      Well it can be a bit irritating since he cannot help the new comers reframe the questions they are        trying to ask and can create a impression that this person is sitting with his ego pumped up.        So I think this scenario cannot &nbsp;be satisfactory.        &nbsp;        But let us take Scenario 2        &nbsp;         Scenario2:    The person who has more knowledge and less useless contribution can be       acceptable as the sentence says. So I think this scenario should be fine.        &nbsp;          ROLE 3 ANALYSIS:          &nbsp;        Ah, The Role 3 guy&#8230;seen many a times in corporate environments who is fresh in certain        Domain. He has less knowledge and less contribution. But this is not acceptable in corporate        world since this person should atleast know some basics of what is discussed about and should be        willing to learn.        &nbsp;        The scenarios again:         &nbsp;         Scenario 1:    The person has less knowledge and less useful contribution. He keeps on talking that      he knows everything and spills out less useful facts to the team. This is very very Dangerous        situation because the team members cannot discourage that what he talks is useless and that        he can waste the time of meeting by contributing things out of the subject because he gets a complex        and starts off suddenly just to show that he is the one rolling the ball.        &nbsp;        So watch out people&#8230;persons like this can be made to shift to one of the other acceptable quadrants.        &nbsp;         Scenario2:    This person has less knowledge and less useless contribution.      &nbsp;        Sounds fair..this guy is a new kid in the block and that he makes no mistakes while contributing or        asking doubts.        &nbsp;        So go for this scenario at any point of your life.        &nbsp;         ROLE 4 ANALYSIS:          &nbsp;         Less knowledge and more contribution. This seems fair if this guy contributes more usefully as in   Scenario1.          This person can bring his/her domain level expertise from a known domain to an unknown domain and finds        a correlation so that both parties who know his domain the best can share ideas and learn about unknown domains        Should be the ideal scenario when people of different roles meet and discuss.        &nbsp;        &nbsp;But this can be very harmful to the meeting if he is on   Scenario 2   &nbsp;that is he contributes more useless facts        and has less knowledge. Half Knowledge is dangerous.        &nbsp;        So to wrap up the discussion we have to be in one of the quadrants and in one of those role scenarios.        Let me sum up the good and bad role-scenarios:        &nbsp;          GOOD ROLES:          &nbsp;        &nbsp;        Role 1: Scenario 1:&nbsp; This person has more knowledge and more useful contribution.        Role 2: Scenario 2: &nbsp;This person has more knowledge and less useless contribution        Role 3: Scenario 2: &nbsp;This person has less knowledge and less useless contribution.        Role 4: Scenario 1: &nbsp;This person has less knowledge and more useful contribution        &nbsp;        And Watch Out for the other roles (  &#8220;NOT OK ROLES&#8221;  ) if not listed here, those are dangerous.        &nbsp;        So whenever we are in a meeting we can use the Knowledge vs. Contribution graph        and populate with the names of the meeting members. After that we must analyze        which scenario they belong to. And then you should be interacting more with the        GOOD Roles mentioned above and try to give feedback or help them if you have        categorized in the &#8220;NOT OK: Roles.        &nbsp;        So let us divert our topic and explore something else which comes out of my mind in my next blog.        &nbsp;        Seeya.

      Last blog I was talking about a weird formula which brings out the end result of a team .   What I am now trying to do is take scenarios and explain the roles each individual plays in a meeting.   So here goes the different roles represented in a graphical manner:       Let us analyze the chart since if we go deep lot of truths reveal:  Before that I want to emphasize the fact contribution is further divided into useful and  useless contribution.   ROLE1 ANALYSIS:   &nbsp; Role 1 should be the best, as this person has more &nbsp;knowledge and more contribution.   Scenario 1: &nbsp;This person has more knowledge and more useful contribution.  Scenario 2: &nbsp;This person has more knowledge and more useless contribution.   &nbsp;But can a guy with more knowledge contribute in a useless way. So this is a contradiction  and you would be thinking that useless contribution means less knowledge. No that is not the case.   &nbsp;Here’s an example. This guy has more knowledge in particular domain which the meeting is about.  But since he has more knowledge he overdo’s the contribution by asking Hi-Fi Technical questions and in that  Way the other team members cannot sync up with his way of thinking. So in a way he contributes more  to the meeting but not contributing the way others understand.   So watch out. Scenario 1 of ROLE1 supercedes Scenario 2

                                 &nbsp; Once upon a time there lived a manager&#8230;and so the journey starts of being a IT Guy and all        sitting for hours in front of the Laptop typing weird characters and numbers that come almost parallely        from my interconnected neurons in my brain, pumping bio-electrical signals wherein each neuron contests        according to god&#8217;s weird algorithms that he prepared to get one god damn alphabet through my hand and converting        it to a series of key strokes and all this I am doing for earning my daily bread and butter ?        &nbsp;        &nbsp;&nbsp;Is this all that an IT Job is about? No there is much more than that.        &nbsp;        &nbsp; There is a very interesting phenomenon which takes place in corporate workplace.        That is the topic of this blog...CORPORATE WORK PSYCHOLOGY.        &nbsp;        &nbsp; Its very fun to watch human beings making a comment about other human beings. People        in a meeting never ask the same question and never share the same thought (sounds like a theorem).        &nbsp;        Well its all about mindset people have. Most of them do not have open mindedness.        &nbsp;        Why is this happening? Why can&#8217;t people free their mind?        Why can&#8217;t there be a dream corporation where everybody gives hand to everybody for advantage        of their individual development and that of the corporation.         &nbsp;        Corporations boast that they have great team which can deliver what they want&#8230;that&#8217;s it&#8230;that&#8217;s        What corporations are concerned of the damn end result. But do they know what goes on the mindset of an individual        in that team, the sub team members which is formed by neglecting a particular individual who is smart, out of the box        and finally the team as a whole which finally contributes the end result.        &nbsp;        Well there might be some formula for this of how the weightage to the end result counts.        &nbsp;        Here goes a fictious formula        0.4* (Sub-team contribution ) + 0.4 * (Smart individual contribution) + 0.2 * (Whole Team contribution) = END RESULT        &nbsp;        Well&#8230;got anything from this&#8230;I write more about this in my next BLOG        &nbsp;        &nbsp;

      Hey guys...This is a Test Blog...history in the making.

        My next blog is going to be on.....Well I was thinking hard while I was waiting for the bus stop and while I was travelling in the lift to my office floor...you know what's interesting in these scenarios...well let's see that in this blog.    I have noticed people of three categories when they are waiting.    Either:   A) You wait...alone.   B) You wait...with two people ( you and your friend )   C) You wait...with your group.   Let us look at their behaviour and state of mind:  Case A  :       In this case you wait for an event to happen...like arrival of the bus or the Lift to come to your floor.  Remember there is also a factor of space here. In the bus stop you have a large space and in the Lift a small one.   Large Space: (Bus Stop)  When you are in the bus stop, have you noticed these chain of reactions:  1) You first look left and right...and see whether the bus comes. 2) Then you look at your watch...to show you are a busy person. 3) ...you look at your belongings...fumble ( at this time people start noticing you ) 4) ...you scan all the people who are also waiting. 5) ...you look up and down. 6) ...Now since its a large space...you have many interesting things to gaze upon...like     you start noticing all the vehicles that go by, Maybe you look at a shop and see what they are   upto. 7) ...Now its already 5 minutes and you shake your head for showing others that you are annoyed and  convincing them that you are a very busy person ;-) 8) ...You may draw patterns in the ground with your shoe. 9) ...you massage you face or eyes. 10...Some people cleverly read a book and forget all the steps mentioned above.   Small Space: (Lift)  Well now since the space is small, you have to do something.  Suppose your floor is the 30th or something...now that's a looong way.  1) People usually stare at the Floor number display which changes rapidly. 2) ...you may also look down or fumble with your pocket. 3) ...you may also look at your watch and show everybody your new watch ;-) 4) ...Some people watch others what they are doing. 5) ...you may read the warning or message board in the lift without even missing a single sentence. 6) ...Some pray god their floor should come fast to save them from this boredom.   Case B:   Differs when two people are in this category. In both case you may end up talking like crazy...in the bus stop you may talk about a known subjectbut in the lift you may blabber since everybody is hearing your conversation...you might also talk about the party you attended last sunday...which your friend may be least interested in.  But the hours go fast and Abracadabra here the bus arrives.   Case C:    This is a bit complicated since it depends on the group you are in.  If you are in a very talkative group...the hours will be like minutes and you might think the bus should have been more late. But if you are left alone in th group and you end up laughing (forcefully) at other's jokes then you must refer Case A...you go back to square one and minutes will feel like hours.  Anyway some crazy thought I documented...Hope your minutes did not turn into lightyears ;-)
