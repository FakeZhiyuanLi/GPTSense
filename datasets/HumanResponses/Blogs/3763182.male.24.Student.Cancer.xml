      	I have laid back and taken this for too long. Anyone that is for Anti-abortion, Anti guns, anti smoking, anti-gay marriage, anti-meat, anti -liquor, anti-hunting, anti-flag burning, anti-violent video games, anti-lottery, anti-cock fighting, anti prostitution, anti-loitering, anti-atheist, anti Democrat, Anti- Republican or various other things is anti American! If I snatch your Dr. Pepper away and say you can only drink coke, that is taking away your right to chose Pepsi or drink Dr.peper even if I say it's "because sugar is bad for you and could be a risk to  national security" that is still taking one of your freedoms away.  And if you ask me there are already too few of them now! We need to hold on to and keep every damn one of them that we have left! Or else we might as well march back to the 17th century, when England told us we had to be a certain religion and we couldn't bad mouth the king without being charged with treason.   	I don't care if a terrorist is going to fly a plane into a building once a year, once a month or even once every day. Giving up freedom for security is not a justifiable reason for taking freedoms away and it sure as hell is not the answer to the terrorism problem! It is an excuse, and a pour one at that, to give the government more power and take it away from you and I.  	But all right, we'll pretend for just a second that it does work and is a great way to keep national security. And I will explain this to you people in words that even the dumbest of chimps can understand. About a year ago the public wanted to ban smoking in public because no one liked the smell, it was bad for the people, whatever their reason was they didn't like it. And they passed a law saying  that you had to either be a smoke free restaurant, and all smoking restaurant or install an expensive ventilation system. People paraded through the streets and celebrated that they had beat back the evil beast that was "cigarette smokers". Now that's all fine and good because  smokers are a minority and the majority was happy to see smokers leave their smoke outside.   	Now they have moved on to breast feeding, I mean no one likes partial nudity anymore right? They are still a minority and there's even less of them than there were smokers. So lets all jump on the anti breast feeding wagon and ban that. Then it will be perfume, because some people are allergic to, perfume so lets ban that and soon enough we'll ban books because they inspire people to think and if people think they could break the law. Open your eyes people so you can see that if you take something away from someone and say they can no longer do it , it will only be a matter of time before they take something away from you and tell you the same.
