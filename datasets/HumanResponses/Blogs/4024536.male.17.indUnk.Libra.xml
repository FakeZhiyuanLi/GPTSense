      I've already managed to secure myself a copy of every episode of WPT, season 1. Before I beging working on the next season I need to copy these over to cd- I'll be the coolest kid on the block, always carrying around 20 solid hours of poker goodness.  I am such a geek.  Also, I'm putting out a call to people who want input on the next big article I'm doing- reading betting patterns. All input is appreciated, and you will get credit.  That's all for now, I'm off to burn some  urlLink Shana Hiatt .  P.S. - Not that I particularly care, but has anyone figured out   why   she's on the WPT?

       urlLink Poker Charts  is incredibly useful- I've switched over from a cheap excel graph to this service. While I don't have enough data yet to have useful correlations and usage of the data I've inputted, it looks like top notch work. I suggest it for anyone serious about their game and want a constant tracking.

      The bluff is the signature move of poker, known by even poker newbies. It is quite possibly the most tempting action to take, as players miss their fair share of flops. Likewise, there is nothing quite like forcing a superior hand to fold to your mere 4 high, underlining your superior play- it is the very meaning of poker; the ability to win money without the hand.  However, the best steps to bluffing are not well known. Many players are under the impression that a good bluff is firing out a large sum of money at the right time. They believe that a  great  bluff is firing a large sum of money at a pot  twice  to have a great hand laid down to you. Of course this isn’t true – it’s simply gutsy. And while this works on occasion, it simply isn’t the best way to play.  Instead, consider this method.  Sklansky’s mathematical theory of poker states that every time you act as if you knew your opponent’s cards, you gain and they lose, as well as vice versa. From this, we gain the first steps to a solid bluff.    Figure out what your opponent has- there is no sense in attempting to bluff a man that has a made hand.  Conceal your hand through your betting.   Take a look at  urlLink this post  and you’ll find the next step. From that, we know to:   Never bluff players that can not be bluffed, such as calling station and dimwits that are not capable of making the reads you assume they will make.   Two more conditions to consider when bluffing:   Don’t bluff an empty pot- you yield nothing, and risk much. Likewise, rarely is it correct to bluff an empty sidepot, even if one player is all in. Checks around is good enough.  Consider the board. An opponent will fold two pair if there is an obvious straight or flush apparent, or perhaps a higher pair on the board. However, if there is not much on the board that can beat him, then there is little chance he’ll fold.   If the player you’re bluffing has no clue what kind of hand you have and you know that he will probably fold if he believes he’s beat, as well as the condition of pot size and a bluff-able board, the air is ripe for a bluff. The next stage in the bluff is not, like some unfortunately believe, to bet the amount that the opponent is uncomfortable in calling with his hand, but instead to make the opponent believe you hold the best hand. Constantly consider what you think the opponent has. Bet your hand  exactly  as if you had the cards you’re representing. Be sure to constantly check if your read on the player is correct. Do not over bet, do not under bet. You must bet as if you have the better hand, and believably so.  Live, Learn, Earn! Your bluffing checklist:   Figure out what your opponent has- no sense attempting to bluff a man that has a made hand.  Conceal your hand through your betting.  Do not bluff players that can not be bluffed, such as calling station and dimwits that can’t read for the life of them.  Don’t bluff an empty pot- you yield nothing, and risk much. Likewise, rarely is it correct to bluff an empty sidepot, even if one player is all in. Checks around is good enough.  Consider the board. An opponent will fold two pair if there is an obvious straight or flush apparent, or perhaps a higher pair on the board. However, if there is not much on the board that can beat him, then there is little chance he’ll fold.  Play the hand as if you had  exactly  those cards, but don’t fake slowplaying too long.

       urlLink This game  was so God-awful that I couldn't even finish reviewing it. Nay- I didn't finish 3 hands before I got fed up with the horrible music, the cheesy announcers that say the  same damned thing over and over,  the cheesy characters that really can't play poker, the time consuming play of all the computers and the impossibility of skipping their play to make hands quicker, and the horrible camera work. Even the suggestive dresses and massive breasts of the female characters couldn't save it, as they not only screamed plastic but failed to jiggle upon having rockets.  How did I notice all of this in 3 hands time? Simple. Every hand took nearly 5 minutes.  I give it a negative infinity. If you buy this, I spit on your grave.

      Many remember Sammy Farha and his profile in the 2003 WSOP Big One, where he claimed that he was able to put moves on most players, but would not be able to outplay a "bad" player. While taken out of context (Farha was referring to the looser playing styles, not necessarily to dimwits) it certainly can be applied to having a poker idiot at your table. Found at nearly all stakes, these people either still believe poker to be a lottery gambling game, no different than blackjack or Pai Gow, or simply do not use the allotted 10 percent of brain matter when looking down at cards. We have all seen them - players that call with a pocket pair to the river, despite the 4 overcards on the board. The players that call the massive preflop raise for a quarter of their chips to bust your pocket Queens with a mere K2 offsuit. And worse yet- the players that call a massive raise preflop with 4-6 for the mere reason that it was  suited , proceed to crack your AK  -  and fully believe their play was an ingenious move, and it was you. Yes, I've seen all of this, though the last I didn't - James McManus of   urlLink Positively Fifth Street   did during his 2000 Big One experience.  Please note before reading the using these suggestions  might  work if you have two of those players at your table- it will definitely not work if you have 3 or more at your table. It will  definitely  not work if you play a game full of it. The game becomes a crap shoot - any hopes of cracking it with superior poker playing skills is utterly hopeless- any play you put on the players goes unrespected and will not be thought through.  First, we shall begin with identification.  Ways to identify a "bad" player:   Calls to the death with either nothing or a marginal/horrible hand.  Attempts to limp in often.  Rarely raises preflop, even with great hands.  Does not bet on river, despite a massive hand (and worse yet- can't explain why).  Never bets mid-pair or  ALWAYS  bets  EVERY  pair.  Calls a large raise because he thought you were bluffing, despite his mere jack high.  Or calls a large raise on the river with nothing, and when questioned, claims he was bluffing.   If this sounds like someone in your game, there's an easy way to take care of this, without opening up areas of weakness for the more seasoned veterans of your table.   Great Rule the First:   For one, never try to bluff this player if it's down to you, him, and possibly one other player. Bluffing can only serve to limit to you and him- not a profitable move if there is only one other player in the pot. For instance, if 3 players total called the flop and you bluff the turn, eliminating 1 player will leave you to the calling station. While you believe your hand has improved by his leaving the pot, it is hardly profitable as not enough people called any bets on the flop. If however you had 5 callers, and you bluffed all but the calling station, your hand stands a better chance of becoming highly profitable.  Likewise, you must consider this calling station your bank. You are "depositing" money lost to him, and want HIM to win the large pots against your opponents. You must beat the rest of the table in "withdrawing" money from him, which is bound to happen in the long run. Also, if he is stocked with money, he may be used as a component of psychological warfare- the chips he has allows him to put possibly horrible beats upon your opponents, thus tilting them - and their wallets- towards you.   Great Rule the Second:   Stay tight-aggressive. While loose-aggressive has its moments in short bursts at any table the fish (usually loose-passive) will make it hell on earth for you. Stay tight, and when you flop a monster (and I say  flop - even aces can be cracked by 2-7, a possibility with these kind of players) trapping these players will usually be quite easy. Stay docile and don't seem confident when betting these either.   Great Rule the Third   Do not tilt or get angry with the horrible player. This will lower your play down to their level, and will scare them into tightening up to a level beyond what is logical. In other words- you'll lose more money because of it, and the dimwit will pay off less.   Great Rule the Last:   Advertising usually works for large games that play for hours at a time, such as showing your river call with 6 high. While most players at your game realize its simply advertising, the fish may take it to mean more than that. Advertising to these dimwit players is incredibly important, as its a lasting impression that will take many costly hands for them to forget.     Warning: Leave tables that have this signature, as it is filled with dimwits:    It is ok for a table to have a couple hands of unraised preflop rounds - it's perfectly natural. But when the table rarely raises preflops and acts outright disgusted with your preflop raise, even if you have Queens or AQ, then you're in a tight game that's difficult to maneuver in. No complicated plays will work here.  A table that seems dedicated to aces. And not two aces in the hole card, but instead single aces, and will call any preflop raise with it.  A table that seems focused more on the sports game or movie in the background instead of the game upfront. This one is to be ignored if you're casually gaming with friends- I do it myself when a group of us are bored. But when it comes to serious money, the concentration should be on the cards, not the tube.  A table that universally agrees you should not have called the person's all in bet on the flop with only a nut flush draw, when the bet is only 2 more dollars to you and you've already devoted 10 or more dollars to the pot. *sigh*

       urlLink Donhoe Digital’s Tournament No Limit Texas Hold ‘Em  is a poker program that is by far a much cheaper alternative than the Turbo Software by Wilson. The question is whether or not the program can act as a true replacement.  To start off, the interface is just fine. You’re immediately presented with the choice on the program’s loading of a full screen game or a small window so one could multitask. While this choice doesn’t seem significant, this has been a major criticism of Wilson’s Turbo Software for years.  Once on the menu screen, you’re presented with two options- Tournament and Poker Night. I’ll get into Poker Night later; for now we shall venture into the Tournament option.  Once Tournament is selected, the program has you create a profile that will track your poker career on the program. Don’t read too much into this- all it will do is show how much you’ve won from the tournaments you’ve played on the program versus the “cost” to enter these tournaments. You’ll be presented with a number of pre-designed tournaments, from a setting that emulates the most common type of home game tournaments, to common card room tournaments. It also includes a satellite and super satellite for the Big One, as well as the 2003 and 2004 Big One itself.  The best aspect of this program is hardly unique- it allows you to create a custom tournament with unique settings. I’ve used this option to create a tournament I planned on hosting/playing in for practice.  Once playing, I advise you hit the options button and raise the AI to their hardest level. Even here the game is laughable in skill. Simply playing tight and raising on crap once in awhile will guarantee you money in any tournament, possibly even a win. Not once was I check raised by this program. I’ve watched a number of AI’s go all in with 2 pair on the board, simply because their programming told them that they held two pair. The AI is also extremely tight- an especially weak aspect of the program since loose play is expected of early tournament play. Also, to make the game quicker, I suggest turning the AI Time Delay all the way down as well. Turn off that annoying background music as well.  You’ll also be presented with a number of “cheat” options. These options, due to the weak nature of the AI, these options are rarely useful.  Playing is easy enough, and I recommend learning the one touch keyboard shortcuts to quicken your game. Though I’ve accidentally told the computer to call things I shouldn’t have because of it, this is mere lack of attention on my part than a bad setup on the keyboard shortcut. Since the program first on default 30 hands an hour (you can change this) you can take forever on a decision for a single hand, and it will still only register 2 minutes for that hand.  There is no advice for your play- the only thing presented to you is your hand strength percentage. There is also a “slow motion for all-in” option that will show, just like on TV, the strength of each hand as the flop, turn, and river is dealt. There is no advisor, no statistics presented for your play, no way to practice certain hands, and no practical way to see where your weaknesses in tournament is.  Now onto the Poker Night feature!  Poker Night is actually quite useful for me, so I have very little negative remarks on it. However, if you don’t plan on holding a home tournament or ever helping in holding one, then this feature is damned useless. It provides a counter on the image of a table that counts down until the next blind level, and will audibly count the last 5 seconds of the blind level to alert players. It will then show the new blind/ante level. It also show’s the next blind/ante level. If you programmed the tournament settings with rebuys or add-ons that stop at a certain level, the program will also track this. On top of this, once you designate buy in, house cut, and number of people, it will automatically calculate the payouts for the tournament. You can also force it to pay a certain amount of spots, percentages, and dollar amount if need be.  If it wasn’t for the Poker Night option, the program would be completely useless. In fact, if you aren’t in need of such a feature that I’m sure you could live without even if you were, this program is not for you. If you’re looking for something to seriously practice on or improve your play, then don’t bother with the program. It comes across as more of an amusement than a serious tool for a poker player.

      This idea is ingenious, and I'm working on the patent right now. A small calculator-like computer sits on the table. You quickly enter all bets played, the entire board, and at the end, your hole cards. The computer will calculate, depending on each bet towards you and your hole cards, whether or not this was a good move. After it decideds, it will then use this formula:  if(badmove==false){ end; } if(badmove==true){  shock=potsize * (1/OddsOfHitting) * yourloss; }  And shock, of course, is the number of volts shot into your brain. And yes, I'm kidding.

        Take more breaks during play.  Take more time to calculate outs.  Lay down hands earlier.  Be more outwardly aggressive with top pair.  Mix up method of slowplay more often.  Change gears more - I tend to stay in one kind of play for one stack size, a lethal mistake in this game.  Take the same amount of time for everything - while I do take time to think about each move, sometimes I take longer than most. This means I either hold a monster or am drawing. I need to disguise this by either shortening or lengthening my decision time.  Use implied pot odds more! I tend to only calculate pot odds for the current round of betting and don't think ahead to the river.  Stop bluffing unraised pots- they're not worth it! I caught myself doing this last night at least twice. I need to get a shock collar or something. Actually, that's a good idea...

      Thanks to Kel and his kindness, he quickly made me a simple chart that calcualtes my lifetime poker earnings. Unfortunately a horrible loss after buying in 60 dollars at a 12 person mixed games night moves this budding flower from a nice and high positive count, as it should be for lifetime, to a sad minus 6 dollars.  What happened at the mixed games night you ask? Well, with two tables, 6 at each, a dealer would choose a game for one round. Upon the next dealer after a round, a new game is chosen. We started off with no limit hold 'em, of which I managed to score an amazing 2 dollar profit in 10 hands (sarcasm). After that, we dived into Omaha hi/lo, where I did quite well for myself. After that came razz, where my 87642 lost to an 8764A, putting me down 40. After another buy in, some Chicago quickly launched me near even. Chicago is 7 card stud, but the highest concealed spade gets half the pot. I managed to heavily abuse this rule and adjusted my play for it, allowing me to take pots I should have never been in. Also did quite well in regular stud, and progressive. Progressive is a single draw 5 card game where jacks or better is needed to open. If it's not met, the pair moves up to queens (after aces comes 2's) and everyone re-antes.  The hand that knocked me out had me pissed at first, but I realize I would have made the same call in his position. I shared the nut straight off the flop on an all in bet with one caller, and another caller that covered both our stacks had trip 10's. In a 40-60 shot to win, he turned a 7 for the boat. I was simply upset over the initial loss.  That's all for now.

      Gather around listen to a tale of a masterful play, screwed over by my amateur error! Ah, I love playing poker, the game that continually teaches you while killing its pupil’s bankroll.  Sitting in the big blind on a shorthanded small cash game, the player under the gun limps in. Everyone including the small blind folds, and I look down to see a 24 off suit. I check of course, and the flop comes 557 with 2 spades. I check, and so does the sole opponent. I decide that no matter what the turn is, I will bluff the pot. Now falls the 10 of spades, a juicy card that strengthens my decision to bluff the pot. I check, and the opponent bets twice the big blind. After a seconds thought, I decided that my opponent didn’t hold the 5 or spade, and went on with my bluff, re-raising 10 times the big blind. I take a glance for the first time at my opponent’s stack and realize, quite sorely, that he only has 5 times the big blind left in his small stack. After nearly 2 minutes thought, he pushes his chips in and flips over AA. He looks squarely at me and says “I think you have it, but I can’t play with this little.” Master plan = master   damnit  .  Why did this plan fail? What were the two major mistakes in this play?  Easy! The first mistake was deciding to bluff. While the play was well executed until mistake #2, there was too little money in the pot to justify such a play. If it had failed, I would lose, while a successful play would yield little return.  The second mistake was an even more amateur move – I never took into account the size of my opponent’s bankroll. A manageable bankroll is 9 times the big blind- by raising the player all in when he had only 5 times the big blind, any somewhat decent hand, even if he believed I had him beat, would call the all-in.  Let this be a lesson to you all - just because you can play fancy doesn’t mean you should. Also,  always  keep in mind the size of each player’s stack, be it tournament or cash game. Either of these mistakes can bring a mountain of hurt upon you.

      It's down to the last 7 of the 2nd wTf tournament. I'm sitting with a slightly above average stack, but with blinds so high this can change within the span of two rounds with unplayable cards. I'm first to act, and look down to see suited JT.  JT is by far my favorite hand that isn't a pocket pair. It has a 21% win percentage on a 7 person table (what I usually play) but when played correctly, it's a damned dangerous hand. I usually call a medium to slightly large raise with it if I'm sitting comfortably on chip size, and if unraised will raise it to at least 4 times the big blind, sometimes up to 10 times.  On situations when I raise it or call a large raise with JT, suited or not, I don't look forward to hitting my 10 or jack as top pair. I'm weak to any AJ that raised or called me, and any higher pocket pair. Instead it acts as the best connector and suited connector in the game, the highest one that can make 4 straights (QJ can only make 4 straights). What I look for are straight possibilities off the bat, which gives me a significant amount of maneuvering room. To top it off, if the flop comes royal - AKQ, or even similar, KQ to give you the open ended, your opponent more than likely hit their flop. If this is the case, see if you can get free cards to complete your straight.  One hand of my JT versus AK: I'm sitting in mid position and raise the empty pot to 5 dollars, 10 times the big blind. The big blind is the only caller. The flop comes KQ3 rainbow. Big blind checks to me. I bet out for another 5 on my open ended. I get reraised 10 more. The BB either has AK or AQ, possibly even as high as KQ, though I doubt it as I don't think he'd call five with KQ. The very best he could have is a flopped set. Take away an ace for an out in case he has AK or AQ. It's doubtful he has a nine in his hand, so those 4 outs remain. With 47 cards remaining, I have a 14% chance of hitting the straight. Looking forward one step, I asked what if I didn't hit the straight on the turn. Depending on the card, I would have to call at least another 10 dollar bet to take a pot of 55. However, if the straight hit with an ace, the better would gladly bet into me, as he would have hit probably two pair. If the 9 hit, it would be hard to detect a J10. While not statistically the sound move, calling could lead to me taking down a huge pot with relatively little play- he would continue betting into me. While costly to me, I risked it, and hit the ace on the turn. The better went all in, and I called. He flipped over AK, only to be pissed to find me holding J10. All in all the hand paid $50 bucks, which I soon loss to a set beaten by a flush.  Back to the tournament. Seeing the suited connector from heaven I raise it to 5000 to go with the big blind being 800. Folds all around until the big blind, when he moves all in. I stop to think. The all-in wasn't too short stacked- his raise alone was 12 times the big blind. With shortstacked technically being under 9 times the big blind, I figured he was playing a hand he didn't want any callers on. With my 5000 out there and his blind, I thought he knew I was raising with a mediocre hand. However, if he had something along the lines of AJ (which he would only call with) or AQ and higher, or possibly even a pocket pair of TT and higher, I felt he had enough of a stack to afford a minor reraise or slowplay of those monsters. It was also obvious that a 5000 raise did not commit me to any pot, as I was 2nd in chips with nearly 72,000 in tournament chips. Thinking for a minute, I placed him on a medium pair, honestly placing him on 7's. He could make a stand with such a hand, but did not want to have too much play on them. At the stage of the tournament, that would have been a perfect move for such a hand.  I called, and he flipped over a pair of 8's. I flopped the Jack, turned the 10, and rivered a universally useless 3. The hand over, down to 6, I wondered if the move was correct. Since I had placed him on a medium pocket pair, my Jack 10 acted the same as an AK would- two overcards. Just like AK, when J10 is paired against 88 250,000 times on my poker simulator, the hand comes out as a coin flip, with 88 having a .4% advantage.  I just plain love JT.

      With Drew and James heading over to Rutgers, I'll always be able to find a Saturday or Friday game on the college grounds. Especially in Drew's dorms, as he in Cook College is literally a 4 minute drive. The point is though that I am used to having a game within 2 minutes of me, with people that I can bring together in 2 minutes. The East Brunswick games will be dissipated as well.  It's going to be up to me to form a good game from what juniors and seniors I can find, but the problem is a $5 buy in is no longer appealing. Damn.   There is one game that is quite appealing. A group of juniors that play $5 buy ins practically every day. One of the players was at the tournament and ended up 9th. I was quite surprised when I watched him play. While I noticed some flaws in his tournament play, he managed to make some pretty smart calls. If I can get them to play larger stakes, it could prove to be quite fun.
