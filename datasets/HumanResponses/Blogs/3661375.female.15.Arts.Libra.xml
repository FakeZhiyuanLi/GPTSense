      that last post was too despressing for me to read. so i decided i would come and write another post to make up for that one.  the world of barbies is a sick dark world that no 10 year old can even begin to explain. there is something so sacred so amazing as a barbie doll. she is the epitome of beauty and can bend in so many ways it just blows your fragile little mind. it's been a long time since i've played with these plastic mini humans but i remeber looking back on my dolls times fondly. Friends would come over woth their barbies, the only thing not varing is their chest sized, sneaking up to my bedroom and putting barbie and ken in to more complicated manuever then found in the karma sutra. quietly we would bend, place, and stuff their clothes and bodies in ways that if our parents had trully discovered what these plastic sex icons were for they would have had a ritualistic burning of them a looooong time ago.   but it's not really our fault. barbies are made so they start your sexual exploration. Barbie has large incredible breasts that made pamela anderson look like an a cup. she isn't wearing any underwear and you can put her into any outfit and send her on her merry way over to ken's. Ken is a different story all toghether. tall, dark and handsome, ken is the ultimate package with the exception of his tighty whities wrapped around his large square package. then people wonder who was the original metro sexual. fuck off David Beckham, you've got nothing on ken.  now think about what youre buying young children for the holidays and maybe next time you should just give them taht pony they've always wanted.  night all, jules

      i've been allowing myself to think of him. if you are trusted you know who him is. so exactly one person knows. i've always wanted to believe in love but recently its been hitting a blank wall. he was the first guy i ever wated and he hardly even noticed me. i sound like  desprate sad lonely girl. i am. wow it feels reall weird to admit that. but i wasn't about him. after i got the hint that he wasn;t interested i backed off and got over him. i was fine. until he had to walk into my class room and smile at me. stupidly i smiled back. he sat next to me. there was a boy, there was a girl. there was quick smiles and glances to the side. there was hope and then there was heat break as a girl started to wait for him outside. once again the girl is alone. once again she is trying to understand why she couldn't tell him how she felt. so she gave up and walked away. and i'm still walking.  talk about depressing ehh? well there you have it. my pathetic love story. now it just needs an ending.   later all, jules

      okay what to say, what to say... i created this site basicially to tell my friends up in MA. what i've been up to.  today was the first day since sophomre year ended. it was incredibly boring. never has doing the laundry seemed so appealing. i packed for my trip.   isn't my life so interesting. at the end of the day i wish i could be sitting in the murky water of Point Judith Salt Pond, teaching little kids how to windsurf. and the brillant part os that in a week i'll be doing just that. i'm so excited.   oh well i think it's time for me to go to bed i have the global regents tomorrow. Spaceballs calls.  night,
