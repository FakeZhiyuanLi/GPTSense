      Yeah...this is the first ever entry into my first ever blog. Wow, I must seriously be bored as fuck.  Oh well, I don't have shit better to do.  So here goes.  All right. So cars, yeah?  I'm lookin to buy a truck, a Chevy most likely. Every time I go down to "the Chevy Dealer," Lewis, the dumbest fuckin' car salesman in the world, comes out and tries to make me buy something I don't want. What the fuck...  And don't tell me that a fuckin' Hyundai looks like a Jaguar. Help me out here, they don't look the same do they?  Anyway, back to Car Search 2004.  Well, with the money I'm supposed to get from my mom, and the cash I'll get from the car I'm driving now, it should all work out...I could even build the chopper I'm thinkin' of if I wanted.  A nice truck, a nice chopper...what more could a guy ask for?  Ok, two more things, and any guy will tell you this is true:  A good woman, and a load of cash.  Well that's all folks, maybe there'll be something tomorrow, maybe not. You'll just have to wait and see.

       Guy "Hey, did I tell you? I saw Mike today"   Me (thinking: why ask if you're going to tell me?)   Me "No, why are you tell..." Guy "I saw him at Best Buy, blah blah blah."   Me "Really, I don't want to know!"   Guy "And then, blah blah blah...and he blah blah blah. So anyway...any news from you?"   Me "Wow, did I tell you, I heard you got bitch slapped today?"   Guy "No...I didn't&nbsp;get slapped today? (confused)"   Me "Well then, here you go!"   **SLAP!!!**    &nbsp;  Ok, that's one slap. The other is, The Lex...rechristened by Sir Cam of Nasty...has recieved it's first dose of BOOM! Care of either Alex or Amir, depending on who wins the fight tomorrow. I got a 12" Sony subwoofer in a Rockford Fostgate competition series sealed box. It sounds nice, but I haven't heard it in the Lex. I still need to get and amp and wire it up, Amir should have that all taken care of in a few days and I'll be happy, and Cam will love ridin' in the Lex even more.    &nbsp;  Well, maybe next time we head to PCC for more estranged incedents, we'll be listening to an even better "almost" stock stereo.

       You know, it's because of the rest that most of us are still here. People that don't give a shit about the superficial dog&nbsp;crap, who hang out with you when you're down, who talk to you when you feel like shit.    &nbsp;  Peopl like Cam, Nar, Son, Noelle, Lee, Malcolm, Phillips, and all the others that aren't just playin' around when they ask you how you're doin.    &nbsp;  I suppose I should explain how they earned their name...It's probably because every time I would talk to someone, we'd be discussing who would come here or go there, and we would say, not all the shitty people and the assholes, just "the Rest..."    &nbsp;  The Rest of the world. The non- shallow, arrogant, dumbfuck, conceeded, heartless people of the world. The people that really make a difference.    &nbsp;  I may not be a very smart man, and I may not be very good with words, but I do know I would rather have the support of one true friend than the support of thousands of fakes.    &nbsp;  This is for Cam...thanks.

       Ok, this is really starting to eat away at me. I can't stand not telling people.    &nbsp;  The first person I told was the DJ, then I told cam, then Alex and Amir heard. Up 'til now, they were the only ones, and that sucks.     &nbsp;  It really bites to not want to talk about dead people, but as much as I know I have to remember, it's easier to just forget. I saw a photo of these girls crying about their cousin that died in the Farmer's Market "drive-thru" that happened a few months ago...    &nbsp;  Yeah, that bites, but at least your grandmother didn't die a week before your graduation. Aint that a bitch.    &nbsp;  Yeah, so my grandmother died. My Dad's Mom. So now I am the only person to pass on my family name. It sucks even more 'cus I was like one of two people who ever really visited her that she liked. It pisses me off that my family, at least on my mom's side, never really went to my Dad's side. What the fuck! I'm like a member of a dying breed, except it's not the Mohicans, or Siberian Tigers...it's a fucking name. How much does that kick dog shit!?    &nbsp;  As unimportant as I feel, I know my grandmother was important to me, and I still love her, which is more than I can say for my feelings toward the rest of my family, who, right now, are on the DEEP AS A MOTHER FUCKER Shit List.    &nbsp;  Just 'cus I don't wanna believe in a god that's cruel and let's people be taken from their loved ones and won't stop people from being sick or hurting.    &nbsp;  Ah well, seems like it's all fucked. And the only thing I want to do is see the DJ smile...that always made me happy.

       Today was a very shitty day. Not so much at first, but at about 9 o'clock, everything went down the shithole.    &nbsp;  So we're supposed to go and check out this Ranchero, 1957, that my mom's friend's mother in law is giving us, if we ever get out there. It doesn't run, but that's not a problem, a few small items, maybe 150 bucks and it should go. But I get home..."what time are we going out to see the Ranchero tomorrow?" "We're not goin' out there tomorrow..." WTF!?!    &nbsp;  Then, I get to the office and switch on the comp. just to realize I missed 3 hours of badminton. It doesn't sound bad, but it was the last day, and the only day Nate showed...Of course it was fate. I had to take my mom's shit out to my dead grammas house, and I stayed a while, left the cell at home.    &nbsp;  Then, while talkin to Cam, I realize...nothing we planned or talked about is ever likely to happen. Everything is falling to shit, and yes, I'm goin back into my depressed shit, and I doubt anything by the DJ could make me better. I'm never gonna move out, not for 3 or 4 years at least, well, that's if my mom remodels the house.    &nbsp;  I doubt I'll ever go back to the auto shop, I don't wanna learn how to sweep the sidewalk, and clean up barf from a shit faced mechanic, and I'm not a very good errand boy. So there goes that.    &nbsp;  I'm still waiting for Sonya to call about goin' to the beach today...a little late. So there goes that; yeah, we didn't go, Speedzone kinda takes a lot out of you.    &nbsp;  Damn it..."Blues dead, Nicole hates me, Frank's divorced..." shit I feel like the Godfather. Except, I can't make it all good again buy beating the Dean at his own game.    &nbsp;  Fate's a cruel bitch...but then again, "Payback's a Bitch, aint it?"

       Mr Cam 2 U: you mean to tell me   Mr Cam 2 U: my dream car could be sittin in a rust heap   drvalkyrie692: yeah...it's possible   Mr Cam 2 U: and i dont have to buy one of these already restored camaros    &nbsp;  Yeah, Cam...it's very possible. But you gotta understand. Takin' a rust heap to show stopper status aint playin with ABC blocks you know? It's hard work cuttin apart a car, especially a unibody that's got more rust than the RMS Titanic.    &nbsp;  I'll see if I can't get you down to Pick Your Part or Memory Lane...then you'll see. There's lots to be had, but it's hard to get done.    &nbsp;  In junkyards, cars are cheaps.   And what you find you keeps?   You pay for, then you keeps.   And if it's gutless, they're real cheaps.   So you likes?   You keeps.

       Yeah, so I'm the new Chevy propagandist. I've managed to sway cam away from a straight six and opt into an old school V8.    &nbsp;  A lot of people hate on classic cars and muscle cars. They say, "You don't have to put any work into a muscle car, they're fast right out of the box." Well, this is true, but so is a factory twin turbo Toyota Supra or Nissan 300ZX.    &nbsp;  A car is only as fast as the wrench time you put behind it. Adding a squirt of nitrous or bolting on a turbo will only do so much. "There's no replacement for displacement." Some people say that and stand by their El Camino SS 396 thinking they're cool. But if you wrench on a car, a small 4 cyl. will kill an SS 396. Either way, it's however much time you put in the car. But an SS 396 with a super charger and some engine work weighing in at around 3000 lbs will blow the shit out of a 2000 lb Honda with a V-TEC turbo and nitrous.    &nbsp;  There's no need to spend all your time wrenching on a little import, unless it'll beat a muscle. And if you can't drive, you'll lose either way. At Irwindale on Thursday, I saw a guy driving a pristine Mitsubishi 3000 GT. A real nice car, but they guy wouldn't even burn out, and he couldn't shift, so he only won against a pickup...it's so sad. And if you still aren't swayed, watch the second Ricer flick, 2 Fast 2 Furious. They even talk about how a Yenko Camaro and a Dodge Hemi will blow the shit out of an Eclipse Spyder and a Lancer Evo 8.    &nbsp;  You still like rice rockets? That's cool. I'll see you on thursday with my beast.    &nbsp;  '65 Malibu SS 606   Twin turbo, nitrous, C5 suspension; yeah, you're screwed.

       Just because my posts have been somewhat non-existant for the past few days, I'll update you on things.     &nbsp;   Here's what happened:     &nbsp;    &nbsp;   And that's it!     &nbsp;   Yeah, something more than nothing happened. I've been trying to figure out classes and stuff for PCC and I think I've got it down, I just hope none of the classes I'm trying to get into close before I get a chance to jump in there! It looks like the line up will be Psychology 1, English 1A and 1000X, Math 131, and Theater Arts 7B. Five classes, 14 units(English 1000X is a bullshit, no unit waste of an hour of my life), and I'll even have some time do homework before classes.     &nbsp;   Ah, aint it grand?     &nbsp;   It seems like only a month ago I graduated from PHS, now I gotta go through the shit of choosing classes without the help of a counselor...wait, that sounds just like PHS!! Am I really going to a different school?     &nbsp;   I'm so displeased with the administrative authority wielders(or so they think) that I've decided to be a complete asshole, just as they have. All right, all right, I'm not gonna be an asshole...I guess I'm just too nice; but wait, let's ask Nate..."Is Cavs to nice to be an asshole?"    "Man, the devil aint as mean as that mother fucker can be, SHIT!!!"     &nbsp;   Well folks, there's your answer. Looks like I'll be getting A S in all my classes, and I'll just fill in the ..shole.     &nbsp;   For now, fuck the bastards. For later, "Ah, don't you love the smell of bullshit in the morning?"

        This will be an attempt at a constant running blog entry of the strange happenings that occur any time Sir Cam of Nastie and I venture into the realms of the "Pasadena Cheat/Copy Center."      &nbsp;   As you may have heard, just about any time that Cam and I go to PCC, we end up seeing some really funny shit; one time, TWO occurences of the strange and completely unneeded.     &nbsp;   So here goes...     &nbsp;   #1: Carls JR. Manager: "Mam, you can't put soda in that cup, if you want to buy soda you can use this cup, but for that cup...ONLY WATER!!!"    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Old Lady: "OK..." (Get's sprite, without even caring to look and see if the bastards are watching, that's some funny shit.)     &nbsp;   #2/3: These incedents occured(however the fuck you spell that) at an infamous institution among the East Pass crowd.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Lucky Boy, Cam and I were nonschalantly eating our lunch when two grown White, extremely white, people walked in. He slapped her ass as he was waiting for the guy at the register, then started caressing her back...NASTY!!! Also witness to these events was a "mexican" guy who started to laugh so hard he had to leave.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there was the "GUY" who walked in. He was wearing a red Hello Kitty type shirt, a pair of red Dockers shorts, pleated of course, and a red with white polka dot bandana for a belt. Now, this doesn't seem so strange, "maybe he's gay" you think. NO! He's just wierd. His belly was out furter than a pregnant fat lady, but the rest was normal proportions, what the fuck? And yes, I do have pictures of the "GUY."     &nbsp;   #4: Sir Cam and I were going to PCC to get our bullshit group counseling, and yes, it was a lot of bullshit. Afterwards, a drink from Carls JR. seemed to be in order. Let me just say, never blast good music in a drive thru where people who listen to "white people music" work. The attendant did a "WTF!?" kind of face, then started to head bob. I decided my penny change wasn't worth any more head bobbing so I sped off with Cam in tow.    &nbsp;  #5: Cam told me he wished he was on some sort of team. We saw these two girl soccer players. They were walking to their car.   Soccer Player: "OH MY GOD!!! What the hell is this?...OH MY GOD, It's a parking ticket!? Wait, the car behind me didn't get a ticket!?"   Cam: "Yeah, that's cus the car behind you isn't parked in the red..."  &nbsp;  For now, that's it.

       Here it is, just because I've been gone for a while.     &nbsp;   1965 Chevrolet Malibu    SS   custom 606 big block Chevy     Dart Big Chief intake manifold w/ double 2000cfm Advanced Performance throttle bodes and custom fuel injection,    twin Turbonetics Super T turbochargers,    custom exhaust and intake pipes,    Edelbrock Super Victor direct port nitrous injection,     &nbsp;   bringing the total to between 1500 and 2000+ horsepower, and monstrous loads of torque!!     &nbsp;   Wow, back that up with a&nbsp; Hughes Performance Turbo 400 transmission, a Currie custom built Ford 9" rear end w/ 4.10 gears and some big Mickey Thompson slicks...shit, that's a 7 second or less street legal monster!     &nbsp;   Oh, don't you just love American Muscle?

      "Now you see, your heart is clogged with fat and it's not healthy. Over here you've got your beef fat, your pork fat, your chicken fat, and your beer. That's only four of the five food groups, you need to balance it out with some vegetables or you'll die...a man's body can only take so many heart attacks. Now, eat some vegetables, try some onion rings."  Yeah, I'm a fat fucker. Summer has a special knack for making me fatter, and it doesn't help that I'm stuck inside all day. When you only use one finger to click or change channels, nothing is "exercised."  It's like summer cabin fever; well, not so much fever, more like cabin fatter.  Ok, I need to work out and prolly eat a little better. My body could use more onion rings and the like.  So, I will once again start my journey. Hopefully this time it ends a few pounds lighter, not just bulkier. And fitness is not the only reason to be looking good.  I'll just leave that up to you to ponder over.  No Cameron, I'm still not telling you...

      Damn...I fell old.  I played badminton for 3 hours straight yesterday, BAD IDEA!!  My lower back hurts like a bitch, and it doesn't help that I spent 2 hours leaning over a railing trying to watch fireworks on the fourth. Shit I'm gettin' old.  Besides that, my knee is a piece of shit. Hurts like a mother when I walk, when I stand, when I sit, when I'm sleeping it hurts!  Shit I'm Old.  And fireworks...let me tell you about the dumbfucks in my neighboorhood. I get the fuckheads who think it's fun to start setting off fireworks on the 3rd of July.(that's not a typo) The jackasses kept me up 'til like 2 in the morning with that shit. Then on the fourth, I get home from my grandparents and there's a huge explosion. Of course I live in the "call the police whenever possible" neighboorhood, so there was a police helicopter above my house for 2 hours 2 minutes after the boom.  Ah, isn't life grand? I'm turning into an old man...I should just apply for social security now and get it over with.  Fuck, I'm old.

      Well, I've been thinking about cars and I have created a list...  Here it is...I hope:  2001 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD 4x4 Crew Cab/Short Bed w/ Duramax diesel engine and Allison auto trans.  Bullydog propane and nitrous injection, Banks Power exhaust, exhaust brake, chip enhancer, all the greatest stuff and more...and that's just the engine compartment!?  Ok...so there's more:  CST 12" suspension lift w/ dual Fox 2.5" remote reservoir shocks all around, Deaver springs, Donahoe traction bars, and some more stuff.  How about some 20" Weld racing wheels...sound nice? Yeah, put some 39.5" meats from Interco on there and some o' those little Asian bastards could drive underneath me.  Oh well. If I can get the cash to get it all done, in the the immortal words of Sir Cam of Nastie, "spiffy."  Yeah, it could probably take most of those Asians int he 1/4 mile too.  Ok, so that's the first half of the equation. The other half is the bike. And I'm not talking some six year old's little 18 speed mountain bike that never sees dirt here, I'm talkin a monstrous, race winning, crazy ass mother fucker.  Like the Yamaha YZ450F. The top of the top motorcross style fast as a mother fucker type bike. Yes, for all you lamans, it's a motorcycle. And no, I don't care if I misspelled LAMAN!!!  All right, that's it for the cars...until I get one, then I'll start braggin' my ass off. 'Til then....peace.

      So a good man I know has been annointed a Pirate on the waves of the Internet high seas...the other night I was inspired by him and have come to think that I would like to own a boat as well.  Not like his vessel...a "Gate-whey?" or the like. I am thinkin' more like a Seacraft SC32 Master Angler.  Yeah, I'm talking about a real boat here. Sorry for the stupid, "I'm acting like a pirate who doesn't understand..." talk.  I'ld love to have a boat. I like fishing, at least in the ocean, because I've actually caught things there. Plus, I'd be able to talk to Hart about more than just shitty boat charters and other crap.  Well, piracy of two kinds inspired this blog so I'll try to recount the convo...  Cam:"I've decided to become a major player in the piracy game." Cav:"Yeah...I'm looking to buy a boat." Cam:"LOL"  So it's not as complicated as it sounds, but it happened and I have nothing else to talk about. Oh fuckin well.

      Praise the Lowered!!!  The Lifted are Gifted!!!  Where the hell did those ever come from? Anyways, on to the task at hand.  I'm tryin' to get a truck right...ok, a Chevy. In particular a: 2001 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD 6.6L Duramax Diesel engine Allison automatic transmission  I'd do a lot of things to it, add horsepower, wheels and tires, give it some good looks and all; but one question still remains.  Do I lift it, or lower it?  I say lift and I think about off-roading, takin' a bike out to the desert and just riding for hours...or going out camping with friends up at a lake somewhere, sounds nice right?  But then I say lower and I think of how cool it would look. Why do I care what other people think. yeah it would look nice, but if I'm gettin the HD, I don't think there'd be much use in lowering it.  I guess that answers my question. Lift it!  Maybe a Fabtech Motorsports 8" lift w/ dual Bilstein long travel, remote reservoir shocks and Superlift rear leaf springs.  Sounds nice...I'll update you as the story goes, yeah?  Adios until next time...

      Why do people always hate on old school?  Why do people always try to be old school?  I'm old school, I don't try...it's just the way I am. I like old cars, old bikes, and old ways.  There's nothing nicer than a big block v8 under the hood; all you ricers can go fuck yourselves.  Now don't get me wrong, rice rockets have their appeal...what else can you spend 30 grand on and only make 15s in the 1/8th mile? I mean...that's fuckin fantastic!  Yeah right.  If you've ever been to a real race (circle track, road course, or drag strip) you know that nothing's gonna beat the pounding of 8 cylinders. Not even a wimpy little 4 cylinder with twin turbos and NOS.  I like big cars, old cars, fast cars. I like old school...  What the fuck are you gonna do about it?

      Yeah, I love her. She's so nice, beautiful, hardworking, and she's quiet. I have to pay her off though, well...in gas at least. If you haven't already guessed, the 'Hoe isn't a girl, but I hope she'll be my baby.  So I went for a test drive yesterday in this pristine as fuck '99 Chevy Tahoe. The shit was so nice I almost crapped my pants; I was wearing shorts though, so I got saved.  Anyway. The Tahoe is fuckin amazing, it's jesus, it kicks all ass, it's "heaven on white bread." A '99 Chevy Tahoe 4x4 LT. It's navy blue, with tan leather interior, but not browny tan...it's more light gray. It's got ambulance doors so I'm really likin' the S.W.A.T. look of it. There's nothin' wrong with it except there's a ding in the front bumper, and some stuff sticking to a button on the dash.  I would have to make it even more JESUS tho. Add a 4" lift, some wheels and tires, supercharger and intake, exhaust, and of course...THE SOUNDS!!! Kenwood in-dash DVD player w/ 7" touch screen, dual 12" Sony subs with their own amps, Pioneers with so many drivers you lose count, a Sony sub for the speaks, a Big Red capacitor or two, and a Rockford dual amp kit to wire it all up.  She's a bitch aint she? Yeah, that's why I love her!

      "Baby's got BACK!"  So I'm talkin' to Cam and we come to the subject of the ladies. Now, don't confuse ladies with girls, girls you drive, ladies you ride...or they ride you depending on you're preferrence, but that's another blog entirely.  So we're talking and I say to him that I think I'll end up with a short girl. Not a shorty keep in mind, a SHORT girl. And you may say, "Well, at 6' 6" just about everyone is short right?" Well, I'm not talkin relative. I was thinkin' someone along the lines of a tall midget, don't ask me why. Cam came to my rescue. He said, and I hope this is true, that I'm likely to end up with a sporty girl, a "Lady Lancer" perhaps. A volleyball player was mentioned, no one in particular, just a player, and I remembered something. Volleyball players are usually pretty hot. Volleyball shorts are like god's gift to men who like the ass, they'll make any girl look like she's packin' but then again, so do "tight butt jeans."  I'm thinking, "A lady lancer who smacks balls around might not be so good...but it's worth a shot."  Now all I gotta do is get rid of the baby fat. To get to the baby fat I gotta work off the "I'm a fat bastard" fat and the "Lazy Shit" fat. It's all possible, and if the girl comes in, it'll be much more likely.

      Wow, everyone's leaving. What the hell man. This aint cool. Everyone's goin' off to college, and getting better lives. I feel like the shithead who gets stuck in the little town and becomes sheriff and does nothing with his life.  Nar's goin' off to CSUN, I offered to drop her at the train station...not drop her, but take her there. She won't have it. Cam's at CC with me, but still, it's like everyone else is leaving. Son is off to Oxy, Lee is goin to some Lutheran type place in Minnesota or something, nothing's clear, everyone's leaving.  Well, that's not true. Not everyone is leaving. Some of the shitty people are sticking around. We call it getting Miked for a reason you know? JoJo is at the CC wit Cam and me, but it seems like the only classes she could have taken are things like Beginner's Photosynthesis Mechanics and shit, you know...the things only three people take becuase they have too.  Ah well. My schedule is fucked over too. Mon.-Thurs. I start at either 7 or 715 depending, and end between 930 and 1030. Damn, it's shorter than virgin sex! Wed. and Fri. I leave at 430 tho, what a bitch. But Friday is my film history day, and Cam and I will never forget the Van when it comes to film history.  We thought about takin english wit Van Leuven over winter, but he teaches 1a, and we've got that covered. It seems like the thing to do tho, just to piss Van off.  Oh well, that's enough for now...but maybe, just maybe I'll have some more for yah in a few minutes; if not, wait 'til tomorrow.

       We're goin to White Castle! Ok, so we're goin' right, next summer. Cam, and the Nar, and me...maybe some other guys. It was all inspired by "Harold and Kumar..."      One problem. I went to the White Castle website to find the location in Cherry Hill, New Jersey where Harold and Kumar end up, but it wasn't there! There's no White Castle in Cherry Hill! But there are 3 in the general vicinity. Plan: go to each location and take pictures and compare them to the movie. If I have a dvd system in my car though, I won't need to compare really, just drive up and look.      Anyway, we're of to see the Castle, the wonderful Castle of White!

       Looks like I'll be getting A S in all my classes, and I'll just fill in the ..shole.      You say you'd fuck her, but you'd probably fight. Just remember, make up sex with a bitch is a bitch.      If you have to ask for help to take an IQ test, just stop.
