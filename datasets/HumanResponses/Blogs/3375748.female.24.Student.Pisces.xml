      I am learning how to take nice pictures now. It's good for my boring life now, and I should use my free time to study something that I always wanna. From last week, I almost took one roll of film everyday. Of cause, I am not the only one who taking pictures, Toshi does it too. But, most of those pictures are taken by me. Since I like to look at pictures and take or be taken, I hope I could know how to take good pictures as Toshi, Tadayoshi, Kenji, Bon... .  But, I can't be so good now. I am just starting, so I have a lot of bad pictures. Only 1/3 pictures of one film are good enough to be kept. I went to RITZ CAMERA for pictures a lot, and they ask me buy the card everytime. Finally, I bought it today. I think I am too rely on my digital camera because I can see what the picture will look like before I take it, it make my eyes not good enough to see the beauty though the view window of normal camera. I have to learn how to do it without digital camera. I spend a lot of money because of that, but I remember my professor of photo class told us that the only way to improve the skill is continua taking pictures. I am not a smart person who have the talent, so I guess I will use the idiot way. Hope I could be better in the future.  气死我了啦！！！刚才打了一次中文的，结果不知道什么原因忽然变成乱码！！！害得我现在要重新打一次。  最近哦，我开始学习如何摄影了。因为一直以来我都很喜欢看那些漂亮的图片，不只是美女帅哥的，还有风土人情的。自己也很羡慕那些可以拍出美丽世界的摄影师，我觉得他们真得很了不起，可以带给人们美的感受。所以自己也希望能过通过自己的眼睛看见那么美丽的事物。  从上个星期开始，每天都会拍照片。几乎是一天就要用掉一卷24的胶卷，可是每次也就只有三分之一的照片可以保存起来。其它的都不是很好，我想刚开始应该都是这样的，慢慢来就好了吧。原来太依赖数码相机，因为数码相机的大窗口可以让你提前看到照片成型后的样子，所以用数码相机照出照片固然都不错。也因为如此，人的眼睛就变得懒惰起来了。所以，现在的我不想依赖数码相机了，希望能过自己照出漂亮的照片来。  加油吧！！！

      Yesterday was start with a dog and end with a dog. I woke up around 7:40 a.m to drive Toshi and Masa to work. It is my daily routine now. I walked to downstairs after Toshi. When I was just out of my house, Toshi was already beside my car. Then, I saw a HUGE dog, which was walking beside my car. I don't know why but I was scared by that dog, and scream out. That dog was so innocent, and she/he looked at me a little bit, then walked away as nothing happened. I mean, there wasn't anything happened, but she/he was too normal compare to me. I felt funny few mins later 'cause I was not scared when I just saw that dog. I was more like: huh, a big dog... ... ... Scare!!!  Later that night, after we came back from diner with all those co-workers. We saw a small dog which ran with three legs. We met him before, and Toshi was trying to catch him once. That dog has four legs, but he only use three legs to run or walk, maybe the last leg is broken or something. I think that dog remembers us, at least Toshi. He saw us came out of the car and saw Toshi went to him, he started to run. Toshi went after him, who knows, Toshi was faster then him. So, he gave up running and try to fight with Toshi. I watched them from far away then decided open the door first. When I turn around to my house, I saw another dog!!!!! And, he was sitting not so far from me and looking at me. So, I didn't move or do anything, I just kept my post and looked at him too. We looked at each other for more than 30 seconds. Then, Toshi came back, that dog stand up and ran away.  What a dog day!!!!! But, the last dog was cute.   昨天真是很狗的一天。早上在7：40左右起来后，送敏和正去上班。刚下了楼，就看见一只大狗向我走来。不知道为什么我居然被吓到了！！！其实那只狗没什么可怕的，只是有点大，长得还挺和蔼的。我一开始也没被吓到，就是看见了一只大狗而已，可是脑海中闪过“一只大狗”后，不由自主地叫了出来。哈哈，自己都觉得有点好笑。  晚上回来的时候，居然遇见了两只狗。第一只是长遇见的一只小狗，他明明有四条腿，可是只用三条腿跑，我想可能那条不能跑的腿断掉了吧。敏看见他就想把他拿过来抱抱，可是那小狗一见人就跑。敏原来有追过他，可是失败了。这次他居然跑的比那只小狗快，后来小狗不得不放弃继续跑，可是居然打算和敏打一架。我站在比较远的地方看敏和那只小狗，决定先回家的好，一转身，居然看见另一只狗。这只狗干干净净，长得也挺可爱的。他坐在离我不远的地方，安安静静的看着我。我也没有什么动作，也安安静静的看着他。我们这样大概持续了多过30秒的样子，直到敏走过来，那只小狗才站起来，溜溜达达的走了。  一天居然看见三条狗，都没有主人。虽然没有什么好感叹的，但是觉得还是蛮好玩。

      I dreamed about having a bowl of fired egg noodle last night. The dream remind me old times in China. I would cook fired egg noodle for lunch when I was alone at my house. I missed the noodle,so I cooked my old time favor noodle for today's lunch. Looks not too bad, right? 昨天晚上做梦，梦到一碗香喷喷的煎蛋面放在我面前。这让我想起原来在国内的时候我常一个人做煎蛋面吃，所以今天中午的午餐就是一碗煎蛋面。看起来不是太差，对吧？&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      Something happened which made me so mad yesterday. I went to do laundry yesterday's afternoon in Fairfield. As always, after I put my laundry in dryer, I went to wash my car. The car wash place just 2 mins away from laundry shop. I spend around 30 mins wash my car after that I went back to pick up my laundry. Around 4:30, I walked out from laundry shop and tried to open my car.   THEN!!! A white American guy walked to me and asked me if I saw a wallet at car wash place. I told him I didn't. He kept ask me and looked into my car like searching for something at the same time. I wanted make sure if he said is the car wash place, so I asked him where he was asking. I made sure that he was talking about the car wash place that I went to around a hour ago, and I told him that I am sure I didn't see any wallet. Then, he asked me if I was leaving or not, I told him I was. He started to using his cell phone save my plate number. I was confused by his action, and I ask him:" You think I stole your wallet?!!" He kept save my plate number and said:" Yes, I think you stole my girlfriend's wallet." I was SO surprised, and I said:" What? That's so stupid!!!" He walked away from me and my car. I looked at him and he got in a white car which I noticed was parking beside my car over car wash place. So, I went to there, and saw that girl who was washing that white car inside of that car. I walked to the driver side door and asked her:" You think I stole your wallet? " She said:" No." I said:" That's so stupid!!! Do you want search my car??!!! I haven't go home yet.!!" She said:" No, I don't wanna search your car." I was so mad at that I told her that I don't even know what her wallet looks like, and I went to close to her car once because I needed the cleanser for my car window, and I had to cross her car to get it. She was saying that she didn't think I stole her wallet. I just left them madly. That made me So MAD!!!!!! After while, I thought that I should stay there longer and ask them if they need call the police or not 'cause I would like to call police for them!!!! Stupid Couple!!!!!  昨天下午发生了一件让我及其气愤的事！！！！！！昨天下午2点过的样子，我去一家叫soap box的洗衣店洗衣服，那是家我常去的店，基本上是一个月两次的样子。和往常一样，我先洗衣服，然后在等烘干机烘干衣服的时候就去洗车。洗车的地方离洗衣店非常的近，开车大概一`两分钟就到了。我大概花了半个多小时洗车，然后回到洗衣店取出已经烘干的衣服，折折好，放入洗衣筐中，一切准备就绪后，就打算走人。  当我正打开车门，把洗衣筐放入后座的时候，一个三十多岁的白人男子走过来问我有没有在洗车的地方看见一个钱包，我回忆了一下，没有看见什么钱包，就告诉他没有看见。但是他却继续地问我真的有没有看见，我觉得他可能掉了钱包，所以在问那里洗过车的人，而且他会来问我我觉得也没有什么好奇怪的，因为我的车子太容易辨别，也太容易给人留下很深的印象。我为了确定自己有没有听错地方，就问他他说的是什么地方，得到肯定是那个我刚才去过的洗车地方后，我很确信的告诉他我没有看见任何钱包。这时，他就边问我是不是要走了，边像是在找什么一样向我车里不停的看。我告诉他我的确是要走了，他就走到我车后面，用手机纪录我的车牌号码。我当时就觉得很奇怪，于是就问他：“你不会觉得我偷了你的钱包吧？？”他边抄我的车牌号码，边说：“是的，我觉得你偷了我女朋友的钱包。”说完就转身离开。我当时是惊讶的不知道说什么，于是我跟着他向一辆白色的车子走去。我记得那辆车，因为在洗车的地方那辆车停在我旁边，而且我记得的另两个原因是那是辆老式的宝马，宝马的徽记已经磨白了，加上那个女人在洗车时很仔细，所以记得很牢。我走到驾驶座那边的门，那个男人坐在驾驶座，女人坐在另一边。我就对那个女人说：“这是在是太荒谬了！！你觉得我偷了你的钱包吗？”那个女的一脸流氓的样子说：“没有。”于是我说：“我连你钱包什么样子都不知道，你要不要去我车里找？我还没回过家！”那个女的说：“不，我不想去你车里找。我不觉得你偷了我的钱包。”到这个时候我还有什么好说的，于是我就很气愤地走了。走了大概十五分钟左右，我就在想我当时应该就不走，问他们需不需要叫警察来，我倒是挺愿意帮他们叫警察的！！！！  气死我了！！！死老外！！！！

      Yeah! We went to Six Flags on last Sunday!!!! Finally!!! The group members are Koji, Mayumi, Sugiyama, Kayoko, Masa, Toshi and I. We met at 9:00 a.m. at the parking lot outside of Koji's place again, and left around 9:30. Stopped at exit 40 for breakfast again. Toshi, Masa, Koji and I sit at the same place that we sit last time.  This time, the weather looked good even the weather report said it would be rain.   When we arrived at Six Flags, not so many people were there which was good for us 'cause we didn't have to wait for long time to ride. And the weather was not bad at all, in fact, it started getting hot. The first ride that we went to was kind of scare for me. I was screaming all the way from the beginning to the end. The second one is the wood one, not so scare, but felt not so safe when we ride it. After a while, I got use to those scare ride, then start to enjoy it. Hahahaha, I was laughing when I ride.   We took a funny picture together, Koji has the picture right now. And, I will show you guys later after I get it. We went home around 4 - 5 p.m. Right after we left six flags, it started to rain. Really really really hard rain. We stopped at Ivy, had good dinner together.   Six Flags was nice!!!! I hope I could go again. Maybe I will go with Can or Lei!!!  终于，在星期天我和七个日本朋友去了SIX FLAGS。哈哈，我一直都想去SF， 但是一直都没有机会，全是因为天气，老是下雨。本来天气预报说星期天的时候依然会下雨，但是我和KoJI都觉得应该没有什么问题，因为只是说雷阵雨而已。出乎意料的，星期天的天气好得不得了，我们在SF的时候一点雨都没有。  我们在早上九点半的时候出发，大概开了一个半小时，终于到了SF。到的时候并没有太多的人，这样很好噢，因为不用排很长的队。所以我们在很短的时间里就可以坐上那些恐怖的翻滚列车。第一个我觉得最恐怖，因为人要倒着跑；第二个是木质结构的，虽然不会翻滚，但是没有安全感，依然很恐怖。我们坐了三个和水有关系的，结果每次都是全湿！！！最开始还觉得很恐怖，心理压力还蛮大的。可是到后来，我就习惯了。玩得很高兴哦！！！！  大概在下午4，5点的时候，我们就结束了所有的游乐设施。回家的时候开始下很大很大的雨！！！大的只能开20MILE。慢慢开，慢慢开，终于开到NH，我们就到IVY去吃饭。  可真是很累的一天，但是真的是SUPER FUN!!!!

      Takayuki is going back to Japan. He needs someone take care of his tort. Toshi and I went to his house pick up the tortoise yesterday's afternoon. The tortoise is much bigger than those two tortoise which I use to have that died because I didn't give them enough food. I am happy to have another pet, but also afraid that I can't take care of him. Anyway, this tortoise had a name from I don't know who, maybe Tadayuki named him, which is "Savage-the-mother-fucker"!!!!!! What a name!!!!! After Toshi and I bought him home, we decided five him a new name. Toshi and I both like 村上春樹,and Toshi is reading a new book of his, which is called 海边のカフカ。 So, we named him カフカ。He is cute and aggressive. We went to Flushing today and bought some seafood for him. I think he likes it. I will try to take care of him 'cause I don't wanna another tortoise die on my hand.!  一个日本朋友近期回国,于是就把他养的一只乌龟给了我.那只乌龟比我原来养过的,不幸因为我的疏忽死掉的两只乌龟大很多.在鱼缸里爬来爬去的,很是好玩的样子.看见乌龟就想起正列的故事,从君敏那里听说正列小时候在上学的路上捡到一只乌龟,因为小的时候常玩超级玛丽兄弟的游戏,所以以为乌龟背上的壳和乌龟的身体是分开的.如果打开乌龟的壳,那么就可以看见一只乌龟裸体跑出来.可想而知,那只乌龟的结果....（听说小正列被吓哭了，因为壳被打开后看见的全是内脏）。说偏题了，回到正题上来。那只乌龟本来有个名字，不过实在是不好听也太长，叫savage-the-mother-fucker.哈哈，不知道是谁取得这个名字哦！！！！于是我就和敏打算重新给他取个名字，正好，敏在看村上春树的新书《海边的卡夫卡》，我们都挺喜欢村上春树的，加上卡夫卡这个名字挺有意思，于是我们就叫他卡夫卡了。卡夫卡蛮活泼的，常常在鱼缸里爬来爬去，吃的也挺多的。希望他能活的好好的。

      I started work as a nail person. I don't know how you guys call the people who work in the nail salon. Anyway, the place I work is called The Simply Nail salon and Spa. It's 30 mins drive from Bridgeport on 95 North, and it is the same place that Toshi and Masa worked before. Toshi and Masa build that place with the Korean Boss. From him, I met all those wonderful Korean women, and they asked me to work with them. I didn't know anything about nail. So, I had to study from very basic, but I am a good student (kidding). Anyway, I started take customers from last week, and I only had three customers per day. However, we had very, very, very, very busy day yesterday. I walked in to the salon at 9:30 a.m, I had first customer after five mins, and then, none stop until 3:00 p.m. I had lunch for 20 mins, and none stop until 5:30 p.m. Oh! What a day!!! But, I had 10 customers!!! 10 customers are a lot because I have to spend around 45 mins for each customers. But, it was all good. Today was busy too!! Since it was busy yesterday, I felt ok today. （PICTURE: Toshi, Masa and Korean Boss. Behide them is the nail salon which they was working on, and I am working now. Check on picture for bigger image.)    大概在三个星期前，我开始在一家韩国人开的指甲店工作。那家店的名字叫做简单指甲与美容，那家店才开六个星期，在两个月前我每天都送敏和正去上班的地方正好就是这家指甲店的前生。也就是说，那家指甲店是他们修起来的，哈哈。也就是因为这样所以认识了那里的老板娘们。那里一共有三个老板娘，都是很好的韩国人。指甲店装修好后，她们就邀请我去那里打工。可是，关于指甲的一切一切我都不知道，所以我就从头开始学起。看起来美甲是件很简单的事，可是却没有那么得容易。从上个星期开始，我终于开始接待客人了，虽然每天都只有三个客人而已，但是比什么都没有的好，因为有客人就有小费。昨天超级的忙！！！我在早上9：30踏入店里的5分钟后就开始接待第一个客人，就这样一直没有停止的到下午3点。然后，20分钟的吃饭时间。过后，又是没有停止的到下午5：30。我一下子就接待了10个客人！！！很多了哦！！！因为一个客人我就要花差不多45分钟的样子。不管怎么说，忙一点也好！！！（图片说明：敏，正和韩国老板在指甲店前，他们当时正在装修，现在我在那里工作。点击图片看大图） urlLink    work&nbsp; urlLink

      Toshi, Masa and I went to picnic on Tuesday. They made riceballs in the early monring. We looked for a park which has a castle. It was a little bit far from Bridgeport,but it was ok. Tuesday was a raining day, but we still wanted to go. We took Lemon with us too. However, we had to leave Lemon in the car because she got so wild in the woods. When we just got there, it was still raining. We had to eat our riceballs inside of the house. There were around 10 young people who looked like teenagers, but they were drinking beers. After we ate our riceballs, we went to mountain climbing. And, we met a father with two daughters. Both of his daughters are so Cute!!! The younger one is really cute. We were climbing together, and they had a lot of fun with Toshi and Masa. Masa was so funny, and they called him the "Monkey-boy". Toshi had long talk with the father, and Masa and I just played with them. It was a good time. Those kids are too cute to grow up.   上个星期二，我，敏和正一起去野炊。一大早，敏和正就开始做饭团，做好了后我们就出发去我们的目的地。开车大概40分钟的一个公园，我们还带着柠檬一起去哦。可惜，柠檬到了野外就开始发狂了，到处乱跑，我们怕她跑不见，只有把她放进车子里。刚到公园的时候还在下雨，我们就去了一个像屋子的亭子里，里面很大，而且有10多个人在。他们开起来挺像高中生的，但是都在喝啤酒。我们就在离他们最远的地方开始吃饭团，还不错。吃完后，我们决定去爬山。在去的途中我们遇见一个带着两个女儿的父亲。那两个女儿超级可爱，特别是小的那个。我们就这样相遇，然后一起爬山。蛮好玩的，她们实在是太可爱了。 &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      I really really don't like the owner of my house. He is always making problems for me. This time, he told me that I can't have Lemon in the living room and I have to keep her in my room. Well, there is nothing I can do. Bon is the one who told me that I can just let her stay in the living room, plus, I don't have enough place for her in my room. It's not just a place for Lemon. There was one time, he told me that I should move to first floor since I bought a lot of guys back, and most girls live on second floor!!! What!!! When did I bought a lot of guys back? And, there are three men live on second floor, but only two women!!!!! I am so upset of him! Maybe I will think about move to another place to live.  丁教授真的是超級討厭。今天回家來，樓下peter說丁教授不讓貓在外面跑，讓我放到我房間裏。我房間那麽小，怎麽放得下貓？其實一只貓是沒有問題的，但是我哪裏有地方放貓貓用的便盆。而且當初是小邦說可以放在客廳和廚房裏，我才答應幫他照看。可現在丁教授卻説不可以。丁教授實在是個很可惡的人，上次居然讓我搬到一樓去，說什麽因爲二樓住的幾乎都是女生，我常帶男生回來過夜。什麽哦！！！我什麽時候常帶男生回來過夜了？而且二樓除了我之外就只剩下一個女生和兩個男生，那麽幾乎都是女生！！！！白癡丁教授！！！！！恨死你了！！！！

      Toshi went to macho club, and I was playing with my computer as usual. Masa called and asked if we wanna go fishing or not. That was a good idea. But Toshi didn't bring his cell phone with him, Masa and Tomoya went fishing first. After Toshi came back from macho club, we went to looking for them. It didn't take long to find them. They told us that they caught 5 fish already, but they sent them back to the sea. We changed to another place to fishing, but none of us caught anything. It was a relaxing time, a relaxing afternoon. 昨天下午和三个朋友去钓鱼，我对钓鱼是没有什么兴趣的，只是为了打发时间而已。记得小时候会和爸爸妈妈去什么钓鱼村之类的，大人在一边钓鱼，一边吃这瓜果，一边闲聊。而我一般则是被乡土气息所吸引，在一边和泥鳅蚂蚁玩，然后就等待那一顿下馆子的饭。昨天的钓鱼没有什么乡土气息，泥鳅蚂蚁，也没有下馆子。只是很普普通通的走到海边，然后开始钓鱼。海边钓鱼的人挺多，可掉到鱼的人却很少。主要还是感觉那个气氛罢了，海风吹在身上很冷，即使是在六月底的下午，依然需要穿件外套。最终，因为受不了刺骨的海风，想过夏天生活的我们就放弃了。 urlLink    fishing&nbsp; urlLink

      This year's fireworks is shorter and earlier than last year. But, it was good. Sugi, Toshi and I watched it together. We met kuni on our way to watching the fireworks. It was good time. After all, this summer is not bad. 今年的焰火比去年早，也比去年短。听说是为了省钱，不过也还是不错。我，敏和杉山一起看焰火。Bridgeport今晚超级热闹，超级多人。我在海边走的时候，怀疑我是不是非洲哪个国家。哈哈，不过，一切都很好噢！ urlLink    ff&nbsp; urlLink

      I heard there will be a couple who are from my hometown move in July 1st. I guess they will live in the room across my room. Well, I hope they are nice couple since they are from my hometown. I don't really know them, and I think they are kind of new. I am not good at being with people, so hope we will be OK.  听说7月1日会有新人搬进来，还听说是一对来自四川的夫妻。我想他们应该会住在我对面的那个房间。不知道他们会是什么样的人，希望能和他们合得来。嗯，太久没有和家乡人接触了，有点小紧张！！！

      Today was busy, I had 9 customers and didn't have anytime to relax for long. But, I did have a short period of time that nothing to do. I went to kitchen and ate some animal cookies. I don't know why, but while I was relaxing, I thought about my mom. There was one old time image came out of my mind which is I was eating something and my mom came out and told me don't eat snakes because we will have dinner soon. I felt so upset and depressed. I start to miss my parents. I am not that kind of girl who easy miss their parents, but I felt that the times that I miss my family is more than before. While I do nails for those ladies whose age are close to my mom or grandmother, I will miss them. While I think about all those Korean co-works who are nice to me and have children close to my age, I will miss my parents. I do miss them, I think. Haven't leave with them or spend any quality time with them in 6 years. I should shame on myself for whatever I did to make my parents sad or disappointed. After all, I am their only child and they love me deeply and truly. I love them too, but it just hard for me to tell them. I hope I can see them soon, and best wishes for them. ( The picture: I was only 15. I looked so stupid, but look at my family, we were all happy. I haven't see any of us have that kind of smile together for long time. I miss my happy family.)  今天工作很忙，很多客人。我都没有什么时间可以休息。不过，还好的是有那么一点点。在那一点点的时间里，我就去厨房吃点饼干。一个人坐在厨房的椅子上，吃着饼干，不知道为什么忽然想起了在国内的一幕：我在吃着零食，妈妈从房间里走出来说：“马上就要吃饭了，你还吃零食。”忽然一下，我觉得很伤感，心里有种说不出来的滋味，是不是寂寞，我也不知道。开车回家的时候也一样，开着开着，忽然想家；给年龄偏向中老年的客人美甲时会想起妈妈和奶奶；看见那些对我很好，孩子和我差不多大的韩国阿姨时，也会想家。有时觉得我那些家在美国的朋友真好，回到家里，爸爸妈妈兄弟姐妹都在。不像我们，孤独的一个人。我不是一个很容易想家的人，可是这一年来想家的次数比原来多了。不知道是不是因为我老了，我自己有时候真为自己感到羞耻，辜负了父母那么多的爱和好心。毕竟我是他们唯一的孩子，他们对我的爱是毫无保留并没有目的的。希望我不会再辜负他们，也希望能够早点见到他们。祝他们身体健康，快乐，平安。（照片：我大概15岁吧！看起来像个男孩子，傻傻的~，不过我很喜欢这张照片，因为我们一家人在照片中的那中笑容，我已经很久没有看见过了。快乐美满的家庭是我所向往的，我爱我家哦！）&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      Toshi and I went to NY today. We parked the car in Flushing as always, then went to eat breakfast. The place that we chose was really not good. We didn't like the food at all. Kind of feel wasted my money. Anyway, after that we went to Hong Kong market for change single bills to 25 cents(for parking). Right after we went out from Hong Kong market, we met Kayoko, Mari and Guoli. We were so surprised to see each other because Toshi and I thought Kayoko just went back to Japan, but she came back for summer classes. So fast!!! How long did she stayed in Japan? Maybe less than a month. After said bye to them, we took subway to Manhattan. On our way to Manhattan, Toshi met two old Japanese friends who were studying in UB. Toshi was so happy to see them and talk with them. They thought I am a Japanese as everybody does. After we got out of subway, we tried to looking for the Japanese bookstore. Even we went there once before, but none of us could remember where is that place. Then, Toshi went to talk with an Asian guy. I thought he is just a some Japanese who were walking on the street, and Toshi just wanted to ask him if he knows where is the bookstore. But, that guy is a Chinese guy study in UB, who can speak Japanese very well, and they met before. He was looking for the bookstore too, and he helped us fought it. We spend more than a hour in there, and I bought two books. After we left bookstore, Toshi took me to a place called Tribeca. Toshi thought there would be a lot of different stores because that's what books says. However, we walked more than 2 hours around there, and we didn't see anything good. The only thing over there is Chinatown. We got so tired and decided go to East Village. So, we took a Taxi to there because we were too tired!!! After we got there, we looked around, and walked around again!!!! Then, started our dinner in FIGHT. That was good dinner with two tired body. When we above to leave, Toshi met another Japanese person who was in the same high school as Toshi, and they talked a little bit. When we tried to go back to Flushing, it was around 10:00 p.m. We were really, really tired. Finally, we got Flushing and drunk some tea, then decided to go home. After we got in the car and tried to go home, Tadami called me. Guess what! He and Yoko were in the same parking lot with us, and they saw we were leaving, so they kind of followed us, but gave up soon. What a day!!!! We were in NY for 12 hours and we met 9 people!!!!! This is a small world after all!!! Anyway, today was hot, fun, tired and wired!   今天和敏一起去了纽约。早上11点过我们就到了法拉盛，把车停好后就去吃东西。本来想去茶都，可是茶都没有开门，我们就去了糖潮。我的天哪！！！糖潮的东西真是不敢恭维！！！实在是不好吃，我觉得我那钱花得太不值得了。吃完饭后，我们打算去香港超市换些硬币好停车，换了半天才换了4美元而已。出了香港超市向停车场走去时，忽然遇见了Kayoko, Mari和国立，我们都大吃一惊！！！因为Kayoko才回日本不久，怎么那么快就回来了。她说因为她要上暑假课，那也太快了一点，她总共回日本的时间可能还不到一个月。告别他们后，我们就决定坐地铁去曼哈顿，在车上，敏遇见了他的两个日本老友，两个人都是从UB毕业的。其中一个男生听说现在在给那个在纽约棒球队的日本球员做翻译。敏遇见他们非常的高兴，敏告诉我说那个男生在UB的日本人中声誉很高。出了地铁，我们在第五大道附近徘徊，因为找不到我们想要去的一家日本书店。忽然，敏开始和一个亚洲人说话，我一开始还以为敏只是找个一看起来像日本人的人问问看知不知道那个书店在什么地方。结果，那个人居然是在UB读书的一个在日本长大的中国人，他们互相认识。那个人就带我们去了那家书店，我们在书店里待了差不多2个小时，我买了两本书。于是敏说带我去一个叫Tribeca的地方，说是日本的杂志上有介绍，是个很不错的地方。可是，我们在那个区域里转了快两个小时却什么都没有看见。不知道是不是我们没有找到正确的地方，还是杂志把我们给骗了。总之，我们是累死了。于是决定去East Village吃东西。East Village是一个小区的名字，在那里有一条专门买日本食物的街，街边都是日本餐馆。那顿饭吃的还蛮好的，就是我们太累了。吃完饭后，我们就决定还是回法拉盛的好。正准备离开的时候，敏忽然又遇见了另一个日本朋友，听说是原来在一个高中读书的朋友。终于，我们回到了法拉盛，在回家之间，喝了杯冰茶。开车离开停车场的时候，Tadami忽然打电话来，原来他和女朋友正好也在那个停车场，看见我们的车开出去，忙给我们打招呼，可惜我们没看见。今天一天真是很热，很累，很奇怪&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      After working at simply nail salon, I found out simply is not simple at all. First, there are three owners which are all women. One of them controls most of power, one of them works very hard and another one of them is kind boss. However, when three of them together, there is a war!!! Personally, I like the kind boss one. She is a very kind woman. She doesn't talk a lot, maybe because her English is not so good. Besides those three owners, there are 6 women work there. One girl just came from Korea 2 months ago, one stays in America 8 years, one who is the best nail person in our salon and gonna get married next month, one is K_andy's mother, one is very very very funny and nice person and last one is me. I am basically is a outsider of those women because I am not Korean and can't understand what they are talking about, which is fine with me. Because of that, I knew there is something going on in the salon, but don't know what is it. However, I can guess. I think there is something about money, some of them start to notice that they are not paid fair. Well, I just guess, I don't really know. But, I know they are not really friendly with each other as other people thought. When I work there, I feel like back to High school, you know how those high school girls fight with each other, right? Yeah, just like that. Luckily, I am not Korean, and don't have to get into those things. I am really bad at deal with women. And luckily, they all like me a lot. I think I am good at make older people like me as a kid or something.   简单美容院真是不简单哦！！！工作了差不多一个月，发现原来简单很复杂。首先哦，简单是由三个女老板合资开的。三个人各有各的性格，第一个女老板有着最大的权利，我不知道是不是因为她投资的最多什么的；第二个女老板最勤劳的一个，每天从早到晚做个不停；第三个女老板是最善良的，对人非常之好，可能是因为英语不好而不常说话。可这三个女老板在一起的时候就没有什么特别太平的事情发生了。除了三个女老板之外，还有六个工作人员，第一个是刚从韩国来还没有两个月的和我同龄女生，主管做脸和美甲；第二个是来了八年30岁的胖胖姐姐；第三个是35岁下个月要结婚的未婚妈妈，也是店里的美甲高手；第四个是韩国好朋友k_andy的妈妈；第五个是超级有趣对人超好的甜心阿姨；第六个是超级没有资历和经验的我。幸好我不是韩国人，所以不知道她们之间那些勾心斗角的事情。虽然我听不懂她们平时都再说些什么，但通过我常在日本人中打拼的经验，她们说话的内容我可以猜到50%。所以我知道她们至少是因为工作分工合不合理的事情有过结，因为大家都是靠小费吃饭的人，所以客人的多少就决定了小费的多少，有些人的客人多余其他人的，其他人就有意见。幸好哦，我不是韩国人，不用进入那些像高中小女生的圈子里，只要埋头苦干就好，就好。

      Toshi, Sugi and I went to NJ and NY yesterday. We went to the Japanese market which is in NJ. We drove from CT to NJ, normally it only gonna take 1 hour more something, but there was HUGE traffic. It took us almost 2 hour to get there, but the driving was not too bad, three of us chat together while in traffic. The Japanese market is much bigger than I thought and it was nice that there is bookstores and little stuff stores around it. We went to eat first 'cause we were so hungry. The food was ok, and I had have better before. After that, we went to bookstore first. I didn't buy anything from the bookstore, but Sugi and Toshi bought some thing. Then we went to those little stores. All those stuff are cute, but I think I passed the age to buy those cute stuff. I mean I still like them a lot, but don't wanna buy them anymore. I wanna a Japanese futo, but futo over there are too expensive!! 300 dollars something!!! I can't afford it. I am too poor. Anyway, after all those things, we went to buy food. It was fun to look at all those Japanese products. Oh, we took those small pics. I remember that Tadayoshi told me there is the machine. I think we had fun. After that, we went to Flushing to eat hot pot. Flushing is just same as always. Hot pot was good, and we ate a lot!!! This summer is Fun at all.  敏，山和我昨天一起去了新泽喜和纽约。我们先去的新泽西，去那家日本超市买食品。在Yahoo上看到只要一个半小时就到了的地方，因为堵车居然用了两个多小时，还好是三个人一起去，在车里大家可以聊天。那家日本超市比我想象中的大，但可能是因为不是周末的原因，没有太多的人在。我们先去吃东西，我吃的是拉面，还好啦。我吃过更好吃的。然后哦，山就说要去书店看看，我们就先去的书店。因为上个星期才去过日本书店，所以我没有买什么东西，倒是山和敏买了一些书。书店的旁边有些卖小东西的店，就是那种很可爱的小东西。但是因为我已经失去了对可爱小东西的购物欲望，所以什么都没有买。回到超市后，就开始买食物，然后就去照小照片！！那里有小照片的机器哦！！挺好玩的。在归家的路上，我们决定去法拉盛，去那家四川菜吃火锅！！不错，不错。很好的一天，吃的好饱，这个夏天到头来一天也不坏哦！！&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

       Toshi washed out my contact lenses last night!!(Cry) That's my only pair!!! I went to Wal-markt this morning for a new pair of contact lenses. I thought I could get a new pair just right there, but they have to order from somewhere and it takes 5 days!!!&nbsp;FIVE DAY!!! That means I have to wear glasses for 5 days!!! I don't wanna!!!! I look so ugly with glasses!!! But, what can I do. They told me that they have to order a special kind contact lenses because my they told me that my left eyes shape look like a football and it need some special kind contact lenses. Well,&nbsp; 5 days without contact lenses shouldn't be so hard! Huh.. Can't go waterpark before I get the&nbsp;contact lenses. I am&nbsp;so not lucky with&nbsp;all those park thing.   &nbsp; 昨晚，我的隐形眼镜被敏给洗掉了！！！那是我唯一的一付，好伤心！今天一大早我就去买隐形眼镜。本来以为没有什么特别的要求，当场就可以拿到。结果！！我居然要等上5天！我的天哦，5天呢！这5天我都要带眼镜才可以。可是，这一切都是我自己的错，谁叫我自己小时候没有好好保护眼睛，现在却需要高科技的扶持过日子。可能人都是这样，拥有的时候觉得失去了也无所谓，结果失去了，才知道原来好幸福。不过怎么说，这5天都必须成为丑小鸭，等到隐形眼镜来了后，在变成天鹅好了。 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

      Masa's girlfriend, Yayoi, is here now. She is a cute girl who looks kind too.&nbsp; Masa took her to NY yesterday, and Toshi and I went there met them later. When we met them, they looked tried. They spend whole day walking in NY and visit this big apple. We went to couple places together, and Masa decided go empire State Building. That was kind of late, around 8 p.m. Toshi and I decided go to&nbsp;the Japanese Bar&nbsp;restaurant "Fight"&nbsp;first.&nbsp;"Fight" is always busy even that day wasn't weekend. We had to wait for around 30 mins to have site. While&nbsp;we was waiting,&nbsp;I made a cotton ball.&nbsp;Hahaha, kind of childlike, but it's ok. When we had site, we ordered seaweed salad and Edamame first. We were wondering if Masa could make it to ESB and "Fight", but we didn't wait for long. Masa and Yayoi came&nbsp;with a&nbsp;sad face because they had to wait for 2 hours&nbsp;if they wanna go to the&nbsp;top of ESB. They just gave up. We spend&nbsp;3 hours in the "Fight" and talked about all kinds of stuff. That was good time. On the way back to Flushing, I was so tried&nbsp;in the subway. But, once when I got in my car, I was awake.&nbsp;There wasn't&nbsp;many cars on the high way. We only use 45 mins to get home, and Masa and Yayoi were&nbsp;sleeping in my car (well, everybody does). &nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink   &nbsp;

      Monday night, for no&nbsp;reason, Toshi and I felt so hungry when we saw our&nbsp;video which was&nbsp;eating hot pot in Flushing with&nbsp;sugi.&nbsp;"Let's cook hot pot." I&nbsp;said to Toshi,&nbsp;"OK.&nbsp;and can I ask sugi too?" Toshi&nbsp;asked. "Sure." Then, Toshi went to pick up sugi while I was cooking hot pot.&nbsp;Hot pot is&nbsp;easy to cook, and you don't really&nbsp;need a lot of other food to&nbsp;go with it. So, we just waited for 30 mins for preparing.&nbsp;Oh! The hot pot was so hot and&nbsp;spicy even&nbsp;for me. We were enjoy hot&spicy in late night ( around 2:00 in the morning). That was really good for some reason. We really liked it and happy about it. &nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    星期一，半夜兩點。敏和我在看我們上次去法拉盛吃火鍋的錄像時，一致認同肚子餓。於是我就說要不要現在吃火鍋，敏說好噢，打電話叫山一起來。敏開車去接山，我就準備火鍋，火鍋很簡單，簡簡單單的吃的話。大概只用了半個小時就準備好了。三個人邊看電視邊吃火鍋，火鍋超級辣！！真的，我都覺得超級辣！吃的我們汗流不止的。哈哈，不過真的是很enjoy的一件事哦！下次有機會，再來一次哦。&nbsp;

I had all those pop-ups which ask me to stop pop-ups, and my computer was slow and many many more.&nbsp; My friend of China send me one software, and it is a really good one. I used it and killed many many virus. How many? 590 ! 590 VIRUSES~~~!!! I felt so happy to see all those viruses be killed. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! No more pop-ups and all those problems!!!!     我的好网友传给我一个软件，让我电脑里那些病毒全都死光光。我的电脑开始就像要死了一样，超级可怜。我用了很多方法都没有办法把那些病毒消除。幸好，我的网友有这个软件，用那个软件一查，光是木马就有5个。2个小时后，终于，590个病毒被拴出！！590个！超级多的。我会好好地对待我的电脑了，多带他去看看医生。

      We supposed wait for Masa and Yayoi to go water park too. But, they couldn't make it. Toshi and I decided to go by ourselves. We went to Six Flags' water park. It is kind of big inside. It was expensive!!! We spent $79.50 for tickes, and the locker spent us $12!!! We only brought $100 with us, and we had nothing left after that. That day was hot, which was good. We went to all those water rides. Most of them were fun, but kind of short. I wish they were longer. It was really good to see all those good looking people and cute kids. I haven't go to any water park for a long time. It was really fun. I wanna go again with more people next summer!!! urlLink     urlLink

        Masa and Toshi    urlLink     urlLink    Today! Masa, Kuni, Toshi and I went to Misquamicut Beach in RI. Toshi and I got up around 8 a.m. Masa came to our place around 8:30 a.m. for cooking the rice ball. I cooked one cold dish, corn and washed cherry. Kuni supposed to come at 8:30 a.m. too, but he didn't show up. We were wondering if Kuni still would go or not. Toshi went to Orange to check on Kuni, and came back without him. We thought Kuni not able to go anymore. However, maybe 15 mins later, Kuni called Masa and he was coming. We left our place around 10:30 a.m., which was 1 hour and 30 mins late than we planed.  The high way traffic was so bad!!! I really don't like CT 95, it also traffic. It took a long time to get the Misquamicut Beach. When we arrived, it was already around 1:00. The beach was good!!! So many people around!! We found a good spot very soon. When we put all our stuff in order, Toshi and I went to the ocean first. The water was cold!!!! We just stayed in water for a little bit, then came up and ate lunch. Lunch was good too!!! After that, everybody went into water. Toshi rent a boogie board and we went into water with it. I didn't really play because I was kind of afraid. The waves were strong sometimes. I was KO by a huge wave, and my left army got hurt by the sand. It wasn't too bad. I didn't play for too long, but Masa, Kuni and Toshi did. It was really good time that we spend on the beach!! We video typed fun things and took pictures.  It was fun!!! Fun, fun, fun.

      Masa took us (Toshi, Taiji, Nozomi, Kuni and I) to Norwalk last night. We thought there was a shops, but the shops was already closed when we got there. The only thing left was a who-knows-who-they-are rock ban, which was singing so hard. On the side of street, there were so many bars and cute shops. Toshi and I went to buy some food and stopped by a really cute shop. Because we were eating, we didn't went in. After we finished the food, that shop was already closed!! It wasn't so much fun over there, but it is always good to take a night walk during the summer night.  urlLink     urlLink
