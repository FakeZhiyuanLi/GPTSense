      Well today I cleaned house for a while. And then Laura invited my sisters and I to go to Fairfax pool because her Spanish friend Marta was exiling her. But we couldn't leave until a parental got home, which is dumb. So we didn't get there until Laura and Marta were leaving! What's the point? I'll tell you what the point is! To stay there for 4 hours, hang out with Erin Loree, work on my approach with lifeguard/madrigal and former diver Mandy A., and to help my sister build up the courage to go down the slide and swim by herself in the   deep water!   Overall, I'd say it was quite the fun time. But I've had way more than my fair share of chlorine today, and Lauren will be at diving tomorrow! Yey! So I should probably hit the sack. That was short, and not too sweet either. John is moving to Israel???? Or France . . . Or Germany . . . oh whatever, the kid can't hold on to a thought for more than year anyway. I'm excited to see what he does do with his life after he's been tormenting me with this dream switching business for 3 years. So . . . see you later aligator! Au revoir!

      Fumbling his confidence  And wondering why the world has passed him by  Hoping that he’s bid for more than arguments  And failed attempts to fly, fly   We were meant to live for so much more  Have we lost ourselves?  Somewhere we live inside  Somewhere we live inside  We were meant to live for so much more  Have we lost ourselves?  Somewhere we live inside   Dreaming about Providence And whether mice or men have second tries  Maybe we’ve been livin with our eyes half open  Maybe we’re bent and broken, broken   We want more than this world’s got to offer  We want more than this world’s got to offer  We want more than the wars of our fathers  And everything inside screams for second life

      Yeah, well you know what I said yesterday about breaking away from the idiot thing??? I lied. Today was horrid. Sometimes I'm not really sure why I'm such a loser, but I absolutely love it. Like, when can I just figure it out? I'm not sure if I'm just kidding myself that I might get better at diving someday, or if I just love doing it so much that I don't care. I always feel like I'm trying, but if I loved diving as much as I thought I did, then why can't I do a freaking back dive???? AAAARGH! And I don't mean to be all woe is me and unpleasant, but for crying out loud! Remember the inwards I was so excited about? Today I couldn't even remember how to do them, and my mind kept thinking about a zillion other things the whole time I was on the board. Then I would do my press (still thinking I was going to nail it) and jump . . . and fall. No dive whatsoever. I feel like crap, like crap that can barely stand up without it's legs shaking. If you've never felt that, it's really really annoying. Especially when you are balancing on the edge of a diving board. So . . . ugh.   In other news::: Sam got back from Costa Rica today. Lauren is still on the missing person's list. Maria is going to get her cast off in like an hour. She also learned how to toot on her clarinet which is about as beautiful as a dying owl. :)I think Laura wants to do something today, but I'm not really in the mood. I wish Cecilia would call me sometime this millenium. Hint Hint Miss Fisher. AND . . . joy of all possible joys . . . MY AUNT AND BOYFRIEND UNCLE RECENTLY PURCHASED A VERY EXPENSIVE LITTLE BOX THAT I SWORE I WOULDN'T TELL ANYONE ABOUT SO I'M NOT REALLY TELLING YOU THIS OKAY?? BUT MARIA AND I ARE THE ONLY ONES CLEVER ENOUGH TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS. Christy I was thinking mauve for the dresses . . . what do you think? ;) hehe. Well, adios people!

        Heyya, I'm super excited! I did 3 inward dives off the high dive today!! Whoooohooooo! And on the third one I smacked so hard I bruised my thigh! haha! I also got full twisting somersaults! This year is going to rock so much because I think I've finally broken out of my "idiot on a diving board stage". Derrick (my coach) even said that I look a lot more courageous on the board than I did last November, so that's definately an improvement. My friend Maya got 1 & 1/2's of the high dive too, so now I have to get those . . . mwa ha ha. Okay, well, I really need to go put lotion on my dry and cracking face, and start reading my book. Ciao!

        Hey All! I am currently at a loss of understanding at why my aunt can wear such little clothing . . . I mean she is 22, but the shorts she gave me may as well be denim underwear. Yuck! My knees feel very lonely and isolated. So does my neck, come to think about it. I just received a very interesting hair chopping which I think will inevitably turn into a mullet within a short period of time. My hair would not be so short if it wasn't pubescently changing into the dreaded curly hair that abounds on the head of my mother. I tried to explain this to the hair cutter lady person, but she did not see any reason not to hack the living daylights off of my head. However, I made the mistake of telling her that "It's just hair, it will grow back." Which is true, and it's not like I care much about hair anyway, but that's just not the type of thing to say to someone with scissors. This short haired journey will be interesting if not completely flattering, and perhaps the chlorine will spare me a little of it's torture. Whatever. I wish wholeheartedly that I was bald. I hope you are having a marvelous day! Adieu!

      Today was fun. At 1:00, Lauren came over and we went to pick up Hannah and meet Kirsten at Mt. Simon. We frolfed a round and I was two over par. I used Joe's frisbee golf discs, and we had a blast. Then we went diving at the cliffs and I chucked a 1 1/2 for the very first jump! I was really short, but it was cool to make the people there say "ooh" "aah". Hannah did a 1 1/2 too. Kirsten forgot a suit, so she just watched, which stunk, but we had fun anyway. After that, we went to jump off from a railroad track thingy. It was so fricken high, I was going to pee my pants. Yikes, I'm shiverifying thinking about it. Fun times, great oldies however. And then I was lait, but nobody was home to know that. And then we are going to the cabin again. Boring again, sorry Chris. Buh bye!

      Today, I swam at the "Plaza" formerly known as the Ramada. I swam around with my sisters for like 4 hours or something crazy like that. It sucked immensely. That is all.

      Today was soooo much better than yesterday! It was the swim/dive tubing trip and it was pretty dang fun if I do say so myself. Super cool to hang out with everyone, minus Alisha . . . jk. Or am I? So after that, the divers went home early and Lauren forgot her keys in the other van, so we got to hang out for&nbsp; while and wait for them. That was cool though. Except the girl is allergic to grass! I think that's sort of funny in some dumb way. Haha, we sang a lot of Paint Your Wagon . . . It was awesome. Hand me down that can of beans. Lauren is so cool. She's just all around fun to hang out with. Like, some people are boring and you have to be doing something interesting for it to be fun to hang out with them, but not Lauren. Coo "L". Oh yes. Oh yes, Oh yes, Oh yes, We both, oh yes, we both reached for the gun, the gun, the gun . . . AAAh, musicals! And then I went to a Common Ground function organized by Zacharye himself. I think he had some good points, but . . . I'm not sure he really accomplished what he set out to do. After that, we had this awesome idea to go to HOM furniture, but that failed when it closed at 9 o'clock. Blah blah blah, Sam's house, blah, more cool people. Kate, Miah, Maya, Josh, Sam, Lauren. TGS. Roger Rabbit. Fun times, great oldies. Oldy Molde. Sorry Kirsten. I'm so sick of typing, and I'm hungry, and nobody cares, and then I found ten dollars.

      Sometimes, screaming just isn't enough. Either everyone in my family is crazy or I really am the self absorbed jerk they claim me to be. I'm guessing it's probably the latter, but then all of my friends must just hang out with me out of pity or something. Sorry guys, you can all go home and leave me to my grouchiness. What did I do today? A whole heaping bucket of absolutely nothing. I slept late on accident. I attempted to clean the kitchen, but Dad came home and made a huge mess, Leah wanted help on the computer, I had to figure out what was happening with the tubing trip tomorrow, and I had to take all the crap off of my computer. Needless to say, it took a while. After that, I tried to burn my files from my computer, but it kept crashing on me and being really rude. The whole time, Maria would say something, I would reply, and suddenly I was getting&nbsp;chewed out for&nbsp;"freaking out". I'm not quite sure when disagreeing bridged the gap to freaking out, but hopefully this is just a stage in the mind of an eleven-year-old. More of the same throughout the day, and I pretty much felt like crap. And then I asked for a break. At the request, Mom sat there and picked through everything that I haven't gotten done today and threw in something about paying for the trip tomorrow. It ended with one of those guilt trip type "well . . . I guess." (sigh) I decided to be greedy, and with that I laced up the blades and hit the road. Of course I couldn't actually go anywhere, because that would be wrong of me. Why? I have no idea. It was very very nice to get out of the house for a few minutes though. There are just some things that bring me back to earth, and&nbsp;skating is&nbsp;one of them. So I went back inside and offended Maria almost instantaneously. Back to the street. Back inside. The coast was clear. I sat down to watch Family Guy. Family Guy is the most stupid, absurd, cynical thing on television. Therefore, I love it. Five seconds later I'm summoned downstairs. I figure, can't be anything too bad. Mom wanted to figure out yet another way to get us to clean the house regularly and efficiently. She said she would pay us, and what not. Maria came up with an idea to clean the house every other day and scrub everything down once a month. That sounded good to me, except I know I'm not going to be here enough to make it work. So I said, regretfully, "Well that would suck, for when you have a life." Not funny. What I meant was "How can you clean the whole house every other day when we won't all be home every other day?" My mother took it in the opposite direction, instead saying that I was ungrateful, and didn't care, and didn't want to offer any ideas, and we can just never clean the house if we have something better to do. After that was clarified, (or so I thought), I asked something about what we would do after school starts because I won't have time every day along with diving and homework. Then of course it was that I was trying to figure out reasons why I couldn't be involved and why this plan would never work. That was it. World War Three. And why? Because everything I said got flipped around against me. I wish we could submit our family conversations in writing. Mom just kept pulling every stupid thing into the argument and even after I explained something, she would go back and keep distorting it. And then there was a point where I was just supposed to sit and listen and keep my mouth shut if I couldn't offer anything positive. WHO THE HECK IS BEING NEGATIVE HERE?? AAAAH! Am I going insane? I swear, a reasonable agreement could have easily been reached between Bush, Saddam, and Jacques Chirac, but not my mother and I. Everything has to be a big federal case around here and I am so sick of it! And I love how my sisters are the cute little angels all the time. Maria asks what she could possibly do around the house to get a couple bucks for. Leah sweetly agrees with everything Mom or Dad says. I'm the big idiot that goes out and has fun and then is just mean all the time. Constantly. Never thinking of others. My sisters don't like me, and I have proof of that, so I don't really know why I bother. Whenever I do something nice, it gets overthrown by whatever dumb, sarcastic thing I said. I don't care. I should just shut up all the time. I should be mute. Duct tape my mouth please! Just to ensure that I don't screw up my wording and offend someone. I'm sorry I'm such a loser, but I really do try, so bear with me in my feeble attempts at humanity. I can't even pay attention to other people, so how am I supposed to figure out what I'm talking about? Whatever. I should sleep. And tomorrow suffer the guilt of asking my mom for 8 bucks. Good night everyone.

      Today, Apryl came over to hang out with the madre for a bit. She brought her chitlins for me to babysit. Little Richie is 5 and Annie is 2. They are pretty cute kids, so I didn't mind watching them for 5 hours, but it got a little tedious at times. We had a scraped toe, a falling off the swingset, and an hour long nappy, but that was it. Overall, it went awesome, and I made 15 dollahs. Not too bad at all. So, they got back and we went to Garfields to eat. It was super cooL to see Apryl again because we haven't seen her in about a year. And then we went to Kohl's and I got a shirt for tomorrow. PHANTOM OF THE OPERA!!! I'm soooo excited! AAH! Ciao.

        Heyyya! This morning was&nbsp;a carwash at Burger King. There were not a lot of peoples there, at all. I got such a bad sunburn, it's funny. I'm not totally sure pink is my color . . . The sunburn isn't really a big deal though, considering that the carwash was quite the fun time. Upon getting home from that, I "went to work". haha. work. Selling doorknobs is absolutely rivetting. Later we went to Culvers, and then to the brain injury support group. I haven't seen those people for such a long time! It was really cool. Dawn had a really nifty mug that said, "It's been fun, but really, I think I have to scream now." Steve and Jake came aussi. So . . . apres that, we went to Scheels to see if the sandals I got are worth the money or if I should get different ones. I believe I have chosen to stay with the ones I got even though they don't dry out very well at all. Wow, I'm sure you were waiting on the edge of your chair to find out the answer to that one . . . I'm so exciting. So yeah, groceries, and now here I am. AH! I watched an episode of Family Guy! I usually don't like to sit and watch TV, but that is the funniest show ever made. I suppose I will get back to "work". See ya!

      Yesterday was Tuesday. I didn't do very much of anything except scrub the kitchen. After that I went rollerblading to Sam's to give her some pictures of the last day of school. Kate was there, and we all went to Menards to pick out paint for her room. Later that day I ended up going frolfing with Sam and Joshua Mario. (They use par three for every hole!) We jumped off the cliffs too. That was really fun. I did some more back somersaults and what not. Josh and Sam jumped off King . . . scary scary. Sam narrowly escaped sudden death. I wimped out. I value my life. Overall, pretty nice, slow, fun day. Sam's leaving today for Boulder orientation. CooL. Aloha!

      Long time no see! Okay, well, I'm going to try to keep this short. It will be hard. On Friday I had a few divers up to my cabin for a G'wan G'wan sort of thing. It was soooo much fun! We drove up in Lauren's car and we ate pizza and played Catch Phrase and hung out for a while. Sleeping in the bunkhouse was quite the experience for a number of reasons. Firstly, lots of bugs. Second, we found romance novels that the previous owners had left behind. Third, truth or dare . . . haha! yeah, that was hilarious, but what happens in the bunkhouse stays in the bunkhouse, right Alexis? The pizza box thing will continue to crack me up for quite a while though. We were going to go swimming later at night, but nobody likes bugs that hover over the water.   Saturday, we slept for a really long time. It was like a snoring orchestra. We rose, we ate, we conquered. Just kidding. But we did go for a swim, and we hung out in the middle of the lake on inflatable chairs. Magical Otter Hannah!!! What is a fire? And why does it, what's the word? BURN!? I hear you call my name and it feels like home. So yeah, and then we left. More Catch Phrase and Scattegories on the way home. Overall, waaaay fun weekend. And what is the moral of this story?   The only thing Sam Loomishka thinks about is Harry Potter and sex.    Saturday night, I was dropped off at the Grandparents' for unknown reasons, wink wink. My grandmother doesn't know much about . . . anything that doesn't involve the Bible or cooking. She is trying to convince me to go to some microscopic private non-recognized Christian missionary school. To which of course, I say NAY! RARR! So then I said, "Well shucks Grandmumsie! It's always been my dream to go to school in Las Vegas and go into the adult entertainment business! I hear there's a bunch of job opportunities for young girls such as myself!" HA HA and dare I say HA. No, I don't, because I didn't ever say that. But I was thinking it.   Sunday morning, churchy church. I wanted to fall asleep. I have no clue what the sermon was about because I stopped listening after we walked in the door. Is God really that boring? Why is it so hard to spice it up a little bit? And could the ladies in the front row please not give me strange demonic looks for wearing pants? After that it was home, Subway, nap, attempted game of Go Fish. Attempted because my great grandmother Mertie could not figure out how to play. Again, I desired sleep, or chewing a limb off. The rest of the day was more boring. And more being referred to as "Bunky". I decided I might want to attend college at the University of Montana. It looks cool.   Today! Sleeping, and then to Shopko with Laura. We saw Sam, and I cut my finger open. Later, cliffs with Chris. Saw Josh and Joel. Then, rollerblading with Chris downtown. Fun! Then, frisbee with Chris. Yey! Then, picking up Christy . . . Not yey. She seemed happy, and then we were waiting for her to get ready. We played a video game until she was ready to go. She never informed us when she was ready to go. I guess we were supposed to figure it out or something. Suddenly it was war. She just left the house to go "running" apparently. Because we were playing video games and not caring about going to the gym? Are you confused yet? Me too. So we went to go find her, which is what she wanted. Chris and Christy argued stupidly, also what she wanted. And eventually she came out thinking that she was right. Again, it was what she wanted. Chris is either very dumb, or very . . . something. I don't understand what the big deal was, and I don't really care. Christy is just rude and manipulating. Sometimes. Most of the time, she's the coolest person ever, but seriously! What's the point of getting your undies all in a bundle over stupid crap? Where does that get you? How can you be living life to the fullest if you're a grouch and a whiner? I don't know. Goodnight!

      This entry promises not to be so long. It was a slow day. I slept until like eleven, haha! And then Lauren called while I was doing laundry and asked if I would like to go frolfing and cliff jumping. The mother gave me quite the list of things to get done before I could leave, in addition to taking a shower and emptying the cat litter. I said to her, "Mother, there is no way I can finish this in less than an hour!" But I attempted it anyway. Of course, I had just started on the disgusting room that some people like to call a kitchen, when Lauren and Danielle show up. That stunk a lot, because our house is probably the messiest house around. They, being the nice people that they are, assisted in the loading of the dishwasher. That was soooo gross because we still had dishes from Friday afternoon sitting there. We had to leave for the cities on Friday right after we made a ton of food, and we didn't have time to do any dishes. So, that was icky and bad timing on my part, but whatever. After the dishes, we went up to Mt. Simon park to play some frisbee golf. I have never played frolf before today, and it's really very enjoyable. Danielle and Lauren are really awesome people to hang out with too. After that, we went up to the cliffs and dove for a little while. Some kids that were there shoved a huge part of the cliff into the water. That was kind of cool. Oh yeah, and I got stuck on a rope swing. Funny, funny. So, yeah. That's about it!

      We rose. We daisy. We got up so to speak. We thought: Hunger! Hunger! The man at the desk said,"Eat! Much food over there!". So we went in ignorance. I forgot the stupid camera, which ruined the morning for my father. I'm not sure why I have any responsibility in this world . . . So, Leah was starving and whining, and we had to walk fifty miles more than we should have. Everyone was in a bad mood, and it sucked a lot. And then we get to the stupid carnival thing and the food is soooooo expensive! We could have eaten a nice meal at the Mall of America for less than what the crappy fair food cost! So, suddenly we have fifteen minutes until the stupid train leaves, and we were still at the carnival thing. The Nelson family can run quickly when provoked. You would be surprised. Except my mom had to walk at snail speed because of her squished foot, so it took us five years to walk a mile. Then we got to the train takey offy place. It was actually just a long parking lot with a train by it. Oh yeah, and a big ole fence that we had to walk the length of, turn around, and then walk the entire length of it to get on the train. And by then, they were waiting for us, which is fortunate for my mother's sake. (She's been planning this grand excursion thing for like a month.) So we got on the train. It started to move. It went for about a good solid 15 minutes, stopped for a good solid 15 more minutes, and then went backwards. I read a chapter in my book and bought a T-Shirt for some reason. However, the mother was pleased, and therefore it was not a waste. After that excitement, we ran inside the science museum for a few minutes. Then it was back to the van. Ma and Pa thought it was a wondrous idea to head over to the U of M and check out the FREE art museum there, but of course that was closed for the fourth of July. Whoop dee doo. Then there was food at some Chicago restaurant. If you have never tried Thai pizza, you should. It's tres chouette. Mom and Dad played old arcade games. Mom was really impressed that she was able to beat me. Haha. I soooo let her win. : ) After that we stopped by Northwestern to see the campus and such. Once again, a Mom thing. After that it was homeward bound. Except we ended up going to Carson Park to see fireworks with both sets of G & G's, C.J. squared, and aunt Sally. My boyfriend uncle Chris and I had a ton of fun. We played frisbee in the baseball field until the fireworks started. Christy is a turd though. AAAH! I almost ran into Mr. Nelson and his five-year-old son! That is so icky! Blech, blech, blech! So, after fireworks it was home and playing with firecrackers and sparklers in the driveway. It's really interesting if you throw some in a mailbox, or in a rain gutter. Heehee. That's about it, and I have to fart and go to sleep! I'm beat and it's 1:12 in the morning. Good morning Neverland! -Anna

      Saturday: We left for the cities around 2:30 or something like that. We went to my aunt Jean and uncle Don's house because we haven't seen them for a while. That was an experience and a half. But I guess I need to cherish these precious moments. They have a stupid and annoying poodle named Crombie that is 15 days older than me. And apparently they're moving to some appartment complex?? Why on earth would they do that? They have lived in the same house, that smells the same, and looks the same for my whole life. Why change it just because they are old? Haha, world revolving around myself. So, after that rendezvous, we went to Applebee's. I ate sooo much, I wanted to hurl. And I met this really nice waitress from Germany. She reminded me a lot of Christina from Denmark. Anyway, we went back to the land of the Dalrymple, and played with stupid drooly animals. Dad attempted to fix the sad sad thing that is Jean's computer while we had a roaring conversation with Don. He's begun the process of losing many a marble. So yeah, that was that. And then we drove for a while and located our hotel. Once my sisters had thouroughly bounced the mattresses until they contained no more bounce, we went down the street in the drizzle to see some works of fire. There was actually a spectacular show from the "Taste of Minnesota" thing. The music was perfectly corresponding with the fireworks, and we had a great view from a parking ramp. Apres cette, we returned to the hotel and watched the best show on television . . . MONK! haha, okay, I like it a lot. We ordered food and what not also. And then there was night the first day.

        Today, diving: Lauren was really excited about everything. It was cool to see her having so much fun diving because usually she gets kind of weird and distant when she's trying to get a dive. Today however, she got back one and a halves with a half twist! Sam dove with us, but she was just being a big show off the whole time. Trying to get some "oohs and aaahs". haha. And then our berries of straw were not being sold, and it was sad.  Today,HOM furniture: Lauren, Sam, and I all went to HOM today to hang out. (poop on Derick) We ate cookies and played with the massaging chairs. And then . . . marshmallow mattress partay!! For the thousandth time, if I was homeless . . . oooh, that would do it.  Today, Riverview Park: ULTIMATE FRISBEE!!! whoohoo! Sam, Lauren, Josh, Schasse, Kate, Anita, Matt, Matt, Joel, and a couple others that I can't remember. We played in the river for about an hour and a half ish. I have a mystery gash on my thigh from diving into a sunken tree. Not the coolest idea on the planet. And then there was a mud fight, and if you've never had sand stuck in every crevice of your swimsuit, it's an interesting sensation.  Today, Grandma car: Anita driving me home. We wore sombreros. We listened to Cindy Loper. Flicked off Memorial as we drove by.  Today, F to the isher residence: Roller bladed to Cecilia's. Played with Thor and Coltrane. Played DDR. Got sick of it. Played James Bond. Got sick of it. Made macaroni and drank Diet Dr. Pepper. Ate Oreo's. Played Scrabble. Got sick of it. Went online. Got very very bored. Listened to music. More boredom. More online. Dancing animals. Bored. Sat around and did absolutely nothing. Surprisingly, not that boring! Went outside and sat around doing nothing. Even less boring! And then I went home.  Today, Chez Moi: Went online. Played a prank on someone. Tried to figure out Ebay. It's kind of dumb. No, it's really dumb. Continued playing a prank. Ate some food and junk. More stupid online wandering.  Today, My Driveway: Christy and Chris came over to give me a PHANTOM OF THE OPERA CD!!! They are the coolest aunt and boyfriend uncle ever! whoohoo! We played on the car. I got my butt all wet with the windshield fluid. (I'm sort of lame like that.)   Today, The Brain Drain Machine: Sat on my butt and watched Monk. It is the best show on television. I think. I don't watch enough television to say so, but it captivates my interest for 60 minutes of my day, so it must not be bad.  And now here I am ignoring my siblings. I should probly go and make sure they're sleeping at 1 in the morning. Just a thought. Goodnight. Farwell. I wish this blog could sing like in the Sound of Music. That would be cool.

      First of all . . . Lauren, tomorrow you WILL! I really wanna go to HOM!  So . . . I got a letter from Mr. Suppon. He is one of my favorite teachers, if not my favorite teacher. I love photo way much, but I am pretty darn good at screwing things up in that department. Cheating is bad, especially if you are a really bad cheater and you end up making it look like you were cheating even more than you were before. Yeah, so, that made no sense. However, I did it. I muddled up coppying the end of a simple paper into turning in the wrong paper and looking like a total lying idiot. I suppose I deserve it though. But how lame is it to end the year with an "  INCOMPLETE  " in your favorite class? Extraordinarily lame. So, now I have to do this stupid paper for the fourth and possibly fifth time to compensate for getting a low score on it the third time around because I didn't have my study guide anymore. I am going to go and sit on my butt and finish this dumb thing as neatly and perfectly as I possbibly can to ensure honesty and completion. Yikes oh mighty. I'm like the fugitive or something. A bientot!
