        i added more stuff into my blog, hopefully they will be used... :) well, here is my journal for the day...  hmmm, went to my brother's kindergarden to see his teacher, not that he is naughty but it's something like 'Meet-the-Parent Session' but in my case, 'Meet-the-Siblings Session' coz my father couldnt make it...  the last time i went back to the kindergarden was last year, to pick my brother up from school with my father... i cant believe that the kindergarden actually changed a bit when i returned today along with my siblings and maid...we took the MRT to potong pasir, where the kindergarden was located...and we were like walking around trying to look for which path to take to get into the kindergarden... we spent around like half an hour just to realize how to go there... actually, if they didnt seal off some parts of the roads, i would be able to find the kindergarden easier but there's some kinda school contruction there so the path was blocked...  when we finally reached there, my brother led us to his class... when we got to the second level, where his class was located, we were so lucky that we met his teacher at the stairs. she led us to the music room and told us about my brother... basically, the teacher said that he was a helpful boy but needs more help with his numbers and english... so my sister and i pretended that we knew what she was saying and nodded our way through...then, we were brought to this room, with tables and chairs and blah blah blah...  the chairs, i found them kinda small and hard to sit on... i was like 'these are chairs? they look more like stools... and the table are the height of my secondary school's chair...' everything in that room seem so small... and i cant believe that i once studied in a such a place before... :P then, these teachers came and talked to us... some of the teachers recoqnized my other brother, leon, and my sister, vera but none of them have any impression of me... i wasnt surprised...it was like a decade ago since they last saw me...  vera and me was asked to see the chinese teacher... okay...so we were led into another room, which i suppose was the english room but the teacher just used it for meeting the parents... then we were made to sit on the chairs again, and i'm surprised the teacher was also sitting at the tiny table with the small chair... so the teacher said that my brother is very active, too active, always chit chatting with his friends... ya... coz the teacher sounded like a china person, i was like 'ya, ya, ya' but seriously, i can hardly understand what she said... i only took out the main points...:p  hmmm...after all the meeting and stuff, we walked down the stairs and looked around the school...then, went back to hougang...  when we reached hougang, leon and i went to hougang mall to check out the price of the PS2... i was planning to buy one but i wanna check out the price first... the deal was kinda good, S$399 for the PS2 console, chipped, 2 controllers and an original PS2 game. after checking out the price, we went to play at the arcade... ya...just play those games i normally play lor, para para, ddr, marvel vs capcom 2 etc etc blah blah... my sister, youngest brother and maid went home on their own...  when we played enough, we took a bus home and i did my art homework... ya...then used the computer...ate dinner...and ta da...here...typing... :P
