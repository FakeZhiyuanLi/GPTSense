      At this very moment there are reasons why Americans should rise up against the government and there are definite revolutionary strides being made (including here in Metro Denver) for certain causes (the media for instance), but most Americans are not willing to rise up; not yet anyway…  Over the past few years our rights as Americans are being whittled away while most of us go through our daily lives with all this activity unbeknownst to us because we don’t hear about it or see it through our traditional methods of information retrieval.  The great talking heads that we have learned to trust, that we invite into our homes each evening, to scare us into believing that the non-Christian world is out to kill us, that people of color are going to steal everything you work so hard to buy at Wal-Mart, and of course all is good because some kind policeman stopped tormenting the inner city youth long enough to rescue a stranded puppy.  Of course, I’m being facetious, but until the propaganda machine of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is reformed, most Americans will go on believing that they need to buy SUVs to support America, that McDonalds is a viable choice for family meals, and that they should be proud that Wal-Mart wants to invade their neighborhood.  There are basically only a handful of corporation (and we know how honest they can be, I have worked for two Fortune 50 (not 500) companies, and saw things that would make your head spin) who provide us with our daily news, and most of these corporations have major business ties to the United States government (i.e. General Electric (G.E. owns NBC and is also one of the largest nuclear weapons manufacturers in the world); and just as most of these corporations make shoddy products that we have just come to expect, they are also shoddy with the news by basically providing us on average with three minutes of “real news” in a thirty minute broadcast (please see www.fair.org for more information).  But there is hope; there are “revolutionaries” fighting the fight against big media.  People like Amy Goodman and Greg Palast who go out and seek the truth, looking under rocks, finding the real stories, the stories we need to learn of and understand, and not just accept that we are under the immediate threat of a foreign dictator because the President and Vice-President Select say that we are.  There are countless other issues that need to be ranted about, that need a revolution to bring change, but there is one issue that is going to come to the forefront and I believe it is coming sooner than later, and will force a lot of Americans to take to the streets, to take action…the raping of our education system.  Education is the key to freedom, it is proven by the legal victories of the civil rights movement in this country.  At some point, the government paved the way for community colleges and easier accessible institutions of higher learning, allowing the less fortunate, the working class citizens an opportunity to break the “blue collar” career that would more than likely lie before them.  Technology was ripe and the jobs were good.  Notice that there are no longer any poor people in this country?  You don’t hear or see poor people (in America) on the news, nor from the politicians.  At sometime in the early nineties the propaganda machine programmed us to believe that if you have a job you are middle-class.  I may have been that way in the past, but I know now that it is not true.  I have a job, and I’m basically one paycheck away from living on the street.  But the elites of this country who feel education should not be a right, have decided to outsource all these jobs, take them away from us and ship them overseas, where they can pay someone from an impoverished land a “living wage” of mere pennies a day.  The powers that be rant and rave about school vouchers.  How school vouchers will help the striving single mother of two get her children a proper education.  The children are definitely being deprived of that in public school (where these same powers that be have repeatedly slashed funding to these school for the past twenty years), where they don’t teach Christian values and speak of heresy.  It will help someone, but certainly not that single mother.  In the long run it only aids the elite and the corporations they either own or befriend; because in the long run, we won’t have institutions like this, in the long run education will be something that you are born into like the class systems of South America, they will take away our power, and have created a pool of uneducated desperate employees to help sweep the floors and stock the shelves at Wal-Mart.  Now I’m not criticizing these as bad jobs for those who currently hold them, but this will be all there is, no opportunity to move up and out; basically a two-class system of consumers (those who have money) and the people that service the consumers (those who don’t have money).  If they put this voucher system in place and then cut funding for the vouchers themselves, because they will, there will be more wars to fight over oil (read the Eisenhower Doctrine) and basically mandate that if you cannot pay then you cannot receive an education (they don’t care, they have the money for education); this is when the people, the American people will rise and take to the streets, to fight this to the bitter end.

      We (as global citizens) experience new ideas and changes that are very similar to what the Europeans saw during the Scientific Revolution, the only thing is that we are more educated, enlightened, maybe jaded to just step back and be totally awestruck at every one.  But just like the Europeans during that time frame, there are a lot of leaders who look at gains in science (stem-cell research in particular) and scream heretic.  Whoever coined the phrase “history repeats itself” was dead on; the world we stand on today very much parallels the world (from the timeframe) that we just studied.  We have “leaders” who feel that they have been chosen (or rather appointed) by God, put holds and criminal penalties on scientific research that would blow the doors wide open on disease, censor artists, control the flow of every piece of information we receive by allowing the media conglomerates to consolidate and become fewer and fewer and further the fight for “globalization” with this plan for New World Order, but the “leaders” get to pick and choose who gets to play, just like they do with the joke they call “fair trade”.  Many of these things…fear of science & technology, the (attempted) Christianization of the world, meaningless wars for personal gain, greed, an attempt at extremely cheap global labor, to the point of slavery, no interest in human rights or the public interest, these are all ideas that are spoon fed to us (with a little sugar to make it go down easier) as the way the country/world needs to go.  The United States alone is a prime example; we are in the fast lane towards becoming what is basically a two class society.  They have led us to believe that as long as you have a job you are middle class, notice that there are no more poor people in America…politicians no longer speak of the poor, the media certainly doesn’t…and we’ve been led to believe that all of the people who sleep on the streets at night, do it by choice because they are lazy.  They told all of us to go to college and get trained for new careers because the manufacturing jobs were going, and they weren’t coming back (to steal from Bruce Springsteen), that is why institutions like this were created.  Now those jobs are gone, they say don’t worry you’ll get trained for new jobs, bigger and better jobs, but they’re going to rapidly close institutions like this, and make education privilege, all the while taking the jobs and outsourcing them to India and Pakistan where they can basically pay them no more than $2 a day, and have what basically amounts to “legalized slavery”.  Is it any coincidence that the only jobs we can get are at the friendly, neighborhood Wal-Mart, at the same time that they (Wal-Mart) are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to privatize education.  Once they take away education, the powers that be are able to keep the population down, and they can hypnotize and woo us with religion, as long as we pray to the right god and wear the right medallions.  These ideas are changing the world, and not for the better, we are basically sitting back, and allowing “history to repeat itself” when in fact, we can step up and stop it.  I know that this maybe upsetting and possibly offensive to some, and I may just have totally jumped on a soapbox and moved off of the topic, but I firmly believe that the state of the world today emulates the state of the world at that very time, and at the rate these ideas and tactics are moving there is the grave possibility that things will get darker before we see any improvement; unless we stand up and fight.  These things are all going to lead to one thing…an uprising, maybe not a full-blown revolution, but something will more or less take place to take something back from the ruling class.

      Fatherhood, impending like a storm, not a violent turbulent storm; the type of storm that blows roofs off houses and turns trailer parks around.  This is the kind of storm that you look forward to after a hot, humid East Coast day.  The kind of storm that cools everything down just before the ice cream man comes with his evening sing song.  As frightening as it is, I long for fatherhood to come…to feel his feather-soft skin against my naked chest…to smell the sweet scent of innocence and youth wafting from his head.  How I long for my youth, to be virile and fearless leading young Jack through adventure after adventure.  But alas, my youth is gone…replaced by sensibility (I laugh at the very thought) and a fear factor that longs to tumble down an incline at forty miles-per-hour, but simply knows better.  How I long to spend every possible waking hour with him; showing him the things that I had to learn on my own.  I want to give him all of the tradition, but remain unorthodox…refusing to surrender my identity.  He will help me, more than I will ever help him…centering me, balancing me, ensuring that I’m half of the man that I’ve always wanted to be.  I love him already…shit, I love him more than anything that I have ever known…it brings tears to my eyes, and yet all that I’ve seen of him is a horribly blurry picture…black and white nonetheless.  It puzzles me…how can I love something so much, but never to have seen it?  It’s unexplainable like the passing of the seasons or the mysteries of God!  All I know is that I need to prepare for his arrival; and I don’t know how.  The things I need to accomplish are things that I have dawdled over for ten years or more…and now I have five months…lord knows it is such a tumultuous time to bring a child into the world, but I will protect him from everything against the grain, everything evil.  I would go against everything that I believe in to ensure his sanctity.  I guess society would say that I’ve forsaken his future for my own happiness.  This may or may not be true, and I probably won’t ever have the ability to shower him in luxury, but hopefully throughout everything I will have maintained my integrity.  This I can pass onto him; a gift far greater then cars, gold, or an Ivy League education.  I pray (to whoever will have me) that I lay the foundation for him to do something, anything to shake up the system.  Like the San Francisco writers of a generation past, I hope he makes the status quo stop and say “Whoa”…but I would never pressure him to do anything, to be something.  He only needs to be a man…a good man, a man with integrity and kindness in his heart for the world, and then I can rest…be able to close my eyes and drift away with the pictures, memories of our life together clutched in my hand, and his undying love beating through my heart…I love this baby to be called Jack, more than he will ever know.
