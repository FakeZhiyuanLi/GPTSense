      Fahrenheit 9/11 not realeased in australia yet. 3 weeks into realease and its still at number 4 in the US box office.  It wont be realeased in Australia til end of july.  I got to watch it from a screener...using bit torrent.  This is an important film. If it assists in changing the US prez. Then great because any country that has stood shoulder to shoulder with Bush has been given a shit sandwich.  I must say that although Michael Moore is excellent at presenting an alternative to the world media that it is still one mans voice. The world needs a diverse range of media easily available... I guess that is why blogs are taking off  Check Out Mikes Blog urlLink Here

      I find that the media/movies/tv shows have this stock version of the 60s that is trudged out. Hippies free love and a like.  avoiding the stereo type is hard, but taking another look at the music and art that exploded at the time....WOW!  Here is a link to  urlLink Yayoi Kusama   And her polka dot obsession. see how she progressed from 60s flower child to today!

         This would have to be one of my favorite movies at the moment.  I can watch it every now and again with out getting bored.  Its not the greatest movie nor the greatest story..but I must say it is still a favorite.
