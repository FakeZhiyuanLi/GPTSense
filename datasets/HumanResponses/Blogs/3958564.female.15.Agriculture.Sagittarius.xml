         I kinda liked this quote and it might be of some use to other people.       "PROMISE YOURSELF ...   to be so strong that nothing can disturb your peace of mind.  To talk health, happiness, and prosperity to every person you meet.  To make all your friends feel that there is something in them.  To look at the sunny side of everything and make your optimism come true.  To think only of the best, and to expect only the best.  To be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as your are about your own.  To forget the mistakes of the past and press on to greater achievements of the future.  To wear a cheerful countenance at all times and give every living creature you meet a smile.  To give so much time to the improvement of yourself that you have not time to criticize others.  To be too large for worry, too noble for anger, too strong for fear, and too happy for permit the presence of trouble."                                                        - Christian Larson     I know it sounds somewhat cheesy, but it does have some good points.  Hehe, in other words "Have a good day,"   ^_^   .

         Well, today, I managed to use the mousse my mother bought me, and to bring out my natural curls. People wanted to know if I had gotten a perm. I said "Heavens, no! These&nbsp;are my natural curls!" In not so many words. They said that it was cute though. We weren't late today, but just on time. We even managed to acquire a cushioned pew. I was very pleased. When we got home, I finally remembered to email my Easter talk to Sister Pheysey. She's been begging me for months. I really am not sure of why my talk impressed so many people so much. They're still complimenting me about it. Oh well, Mine is not to wonder why, mine is but to do and die. After a few events that I admit I may have overreacted in, I am now forced to think of and participate in an activity with  urlLink  Almond  . I think I may be able to avoid it, but if not, oh well, it can't be too bad. I practiced for nearly an hour. A lot of it was improv, but hey. There are some times when you CAN serve two masters. My mother and myself. Well, in the background, I can hear my mother hinting about how much she dislikes my situation, and how she wishes I was like any other child.  urlLink  *sigh*   Life is just a package stuffed with foam peanuts. You have to sift through the annoying to find the enjoyable, and sometimes you just have to make do with the bubblewrap at the bottom. I read some from Fellowship of the Ring. I wish I could read faster. I really need to buckle down and just read the thing. Oh, I got emails today. Yesterday I just decided to tell    urlLink   Van Tan      the truth that I don't like him, and never have, but that I really don't want to lose such a good friend. He wrote back saying that he actually hadn't been avoiding me, just that he'd been busy. I just decided to believe him. He also assured me that we were still friends, which made me glad.     Anyway, 2 of the other emails were from    urlLink   The Radish     , telling me about his&nbsp;family reunion&nbsp;in CA, as well as congratulating me about telling Van Tan the truth. The last email was from  urlLink  The Watermelon  ; it was&nbsp;about my confession as well. She also wanted to know exactly what the truth was. I told her that the truth was that I never liked him, and that I'm a dork. Well, that pretty much covers my day.

       Happy Pioneer Day! Today is Saturday, July 24, 2004! Anyway, I'm so bored, I just got through saving 170+ pictures, just to find out that at least 1/2 of them were the same pictures!! I'm never going to do a montage for Girl's Camp ever again. What a waste of my precious time when I could be lazying around doing nothing whatsoever! I'm waiting for 4:00 to come around so that we can start our Ward Pioneer Fun day. Whatever that is. Ergh. So what's new in the life of YOU?! Yes you! that's who I'm talkin about!!! I feel so selfish using this. Quick, someone else post...........................NOW!

       Hiya! I think that it'd be safe now to try to decide what kind of stuff we'll talk about, and exactly what we'll be doin.&nbsp;Should we decide just how many people contributing to the posts we'll allow? Because anyone,&nbsp;whether they're a team member or not, can comment to the posts, but I think it might be a good idea to limit the # of people able to post. Just a vague limit though, not like "only 15" or something. Also, I've noticed that no one has posted as of yet, only commented. So, if this is a matter of not knowing how, or something, I can answer most questions you have, and those can either be written to me, or put here as a comment, or whatever you wanna do. Also, the subjects of discussion...we need to decide whether we'll just be talking about our days, or if we'll have open discussion about current events, opinions on music, movies, whatever. I think it'd also be fun, later on, to have like an election thing to decide who should be "president" or something, so we can have some organization...blah blah blah. Anywho...yeah. Comment, please :D

       Nice quotes you guys...... I thought I'd throw in some I've come across:  "I think there's a difference between appearance and image. An image is not how you look. It's what you do. It's what you portray. Your personality, the example you set, and that's huge for me."  "The greatest glory never comes from falling, but from rising each time you fall."    "It's important that I make a difference in some way. It's not necessarily how I make a difference, but I want to make sure that I do."   "...as long as you're living right, then you don't have  to worry about what people see."  "Half my butt is mac & cheese and the other half is Krispy Kreme..."  Hehehehehehe, I bet you'll NEVER guess who said all that.....

         Haha, just kidding. Anyway, I just thought I'd check in, and tell ya'all...something. I was just reading, and I came across a couple quotes that I liked. So, I thought I'd follow Sir Radish's grand example, and post them. Well, here they are:           I would rather be in company with a dead man than an absent one. For, if the dead man gives me no pleasure, at least he shows me no contempt, whereas the absent man, silently indeed, but very plainly, tell me that he does not think me worth his attention.   - Lord Chesterfield           We should ever conduct ourselves towards our enemy as if he were one day to be our friend.                                                                                                           -John Henry   Newman            Help thy brother's boat across, and lo! Thine own boat has reached the shore.   -Hindu Proverb            I have no right, by anything I do or say, to demean a human being in his own eyes. What matters is not hwat I think of him, it is what he thinks of himself. To undermine a man's self esteem is a sin.   -Antoine de Saint-Exupery            A ship in the harbor is safe, but that's not what ships were built for.   -John A. Shield            If you chase two rabbits, both will escape.   -Unknown            I know no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by a conscious endeavor.   -Henry David Thoreau            Come, my friends, 'Tis not too late to seek a newer world.   -Alfred Lord Tennyson           Well, I hope I didn't bore you too much. Remember, it was your choice, not mine to read them, if you did lol. Well, cya'all later!

          Today has been a pretty good day so far. I went to Marching Band, and even though the rest of the band was having troubles, I think I did a fair job of trying my hardest. During the middle,  urlLink  Onion   and I were getting pretty hot. So, during a break, we ran in the sprinklers. We then noticed that the whole band was staring at us in wonder, amazement, and shock. We just laughed. The rest of the time, the wet shirt felt really good. The  urlLink  Green Bean   and  urlLink  The Radish   thought we were pretty insane, though. It was funny. We got out of MB early, and so I got a ride with the Onion to Summer Seminary. That was really good. We listened to the funeral of Elder Neil A. Maxwell. I cried through about the last half. Not out of sadness, but from the spirit, and just thinking about things. Like the card. Last night, I re-read the card that Sister Dastrup gave me after the talk I gave in Sacrament Meeting. She first thanks me for the best sacrament meeting talk she ever remembers hearing, but then she goes on to say that she's grateful that I live a life that qualifies me to share the spirit so powerfully. I thought "What HAVE I done to qualify me to have any of the things I have?" So, after incredulously searching my memory, trying to think of something I might have done to deserve all this, I decided to "qualify" myself. Well, today I had an hour long trumpet lesson. It was good. My teacher is moving to Idaho, so that was my last lesson with him. It was kinda sad. He gave me lots of stuff to work on, since I'm taking a break from lessons until January. I think that will be best. First of all, I do not want to switch to the one I have to switch to, and also I&nbsp;need some extra time during the first half of the school year for MB. I just watched "Extreme Home Makeover" I like that show. It's pretty cool. Well, I think that's about it for today. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got some of my associates waiting on line 2.

          Today was great. I went to marching band, and preformed fairly well. We did mini-shows,&nbsp; which are always fun. Our group messed up, but we still did a pretty good job, and we probably would have gotten 2nd or 3rd place. I brought my       urlLink   pineapple waterbottle      , my prized possession. Everyone liked it, and&nbsp;now I'm going to bring it filled with pineapple juice hehe. My encouter with the     urlLink   Green Bean       turned out better than I had expected. He acted normal, and I was able to get through it acting mostly normal. I did kinda hesitate talking to him, and got as few pictures of him as possible, but overall, I don't think he noticed. I got lots of pictures, and when I got home, I downloaded them, edited them, and put them into my video. I worked on my movie quite a bit. If I may say so, I think it's hilarious, but maybe that's because I'm involved with so many inside jokes; and others wouldn't understand it quite as well. I made many more pictures, which I will eventually load onto this site. Later, I talked to a bunch of my friends, including the cocoa bean for the first time. I also talked to     urlLink   The Watermelon     , and  urlLink  Clayzy Rachy  , and    urlLink   The Radish     .  Apparently, The Radish shares my love for editing photos of produce. He's pretty good at it, and some of his are really funny. Perhaps, soon, with his permission, I'll put those here too. I think that today was a turning point in my life, one for the better. I got a phone call from  urlLink  The Strawberry  , and guess where whe was! CANADIA!! One of my favorite countries in the world. I could hear that it was windy up there, and it even sounded cold. Oh, how I envied her. It was very exciting to hear from her. It's been so long. She bought me something in Hershey PA; I told her whe shouldn't have, but what's done is done, right? She'll be home tomorrow; I'm excited. We had Family Home Evening, and to my fortune, Boon wanted to make the cookies. And, because dessert was my only responsibility, I didn't have to prepare at all. Dad had the lesson, and it was pretty good; it was about preparing for our missions. It did take quite&nbsp;a bit of time, though. Dinner was really late. We were all starved when the tamales finally arrived, from Boon's friend's mom. We all kinda dug in, especially     urlLink   Cashew     .  I think he slowed down a bit when Mom made him eat broccoli, though lol. Well, I have a bit of classic literature to finish up, so I will now conclude this message.

My mother and myself. Well, in the background, I can hear my mother hinting about how much she dislikes my situation, and how she wishes I was like any other child.  urlLink  *sigh*   Life is just a package stuffed with foam peanuts. You have to sift through the annoying to find the enjoyable, and sometimes you just have to make do with the bubblewrap at the bottom. I read some from Fellowship of the Ring. I wish I could read faster. I really need to buckle down and just read the thing. Oh, I got emails today. Yesterday I just decided to tell  urlLink  Van Tan   the truth that I don't like him, and never have, but that I really don't want to lose such a good friend. He wrote back saying that he actually hadn't been avoiding me, just that he'd been busy. I just decided to believe him. He also assured me that we were still friends, which made me glad. Because now, both  urlLink  Clayzy Rachy   and  urlLink  The Watermelon   have stopped liking him. Which turns all my sacrifice into a bunch of smoke and waterdroplets. But it's all good, it's always good to get practice in manipulating people...Anyway, 2 of the other emails were from  urlLink  The Radish  , telling me about his&nbsp;family reunion&nbsp;in CA, as well as congratulating me about telling Vat Tan the truth. The last email was from The Watermelon; it was&nbsp;about my confession as well. She also wanted to know exactly what the truth was. I told her that the truth was that I never liked him, and that I'm a dork. Well, that pretty much covers my day. Now, I have the obligation to straighten out my client in one of the areas of his naivity.

          This is going to be a good day. I'm not quite sure why, but I have a feeling that things are just going to work out today. I managed to finish all my jobs (which consist of cleaning my room, taking out the trash from the millions of little trash cans all around the house ((do people really need a trash can in every single room?)) and then vacuuming the stairs going up, and vacuuming the second floor, washing the downstairs bathroom mirror, sink, and counter, and floor.) before the 2 o' clock deadline (if we don't finish our jobs before 2, then we don't get paid, but we still have to do them. We only get paid $3 a week). I got to sleep for as long as I wanted, and then took my time doing my jobs, but somehow, I finished at 1:59. I was very happy. Now, I'm doing exactly what I want to do. I'm writing in my blog, and chatting to my friends. In a little while, I'm going to begin on the labors I enjoy, such as documenting the summer through music, film, and still shots. Also included in these pleasant labors, is taking pictures of fruits and making them more interesting. So, with my hands smooth from soap and window washer, I now have to take my leave in order to complete this final report to my supervisor.

         Well, these last few days have pretty much blurred together. My complete boredom and lack of interaction with other vegetables and fruits has forced me to resort to Playstation 2 for pleasure. I have had some opportunity to have fun, though, and that has kept me alive. I finally got to see "O Brother Where Art Thou" at  urlLink  The Watermelon's   and  urlLink  Clairissa's   house.  urlLink  Teddyboy   watched it for a little while too. It was funny. Now I can know what they're talking about when they quote it, as they do so often. I also went with them to Scera park. That day I had forgotten that I had to go to trumpet lessons, so I had to leave really early, which bummed me out. So, as the days go by, I start moving slower and slower, and it gets hard to try to keep speed up to normal. However, I have a feeling that in a couple days, I will be moving as fast or faster than normal. Monday, we go back to Marching Band! So many of my favorite fruits and veggies are there. I wish I could sleep, and have Monday just be there. But, alas,&nbsp; I still have 2 1/2 days left to wait. Anywho, I've got to finalize a deal with my colleague, so I'll cya'all later.

          I am now beginning another week in my life as  urlLink  the Orange  . Sometimes I wonder why I signed up for this one, when I could've been in Canada, or New Zealand, or something exotic like New Hampshire. Oh well, there's no turning back, and here I am, so let everyone else just deal with it! hehe Well,  urlLink  the Radish   contacted me the day he got back. So, I didn't have to get mad at him afterall. Aren't I happy? lol We had a long talk on MSN about Japan, Pride and Prejudice, morphing people, and finally prayer and the spirit. He really wants to know whether or not he should get his patriarchal blessing. I told him to pray about it, and he said he had already. I told him to keep trying, and that maybe he just wasn't ready for an answer yet. I gave him advice on how to more clearly feel the spirit. Then, on Sunday, I prayed and fasted that he might be able to feel the same burning in his bosom that I feel so often. It was strange, because it seemed that everyone was trying to give me food. I got 3 Rice Krispee Treats, a 100 Grande, and a warm, gooey, delicious chocolate chip cookie. I kept to my fast, though. But I read some scriptures last night that kind of hinted to me that he wasn't going to feel it that night, or maybe not for a while. They talked about the Lord doing things his own way. And also about how if good things happen, it's because of God's mercy, and not because of those that labor, (or fast). So, I'm thinking that whenever he's meant to feel it, it's not now, and that time will be best. Anyway, I've g2g respond to the messages of my correspondants.

          Well, I guess I'm starting over, then. I've fogotten my old username, and therefore cannot log in. Oh well, I'm bored enough to want to start over. Today was pretty normal.&nbsp; urlLink  The Radish  &nbsp;finally came home from the big CA, but it makes me a little angry that he has made no effort whatsoever to contact me so far. If no effort has been made by Wednesday night, I'm going to have to take disciplinary actions lol. My mom's been especially demanding with my trumpet practicing. I practiced twice today, but she still says they weren't long enough. I told her again and again that I couldn't play any more because my lips hurt so bad, but she, nor my father, would listen. I've been extremely bored. Fortunately, I haven't recieved a new email from the  urlLink  Green Bean  , and I haven't had to deal with the sight/sound/sign of  urlLink  Van Tan  , but still. A little excitement would be nice. Absolutely nothing happened today. Well, unless you count our purchase of a bunch of Karaoke CD's, and that we FINALLY own the Lord of the Rings Trilogy Soundtrack. Then, we used said Karaoke CD's. So, all day, I've just been sitting here, waiting for some new sign that the Radish lives. Anywho, g2g finish some unfinished business. Cya.

         Well, this has been interesting. I had 2, count them, 2 BCRs. One of them ended early, however, because he found out I was a sophomore. He's a junior. Then, the other one was more fun, because it was this 8th grader. he's young, but he is SO funny. If circumstances had been really different, (me being younger, and not already taken) I think I'd have a big crush on that kid. But for that week it was just pretend. I also had a wee bit of a fight with Radish. But fortunately it was over really fast, and things are ok now. Pickle is being really insistant on things that I'm not sure I want. But...maybe I do want them. ANYWAY, I went to night games at violin's house. That was fun. But I biffed it and got really beat up. Well, I don't feel like writing much more. So, I'm going to instead catch up on ancient British literature, and the secrets of vanished civilizations.

        urlLink  AAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!   Everything: stupid. Everyone: curse them. Everyday: full of misery. Ms. Bingley thinks I'm her friend, muahahaha. Keep your friends close, keep your enemies closer. I think I've done that. Now, I just need to keep an eye out. But I think that for the next week, I'm going to just lay down, and give myself up to sorrow. I've been fighting it so long, it'll be nice to have a week when I can let it take over. I'll take up the fight again when I get back from yellowstone. Maybe that isn't such a good idea, but I'm not sure I'd be able to hold up much longer anyway. I'm running out of ammunition very quickly, and the fort has taken such a beating. There are enemy troops surrounding, and I'm afraid the only thing to do would be to retreat for a ways until I can find a place where I'll have the advantage. I hope I'll be able to find that place soon. Anger is once again consuming me...I can feel the happy, nice, cheerful, optimistic me that everyone sees slipping away. Now, the depressed me, and the hateful, angry me are fighting for my emotions, for the face, for the actions. I don't know whether to scream and hit things, or to go to my room and cry. I think I'll go to the night games at violin's house tomorrow. One last time to be with everyone. One last time to see just how good my life was, and just how rotten it's going to be. I think the hateful me is winning. The only words my fingers seem to want to write, are words like "HATE HATE HATE" and "KILL" and "DIE" If Radish doesn't fulfill his promise tonight, I'm going to be extremely angry, because if he's not there anymore when I really need him, where am I supposed to turn? Tomorrow will be full of tears, and sorrowful goodbyes, and wishing, and remembering, and other things like that. I'm reminded of the song "In Dreams" from Lord of the Rings. The words go like this: "When the cold of winter comes, starless night will cover day. In the vailing of the sun, we will walk in bitter rain. But in dreams, I can hear your name. And in dreams, we will meet again." Because the cold of winter is here. And I'm afraid we'll only meet again in my dreams. Because I dream every single solitary night about my friends. I miss them even in my dreams. But I guess it's all over, and I'll just have to keep dreaming if I want to see them again before I die. I want to scream so badly! And yet, I'm on the edge of running down to my room and crying all night. ALL NIGHT. There is little to live for. My love life's a mess, my friends...gone. My family, getting to like me less and less. Marching band, matters little. I just want to know what exactly I want, and how to get it. Because if I knew that, life would be so much easier. I would be so much happier. I don't feel like doing links. I'm just going to stop now. Bye.

         Well, tonight is nothing but waiting. I'm waiting for tomorrow to come so that I can be duly depressed and horribly sad. I'm waiting for my family to finally go postal on me, and murder me in my bed. I'm waiting for  urlLink  Radish   to get on Hello, even though I've told the kid to get on everyday this week. I know he's busy, but this is rediculous. On the note of the radish, he got  urlLink  braces   today. He's excited, but I can't see why. As I predicted, he can't play high notes. It's going to take a really long time for me to get used to them being on. But it might take even longer seeing as I won't see him as much ever again. Well, life goes on, and whether it goes up or down we cannot say, but we can tell that our feet are still moving, and the view is different wherever we go. Profound, huh? haha just kidding, I don't think I've said anything profound in my life. I just know I'm going to cry tomorrow. Tomorrow marks the end of everything I gained, everything I  loved , cherished, and worked so hard to keep going.  urlLink  Onion   says she'll take me to my first day of high school. That sounds like fun. I'm just seriously hoping that things go better than I expect. Radish had better hang out with me sometimes, and  urlLink  soccerball   and  urlLink  violin   had better not give me that "I don't know you, you're insane" look that they have given me in the past, and I had better see  urlLink  Watermelon  ,  urlLink  Clarissa  ,  urlLink  Alissa  ,  urlLink  Cocoa Bean  , and all those guys a whole lot. Because I am feeling so horrible right now. It's like I'm expecting a nuclear bomb to hit...and I guess I am; except that the bomb's going to hit my social life, my emotions, self esteem, and confidence. I guess the only thing left to do is to beg for mercy, to hope with every particle of my being, and pray for a good tomorrow. Well, now I've gotta do some more waiting, and some more crying, right after I complete the shaving down of my agenda.

         The title is just a quote from me padre. He was commenting about the thoughts in my head after I saw the Village. I really liked it, no matter what all the critics, and some weird people say. It may not have been a thriller, or a typical horror movie, but it was good. It had a good amount of scary, and had an unexpected ending. Or, maybe it was just unexpected because I was very tired. But, I think I mostly liked it because of the romance in the middle. That's probably the biggest factor of every movie. It's gotta have the intrigue. That part was great. Yup, you guessed it...I'm obsessed. Anyway...marching band is fun. We're in the middle of band camp right now. It's getting a little stressful, because everyone is getting really tired, and really wired, and wound tight. So, there's a lot of stuff going on that's kinda  urlLink  frustrating  . I'm really not wanting Friday to come. Because that will be like the last day of summer. Next week, my family and I are going to Yellowstone. Then, school starts. And at school, I won't see  urlLink  Alissa  ,  urlLink  Clarissa  , The  urlLink  Watermelon  , or  urlLink  Cocoa Bean   at all. It's going to be a huge whole. Sure, I'll have great friends, but it's just going to have this void where they all used to be. I'm going to miss The Watermelon's flirting, and having someone else to be obsessed with boys with, and to do crazy things with. And then I'm going to miss Clarissa for the kind of rare, but absolutely hilarious things she says, and also how she was always so shocked at the things watermelon and I did, and how she kept us in line most of the time. And then Alissa's quietness during class, but then super hyperness when we're having fun. Cocoa Bean isn't in our grade anyway, but I'll still miss our little punchy things. It's just going to be  urlLink  me  ,  urlLink  soccerball  , and  urlLink  violin  . I've gotten really close to  urlLink  Radish   and  urlLink  Green Bean   in marching band, but when school starts, green bean will go to the other school. And I'm going to miss Radish really bad, even though he'll be at the same school. He's got his own friends, and I'm positive he's going to want to hang out with them so much more than he'd want to hang out with us. I think I've cried for hours every single night this week about the change that's coming. I even snuck away for a little bit during marching band, and just broke down and cried. I'm just not sure where I'm going to  urlLink  fit in  . I mean, soccerball and violin are awesome, and I love hanging out with them, but they just might be a little smart for me, or at least it seems that way. In the past, it hasn't seemed like they've appreciated the weird things I say...it just doesn't seem like I fit quite right with them. I love those guys, and I wouldn't trade them for anyone. I just keep thinking about how they just won't be the same. I mean, they don't have  urlLink  matching rackets  , they would never  urlLink  drink mustard   with me, they aren't the flirting variety of people, they don't draw pictures of silly things, they wouldn't let me go to sleep on their backs, they don't see the world in the hilarious light that I do. It's just like that song..."life was changed, disassembled, rearragned." I don't know how I'm going to survive. It's so hard to be myself without an audience that appreciates me. I'm just not used to it.     Well, I guess I'll just go...I don't even feel like forcing my opinion on that coworker anymore. Oh well. bye.

         I think that the last few days of little or no sleep have finally caught up with me. I'm finding it hard to function. But, I just can't ge to sleep, nor do I really have the desire to. But that doesn't mean I can just mope around the house, I still have work to do. I just barely put my appetizers in the oven for YW. I hope they turn out ok. I had a lot of SNAFUs while trying to make them. Probably because I left them to the last day. First, half of one of the onions I was going to use went rotten. So, I had to use a white onion, and a red onion. Then, I accidentally messed up some measurements, but fortunately that was cleared up easily. I substituted sugar for honey, so that I would like it a little better. But I'm still worried. Well, only time will tell. If they turn out bad, I'll just say it's gourmet French, and then everyone will know why it tastes so weird...lol Anywho, we signed up for the Las Vegas rooms today.  urlLink  Allissa  ,  urlLink  Cocoa Bean  , and Allissa's sister invited me to share a room with them. It's going to be great fun! Then, I signed up to bus with  urlLink  The Radish  ,  urlLink  The Green Bean  ,  urlLink  The Onion  , SS, and a few others. It's gonna be AWESOME!! I'm so excited I can't even express myself. Yesterday, it was pretty funny. We decided who  urlLink  The Watermelon   was going to like next by writing down names and then picking one out of a mug. I won't disclose who it was that we chose, but I enjoyed the ridiculousness of the whole thing. Well, I've got a multistake dance this Saturday, and I am so darn excited that I could just burst. I also have about the same level of excitement for Band Camp next week. 9 hours a day with so many of my favorite fruits and vegetables! Just thinking about it makes me all tingly inside hehe. Oh, I took this quiz on  urlLink Tickle.com , it was called  urlLink  "What kind of flirt are you?"   My results said that I was a  urlLink  "Smooth Flirt"  . It was hilarious. It said a bunch of stuff about how people can't resist me, and that I have all the right moves. I laughed forever. I do flirt a lot, I think, but...oh well, whatever. My dad comes home tonight! I can finally burn the DVD I made!  urlLink  Halelujah!   It's even got bonus features! I think I said that already, but I just like it. I amaze myself...jk. Well, I've got some urgent transactions I need to make final.

         I just realized recently that I have no pressing problems at all! I feel so happy with myself. Everything that seemed so big and evil, and depressing, now all seem far away, or else I have solved them already. Life is just good. Good, and good.  urlLink  I love it!   I finished my DVD, and now I just have to wait for Dad to come home so that I can finish burning the movie onto the DVD. I'm so excited, it even has bonus features. I've gotten my schedule. It seems just right. Not too hard, not too easy. I am a little sad, though, because I probably won't have many classes with my friends. Oh well, there's always lunch and after school, right? Well, hopefully it'll all turn out ok. I just can' express the ease and the relaxation that I'm feeling right now. I feel like the world is mine. I wonder if most people feel like this most of the time, or if it's an abnormal kind of thing. Well, at any rate, it's abnormal for me! And I just can't get over how good it feels. Well, today was a good day. I went to marching band. We set more of the drill. I love doing the show. It's so much better than parade marching, and also it reminds me of Las Vegas. I think that having a BTR would be fun. It would be just a joke, and I could laugh and make jokes about it. I'm considering possible candidates. I think that probably SS or  urlLink  The Radish   would be good. But then again, there are a lot of other choices. Seeing as everyone says I'm their favorite hehe. Plus, I'm getting an awful lot of attention from SS. Today someone said that he only giggles when he's around me. I thought it was funny, but I also respect her oppinion. But either way, maybe it's a bad idea. Then again...          I've gotta go remedy some miscalculations in the beta version formula. Bye
