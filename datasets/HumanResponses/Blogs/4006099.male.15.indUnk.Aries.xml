        I just completed ENC1101 (English Comp. I) at BCC a couple of weeks ago. It was meant to teach form and style in writing and was a prerequisit to English Comp. II, which was writing on literature. In the class, I wrote about seven papers, which I am going to post now. Some really corny, lame, boring, or just plain old bad, so don't think that I think that these are breath-taking masterpieces; I think quite the opposite. I just think you might be interested in reading some of the things I've written outside of this blog (as if...). So here goes. The assignment for this paper was a 700 word essay, titled "If You Knew Me." Everything in this isn't true, so don't make any hasty generalizations about me as a person. I must say that the part about the work is about 80% true. I'd much rather laze about and play video games than go out and mow the lawn, but hey- the assignment didn't include being truthful.      IF YOU KNEW ME      If you knew me, you would know I am a person with an extremely broad range of interests. For an evening out, I enjoy a football game with screaming fans, or a formal, finely attired, Bach concert. On carefree Saturdays, I’m torn between a good day of yard work and long hours of playing my favorite video games. If you asked me if I was in the mood for an entertaining comedy or a tear-jerking drama, I’d reply with a quick, "Whatever you say." If you knew me, you wouldn’t even bother to ask, and if you did, you wouldn’t get much of an answer.    My recreational schedule is filled with a colorful variety of activities. I never have trouble keeping myself occupied because there’s always something I can not only do, but take pleasure in as well. A great number of my pastimes are games, played outside and inside. Some of the outdoor sports I partake in are football, basketball, kickball, and swimming. But when there’s no one to compete with, I like nothing more than to sit and waste time on my Play Station 2. Despite my love for these games, I spend many hours engaging in (and gleaning much delight from) the direct antithesis of games: work.      Working, with or without an income, is another thing in which I take great interest. To me there is nothing that brings greater satisfaction than seeing a spotless room, which had previously been considered a pigsty. When I’m studying, and my mind just isn’t in the work, I’ll take   five to ten minutes to clean my room. This new, orderly environment often helps me to organize my thoughts and be more productive.      To me, the choicest kind of work is lawn maintenance. One of my favorite sights is a yard with clean-cut grass, freshly-pruned plants, and trimmed hedges. It’s especially pleasurable when it’s my own handiwork. Viewing the fruit of my labor is almost more satisfying than the labor itself. I find that work is the most rewarding thing one can do. It’s the thought of the reward, whether it’s money or the satisfaction of a job well done, drives me to enjoy it so much.      When not playing or working I prefer to relax and throw on a good movie. Non-fictions such as Braveheart and A Beautiful mind (and historical fictions, like Gladiator and Saving Private Ryan) are my favorites. I regard these so highly because they are not out of the range of believability; they actually have, or could have happened. Me, being a history enthusiast, appreciate that kind of thing. There are some major exceptions to this, such as The Lord of the Rings and The Matrix trilogies; films with such intricate plots and excellent battle scenes simply couldn’t be excluded from my list.       The kind of movies I detest are those cliché action films that have become so popular today. Two examples are Triple X and The Fast and the Furious. They usually have weak, if not stupid, story lines, and are good for nothing but far-fetched explosions and ridiculous car chases. Another genre of movies I enjoy is comedy. British and American comedy from the nineteen-thirties to the present day have all earned my liking; from the Marx Brothers to Monty Python to Shrek or Pirates of the Caribbean. If it's amusing, witty, and for the most part, clean, it's my kind of humor.      Another field in which my attractions are especially vast is music. Rock-and-roll, classical, and soundtracks are my three favorite styles of music. This, I think, is my most unusual variety of interests. Classical, while formal and sophisticated, is a far cry from the loud party style of rock'n'roll. Yet they are two of my favorite classes of music. I also have an appetite for soundtrack music. Being made for movies, it often has an immense sense of drama about it. Also, the music stimulates pleasant memories about a movie I have seen.    As you can see, my interests are not only many, but diverse. Games and work; football and video games; drama and humor; classical and rock. They're all so different, but they all fit into one simple category: what know about me, now that you know me.   Pretty corny.   Not one of the best, but okay.

      Uh........I don't know where to start.  I'm not even in school right now and I find that I don't have the time (or self-motiviation) to make frequent entries.  This'll probably just get worse when I start back at BCC; but then again, it may not.  Regardless, I've got a lot to talk about.  On Saturday, Zack had his first football game, which was against Davie.  We showed up at the park a bit before 10:30, right around when it was getting hot.  Because I coach, I had to stand out in the middle of the field rather than under the tent.  The game started about 12:20 and we just mowed 'em down.  It's was poetry really.  Final score: 36-6.  Afterward, we stayed for David's game.  They won 12-0.   We left thereafter, about 3:45.  That was more than 5 hours out in the sun, and whoo boy, I was roasted.  It's Tuesday night and I'm still hurtin.  At 5:30 we went to David Beisner's farewell party, but it wasn't really farewell for us; we saw him again on Sunday and then again on Monday.  He actually left today and he won't be back until Christmas. :(  But I'll be alright.  Don't worry bout me.   I've really been enjoying music lately......like more than usual.  I'm listening to a LOT of music and I'm prolonging piano practice time to an hour or more.  I'm really enjoying it.  I don't know why...I just am.  funny.....  The olympics are also going on right now.  It's awesome, but they haven't started track and field yet.  Swimming and gymnastics is cool though.  Some of these swimming events are really exciting, and what these gymnists do is just amazing.  I'm looking forward to the next couple of weeks.  Pastor Fisher's leaving for Pakistan tomorrow and he'll be gone for 2.5 weeks.  I already miss him.  Hopefully Pastor Diekema will be filling his shows.  That would be something.  Actually, that's all I've got for now.  Lord willing I'll have more time and enthusiasm for writing tomorrow, or the next day, or the next day.  Word...

       W'sup, ya'll? My name is Anthony Nicholas DiPrima, and this is my blog. I'm 15 years old, and the oldest of six children. I live in South Florida with my family, and live a happy-go-lucky life.  I don't exactly know what the point to keeping this blog is, but let me try and define my it anyway. I don't want to be too serious, like constantly talking about theology and philosophy. I also don't want it to foolish and giddy. I don't want it to be a record of my daily life, and I don't want it to be a record of my thoughts on certain issues. I don't just want it to be for your (the reader's) entertainment, and I don't want it to be just for my personal enjoyment. I just want it to fall somewhere in the middle of all that.  So I guess my purpose for keeping this blog is:  to give my thoughts on events that happen in my daily life and the people I encounter therein.  to give you a bit of insight on what goes on inside my head, and to allow myself to get my thoughts down on paper.  to be funny and entertaining some of the time and to be soberminded the rest of the time.  Oh, and I'm not a very good speller and my english is............a little stinky, so bear with me.  Thank you for reading this far. I hope you (and I) enjoy the material posted on this blog.
