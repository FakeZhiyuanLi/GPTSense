       I am starting this journal to document my Peace Corps process. I am not scheduled to depart for my service in Central Asia until January (hopefully) - March (hope not) so some might think I'm jumping the gun a bit here. But the&nbsp;PC journals and blogs I have found over the past few weeks have been my biggest source of insight and information. So I'm hoping this can grow to be an information source to others out there going through the LONG PC Process.&nbsp; I also want to establish something for my family and friends to use to see how the journey is going (when I am finally in my country of service).&nbsp;     &nbsp;  With all of that said - I will leave you with the latest word. Last week my recruiter nominated me to the NGO development program in Central Asia leaving some time during winter 2005. My recruiter called me at work with this info (bad idea) I was SO excited all day I could barely focus. All I wanted to do was look up info on all of the possible countries of service! But, unfortunately it was a busy day at RAND and I couldn't get to any of that. After hours of internet searches I found how interesting each country is - and would honestly be happy with any of them. Although, I do have this gut feeling that it will be Uzbekistan????Hmmm...let you know if I'm right on that one :)&nbsp; The downside of Central Asia - WINTER :( This Florida girl has no tolerance for the cold - so I'm just trying not to focus on that. My mom has already called dibs on buying me long johns for Christmas - silk ones at that - who knew silk could keep you warm? That's all for now...

       This has absolutely nothing to do with the Peace Corps - well maybe there could be an indirecet connection (but you'll have to watch the film to find out)??? Anyway, Matt and I just returned from the new film The Corporation - it was incredible. I feel that everyone&nbsp;would benefit from seeing this&nbsp;film - it&nbsp;surpasses party lines - it is a must see! I've included some info below - please take a look :)    &nbsp;  THE CORPORATION -- a film by Mark Achbar, Jennifer Abbott and Joel Bakan -- is coming to a theater near you. Visit   urlLink  http://www.TheCorporation.com/usa    for more details. Check out the trailer at   urlLink  http://www.thecorporation.com/trailer/   Winner of the AUDIENCE AWARD for DOCUMENTARY in WORLD CINEMA at the 2004 SUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL and numerous other awards including 7 audience choice awards. Based on the book: "The Corporation: The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power" by Joel Bakan. Available at   urlLink  http://gallery.bcentral.com/Gallery/ProductDetails.aspx?GID=5059307&amp;PID=3128968&page=1&amp;sortOrder=0    A darkly amusing account of the institution's evolution as a legal "person," THE CORPORATION is a powerful indictment of the roots of corporate power. So, what kind of person is it? The filmmakers conclude that a person whose prime directive is to produce ever-increasing profit for it's shareholders -- regardless of the cost to people or the planet -- fits the diagnostic criteria of a psychopath. Featuring interviews with CEO's and top-level executives from some of the worlds largest corporations and critical thinkers: Noam Chomsky, Peter Drucker, Milton Friedman, Naomi Klein, Vandana Shiva, Steve Wilson, Jane Akre and muckraking filmmaker Michael Moore.

       Today I found my Peace Corps&nbsp;medical kit waiting in my mailbox - one word - Overwhelming! To sum it all up&nbsp;I&nbsp;need&nbsp;be eavaluated by&nbsp;my general practitioner, a psychiatrist, a dentist, and a girl doctor - Phew! My goal is to try and get everything completed within the next two weeks. That's going to take some creative time management on my part - since I only have&nbsp;7 hours of sick leave left until next month! There is a yahoo message&nbsp;board for Peace Corps volunteers and a recurring theme among current recruits&nbsp;highlights the LONG wait to have your medical papers cleared - some have waited ~16 weeks! It's actually made me a little nervous&nbsp;because I've read several stories about people not having their medical clearance in time to depart on their initial date. I really don't want that to happen, ideally I would like to be out of here by January, so I will do all I can to make sure that happens :) It's funny - I never have any worries about my health - but now that it's&nbsp;a test and determining my future - I am pretty nervous. It feels&nbsp;like final exam week at college.    I'm still finding it pretty hard to focus on the things I need to focus on (i.e. work). I feel like I'm in the holding station - just waiting, excited and anxious - ready to embark upon this new path. At least I am recognizing this and TRYING to settle down - there are quite a few more months of waiting so I need to center myself again.     &nbsp;  Well - I think that's all for now :)

      It is officially out of my hands!! I sent my entire medical packet off to the Peace Corps Office of Medical Services this morning and it should be arriving there on Monday ( I splurged for the overnight delivery). I just feel so relieved that everything is done...but now the waiting begins. I have read soooo many stories about how long it can take to be medically cleared - so I am pretty prepared for the possibility of not hearing anything for another 2 months - although- I certainly hope that is not the case. Actually, knowing myself I can probably only hold out a month before I start calling and asking questions :) But, I promise right now that I will not call and harrass anyone before September 13th! So I guess that's about it for now - hope to have an update soon :)

       The last few weeks have been a whirlwind of medical appointments, cancellations, and other unforseen issues. I'll try to get you all up to speed...      The medical stuff really started out great - mainly due to the fact that I have a great dentist. He filled out my forms immediately - I sent them in - and in ONE day I had my Peace Corps dental clearance!! So I felt like I was really off to a good (and lucky start) - nothing could stop me....      But next came the bulk of the medical exams at the general practitioner. Really, the Dr. and her staff are very nice people BUT those nurses have no business to EVER touch a needle! They took lots of blood and really it wasn't too bad (no popped veins at that point) but then they forgot that they really needed more blood - after 2 nurses, 1 doctor, 5 holes in my arm, and one popped vein (all blue and nasty) later they finally got more blood. It was awful - I was even crying - no fun at all. Next came the waiting - and you know with all of the tests that were done I was actually pretty anxious hoping that nothing would be wrong. Luckily, I just picked my labwork reports yesterday and I am all healthy and ready to go. So only one more Dr. and I would be set...      This morning I was supposed to meet with Dr. "I forget what his name is" but he didn't show! How can a Dr. just not be there - seriously?? So I sat outside of his office for an hour and a half (I really didn't want to give up hope) but he never appeared. I called later to give him a piece of my mind but he left some lame message on his voicemail about how sick he is and all patients will have to call Friday to reschedule -Grrrrrr! Really, I feel bad that the man is sick - but get your receptionist in the office and have her call the patients so they don't waste their time! So, I am really hopeful that he can squeeze me in Friday or Monday - because I can't send any of my medical packet in until I get his evaluation. The (un)funny thing is that I really can't act annoyed or mad because he's doing my mental evaluation so I don't want him to write that I am an unforgiving, high-strung, mean girl - so I need to practice my "I don't hate you" smile for the next few days :) As a side note to this story - there was another man waiting for an appointment (he actually waited for 2 hours) and he told me his life story.  It was kind of interesting - I know a lot about him, his, wife, and his three children - but I was also shocked by how much he was telling me. I really don't like telling strangers about my entire life  - but he said I was a good listnener - better than the Dr. - and offered to pay me for listening (in jest of course - but he offered a few times :) And I  know it sounds funny, but I feel like I did kind of help him - I didn't give him any insightful advice or anything - but I just let him talk.  So I left feeling pretty annoyed by the stupid Dr. but I also felt good - when we parted ways (I can't believe we didn't exchange names) he told me how happy he was to have met me and he told me that that what I was doing with the Peace Corps was worth more than a thousand people's work at the Pentagon. Ok - I agree he may have been speaking in hyperbole - but it was a nice gesture. I hope he gets an appointment soon.
