						   I was writing a long post, when, without my consent, the window which contained erased the message! I was proud of what I wrote. I'm depressed, cuz although I can write the message again, I'm not going to be able to write the words I chose...

						   This post is to the people who visits this Blog for their first time. I'm refering, to Toni, Montse, Núria, who had been given this Blog's URL in todays' morning, to Cristina, who had been given it a few minutes ago, and to the next people who will come here. What I want to tell them is that I'm very grateful to you, because the best reward an author like me can get is knowing that the people enjoy your page or, at least, are interested in it. The support you, the visitors, have given to me is wonderful, and it's why now I'm going to speak to some people individually, if you don't mind (if you mind, please, leave me a comment, and after reading it, I'll act). Jordi, I'm very glad about knowing you. As you said sometimes, since I met you my life's changed. Thanks for all you have done for me (I can't write down all this stuff; it's too long...;)). Then, Alice, our relationship has started some days ago, but I'm sure I've found in you an excellent friend, and I hope you have found in me the same :). Now I have to talk to The Great Family. Yes, I'm talking about Toni, Marc, Montse, and Noelia, my second but not worse family. Thanks to let me saying "paranoietes". No, I don't stop girls, it's a catalan expression which refers to a kind of stupid comment. And, also, I've to write something about my musicmates. Well, I only can say that they have inspired me...lol. After having told all these paragraphs, I see you off. Than you again for all these reasons. Bye!

						   Today has been a very disastrous day: as I've written in the last post, yesterday I come back home at 4:15h, and I had eaten pizza; then, in the morning, I had something like a stomach-ache, but it was worse. Then, during the next 3 hours, this ache has been leaving me and coming back again, so I was worried about what was going to happen. Finally, after 4 hours, I've vomitted. Now, I'm much better, but I'm still with a discomfort in the stomach and in my head...

						   I've come back from the "Concerto Night" 25 minutes ago. The concerto started at 22h, and has gone very well! At least, our work has given us its fruits... After finishing it, the musicians have gone to a restaurant near the theatre, where I've eaten a 4 chesed pizza (yes, my favourite food!) and drunk "sangría", a drink made especially of wine, that has citrus fruits and some citrus fruits' juice. After the meal, we have been talking about everything: from discussing the recent films, to explaining sick sad jokes... it was like a madness; well, it WAS a madness, but we have spent a very comfortable hours with our friends. Now I'm very tired, and, maybe,m you'll ask yourself what am I doing here, writing, when I only want to sleep. The reason is that I have a daily appointment here, in this Blog, and that I'm not so tired that I can't walk, am I? ;-). However, now I'm going to sleep, one of my best interests (look at my complete profile, please; you are going to find there a lot of information), OK? Then, I stop. See you!

						   One month ago, before having this Blog, when I was in a hard life moment, I wrote the following sentence: "The tears are condensed feelings". In fact, this is the first reflection I've post, so thank you again for visiting my blog.

						   La única cosa que sé es saber que nada sé; y esto cabalmente me distingue de los demás filósofos, que creen saberlo todo.  The only thing I know is that I know that I don't know anything; and this is what distinguishes me from the rest of people, who believe that they know everything.

						   I've alredy done the violin class, and it has gone so well that I feel very pleased. It was a very difficult class, and I had to practise my violin a lot. I don't feel stressed at all! Life's beautiful!

						   I'm thinking about the violin class I've to go this evening. Only  thinking about it I feel nervous and stressed. I have practised the  violin, but the pieces I study aren't easy at all. Well, wish me luck...

						   Today, well, a few minutes ago, I've been talking to my best friend by chat, when, suddenly, his mood has changed, and he was not as friendly as before. I supose I've said something which has hurt him, but I insist that I never have wanted it. Then, I need to say: Perdóna, Jordi, pel que sigui que hagi dit (Forgive me, Jordi, for anything I've said).

						   I'm a violinist, and I'm in an orquestra, also. Tomorrow we do our concerto in a local theatre. Then, these last days, we've been practising a lot of hours, and if we don't play well the pieces tomorrow, I'll fell depressed. Although I'm enjoying my holidays, I'm always working, either with the homework or with the instruments, because I play the trombon and the electric guitar, too. It's why most of the times my behaviour is like a fan's one, going from one place to the other...
