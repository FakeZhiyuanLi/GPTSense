       THINGS YOU DON'T EXPECT TO HEAR AT BARNES AND NOBLE  Just when I thought interesting things weren't coming my way...I have a weekends worth of tomfoolery to talk about. I was in Barnes and Noble yesterday at about 2pm. I hadn't been there to just browse the books, DVDs, and CDs lately, so I thought a lazy Sunday afternoon would be good for that. I started in the back in the CDs and DVDs...and made my way forward...with my eventual goal being to end up at the magazine rack. As I was working through the History...Biography...and finally Sports sections, I saw two people, a man and a woman in their 20s, sitting on one of the benches near the window. Here is what he said:  (insert high pitched male voice here)  "I can't BELIEVE that this Barnes and Noble doesn't have a Gay and Lesbian Issues section... Every other Barnes and Noble I've been too has one! This has to be the most homophobic town in the world!"  Now...I wouldn't normally take any note of this, but given the recent increase in discussion of homosexuality in this city with the murder, it caught my attention.  Of course, I wanted to laugh out loud when I heard the comment about CoMo being a homophobic city... Columbia is about as open-minded of a town as you can get in Missouri.  You want to see homophobic...go to Slater...or maybe Kennett...  So that was the first laugh I got... The second laugh I got was when two seconds later...on the way to the magazine rack... I notice the Gay and Lesbian Issues section... Part of me wanted to tell our new Columbia-bashing friend that he could find what he was looking for a few feet away... but I just left him to discover that on his own... which he did a few seconds later...  He offered no apology to the city.    THINGS YOU DON'T EXPECT TO HEAR FROM A PRIEST  At the beginning of Mass this weekend...the priest at my church, which will remain nameless, said:  "Do we have any visitors with us?"  A couple answered yes...and he asked him where they were from.  "Berea, Kentucky" they said.  "Is that near the distillery?" the priest questions.  "Yes"  "Can I come visit? the priest asks "No...not you," he says, "the distillery"  A priest that knows how to hold his burbon... Now there is something I can get behind.     NOVEL IDEA OF THE WEEK  Big Red, as Bish calls her, was in town this weekend. Back briefly from her internship in St. Louis. She told me that she had just quit her summer job in St. Charles. Doing what you might ask? Selling beer at a movie theater.  What a great idea! Beer and Fahrenheit 9/11 (Well... I for one would have to be drunk to see that movie..)

       HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN  Ok...so I started out this blog experience all excitied about the prospects of keeping you and yours up to date on the very latest goings on in the world of Coz. That was last weekend...and Monday...when a lot was happening. Then I realized on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday of this week that not a whole lot was going in my life...so I had nothing to post. I really don't have anything all that exciting to post today either. This weekend has the makings of a really boring experience. With DC gone, Susan in town for Bish, and most of my work friends on a float trip (you may ask yourself why I didn't go...but then you'll remember that I'd come back burned to a crisp...I have nothing promising on this weekends scheduled. I hope some exciting oppertuinity presents itself.   OH NO...NOT THIS AGAIN  (please note the covertness of the following passage) I was reading some industry news today and found out that a company near my mom and dad has an opening in the kind of work I do. I hadn't thought about going anywhere else soon...but who knows. This brings up a whole lot of issues...many of which I'm sure you all are aware. Of course, I tried this before only to come stumbling back to the midwest.   I DID IT BECAUSE I COULD  On Tuesday evening, I ventured to Barnes and Noble after Press Club to purchase President Clinton's new book. I, of course, purchased the audiobook edition. I've taken a lot of flack for doing this from my conservative relatives and friends. But I'm a fan of history, and like the man's politcs or hate them...he's a part of history. But, when most people ask me why I would buy such a book, I say, much like Clinton, "I did it because I could."

       IT'S 5 O'CLOCK IN MID-AMERICA  This is an exciting day at work for me. After three years...two months...and five days, K-FRU's 5pm news hour is returning to the airwaves, and yours truly gets to anchor. For those of you that don't know, the "Hour of Power," as it was affectionately known, was the show I started board oping my junior year of college when I started here. It was one hell of a program, and I loved running it. All the day's news in one hour... no BS. I'm glad its back... It sort of gives me a chance to do my own show for once! Tune in if you can...over the air or online.    WHAT'S THE FREAKING DELAY?  So without going into too much detail, I'm waiting on a financial transaction to come through to help fund the deposit I just put down on the new place. It involved transferring some money in a savings account of sorts with one institution into my checking account. Having faith in technology, I requested it be directly deposited...Forgoing a written check. Now...I find out after bugging the place twice that the deposit was returned because my bank has some fancy instructions for such transfers. It's like playing Russian roulette...   YEAH...I'M GOING TO HAVE TO ASK YOU TO STOP BLOGGING AT WORK...YEAH...  It should be duly noted that this is my first blog post from work. Ahh yes...Productivity down the drain.   RODGER "THE DUDE" CLINTON  Anyone see the 60 Minutes interview with President Clinton last night? I'm not a political fan of the guy, but I enjoyed it very much. My two favorite quotes...  DR=Dan Rather BC=Bill Clinton  DR:Your father had a nickname... What was it? BC:Dude (see The Big Lebowski)  DR:What was your reasoning behind having the affair with Monica Lewinski? BC:I did it because I could.

       YEA...C'MON!   So DC is back in the world of the trucker lingo...at least for a while anyways as he makes his way east for a change of pace. I even got to see the rig myself as I took him and his cousin-in-law out to Midway to get underway. They are going to a job in Omaha and will be back to pick up his stuff in a day or so. Not sure if I'll get to see him then because of work schedules.  I hope very much that this move works out for him. It takes a lot of guts to pick up your life and move it halfway across the country. I've done that a couple of times...and under better circumstances.   Even though I never played Counterstrike or Warcraft (sorry I could just never get into it), we'll always have Madden football (and the snow in Arizona in the playoffs)...and of course we'll always have fern eating bushes....and we'll always have the Naboo Starfighter...and we'll always have the time in Memphis when I was asleep on the bed, and he threw a pillow at me, and I hit him and said, "You'd better watch it Derek!" (This to a guy who could break me in half any day of the week).  I'll miss him a lot, but he'll be back soon enough...and now I have an excuse to go to Norfolk.    LOVE IN AN ELEVATOR  Speaking of DC...we did give him a proper Columbia send-off at McNally's last night. He and Bish spent ten minutes loading 2 bucks worth of quarters into the jukebox... I sang a great rendition of Aerosmith's "Love in an Elevator" and Bish sang the Cars' "Just What I Needed." I don't know what DC sang...it was some heavy metal crap (just kidding). Saturdays are $2 Boulevard Unfiltered Wheat nights at Macs...so we were able to send him off in posh Missourah style.   I got to thinking that this was the first such grizzled going-away gathering at Macs. Most of the other ones that I've known of have been at the 'Berg... Ok...Evan's was at the 'Berg... but you all know what happened a few days after he left... The bar burned down.   INSIDE THE ACTORS' STUDIO  There has been an Inside the Actors' Studio marathon today on Bravo. I like the program most of the time...in particular when there is an interesting actor on. Today...I saw back to back episodes with the voices from the Simpsons....and Robin Williams. That was about the funniest two hours of television I've seen in some time.    IT SEEMS TO THIS REPOTER...  "It seems to this reporter" is one of my favorite Dan Rather sayings. That, and "Here is what we know... and here is what we don't know." What this reporter knows now is that he is going to watch Rather's interview with President Clinton. I'd buy "My Life," but I think I'll just wait until the library gets it (which will be ten years from now).

       YOU KNOW YOU SHOULDN'T BE A SPORTS ANCHOR IF...   As I have for many years, I enjoy watching KLIT News (read: KOMU News). I do this for two reasons.   A. I get a perverse pleasure out of yelling at the television when "8" (as it is affectionately known as in the 24 Hour -- but not in a row -- newsroom at K-FRU) decides to do a story about helping a turtle cross the road...or they call Darwin Hindman...Darwin HEND-men. B. Sometimes the chicks are hot (see e-van)  And while I've seen some things that would qualify as broadcasting "travesty of the game" before...Tonight takes the cake. The female sports anchor referred to a player who double-eagled on a hole in a local golf tournament as going to "negative four." This happened not once but twice. AND she said that, "The LSU is playing Miami" reference the college world series.   Plus...she needs to learn from e-van and myself about conversational delivery.   I'M A THIEF  DC says I stole his idea of creating a blog... I said, "Well, you stole it from Rob." He said something along the lines of, "Well, you stole my idea of stealing."   WHY I'M IN RADIO...  Uneducated people who don't know me will often ask me why I'm in radio and got a BJ (Hey...E-van...LP...and Jason got/are getting one too) in news editorial (read: newspaper journalism). I tell them that's because I didn't want to do TV...and MU didn't have any sort of radio program at the time (they still don't IMHO...but that's another story for another time).  Today I realized just exactly why I wouldn't be good on TV... After looking at my ugly mug during a replay of the Ray Beck Show (read: Ray Beck's pre-council press conference) on Ch 13...I was reminded of the fact that I would probably look like the most awkward person ever on TV (maybe it's the fact that I can't see anything past my nose).  Of course Dave from the Tribune and the 306 reporter from the Missourian more than make up for my visual incompetence.

       THE IMPETUS  Robert Crow has made many a great decision in his life... Including his decision not to kill Marcus when the Bishel opened Rob's car door into a moving mini-van at a Kansas City Royals game. But perhaps his greatest idea of late is the creation of his blog. Blog fever seems to have caught the Grizzled Veteran community... and it all started with our New Mexico correspondent... Big Bad Bob! Derek caught on next... and I, unlike most times in my life, have become a bandwagoner...and have decided to create my own blog for your enjoyment...and mine.  It seems to me that this is the perfect time for blog fever to catch on. With Derek's imminent departure from BoCoMo...the once dominant population of Grizzled Veterans in Central Missouri has dwindled.... And then there were three... One thing I've always hoped for us, as a collective group of friends, is that distance won't keep us from being men (and women) of grizzle for all time. It stands to reason that the internet and other technological advances will make this possible... Something that wouldn't have been as easy 20 years ago.   WHAT USED TO BE HERE  So when I first posted this morning, I had this long drawn out paragraph (very coz like) of philosophical crap about how I'm sad that there will only be three Grizzled Veterans left in Columbia after tomorrow... And then I got to reading some other people's blogs...and I realized that blogs are supposed to be funny, entertaining, full of whit...but not maudlin. So SHAZAM! It's gone...    LEARN HOW TO EAT YOUR DAMN CORN ON THE COB  Marcus, Jason, and I went with Derek to Chili's last night. Let me tell you... there is nothing better than Country Fried Steak at Chili's. You only pay $8 for the whole thing...and you always leave full. I never used to eat the corn on the cob that you get with that meal, but recent times have seen me go after it full bore. Although Jason and Derek claim that I don't know how to properly eat corn on the cob.    CITY CONFIDENTIAL - COLUMBIA, MO   I am firmly convinced that the current murder case that everyone (from police to media) has on their plates will be Columbia's ticket to the A&E series City Confidential. Only problem is that Paul Winfield, the narrator (and Captain Terrell of Star Trek 2 fame), died a couple of months ago. This case just gets more bizarre every day...  For those of you who don't know, it involves a 23 year old MU student from Kentucky... Jesse Valencia... His throat was slit two weeks ago and his body was left near his apartment on Wilson. He was gay... and at first speculation was that it was a hate crime. The police deny that. Turns out Jesse had a "personal relationship" (read: sexual relationship) with a Columbia Police Officer... Not some dope of a cop either... a guy who was one of the chief's chosen ones... a guy with administration written all of him... The Missourian got ahold of the cops name from "unnamed sources" and printed it. The cop subsequently tried to commit suicide... twice... once with a guy in Kansas City... and once by trying to jump off the 5th floor of the Maryland Avenue parking garage. The cop is "a person of interest." but the police say he isn't a suspect (They said at first that he was cleared of any wrongdoing). Many believe the cop did it because the student, Jesse, was going to tell Chief Boehm that he was sleeping with the cop. We'll have to see how it all plays out.   DOES ANYONE FIND IT FUNNY?   I had completed this post and was using the blog's spell check (because I want to look smart in front of all of you...and think you'll look down on me for my lousy spelling). Anyone else think it's funny that the blog's spell checker doesn't have the word "blog" in it?

       BUT NOT FOR LONG...  So tomorrow is move in day at the new place... Well...actually...it's the start of our lease. Move in day, so to speak, is not until this coming Saturday. But I'm determined to sleep in my bed in the new locale tomorrow night...come hell or high water. There is something about paying for a place and not using it that really seems wrong to me. LaCasse isn't as anxious to move, but then again that may be because he has a home right now. As I've mentioned before, I'm loving the thought of a new place... a clean place... a place to make a home again. There is just something special about that.   IT'S GETTING HOT IN HERE...  Ok...so a rapper I'm not... but "I'm getting so hot...I wanna take my clothes off" would be appropriate for my experience last Thursday at Washington Dulles International Airport. So I get from St. Louis to Dulles ok... no problem (even though folks going to O'Hare were having lots of problems). I go to the bar (because were else would you go) and it was crappy...a freaking microbrewhouse at an airport...crappy. I pay $5.53 for a beer (more than STL)...and then... then the fun starts. This gate agent who looks like he's in high school boards us onto the regional jet going to SC... but he does this knowing A. that the air conditioning is out on the aircraft and B. that they haven't put fuel in the aircraft yet. So we sit there on a hot tarmac (even though it was 10 at night) for 45 mins...sweating profusely... No word.... no offer of water... nothing. The only good thing about it was the flight attendant... who was very attractive (ok...as LP would put it...a diamond in the rough). I wrote an e-mail to United to complain... of course in hopes of getting a free ticket sometime soon...    HAVEN'T I SEEN YOU BEFORE...  So I told you about the diamond in the rough flight attendant... Well... she was the flight attendant again on my flight this morning... and of course... she recongnized me...    ON THE HOMEFRONT...  Not too much happening in the upstate of South Carolina really... My sister was gone the whole weekend in Myrtle Beach. She called home on Sunday asking how to get ants out of a car... Thank God it wasn't our car... One of her friends (insert remark here) parked on an ant pile for the weekend. My sister...by the way...has infected our home computer with 172 viruses... And of course somehow I got blamed for it because I tried to fiz it.  I did net a couple of nice new shirts and pairs of slacks while I was home  &nbsp;

       WELL...OK...MAYBE NOT....  But it sure did sound good as a title for this blog post. Why you ask? Well, the big Coz is headed on vacation tomrorow... I guess you can call it that. I've switched to the morning shift tomorrow morning and taken Friday off to head to SC to visit the fam... The fam sans my sister who has decided that this is the ONLY weekend that she and her sorority compatriots could go to the beach... you know... the place where you go to get skin cancer and be seen in the Southeast... So I wont see her...which bums me out not because I won't be seeing my sister of 20 years...but rather because she won't be able to bring home free cheddar biscuits from Red Lobster where she works. Anyways...I'm headed home... and looking forward to it!   IAD  IAD likely means nothing to most of you out there...but to those in the airline industry, it means Washington Dulles International Airport. That's where I'm changing planes tomorrow evening. A new airport to add to my list. And of course the best part of a new airport? A new airport bar! I'm becoming an expert of sorts on those.... Budwiser Brewhouse...Lambert St. Louis International Airport... Concourse A...here I come.   HAVE I EVER MENTIONED...  That I really hate moving... I mean hate it... Take out our notebook of "I'd rather be..." musings from History of American Journalism...and use some of those phrases to discribe how I feel about moving. I'm fondest of the "I'd rather have my balls squeezed in a vice grip." I spent all of last weekend moving the first time in two weeks (that's right the first time). I still have to wait until next Tuesday until Matt and I can get into our new place. And let me tell you that I'm looking forward to a nice clean new place.   HOSANAH...IT'S THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS...  So if you're in Missouri, I hope you've been watching the recent debates between Governor Holden and Claire McCaskill. It's shown me just what a klutz this state has for a governor... and it makes me wonder how in the hell the man was elected in the first place. Of course, in that same election, the state elected a dead man... so go figure... Claire kicked Bob's ass...pure and simple. Bob was on the defenseive the whole time... and he couldn't come up with a good answer to save his life. He was avoiding questions left and right... The pure deer in the headlights look... It was beautiful...    THE VEEP  So the VEEP (read: Vice President of the United States) was in town early this week at a local lumber company. It was supposed to be a talk about small business. Only it turned out to be 20 percent small business...80 percent the war on terror. Frankly, even as a Republican, this war drum thing is getting old. But...that marks the third time in a year and a half that I've seen the Vice President. Not once have I seen W... Although I would have liked to have seen him yesterday in St. Charles when his kids were with him... Reports say Jenna stuck out her tounge at tv cameras at Lambert.   &nbsp;

       THERE IS NO GREATER LOVE, SAYS THE LORD, THAN TO LAY DOWN YOUR LIFE FOR A FRIEND...  I heard that hymn at church last Sunday (more on that later), and it's really kind of ringing true to me right now. Many of you already know part of the story of which I'm going to tell another chapter. Alas, due to FCC secret covert talk-not requirements, I'm prohibited from going into great detail for those of you who don't know about it. Call me if you want to know... but I dare not publish much on the web. Long story short...a friend of mine here in BoCoMo is getting canned...and I have the unfortunate of knowing about it. I had mixed feedback on if I should tell him. There are, of course, other issues that complicate the situation...Namely that we were supposed to move in together soon on a years lease. So...I told him... taking great risk for my own wellbeing. He wasn't mad...or upset... It seemed that I was more worried than him (which doesn't surprise those of you who know me well). He told me that no matter what he was staying in town... that he was looking forward to rooming together... That it was the good times you spend outside of work...and not the humdrum of the every day grind...that makes it all worth it for him. I took a lot of comfort in that... And once again...I had a friend of mine come through for me and reassure me that, indeed, everything will be alright.    THE BIZ  This whole deal as of late has made me contemplate if I really want to be in the business that I'm in. I love news...but I'm not sure if I'm the right medium. Problem is I love the medium... but frankly I love the medium of 10 to 15 years ago when a station was "full service." You could depend on it for everything... from news to sports to traffic to music. The industry is changing so much, and in my opinion it's not changing for the better. Plus...there is more money elsewhere... we'll have to see.   THE MASS  I mentioned above the quote from the hymn I heard at Mass last Sunday. Those of you who know me will know that I didn't go to church a whole lot during college. I did every now and then... I got on streaks... but I wasn't consistent. Many say that in your later twenties you tend to go back to church more... and that has been the case for me as of late. I think it's more about comfort than anything else... In a world that is getting more and more unfamiliar... church offers me familiarity...   PROPS TO E-VAN  My good friend the Lubbock anchorman has started his own blog...and I'll shortly add him to the link list. He rightfully includes me on the greatest newsteam of all time... along with him... which is appropriate considering I...not KOMU...taught him everything he knows about conversational delivery.

       CHICAGO, ILLINOIS - 391 MI  I was complaining about a week ago that there was nothing worth posting about on this here blog, but that was of course before Bish and I took last Friday off and headed to the metro Chicagoland area. Here are a few musings to let you in on just a little bit of the trip. Keep in mind that my stories aren't, and never have been, as good as DC's travelogues...   JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE ON VACATION...  I had a very nicely planned scheduled for last Thursday. It was designed to accomplish everything I needed to get done before my few days away from home. Of course, fate had other plans. As always, the proverbial "shit hit the fan." I woke up early to finish my wash and clean the car....and then Claxton called to let me know that they had arrested the cop (see post below) and charged him with murder. This happend before... I was going to Chicago the weekend after 9/11... I was going to SC on the weekend we started bombing Afghanistan... and I was going to Colorado the day Kent Heitholt was murdered. Of course with this big news...we went into overdrive coverage...and I got to feed AP Network News... but it put a serious dent in my day. Luckily, Bish and I were able to make it out only a half hour after our schedulded departure time.   DOWN ON THE FARM...  This trip marked Bish's first trip to Bob Evans. He and I stopped at one for dinner in Springfield, IL. We both had the open faced roast beef... a good time was had by all...   THE STORE TO END ALL STORES  If you are ever in the Fox Valley Mall in the Chicagoland area...check out the Beer Store. They don't sell beer...but I think they have just about every piece of beer related merchandise that you could want. Of course, it was overpriced.   YOU THINK HARPOS IS CROWDED ON A THRUSDAY NIGHT??  Check out the three or four watering holes in Naperville, IL on a Friday night during the summer... Or wait... don't check them out because they'll be so crowded you want be able to hear yourself think...or move...   JUST A TASTE  I will say that I did enjoy the Taste of Chicago, which we attended on Saturday evening. It was a tad crowded.... people would randomly stop in front of you... and it was a tad overpriced... but it was worth it... I had some of the best crabcakes and turtle soup I've ever had... If you ever wanted a nice thought...think about Bish eating a steamy BBQ Turkey leg...dripping with sauce...on a sidewalk...in Grant Park.   YOU MIGHT BE IN CHICAGO IF...  A teenager drunk off of Busch Light sets a new world record dropping the f bomb 23 times in 30 seconds...using every part of speech known to man...   OR...  Someone gets shot two blocks away from you after watching fireworks.

       THE IOWA PLAGUE THAT IS...  I was chastized this evening by DC for not posting on my blog in some time. It seems as though this has become somewhat of a competition among grizzled ones.... and I must admit that Rob seems to be lagging behind. Perhaps I'll have to whip him into shape when I see him shortly.  On to the Iowa Plague thing. For those of you that don't know, my new roommate (and work co-hort) Matt is from Iowa (although I found out this weekend that he was actually born in Arkansas...which explains a lot). His folks came down from the farm this weekend to spend two days visiting their soon and seeing just what he has gotten himself into here in the "South" (Yes...his mom calls MO the South. She even asked me where all the big mansions with columns were during the tour I gave them of MU and BoCoMo). They brought lots of fresh food from the farm...and a plague (read: cold) that I've caught onto. I hate being sick...I really do. The only good thing about it is that you get to take drugs (such as NyQuil).  So I had so much of a headcold today that I left work early.... intent on going home and taking drugs and going to sleep. Ha! Like that would happen! I stopped to get my mail...and when I got back in the car... it wouldn't start. So I rolled it down the hill into somebody else's parking spot...and call AAA. They come...and jump me...but then it dies again... and they guy says, "We're going to have to tow 'er....but to get up to Albert Honda...it'll be $6..." I asked for closer places...and we ended up at a place on Nifong. The tow truck driver informs me that he thinks its the alternator (which pains me...because I know that's big bucks).  Now I don't know much about cars...so I don't even think about anything being under warrenty. But my dad does...and he gives me all sorts of advice about the situation. It ends up being the battery....$96...and I'm going to try and get re-embursed by Honda since the battery was under warrenty.  Additional problem was that I didn't have my debit card with me. It seems that I had taken it out of my wallet when I was taking out my AAA card to call them. So..I had to call and get someone to bring it to me.  I realized on the way home that God was striking me down for even suggesting that Matt's parents had given me the Iowa Plague. That...I guess...is what you get...when you mess with Iowans.   STAY TUNED...  Don't want to jinx anything or give too much away on the web (many of you already know), but to quote Paul Hannigan, "I've got a deal in the works." And it's a great deal! Lets hope it all works out.

       A LATE NIGHT  It was yet another late election night for the 24 hours but not in a row news team as I didn't get home until about 1:30 am this morning due to election coverage. From a radio coverage standpoint, things went good...except the damn Cardinals went into extra innings forcing us to do updates and no real long form coverage until 11pm (well after other radio stations). But folks seemed to be happy with it. I, of course, as always, overreacted to things thinking the coverage was going to pot...when indeed it wasn't... and now the results of some of my favorite and least favorite races...and some commentary to boot...   OTB!! OTB!! OTB!!  Bob Holden becomes the first incumbant in Missouri history to loose a re-election bid after being challenged from within his own party. Claire McCaskill beat him handily. I voted for her today and I'll likely vote for her again in November. I've seen her speak a couple of times and I'm really impressed with her. And it really does my heart good to know that Bob is leaving... He just wasn't getting the job done...   CAN'T EVEN WIN HIS HOMETOWN...  Ken Jacob looes Boone County to Bekki Cook in the race for Lt. Governor.... Again...a good thing..   THE AMENDMENTS...  While I voted for the winner in both top of the ticket races...I lost both of the bottom of the ticket amendments to the state constitutional. Gay marriage is now banned in the Missouri Constitution (sorry Nick...it's wrong I know). I think it's horifying that it was approved by such a wide margin. That lets you know that despite the fact that this state has become my home, there are still many parts of it that are backasswards. Similar comments go for the vote not to allow a casino on a small river in a small southwest Missouri town.  Now I'm tired...and I'm going to bed...more later

       WE'RE ALL GOING TO POT...  You may recall reading below that I was rather dismayed yesterday about my evening at city council. I felt there wouldn't be anything exciting, and I had already worked a long day. I simply wasn't looking forward to sitting through five hours of endless debate that should take about 45 minutes. A couple of things conspired last night to make the meeting more interesting.  First, the mayor was on vacation. For those of you that know our fair city, you'll know that the mayor tends to be...oh...what word should I use...well...excentric is the only thing I can think of...but that really doesn't do him justice. He's a man that goes for long and drawn out debate and discussion....he always thinks a compromise can be reached (which often it can't)...and he always thinks a project needs a bigger sidewalk or a trail.  Second...for those of you that can remember...rewinder your minds to late 2002 or early 2003 when our friend E-van was still a fledgling reporter at KLIT news here locally (before he made it big time). Recall the live shot that he did from the lobby of city hall where he had pot (as I recall simulated)...to talk about the petition that had been introduced to put medical marijuana on the ballot. That measure failed in April 2003, but organizers are back again. This time they say they've changed the proposal enough to garner more support.  The way the petition process works in our fair city is this. The city council can approve the law revision that is proposed by the petition straight up...thereby forgoing a place on the ballot. If they don't approve it straight up, they must put it on the ballot.  Now our fair city is a liberal island in the midst of a rather conservative sea... Much of the liberalism is due to the fact that the largest employer is a major state university. Academia...for the most part...tend to be more liberal thinking...open to change and newer ideas, etc. Our city council tends to be somewhat the same way... although it's a little more balanced than some would think.  Last night the board was one vote short of making marijuana legal for medicinal reasons in the city. They ended up tied since the mayor was gone...and as such...the law was defeated and will go onto the ballot. But I am simply amazed that we came within one vote of it.   IN THE SPIRIT OF E-VAN...  Many of you who have lived with E-van before will recall his foolproof plan to woo women... Invite them over for a little dinner...some wine...and a movie... Ah yes...many a times (ok...a few times) would one of us grizzled ones come home and find E-van on the couch with a strapping young lady....watching a movie.... Well...young Matthew...my new roomate...is taking after E-van in that tradition. I came home last night....only to find him trying to woo some MU vet students by serving them beer and showing them some comedy.

       AND YOU THOUGHT I LIKED THIS STUFF...  Ok...I've always been a fan of civics...and local civics in particular... Friends of mine will recall many of nights during the last few of my college years when I would crack open a Bud Light...heat up some Tuna Helper...and turn to good old Channel 13 and watch the city council of our fair (and socialist) city... And now people wonder why I bitch and moan about watching the same thing in person as part of my job. Well...the reason is simple... at home...I can become drunk...and I also can skip the boring parts by going and doing something else. I can't skip the boring parts as part of my job.  Many of you who know this city and its politics will know that we tend to talk things to death... we tend to look at things (such as crime) through rose colored glasses... and we love roundabouts and parks (even at the expense of making homes cost more). I just love the way this city pretty much accomplishes nothing...will looking like its accomplishing something...  And the reason I've decided to go on this diatribe... Well..it's council night   YOU COULD HAVE AT LEAST HUNG IT STRAIGHT...  None of you (save DC) know my new roomate Matt (who recently had his job saved by the grace of God and the grace of myself and Dan). He's a great guy... lacking some professional skills (as I think even he would admit) but I enjoy hanging out with him. His only problem from a sports standpoint is that he's an Iowa fan (he hates the Cardinals...so that about makes it a wash). Anyways...I hung my lifesize Ricky Paulding poster...my "Beat KU" sign with many of us grizzled ones on it...and my MU diploma in our upstairs hallway. Matt...in an effort to show the diversity of the household...hung his Hawkeye blanket and other related items near and below my items.... As I said to him today at work... "Well...the least you could have done is hung it straight"   ELECTION 2004  I don't nomrally like to tell folks who I vote for (although many of you can guess) but I figured that I would tell you about how I'm going to cast my ballot in the Missouri primary tomorrow since it will be such a unique ballot for me. I'm going to take a Democratic ballot (shocking I know)...and I'm not going to pull some Republican stunt and vote for who I think will be easier to beat in the general election... No...I'm actually going to vote for who I think will do the best job...  Here is my sample ballot for you...  US Senate: I'll abstain on that one...  Governor: Claire McCaskill  Lt. Governor: Bekki Cook  State Treasurer: Jason Klumb  State Senate: Chuck Graham  State Rep: Greg Casey  Amendment One (Rockaway Beach Casino): Yes  Amendment Two (Banning Gay Marriage): No   Comments welcome   OUT IN THE WEST TEXAS TOWN OF LUBBOCK...  I have to go on the air...but before I do, I wanted to let you know that I will be visiting E-van and Rob out in Lubbock later this month... due in large part to a goof in frequent flier miles. Looking forward to random tomfoolery.  Ok...to work I must go!
