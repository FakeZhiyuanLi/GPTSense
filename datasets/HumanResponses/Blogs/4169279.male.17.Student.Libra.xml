        The sky becomes an arena and the stars fill the stands as the giant settles in the west, casting its delicate orange glow across the horizon. The eternal enemy appears in the eastern sky, the silvery harbinger of the black future, a menacing crescent cutting through the dark blue abyss. Uttering a silent roar, the bringer of day and life unleashes a brilliant display of pinks, purples, oranges and reds. Fading. A golden ray kisses the earth, as if to say goodbye. A crimson tear explodes, searing the clouds as it falls behind the earth, turning them into firey embers of the heavens. A last glorious flicker, a mighty farewell. Gone. Shadows slowly sweep across the land, minions of the victorious, the ruler of the night. Warmth fades. The symphony of twilight emerges. Crickets, owls, all laughing at the firey demise. The glow in the west will fade, the aftermath of an epic duel, replaced by silky moonlight.    thanks for watching

       Eyes.  The glimpse into your soul, yet at the same time, the welcomed intruder.  They express emotion so beautifully- fear, anger, sadness, passion, happiness, angst.  They cannot lie.  I'll never forget that moment we locked eyes, you, suddenly shying away.  And then you looked back.  All of those emotions, suddenly melting into pure bliss as I stared into those piercing eyes, seemingly carved from stunning blue perfection.       Never look away.   Sweet dreams.

       I had an old friend who I will never forget. I can't. If I did, I would break a promise. We met about eight years ago in winter. We knew everything about each other. For four years I had the best friend I've ever known. And then something happened. We drifted away from each other. Slowly at first, and then before I knew it, she was gone. I hate how time and emotion blur the past, especially the moments you wish you could keep forever. If only back then I realized how lucky I was to have her as a friend. I'm sorry.       I still hope that one day we will talk again, like we use to. Its 11:11 - make a wish.

       Just saw lost in translation with Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.  I didn't think I'd like it, but it ended up being really good.  It made me want to go to Japan just to see some of the places they show in the movie, although meeting someone like Johansson would be a definite plus as well :X.  Bill Murray was hilarious as usual, and Johansson was pretty good too.  The whole movie has a dreamlike atmosphere that is just amazing.  It just goes to show how two confused people, stuck in a strange place, can form a bond that transcends barriers that most people seem boxed in by.  They seemed so comfortable in each others' company.      Then again, if I was sharing a bed with someone as beautiful as Scarlett Johansson I would be pretty comfortable too.      The ending is really good and kept the film from being predictable.   Go see it.

       People say to live in the past is a bad thing. You get stuck up in a moment and can't move on. Why? What if that moment was so amazing, so incredible, that living in it forever wouldn't exactly be bad. Our past makes us who we are, so why not embrace it. The future only brings an end, and gives way to the past eventually. What are we without our memories? I often catch myself thinking of one great memory, and wishing that I could go back and relive it. But I can't. Its gone. Locked away in time, forever.       Time sucks.
