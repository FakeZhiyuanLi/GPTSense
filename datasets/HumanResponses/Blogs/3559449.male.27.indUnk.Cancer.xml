        Multi Level Marketing (MLM) is one of the newest business wave that is hitting Singapore shores. Highly hyped as  THE  thing that will bring significant change into our lives, MLM touches everyone of us. Champions of MLM swear by its fantastic business model. Average Joes and Janes like me shudder at the thought of even talking to any MLM representatives, and with good reasons!   Personally, I detest MLM. Most people do, but most people don't really have a solid understanding of what MLM is to begin with. They hate not the business model itself but rather the hard-selling tactics that its supporters practise. It is fear that is driving the masses away.   Me? I've done my share of research, been to countless seminars, even joined an MLM company before. Conclusion?   I'd rather sell toufu.   If you are even considering remotely of joining any MLM company, this entry will be  invaluable .   Let's start with a lesson in history.   Long long time ago, business is pretty much straightforward. You wanna sell a widget of some kind, you open a store. You do some promotion, and people start buying. It's as simple as that. But as your business grows, competitors start coming into your marketplace, taking away your precious customers. Businesses start slashing prices to outdo each other. Some do better than the others and eventually become market leaders. Some collapse under the sheer heap of competition. And so it goes for many many years....   Then some smart alecks decide to turn the table around. This is what they came up with.    Rather than having the businesses market its product, why not have the  customers  market them for us?  That way, we can have strong customer loyalty PLUS they double as salesmen for us, for FREE!   Feeling lightheaded from all the potential money that could pour into the business with this new model, they start laying the groundwork that would eventually become the foundation of the MLM industry. They changed the business game, totally.   First, they said "Let's close our shops! We don't need them anymore. Let's not paying outrageous rentals. Let's just put everything into a warehouse."   Second, they said "To make our customers buy from us, we gotta make it cheaper for them. Let's eliminate the pesky middleman. Let's control the entire value chain, and give value where they truly belong - to our customers!"   Third, they said "Okay, we got customers now. Let's turn them into our champions. Let them sell for us, and in exchange, give them some commission. Heck! Let's go all the way. Let's have award ceremonies and celebrate our top donkeys - free flights to anywhere in the world!"   Fourth and probably most important, they said "Making them as salesmen isn't enough. Let's tell them to recruit other people as well, and let them override on commissions. We will train them and give them all the tools they need. Then let them loose, and like wolves they will bring in the rabbits."   And the rabbits truly came. If you're planning to join the ever massive industry of MLM, congratulations - you're a rabbit now! In my future entry, I will tell you what a rabbit does, and what the wolves don't tell you.   Stay tuned.

        I bet you watched the movie ' The Day After Tomorrow ', correct? Well, after watching it, it got me thinking...    "Suppose a flood really is coming your way, and in about 30 minutes from now, you're gonna join the fishes. What are you going to do  now ?"    I thought about it long and hard. I could be like the hero and go find myself a museum to hide my ass. Or I can be like the rest of them and start jog my way to the next city. Shit, I forgot I'm in Singapore.   Oh, I get it!   I can start recording the anarchy around me, wait for the climatic flood to rush over me while keeping the camera rolling, somehow survive the aftermath of the disaster while everybody around me dies, keep the film intact and dry (somehow), sell my film to Hollywood and end up filty rich.   Nah.... here's what I'll  really  do.   I'd walk up to the prettiest girl I can find, and I'd say:   "Hey prettiness. As you know, the flood's coming our way in a little over 30 minutes time. I don't think you know how to swim right, seeing how milky white your skin is, I don't think you come out much during the day too, do you?"   Girl nods her head, tears strolling down her pink cheeks.   "Don't be afraid. We're all destined to die one way or another. I'm sure it's God's will that at this point of critical moment, we meet each other. Surely there is a meaning that we are talking to each other now, despite the calamity that will surely befalls us later."   Girl appears confused.   "What I'm saying is... there must be a reason why we only get to know each other today, instead of any other days. Do you have a plan to save yourself?"   Girl shakes her head.   "Fear not. Death is but a new beginning in another world. Do not fear death. Look straight into it's eyes. Tell me dear, what would you want to do now, knowing you still have precious little time in this god forsaken place?"   Girl shakes her head again, and starts to sob silently.   "I have an idea..."   Girl looks up to you, tears of hope glistening across her skin.   "Let's have sex! See here, me and you are going to die very very soon. The way I see it, you have two choices. You can wait here and sob and cry before the flood drowns you, and your lungs burst with water. You can do that, and die a horrible death. Or... you can come over to my apartment, and fuck like rabbits. We can drown in the sea of estacsy, embrace in each others warmth, and reach orgasm before we die."   Girl looked shocked. She shakes her head.   "Come on. I've got vibrators and stuff. It will be the best 30 minutes you've ever spent. You've got nothing to lose now - unless you have a better plan?"   Girl didn't say a word.   "Let's go then! We have only about another 20 minutes. Lucky enough my apartments on floor 15. We can probably go for another round before the water reaches us."   I reached out my hand. Girl takes it. I give my most sincere smile. We walked back to my place - hand in hand.   - The End -

        Yahoo! Here's to a better week ahead. In a couple of hours from now, my best friend will reach the fable land of Singapore. We will then proceed to meet up with his new found girl friend. They're going to be spending a night over at my place. I've already planned a beach stroll at East Coast, then we go clubbing (location undetermined as yet). Next morning, we will head up to Orchard Road so that she can go shopping, and we play bodyguards.   Come Sunday, I will follow them to JB, where I will meet up with my boss. We will be spending the night over at JB, the city where you can spit on the road and feel proud about it. He'll follow me back to Singapore the following Monday. Two guys with lots of money to burn, I'm sure Monday will be another day in paradise.   Then on Friday, Feisty Fiona will visit me in Singapore. The close perfect embodiment of prettiness, Feisty Fiona is always a sight to behold. Already my guy friends are looking forward for me to introduce them to her. Right guys, where were you when I wanted an introduction to a pretty lass? Greedy bastards, I too know how to play the game.   Of course, with all these excitements coming up, it also means that I will have to sacrifice blogging. Ouch! Why does it have to happen like this. When they don't come, they don't come for months. When they do come, they come in droves. Ah well, still beats rotting at home everyday.   Come to think of it, I better start mopping the floor. Last time I did mopped the floor was during Chinese New Year. I'm sure my friends won't mind (except probably Feisty Fiona) but I wouldn't want to blame my dog again. I've used that excuse one too many times.

        A little help from a fellow Internet Marketer, Mr.Patric Chan. He recently sent me (and thousands of his other subscribers) an e-mail about his  formula for success . After reading it, I find it, utterly simple yet effective. Let me tell you why..   Most of time when people start 'lecturing' about success forumula, they bragged about mindsets, philosophies, hard work, dedication, blah blah blah. You get the drift. In the end, you get a whole load of horse shit, and you're left there dazed. Intead of giving you impactful real life examples, they go on and on and on without hitting a single useful tip whatsoever.   This little tip from Patric is slightly different. It goes something like this:    Work less, earn more    But first, you must understand this formula in order to achieve that.   Here’s the formula:   Assuming you are working 8 hours a day, and you are getting X result (X can be any amount of money you are getting now.)   Where most people failed to achieve success is, they try to earn X + Y (Y can be any amount of extra money you want to get) without finding a way to work less first. In another words, finding a way to work less while still getting X result.   In order for you to get Y result, you should find ways to work less than 8 hours first and still be getting X result. Let’s say 6 hours.   Once you able to achieve that, only then can you consider how to find ways to get Y result.   In a nutshell,    First step:    Work 8 hours (or whatever your existing working hours are) and get X result.    Second step:    Find ways to work 6 hours and still get X result.    Third step:    Work 8 hours again but get X + Y results.   Once you achieve this, your next step is to find ways on how to achieve X + Y results by working only 6 hours instead of 8 hours. Once you find that, only than you can think about getting  Z result (Z can be any amount of extra money you want to have).   So, repeat the whole process:    First step:    Work 8 hours get X + Y results.    Second step:    Find ways to work 6 hours and still get X + Y results.    Third step:    Work 8 hours again but get X + Y + Z results.   Keep on repeating this process until you get the maximum results you can get (this can be A+B+C+X+Y+Z).   At some stage, you’ll probably reach the optimum of getting the results and you can hardly earn more by working 8 hours a day.   Once you achieve this, congratulations.   Now, what you need to do is to find ways to WORK LESS but still get the same results.   So at the end, you’ll be able to WORK LESS And EARN MORE.

        And you fell hard on reality. The sudden realization that your dreams were nothing but web of lies and deceits, threw you back to a place you thought you will never ever visit. The darkest place within your heart which you have never dared ventured into.   Your horror has finally visited you.   And rest assured, your nightmares have just begun. Lest you think that this is the worse it can get, let me assure you, this is just but a small drip of blood.   I watched you crumbled from far away. And I extended my hand, offering a much needed solace. Yet I knew you would not dare take this hand of mine. For it is exactly the owner of this hand whom you have hurt long ago.   Is it fear or shame that barriers you from my touch? Are you afraid to look into my eyes again, and to once again feel emotionally naked? Or is it shame that filled you, knowing that you have indeed made a terrible mistake?   There is nothing to fear or shame, for there is nothing I do not know of you. As I extend my hand, you will wonder what lies beyond the gesture. You watched me smile, yet there was a hint of a sinister glee. Am I here to save you?   Do you really want to know? Then take my hand, my dear.

        I travel back to Malaysia about once every month. Everytime I reach Larkin (JB), a sudden thought always crosses my mind. Like a sheet of pure white lightning, I was brought back to one particular incident which happened here a couple of months ago. When the thought struck I didn't know whether I should feel angry or stupid.   *One of those days, in a hot afternoon*   I alighted from bus 170, drenched in sweat. Big bag on my shoulders, my next move would be to find a bus that would take me from here back to KL.   As always, there's always one guy standing right in front waving tickets, shouting and plodding around for desperate passengers. That day, I was one desperate customer. I wanna get the heck out of this place, sit my ass on a comfy air-cond bus and sleep the journey to KL.   Guess what? I was in luck.   The guy holding the tickets was shouting "KL! KL! KL! Board now!" Wait a minute, I'm one desperate guy but I ain't stupid. This trick has been used since my grandmother was born, so don't try to tell me that the bus is leaving now. I've been conned so many times before. The bus  never  leaves on time. The moment you pay your money and get on board, you would've realized that you've made a big big mistake. You'd probably have to wait for another 30 agonizing minutes before the driver finally finishes his cigarette, and decide to move the bloody behemoth onwards to KL.   30 minutes... if you're lucky. Better to buy my tickets from those authorized counters.   But this time it's different. The guy waving the tickets looked impatient. "Now! Now! Board now, or don't bother!". His fingers pointed to a blue coloured bus behind him. I gazed upon his direction...   Heck! The bus indeed was moving! The driver engaged first gear and was rumbling about. It  will  leave any minute now. It's now or never.   I quickly rushed over to the guy, paid 25 dollars and got a yellowed, smashed piece of something they called ticket. The bus inched a couple of meters ahead. My heart skipped two beats. "Wait! Wait! I'm boarding now!" I ran to the bus, heaved my bag up the stairs, and quickly looked for a seat. I quickly found one empty seat beside an old woman. I placed my bag underneath, slumped into the comforts of a dusty blue coloured chair (what's with blue anyway?), and felt giddy. For the first time ever, I was leaving this god-forsaken place on time. I was smiling.   That's when the driver stopped pushing the gas pedal, switched off the engine, killed the air-cond, opened the door, stepped outside and promptly lit his favorite cigarette.   What the fuck?   Somebody tell me what the fucking fuck just happened? Me, young smart degree holder in computer science, just got suckered by a skin-wrinkled, toothless, grinning driver. I felt like a piece of stupid shit.   And they bloody switched off the air-cond. I feel like a pig being roasted alive with the rest of the rest of them adult pigs, children piggies, and old fuck pigs.   Out of nowhere, the driver appeared, quickly got back into his seat, engaged first gear and pumped the gas. Vroom! Vroom! A new passenger rushed into the bus, relieved that he got into the bus at the last minute. He quickly looked for a seat.   I didn't need to look behind to see his expression as the driver killed the engine again and continued his smoking. I bet he's a degree holder too.   45 minutes later, the bus started its journey. I stopped cursing since 15 minutes ago.

        Jeff Bezos. Founder of Amazon.com, the most recognized brand name on the Internet. He was also named Time magazine's  Person of the Year . If you want to know how Bezos came about the idea of selling books online, then you've definitely came to the right place.   Below is an excerpt from the book Amazon.com by Robert Spector.   Most experts pinpoint the moment in history when the Internet went mainstream in the period between September 1993 and March 1994. It was a time when corporations began putting up sites that were less for transactions and more for posting static information such as annual reports, products literature and technical specifications, press releases, and regional offices and phone numbers.   Bezos's primary duties in his last couple of years with his firm (D.E Shaw &amp; Co.) was researching commercial opportunities on the Internet. Spring 1994, Bezos's research revealed an astonishing fact: Web usage was growing at a staggering clip of 2,300 percent a year, thanks to the availability of the Mosaic browser to users of Mac and Windos-based PCs.   Looking for the best product that could be sold on the Web, Bezos compiled a list of 20 possibilities, including computer software, office supplies, apparel, and music.   In the course of his research, he was surprised to find that books rocketed from being almost at the bottom of the list to the very top, with music following in second place. Music was eliminated because of the way the industry was set up. With only six major record companies dominating the business and controlling distribution, Bezos feared that those companies had the leverage to freeze out an opportunistic outsider who wanted to challenge traditional brick-and-mortar stores.   That was unlikely to happen in the book business. Another factor in favour of books was the fact there were only 300,000 active music CDs, compared with more than 3 million books active and in print around the world in all languages.   Furthermore, bookselling was large and fragmented, with no dominant 800-pound gorillas. The U.S. industry had tens of thousands of publishers, many of them with a title or two to their credit. Random House, which was the biggest consumer publisher, accounted for less than 10 percent of the market. The combined sales of the two biggest bookselling chains, Barnes &amp; Noble and Borders Group Inc., made up of less than 25 percent of the approximately $30 billion total sales of all consumer adult books in 1994. Neither one of them had established themselves as a prominent global brand. The worldwide book industry - which was also large, growing and fragmented - was projected to generate sales of $82 billion in 1996.   Bezos saw that, "With that huge diversity of products, you could build a store online that simply could not exist in any other way. You could build a true superstore with exhaustive selection; and customers value selection."   An online bookstore would place virtually no limits on the number of books available to the consumers; and the World Wide Web's search and retrieval interface technology would make it easy for customers to surf the entire database of books in print. Buying decisions could be made easier for consumers by providing them with more and better information such as synopses, excerpts and reviews.   By serving a vast, international market from a centralized ordering and distribution location, an online bookseller could be programmed to provide an inexpensive personalized shopping experience for its customers, and, even more important for the online bookseller, the information that could be collected on the individual customer's personal preferences and buying habits could create possibilities for direct marketing and personalized services. Bezos saw that because of these advantages over traditional retailers, online retailers had the potential to build large, global customer bases quickly and to achieve superior economic returns over the long term.   Another advantage to selling books online was availability. Books could easily be acquired either directly from publishers or from a network of distributors that carried up to about 400,000 titles in their inventories.   Finally, another major reason why books had to be the first product that Bezos would sell on the Internet was that  everybody understands what a book is.  And the people who were already using the Internet were obviously computer-savvy, affluent, and most importantly, frequent buyers of books.

        I got a call from one of those timeshare companies. A sweet voice crackled through my handphone. "Morning! How are you today?". She was bursting with excitement.   I wasn't.   I felt dreadful. She was about to ask me on the four thousand dollars that I still owe them.   "Lady, I'm sick."  "Gosh! Whatever happened? Why don't you rest a while? I'll call you tomorrow. Byeeeee!"   I get their calls on average two times a month. I visit their office about once a month, each time pleading and begging my ass off to give me more time. Frankly, I'm surprised they haven't sued me yet. They will... sooner or later.   Someone asked me how I'm doing these days. Wow! "You really wanna know, don't you?"   Let's see...   I broke up with my girlfriend 9 months ago. She can't take me smoking and drinking all the time. So she found another man. Someone who drinks and smokes harder than me. Great! Soon after I got myself a new girlfriend. She was absolutely crazy over me. Till something stupid happened, and we stopped talking to each anymore. Then I got hitched with another pretty lass. She liked me and we got together. Problem was, she already has a boyfriend. A month later, I couldn't take it anymore. I said goodbye. Which then, an air stewardess came into picture. She was great... until she demanded to know where I am and what I'm doing every single minute of my life. Suffice to say, I asked her to go look for a husband instead.   I got no money. I'm worse than the chinese beggar downstairs my block. I owe thousands of dollars from my friends (and that bloody timeshare company). I've got less than 20 dollars each time in my wallet. I owe the public utilities company money. I owe my internet service provider company money. I owe money over a company that sends dinner to my place every month. Yeah, I haven't paid my dinner for the last six months. They stopped sending dinner now.   My house's a complete mess. Light bulbs don't work in the living hall. The house is in perpetual darkness most of time. The drainage just got stuck. So I placed a water container underneath my sink, and throw shit and water every time it's full. I feel like a janitor at home.   My housemate just moved out because he can't stand the dog. I was thrilled. He owed me more money than he can ever repay and he told me he's leaving. My rental just got doubled because he left. What's with the dog?   Oh, she's a pretty little schnauzher, that hasn't got a hair cut for the last 3 months. She doesn't look like a dog now, much less a schnauzher. Everytime I come home, she'd give me that puppy look of hers and said "You haven't fed me for the last two days."   I'm working with a company here in Singapore. As the General Manager. Great huh? Wanna know how many staff I have?   None, zilch, nada.   I must be the only freaking General Manager in Singapore that does not have any staff. I don't even have a freaking office.   "So who makes the decision?" Me.  "So who follows up on the decision?" Me.  "So who does the accounts, sets up the website, and see clients?" Me.  "So who gets screwed when something goes wrong?" Me.  "So who gets credit when something goes right?" My boss.   I got a    job    offer once from the biggest newspaper company in Singapore. Like a smart bastard, I declined their offer, stating that I already am running a business at that point of time, and does not have any interest whatsoever to join your pathethic company. Needless to say, two months later, my so-called business failed with flying colours.   One friend asked me to join a motivational programme. Said it helped alot of people, and it would definitely do wonders for me. I felt enthuastic, till I found out the bloody programme charges five thousand dollars. I told my friend I'm having trouble paying for MRT. Somehow, he couldn't grasp the reality that money is a concern. I don't blame him. He works as a business consultant. I'm sure he thinks since I'm a general manager, I would have more money than he does. I wanna break his nose.   Another friend asked me to attend church. I told him Jesus wouldn't want a smoker and a drunkard in His house.   I haven't bought new clothes in months. The last pair of jeans that I bought six months ago don't fit anymore. Everytime I try to put them on, they slide beautifully down my knees. My weight has been dropping like a stone because I only have money to eat once a day. I looked at the mirror two times a day. Felt like watching a horror movie everytime. My eyebag can now hold water.   "Does that answer your question now? Now, if you'll excuse me, I need a drink."

        urlLink            Yuna. My dream girl. Sigh.. everytime I look at this photo, my heart skips a beat. Is she not one of the  most beautiful  girl you can ever lay your eyes on?   Yuna is the main female lead for the immensely popular game Final Fantasy X by SquareSoft. I played the game about a month ago, and when I first saw Yuna onscreen, I knew I had to finish the game.   Through countless nights, me and Yuna braved the world of Spira, fighting monsters, visiting temples, and many other wonderful things. The moments that I had spent with her was... always happy.   Yes, I know she does not exists. She is but a collections of pixels.  So what?  To me, she is as real as I want it to be. Yuna meant alot. She was there when I needed a company. She was there when I was feeling depressed. She was there when I celebrated happiness.  And most important of all, she gave me something none has ever given me.   She gave me hope.   After I met her, I finally realized what kind of girl I really like. Someone exactly like her. Physically and more importantly, her personality. You see, Yuna is conventional. She is shy and polite yet she exhibits a hidden strength and independence that I so very much adore. She is, to me, without question, an embodiment of a perfect love.   Yet, my heart weeps and wander, "Where can I find you, my Yuna?" Certainly, you're not in Singapore. Close to 5 bloody years here, and I have never encountered a soul that resembles a tiny bit of you. Where indeed in this vast world can I ever find you.      My beloved  Your soulful eyes outshine the brightest star of them all  Your beautiful hair flows with the northen wind  Your soft voice melts my tender heart  Yet fills them with the strength of gods   If I can lay my sight on you for just a speck of time  I would have truly known beauty  I would have truly tasted love  I would have truly lived   Let me find you, Yuna  Let my heart be filled with your wonder  If miracles do visit me, to you I say  It is not your beauty that strikes me deepest  It is your innocence.

        It's 3-plus in the morning. What the hell am I doing still awake at this ungodly hour? That is a question that I've asked myself repeatedly for the last two weeks.   It seems that my bio-clock is all wrong. I sleep when everyone's waking up. Sometimes, when the sun's up, I'm still awake. When that happens, I would go for breakfast. When the tummy's satisfied, I would immediately feel sleepy. And sleep I do... till the sun's high up the sky.   Afternoon. Ahh... I would do my 'morning' chores. By the time I cleaned my teeth and combed my hair, it would be lunch time. I would go about my work till about 4pm. That's when I start to get sleepy again.   Gosh! It's 8pm already. Time really flies when you're in DreamLand. Guess what? It's dinner time...   My day really doesn't start till it's midnight. That's when I feel most fresh, most opinionated, most creative and most excited. My best works always happen when the wolves start howling. I would work till the sun comes up.... then it's time for breakfast and a well deserved sleep.   So what kind of work am I doing, I heard you say. That's a good question. Sadly, I can't at this point of time give you a satisfying answer. I do not have the answer yet. I suspect I will not have the answer anytime soon too.   For now, I live by a code - "You only wake up when you finish sleeping".

        Blogging.  Could this really be my 'salvation'?  Frankly, it doesn't really matter because as absurb as this sounds,  time  is one thing that I have in abundant at the moment.   In fact, I'm having trouble killing time. That's why I've decided to try my hands on blogging. I think it is a fantastic platform for me to express myself.  Will anyone ever read this blog?    Again, this question is mute. I just want to have something that I've created and be able to read back when I'm old and dusty. Who knows, maybe I'd be struck with Alzheimer twenty years from now, so by then, probably the only meaningful thing left to do is... reading back my works.   So without further ado, cyberspace beckons!

       I received&nbsp;a very funny sms a couple of days ago, and decided to share the laughter around. So what I did was, I forwarded this message to a couple of my buddies. The message was something like this:  &nbsp;   I'm getting married next month.    There would be a small party and only few people would be invited.    Dont't bring any gift.    Just bring  SOMEONE  to marry me!    Haha...     &nbsp;  Couple of minutes later, my best buddy replied:  &nbsp;   Next month, I'm going to open a funeral.    Not yet decide who going to die.    You want to be the victim or not?    Send this kind of message...

       A shepherd was herding his flock in a remote pasture when suddenly a brand new BMW advanced out of a dust cloud toward him. The driver, a young man in a Broni suit, Gucci shoes, YSL tie and Ray Ban sunglasses leans out of the window and asks the shepherd, "If I tell you exactly how many sheep you have in your flock, will you give me one?"   The shepherd looks at the man who is obviously a Princeton grad, then looks at his grazing flock and calmly answers, "Sure, why not?"   The yuppie parks his car, whips out his Sony notebook computer, connects to his AT&amp;T cell phone, surfs to a NASA page on the Internet where he calls up a GPS satellite navigation system to get an exact fix on his location. He feeds that data to another NASA satellite which scans the area in an ultra-high resolution photo.   The young man then opens the digital photo in Adobe Photoshop and exports it to an image processing facility located in Hamburg, Germany.   Within seconds, he receives an e-mail on his "Palm Pilot" that the image has been processed and the data stored.   He then accesses a MS-SQL database through an ODBC connected Excel spreadsheet with hundreds of complex formulas. He uploads all of this data via an e-mail on his "Blackberry" and, after a few minutes, receives a response.   Finally, he prints out a full-color, 150-page report on his hi-tech, miniaturized HP Laser jet printer and turns to the shepherd and states, "You have exactly 1,586 sheep."   "That's right. Well, I guess you can take one of my sheep," says the shepherd.   He watches the young man select one of the animals and looks on, amused as the young man stuffs it into the trunk of his car.   Then the shepherd says to the young man, "Hey, if I can tell you exactly what your business is, will you give me back my sheep?"   The young man thinks about it for a second and replies, "Okay, why not?"   "You're a consultant," says the shepherd.   "Wow! That's correct," answers the yuppie. "But how did you guess that?"   "No guessing required. You showed up here even though nobody called you... you want to get paid for an answer I already knew to a question I never asked... and... you don't know shit about my business.    "Now Give Me Back My Dog!"

       Absolutely nothing beats a girl who knows the trick of the trade. If I'm the Education Minister, I'd make this  compulsory  for all girls.&nbsp;Master&nbsp;courtesan  urlLink Sunny Crittenden &nbsp;has this to share:&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Well, there's no "proper" way to give someone a blowjob, I mean, blow jobs are like pizza, even if they're bad, they're still pretty good, according to the boys who helped me in my quest for the perfect blow job techniques. So ladies, (and guys, if you're into that sort of thing), throw out your Cosmo magazines that are full of shit, pull up a chair &amp; take notes First of all, think of the head of the penis like your very own clitoris. The clitoris and head of the penis have the exact same nerve endings and are made of the exact same tissue.    Now think about your tongue. It's a muscle, and like all muscles it can be flexed or relaxed to create a soft or hard tongue. Ladies, you know what happens when a guy mashes your clit with a hard tongue right? The next thing you know, he's prying you from the ceiling and you're mumbling something about kicking him in the face next time. Well, the same thing goes for guys. Because the head of the penis is like your own clit, a soft tongue is recommended. In fact, if you look closely at an erect penis, there's a small scar (if he's cut) where the head and the shaft meet. (If he's not cut, it's where the pulled down foreskin attaches to the head.) Survey says that's the ticket to bliss if it's manipulated properly.    Okay, it's easier to give a blow job if the guy's already hard. If he's not, stroke him until he's hard and then go down on him. The first few mouth movements should be soft, sort of ease into it. If you don't, he can get overly sensitive right away and we don't want that.    First, swirl your tongue over the head, especially where the head meets the shaft, but don't put too much pressure into it, use a "soft tongue". After about 20 seconds of doing this, plunge down and take him as deep into your throat as you can, stiffening your tongue so it slides down the underside of the shaft.    While he's as far down your throat as you're comfortable with, move your tongue up and down the shaft, stick your tongue out as far as you can to lick the base of the penis (if you can get it that far) or his balls.    When you come back up, rapidly wiggle your tongue back and forth along the base. Repeat this whole process a few times and try not to giggle as he gasps every time you deep throat, try to do that part when you think he's not expecting it so he'll begin to anticipate it.    Remember while doing this that you have two hands as well as a mouth. Stroke his balls while you're tonguing the head of his dick. Playing with the balls while giving head is also a good way of figuring out what he likes if your boy's not very vocal. Typically the balls will sort of scrunch up a bit when something feels particularly good and they'll scrunch up completely when he's about to cum.    If you do the above techniques, he's going to last longer usually, so if you're getting tired or "cocksucker's cramp" you might want to speed things up by doing the age old "bobbing" method. Guys seem to vary on their appreciation of the act because girls seem to go at it much too fast. I've found that if you go up and down the shaft with your mouth, it's good practice to make ample use of your tongue at the same time by wiggling it back and forth. Also, instead of the standard up and down movement, really get into it and turn your head from side to side a bit, sort of like a corkscrew motion.    If you're doing this in the light, make sure you look up at him a few times while you're sucking him off because guys seem to really be into that. So, you've got him to the point of blowing his load…you've got three options: swallow, spit, or hop on. Most guys prefer to have you swallow, but my research has shown that most guys would prefer you to hop on rather than spit if it comes down to that.    If you don't like having cum in your mouth, there's various ways to alter it's taste, unfortunately, the texture's always going to be the same. I know some girls who have grown accustomed to the taste of it but to be honest I have no advice on how to go about doing that other than practice. (Your mother always said practice makes perfect, prove her right and tell her about your achievements the next time you see her.)    I would also like to note that the male g-spot (which is actually called the a-spot, I learned that the other night watching the Discovery channel) is the prostate gland, which you can only get to by inserting your finger into his rectum and doing a 'come here" motion with a finger or two, towards the front of him. Cosmo magazine will tell you to "sneak a finger in there" while you're giving him head but the boys I talked to when researching this article begged me to put something in here about ASKING FIRST. Definitely discuss adding this practice to your foreplay routine before you end up having to coax your boy out from under the bed.    Good luck and happy sucking!

       In a span of less than one week, I've got two friends who asked me the exact same question - "Buddy, you got  money  to lend me?"  &nbsp;  My dear friends, I can lend you my ass. You want a piece of it?  &nbsp;  I thought  everybody  knows I'm broke. You guys should be talking to Oei Hong Leong, not ME! Wait a minute, maybe it's not your fault. Maybe... it's mine. I've been thinking and I just realized that 99% of all my friends are poor buggers just like me. The poor tends to attract the poor. Makes sense right? I mean, say you're dead broke. What do you possibly have anything in common with a rich brat?    &nbsp;  - Ded Broke and Ritche Rich -

       In a couple of days from now, I'm going to be yet another year older. Time is running out. I no longer can have sex 7 times a day. So I clasp my hands, close my eyes, blow my candles, and reveal my secret wishes....   1) Someone give me a full set of CK underwears.   2) Government suddenly feels guilty of putting too harsh a punishment on smokers and decide to reduce cigarette prices to 20 cents a pack.   3) Every Wednesday I'd magically sex-changed to a woman, and get free entry to pubs and discos.   4) I get laid everytime I go Zouk.   5) Sasha(my dog) finally learns how to pee in the toilet. She can even wipes herself clean after that. On second thought,she should just  stop  peeing and shitting.   6) Zhang Zhi Yi decides to become a  porn  star.   7) XiaXue takes a liking on me, and decides to ask me out for dinner, treats me to a movie, goes back to my place, performs a strippie, and have hot sex till morning. She even makes me breakfast.   8) I 'kana' lottery.   9)  Kazaa  auto-downloads my favourite porn clips, without me ever touching the keyboard. I just need to get my tissue ready.   10) My boss tells me I work too hard, and forces me to stop working for the next 20 years, and still pays my salary.   11) Bank miscalculates my account account balance, and added a couple of zeros into my $20 account.   12) Genting boss found his long lost grandson - ME.   13) KFC awards me with its 'one-millionth' customer prize - FREE chicken till I retire.   14) MCDonald's got jealous and supplies me with burgers till my son retires.   15) I become Singapore Idol.   16) I become World Idol after that.   17) Paris Hilton leads 'A Simple Life' with me. We basically just fuck everyday.   18) I got elected Mayor for Toa Payoh. First thing I do is collect NKF Funds.   19) Singapore asks me to stop paying taxes. They have enough already.   20) Last but not least, my time share company stop bugging me about the money I still owe them.   I have more wishes, but there's still next year.

       Last one week had been a roller coaster ride. I'm both elated and exhausted. My couple friends have come and gone. My boss has come and gone and Feisty Fiona has also come and gone. Life is back to normal again. But it's time to remiscent the past week and what fun it had been.    Chean and Jeniffer   So my bestest pal has finally decided to pay me a visit in Singapore after so long... NOT! He only came because his girl friend happened to be running a project here. He's a selfish bastard but I forgive him.   On a nice sunny Saturday afternoon, he somehow made his way to my humble abode in Toa Payoh. Dressed like shit and with crumpled hair, he greeted me with a smile.   Chean : "Long time no see, my good friend!"   Me : "Save it pal. Where's Jeniffer?"   Chean : "Still working. We gotta get ready soon. She's gonna be off in about 30 minutes time."   Me : "Right. Where are you planning to bring her?"   Chean : "Somewhere beautiful, romantic, elegant... but must be cheap. Got any idea for me?"   Me : "Yeah! My next room. It has a single bed, air con and a table. You guys can start fucking in no time. Extremely romantic. Plus it's free. What more you want?"   Chean : "Aw, come on. Let's go to that beach you mentioned."   2 hours later - we were at East Coast. Chean promptly left me behind. Hand in hand with Jennifer, he sure was enjoying himself. I felt like a dog trailing my masters.   Chean : "So what's nice here?"   Me : "Well, we can rent some bicyles and tour around the beach!"   Chean : "No lar, I'm too tired after the trip. Maybe next time."   Me : "Okay, we can sit down then and sip some coffee."   Chean : "Ermm... I'm not thirsty yet."   Me : "Well, we can play a game of snooker then."   Chean : "Man I haven't touched a cue in ages."   Me : "What about arcade then?"   Chean : "How much a game?"   Me : "50 cents."   Chean : "Forget it. What else?"    Why do I even bother?    30 minutes later - They sat under a coconut tree.  Dinner time - We ate McDonald's. She paid.  Night time - We were 'supposed' to head out to a disco of sort.   Me : "Get ready guys, we're gonna party till morning."   Chean : "Darl, you wanna go disco later?"   Jen : "Anything my dear."   Chean : "I don't think it's a good idea. Sweden's playing Holland tonight. I CANNOT miss that!"   Me : "Well, we can go now, and still come back for the match."   Chean : "I'm tired man. I need my rest."   Me : "You already rested under the coconut tree!"   Chean : "Just wake me up later okay."   Chean proceeded into HER room. I was dumfounded. It wasn't supposed to be like this at all.    Flashback one week ago...    Chean : "So come night time we're going disco right?"   Me : "Don't worry man. I have everything planned."   Chean : "Like how?"   Me : "See. You and Jeniffer gonna spend the night at my place right?"   Chean : "Yup! I can't wait!"   Me : "So you're gonna  DO  it?"   Chean : "Hell, I don't know. We just started."   Me : "That's what I thought so too. Too soon. Anyway, in case your willy decides otherwise, I better find me a mate for the night too."   Chean : "Yup, you do that. We're going disco to find you a mate. It will be a night to remember! Me and Jeniffer. You and WHOEVER."   Me : "It's settled then. Make sure you bring enough cash to Singapore"   Chean : "Don't worry my friend. Everything's on me!"    Flashback now...    Chean with Jeniffer in their room. They switched off the light soon after. I paced the living hall for 15 minutes. My thoughts far far away in some distant disco dance hall - with sweaty babes and lots of booze.   Noises emated from THE room. That's it. Enough is enough. I went back to my own room, closed the door, tissue ready.... and fired Kazaa.   Epilogue:  Chean left Singapore the next day. Total expenses - $19.80.   Chean : "Thanks man. This trip was simple fabulous!"   Me : "Right. I'm sure it is - for you."   Chean : "But you know what?"   Me : "What?"   Chean : "You should change the bed. It's too small and it has that creaking sound."   Me : "Friend. Please don't ever come back."

       I wrote about Feisty Fiona about a month ago. Well, since then we became good friends, and now she's my god sister. I love her like my own sister. Anyway, the story about how we became so close is not what I wanna write about tonight. It's about her wanting to come down to Singapore to look for a  job . I was estatic of course of the news. But deep down I dread the experience that she will have to face when she lives here.  I know because I'm here for the last four and a half years already. I know what it's like to be a stranger in a foreign land. This article is dedicated to me, four years back...  It was year 2000, right after Chinese New Year. I was at KL train station, waiting for my train to come and fetch me to wonderland Singapore. I carried nothing but one luggage bag. It was weird. I was about to leave everything that I held dear in Malaysia, and everything that I ever needed fitted into just one bag.  Mom, my brother, my uncle, my ex-girlfriend and her auntie were there for my sending. Everyone gave me smiles but I knew they were sad to see me leave. God! I was sad to leave but it was a career choice I could not ignore. Good money, that was why..  My ex-girlfriend wore the strongest face that night. She cried her eyes out later that night. My train came, and I boarded. Minutes later, the train started moving. I waved outside the window, trying to catch last glimpses of my dear ones. Tears stung my eyes, but I had to hold them back. I had to be brave for them. The whole scene pretty much played like a soap opera. Leaving mom was dreadful. Leaving my ex-girlfriend was death itself. I loved her like I've never loved anyone before.  The train trudged further along, my dear ones no longer in sight. I waved my last goodbye and flashed my last smile. Tears rolled down my cheeks freely now. I didn't even bothered, didn't cared. I told myself "You're doing the right thing." But why do I feel so awful? How could money change the course of my life so drastically? That night, I swore an oath.  I would do my very best in Singapore. I would save every cent I earned. Because that was why I came. Without money, I would've sacrificed so many things for nothing. No... I will NOT come back until I've earned a decent living for me, and for my ex-girlfriend.  I slept that night, dreamt big dreams.   Morning came. And I found myself in Singapore already - at the train station. I haven't found a place to settle for the night yet. Sometimes when I think back, I guessed I must've been dead crazy to come to a foreign land without first settling accomodation. Well, I was only 23 at that time. Must've felt that I could do anything, that's why.  Bought myself a newspaper and started looking for a room for rent. Called up agents and landlords. I didn't have a handphone that time, so I was practically hogging the public phone for the whole afternoon. Many many hours later, I was getting worried. Nothing yet. I was dreading the feeling of sleeping at the train station that night. It was getting late. The sun was calling it a day.  Sometime in the evening, an agent called back at the public phone and told me there was a room that I might be interested in. I said yes immediately. He said to wait for me at Bukit Merah.  Where the fuck is that?  I told him I'll be there. Grabbed a cab and minutes later, we were speeding along the highway towards my soon-to-be new home.  Turned out the agent was a pretty nice guy. Thank god. We visited the unit. The landlady was a Chinese national, in her late thirties. The room was sparsely furnished. A double decker, a working desk, a cupboard, a small fan. Well, there was an air cond as well, but I had to pay fifty bucks more. The thought thrilled me a bit. I have never had air cond in my whole life before.  I paid my deposits and quickly went out to look for supplies - mattresses and stuff. The agent even followed me and helped me out with the shopping. I wondered why he was treating me so good, till he explained "My whole career as an agent, and I've never seen someone like you. Just dropped out of nowhere with nothing but a bag looking for a future. You got guts my son." I guess I should feel proud but I wasn't.   My future truly began from that fateful day onwards. But it was far from a fairy tale. In fact, it was a nightmare turned loose.  I thought my landlady was nice. Boy, how wrong was I? Till today, I couldn't figured out what I did that made her hate me so much. I felt worse than a prisoner. Her house rules just didn't made sense.  1) I can't use the house phone. Fair enough. 2) I can't on the air cond during day. Okay. 3) I can't use the washing machine. Hand wash. 4) I can't wash my clothes past 10 p.m. It disturbs her sleeping. 5) I can't use the water heater. Had to bathe cold water. 6) I must come back after 12 midnight. If not I'd be locked outside.  She was a pure bitch, and three months later I couldn't take it anymore. I told her I was moving out from that hell hole. I had zero life back then. My only entertainment was a CD player that I bought to keep my company during the nights. And I had only 2 CDs that time. So every night, it was either Jacky Cheung or Sandy Lam. Of course, I made my way to the pay phone every night to chat with my ex-girlfriend. She was the ONLY thing that kept me going at that point of time. We had plans, for her to come down to Singapore after her studies. One year.... I had to wait for one year before it happens. The thought of staying here all alone gave me shivers.  I had no place to stay after I moved out. So I stayed in the office. Boss was kind enough to let me stay in the office. Brought my mattress and all my other barang barang. I quickly became an instant celebrity - the Malaysian boy that had no place to stay. I bathed in the toilet every morning. It was shitty of course, but you know what. It still beat the crap out of staying with that bitch.  Two weeks later, my colleague offered my a bed at his place. Not really a bed, it was the sofa. I took it. And I moved all my stuff into his place at Holland Village. He was an Indian, and he had three other Indian housemates. I was the only Chinese there. It was the first time I stayed with four Indians under the same roof. It was fun. I met alot of other people from other countries because that house was actually a hostel for NUS students. Legally, I can't stay there because I was not studying at NUS. I was an illegal tenant, and I knew I had to go sooner or later.  Finally, I ended up at Grange Road, staying together with my other colleges. Two Malaysians and one Burmese. I rented the store room behind the kitchen because it was dead cheap. Only a hundred bucks a month. It had nothing though. No cupboard, no fan, no air cond, no table, just a light bulb on the ceiling. Not that you could put those things anyway. I could sit right in the middle, stretch my hands and touch all four corners of the room. My single size mattress filled the whole room. But I was happy. My own room at last....  And I stayed there mighty long. At least a year. I would've stayed much longer had not my housemates decide to move out. I saved hell alot of money that time. I kept a book to myself, writing out my expenses everyday. The days when I spent more than twenty bucks, my heart ached. I still recalled back then I used only about 800 bucks a month.  Work kept me busy most of the time. I didn't have time to think about stuff or even go shopping. But when the nights came, it was tough. The loneliness of it gripped me, its gnarled fingers raked at my soul. I cried many nights. I can bear with any hardship thrown at me but not this... not being alone. I switched off the light and darkness engulfed me. Pitch black. I have never felt so alone in my entire life. The feeling is so real, I can touch it. Me and loneliness soon became friends.  Of course, there was always a light within that never ceased to stop shining. It was the light of hope. The light of a beautiful dream. I ran it across my mind a thousand times. When my ex-girlfriend would one day come here and we will begin our lives together. Not one time that thought did not made me smile. I was working towards a goal, and that was all that mattered.  Eighteen months later, I bought myself a phone. My first phone ever. I'm still using it till now..  I don't think I could write more now. Perhaps, in another entry I shall bring closure to this story. For now, I want to be back at that small room, with the lights off, and my ex-girlfriend laying beside me. I think I can safely say that it was and still is my happiest moment. My dear, I loved you...   I know you loved me too.

       I was strolling along the walkways of Suntec City today when something caught my eye. One of those video stores was playing 'Transformers' - my favourite cartoon when I was young. My eyes transfixed on the screen, I stopped dead in my tracks when I saw what was transpiring on screen.  Galvatron (formerly Megatron):  Who disturbed my plasma bath?   Haha! What the fuck?! I almost choked myself to death. What the fuck is Galvatron doing with a  bath ? Next thing I knew I was laughing so hard, people started looking at me like they just saw Bozo.    "WHO DISTURBED MY PLASMA BATH?"

       I did something today which I've never done before in my whole entire life. I took a taxi to look for supper. Crazy isn't it? Well, listen to the story first.   It's 2 a.m. in the morning And my belly is complaining  I woke up in desperation Looking for a quick solution  Opened the kitchen cabinet Looking for a Maggi packet Turned out it's all empty Coz I ran out of money  So I sat there thinking Should I be out walking Maybe to 7-Eleven Where I can get something for under seven  But I'm sick of bread and peanut butter Makes my heart goes a wander Where else in this forsaken place should I ponder To satisfy my apparent hunger  Last I took my wallet and flagged a cabbie Told him I wanna go look for a quickie Mister cabbie said I looked sleepy I told him "I'm steady"  Meter starts and it's running like crazy My heart beats uneasily Bend here, bend there, it's already five forty I look at my money, soon to be his property  Ordered ban mian, stim! Ordered chicken wing, stim! Ordered milo 'peng', stim! Paid money, not so stim..  Belly satisfied, it was fun Looked at the time, I got stunned Better head home fast, I said If not tomorrow I sure dead

        Okay, I'm pissed... at  WOMEN! . Today is female bashing day, and with good reasons. For the past one whole bloody week, I have been going out on outings with various girls. We went to pubs, discos, movies, restaurants, karaokes... you name it, I've been there. And you know what?  None of you girls paid me shit.  All you girls do are wait for fools like me to call, chit chat a bit, wait for us to ask you out, say okay in some kind of  bochap  manner, dress up with your newest buy from This Fashion, put on same cheapo makeup you got Bugis, stuff twenty bucks into your pretty purse (only for dire emergency), dilly dally to make sure you're at least half an hour late, and....  smile when you see the guy coz you know he just got suckered big time, and he's gonna pay through his nose for as long as his weathered wallet can hold.  Not true?! To hell with you! I've been with enough girls to accumulate a statistical report that shows beyond any reasonable doubt that the female species are the biggest money sucker in this planet.  I swear to God, this is what I've been through. Wanna know how you girls suck money from us? Here, let me compile a list for you.  "Are you buying cigarettes? Can you buy me a Marlboro Menthol? Thanks"  $9.50   "Can you pay for my cover charge?"  $15.00   "I want Long Island"  $60.00!!   "Let's   share   a cab"  $12.00   "My friendssss coming down to join us for karaoke"  kill me please   And the worst type, just keep silent, pretend stupid.   Yah girls. I know what you're thinking. We are guys mah. We are supposed to pay what. I ask you back lor. "Who says so? Your parents teach you that?" Me? My parents teach me to be generous with limit.   I mean really, look at it from a practical standpoint. I'm 20+ and you're 20+. Both of us joined the workforce around the same time. Both of us earned probably the same amount of money. On what basis should the guy pay for every single shit while you girls save every penny for your makeups and accessories. Now I understand why so many of my guy friends are broke - not because they are gamblers or fashion freaks. Just because we are stupid.  And all the while females are preaching, crying, begging and pleading about  equality . In Singapore, you have equality in all manners - job, civil rights, blah blah. So why is it when it comes to just normal social outing, equality is thrown out the window? If we are equal, thus girls should share the cost as much as guys, does it not make sense?  Please don't preach to me about equality because you do NOT deserve it.  One word of advice. We guys don't mind that ten twenty bucks that you sucked from us. It's the attitude that pisses us off. Please don't think that every guy is trying to get you on bed. If that is the case, then go ahead, suck all you want. But if you are going out as friends, then treat your guys as you treat your girl friends. Don't treat us like an ATM machine. Do it once, and you would lose a good friend for the rest of your life. Not to mention a potentially great and loving boyfriend.  P.S - I know some girls are not like that. I assure you, you are rare like a diamond in a charcoal mine. It is you that I pay my respect. It is you that I will eventually love. But even you know that not many girls are like you. Word of advice: don't change.  I'm through with these outings. From now on, I'll save up my money and buy myself some pretty clothes and get a nice haircut.

       There's always a good reason why this blog was never updated. 99% of the time, the reason is always the same. I was back in Malaysia! For a good six days romp, no less. And as usual, everytime I came back to Singapore, things don't feel the same anymore. It's like a jaded kind of feeling where you don't know where you truly belong.
