      my question yesterday, although I never really asked anyone, was 4. Why does everything turn black when it gets burned? (you know, like the ashes...their always black...so yeah)  rite now im in computer apps. just typin some things like, what we want to change bout this class, and yeah...its....yeah.  damn me! im getting so confused now....i dont kno who i like, or who to like, or if its jsut one person i like so yeah...  i still dont kno  bout going trick or treating... and the halloween dance on november 1st...i think im gonna go, since my mom is a chaperone (Kill me now! :S) but i dont wanna be a loner. i havnt been able to talk to my friends to see whos goin....and nobodys asked me, haha, im so freakin dumb, no ones gonna ask me, plus theres no reason to ask someone since theres no fee for couples, its just 5 bucks w/o a costume, or 4 bucks w/a costume...how gay. i dont think im gonna dress up for that at all...i dont always like dressing up, specially for halloween, unless its worth it :p   well i wanted to type more, but i gotta do my assignments now, and by the time i'd be able to type, the bell will ring.  damn! he jsut caught me

       Inside   There’s no way for me to describe, The pain I’m feeling inside. My heart aches for what I don’t have. I can only hope, even though I have tried, To see if I can find someone to heal my pain inside. All of my friends seem to have someone. All my hope is killing me, I just want to be set free, From my aching heart. It’s tearing me apart when I’m with you, When I see you, I wish it were true. Why cant we be the ones holding hands? My tears fall freely, like the rain outside My emotions I do hide. No one knows the pain I feel inside, It makes me want to cry, These dark feelings inside. Please, don’t let my heart die! The sight of you keeps me alive. My emotions spin around like a beehive  Guide me, tell me what to do. My mind if full of hope, I don’t think ill be able to cope. I only survive because of you, But it would be better if my dreams could come true. Guide me, tell me what to do, Because I’m nothing without you!

      one of my poems. i wrote 6 poems in 3 days. poems are how i express my feelings, besides talking to my friends   Forever   I have no way to say my pain Since I can’t talk to my friends, you get the blame. It’s hateful, that’s true, I hate you, yes I do. All you want to do is make my life miserable, But I’d give it all for the rain and drizzle. You tear me within, Killing my grin, Killing my love within. It’s all thanks to you I can’t go through My life without a caring friend. They are more than you do, I’m sure it’s true. My friends love me; Their love is stronger than the sea. Unlike you, they care; Are as protective as a bear. Love me as strong as rocks, Guard me like cops. They’ve always been there, When no one else cared. So here’s to you, my dad: Leave me alone, my friends care, They won’t hurt me, they won’t tear, My heart to pieces. They wont break my should with hate, But mend it with fate. They won’t cuss at me for explaining, But stand with me, even if it’s raining. They’re always there, Because they forever care.  this one was when i was especially mad at my dad

      more poems n songs....    She couldn't stand the silence,  She couldn't stand the tears,  She couldn't stand her life,  After only sixteen years.   He was her entire world,  She gave him all she possesed,  He did the same in return,  They were thought to be obsessed.   Their love couldn't be reached,  Couldn't be touched by any other,  They were all they needed,  They only wanted each other.   From two they became one,  They made each other whole,  They filled each other's voids,  They filled each other's souls.   Everything was perfect,  Everything was great,  Till one damning day,  They were told they'd have to wait.   Her parents were moving her,  To a distant place,  They'd be torn apart,  Couldn't see each other's face.   They swore they'd make it work,  Vowed to stay together,  Didn't care about the distance,  They'd be toghether forever.   She gave it all she had,  She did her very best,  But he still slipped away,  He didn't pass the test.   While she was thinking of him,  He had found another,  He said he couldn't do it,  He talked it over with his mother.   She was devestated,  Her heart was torn straight out,  She'd been such a fool,  She should have listened to her doubt.   From then on they stopped talking,  Never spoke again,  While he was with his new girl,  She was dreaming of him.   Every day she'd cry,  She tried to fight off all the pain,  But the hurting never stopped,  Just shot through every vein.   Months went by since the ending,  But she only grew worse,  She couldn't accept what happened,  This was love's curse.   It finally overtook her,  She couldn't stand it anymore,  She grabbed a picture of him,  And snuck out the front door.   She walked into the woods,  Found a secluded place,  Kept thinking of the past,  And how she'd been replaced.   Hours later she was found,  In a pool of her blood,  And beside her they found,  His picture in the mud.   On the back read her reason,  Why she took her life,  What he did to her,  It seemed he had held the knife.   Though physically he didn't kill her,  He tore her soul apart,  It was obvious how she did,  It was from a broken heart.   - Friends Are Friends Forever ~  Packing up the dreams, God planted In the fertile soil of you I can’t believe the hopes He’s granted Means a chapter in your life is due But we’ll keep you close as always It won’t even seem you’ve gone ‘Cuz our hearts in big as always We’ll keep the love that keeps us strong. And friends are friend forever, if the Lords a lord of them. And a friend will not say never, ‘cuz the welcome will never end. Oh its hard to let you go, in the Father’s hands we know, that a lifetimes not too long, to live as friends. And with the faith and love, God’s given Springing from the hope, we know We will pray with joy, you live in Is the strength that now, gives you But we’ll keep you close, as always It won’t even seem you’ve gone. ‘Cuz our hearts in big, as always We’ll keep the love that keeps us strong. And friends are friend forever, if the Lords a lord of them. And a friend will not say never, ‘cuz the welcome will never end. Though its hard to let you go, in the Father’s hands we know, that a lifetimes not too long, to live as friends. And friends are friend forever, if the Lords a lord of them. And the friend will not say never, ‘cuz the welcome will never end. Though it’s hard to let you go, in the Father’s hands we know, that a lifetimes not too long, to live as friends…to live as friends! Though it’s hard to let you go, in the Father’s hands we know, that a lifetime’s not too long to live as friends. No a lifetime’s not too long…to live as friends… (this is like, my fav song)     Have you ever wondered which hurts the most? Saying something and wishing you hadn't?, or Saying nothing and wishing you had?  I guess the most important things are the hardest things to say.Don't be afraid to tell someone you love them.  If you do, they might break your heart...if you don't, you might break theirs.  Have u ever decided not 2 become a couple because you were so afraid of losing what you already had with that person?  Your heart decides whom it likes and whom it doesn't. You can't tell your heart what to do. It does it on its own........when you least suspect it, or even when you don't want it to.  Have you ever wanted to love someone with everything you had, but that other person was too afraid to let you?  Too many of us stay walled up because we are too afraid to care too much...for fear that the other person does not care as much, or even at all.  Have you ever denied your feelings for someone because your fear of rejection was too hard to handle?  We tell lies when we are afraid... afraid of what we don't know, afraid of what others will think, afraid of what will be found out about us. But every time we tell a lie, the thing we fear grows stronger.  Life is all about risks and it requires you to jump.  Don't be a person who has to look back and wonder what they would have done, or could  have had.  * What would you do if every time you fell in love you had to say good-bye?  *What would you do if every time you wanted someone they would never be there?  *What would you do if your best friend died tomorrow and you never got to tell them how you felt? (even if it is that you don't care anymore) *What would you do if you loved someone more than ever and you couldn't have them?  *What would you do if you never got the chance to say I am friends with all of my family and they know I love them?*  People live, but people die.  I want to tell you that you are a friend.  If you died tomorrow (God Forbid) you would bein my heart. Would I be in yours?  If you care about me as much as I care about you   you will send this back  You might be best friends one year, pretty good friends the next year, don't talk that often the next, and don't want to talk at all the year after that.   So, I just wanted to say, even if I never talk to you again in my life, you are special to me and you have made a difference in my life,   I look up  to you, respect you, truly cherish you , most of all I  CARE about friends   Send this to all your friends, no matter how often you talk, or how close you are, and send it to the person who sent it to you.    Let old friends know you haven't forgotten them, and tell new friends you never will.    Remember, everyone needs a friend someday you might feel like you have  NO FRIENDS at all, just remember this and take comfort in knowing  somebody out there cares about you and .. always will..   I care about  YOU !!

       These are some songs or parts of songs n stuff like that, n quotes n stuff...I'll have more later toos!    I’m glad we’re on this one-way street, just you and I…just you and I! I’m never going to say goodbye, ‘Cause I never want to see you cry. I swear to be your friend, and a friend I will remain. And I swear it all over again.  I’m never going to treat you bad. ‘Cause I never want to see you sad. I swear to share your joy and your pain And I swear it all over again.    Life for Rent  I haven’t ever really found a place that I call home I never stick around quite long enough to make it I apologize that once again im not in love But its not as if I mind that your heat aint exactly breaking Its just a though, only a thought  But if my life is for rent and I don’t learn to buy Well I deserve nothing more than I get Cos nothing I have is truly mine  I’ve always thought that I would love to live by the sea To travel the world alone and live more simply I have no idea what’s happened to that dream Cos there’s really nothing left here to stop me It’s just a thought, only a thought  But if my life is for rent and I don’t learn to buy Well I deserve nothing more than I get Cos nothing I have is truly mine  If my life is for rent and I don’t learn to buy Well I deserve nothing more than I get Cos nothing I have is truly mine  While my heart is a shield and I wont let it down While I am so afraid to fail so I won’t even try Well how can I say I’m alive  But if my life is for rent and I don’t learn to buy Well I deserve nothing more than I get Cos nothing I have is truly mine  If my life is for rent and I don’t learn to buy Well I deserve nothing more than I get Cos nothing I have is truly mine, Cos nothing I have is truly mine Cos nothing I have is truly mine… Cos nothing I have is truly mine…..   *Climb high, climb far, your goal the sky, your aim the stars*    Moving On  Every day and night, I wonder why things happen the way they do. And I wonder what purpose they serve in my life. As I ponder, my mind begins to wander, jutting to different things. My mind swirls fiercely, and my feelings are mixed. Sometimes I wonder if I’ll really know what’s going on, what’s going to happen. I’m moving on, Its got to happen. Left and right my friends are leaving, not to mention my depression. I’m moving on. Things change, yes they do, Moving on is all I am capable of. And moving on is what I must do. My memory holds previous moments, but there are still pieces missing. But I've got to move on, because the world around my is changing, Changing faster than I thought. My life seems hard. It seems pointless to do what I do. My mind is foggy and unsure, and I’m stumbling around in the dark. My life is changing and I need a steady hand to guide me through. To guide me through this world and my life, my changing life. Somebody, help me move on, help me change. Somebody… (written by me)    white flag  i know you think that i shouldn’t sill love you or tell you that but if i didn’t say it well i’d still have felt it, where’s the sense in that i promise i’m not trying to make your life harder or return to where we were, but  i will go down with this ship, and i wont put my hands up and surrender there will be no white flag above my door. i’m in love and always will be.  i know i left too much mess and destruction to come back again and i cause nothing but trouble; i understand if you can’t talk to me again and if you live by the rules of its over then i’m sure that that makes sense but  i will go down with this ship, and i wont put my hands up and surrender there will be no white flag above my door. i’m in love and always will be.  and when we meet, which i’m sure we will all that was there, will be there still i’ll let it pass, and hold my tongue and you will think, that i’ve moved on  i will go down with this ship, and i wont put my hands up and surrender there will be no white flag above my door. i’m in love and always will be.  i will go down with this ship, and i wont put my hands up and surrender there will be no white flag above my door. i’m in love and always will be.  i will go down with this ship, and i wont put my hands up and surrender there will be no white flag above my door. i’m in love and always will be

      Ah...I've told a few people who I like now...so I guess it's not much of a secret, but it still is...so yeah.  I went to the Halloween dance...It wasn't the best, but I guess it beats sitting at home alone, or actually with my annoying sister, for around three hours, or more. Dang...I danced with Bucky....haha, I'm so surprised...then there was this other dude there, named Gage I think, who like, suddenly liked me or something, and I just met him at the dance, so yeah. It's all messed up, lol.  Woo Hoo! My best bud got his new computer! I missed him so much :D lolz, even tho he goes to school, I don't usually see him, but anways, I'm so happy! I cried last night b/c I realized how lucky I was to have him as a friend, as well as other people.  Oh yeah, it was Tamara, Chris, and bucky, who talked me into going to the dance...but guess what, my mom was a chaperone...so yeah, besides that minor detail it was ok  oh darn, bells about to ring, gotta go

       wandering eyes   eyes can hold so much they can tell so little eyes do say a bunch they will never play second fiddle they might tell a deep dark story contro a dear ones love tell of fame & glory be as kind as a dove ease the pain in anothers eye sooth the fear one feels they don't let an oppertunity pass by but help seal so many deals eyes have done so much eyes filled with so much love they seem to have a special touch that's been sent from above   just what it says, its explaining some thing eyes can do...i suppose

       Slowly & Swiftly   Pain hurts us every day Pain pulls us every way Pain that maks our hearts turn Pain that makes our stomaches churn Pain that strangles our personality Pain that kills us mentally Pain that taught our heart to fear Pain that made our eyes tear Pain that ended life so quickly Pain that came slowly & swiftly  I wrote this sunday, nov. 16, around midnight...i was sorta upset with my mom, hehe

       Triple L   (Live, Love, Laugh)   It's all just a memory. His sandy hair, his cherry lips, brown eyes fair, voice full of tips. Hands so stead,  he so willing ever ready, love so filling. It's all just a memory. Full of knowledge so much to know he went to college I knew he would go. He spoke to me, words worth a lot words kind and loving full of thought, always sriving, It's all just a memory. "Live well," he first said "Laugh often," were one of the best "Love much - " I wish he wern't dead but he passed Heaven's test It's all just a memory. Every day I heed hsi words, every day I miss him, every day I watch the birds, oh how I miss him... It's all just a memory.   okay, no one has died in my family (Cept my great grandma, hehe) so dont worry. i jus wrote this poem cuz i read a book that had a boy who's brother died, and yea, so i thought that would be a good poem, lol, and i like the saying, "Live well, Laugh often, Love much." ehe

      my favorite poem of all the poems i've written...its about my friendship, and its true! some of it may involve more than just my frienship, like around the world, or i dunno, but its also related to frienship   Behind the Scenes   My friends are all that matter My feelings are all splattered People killing, people dying People crying, I'm crying So much is going on with me But compared to some others, it's noting We should practice what we preach We need to learn to turn the other cheek My life spins around like a hurricane The heart of it all is my pain I'm not sure if I'll ever be the same I'm not looking for any fame But my friends keep me steady They help me - they keep me ready I'm there for them always No matter how the future lays If ever they call me, if ever they need me I'll drop everything, you just see No matter their life, they care No matter our pain, we both share Being there for eachother is our job I'm not going to act like a sob   (he, dorky, but i couldnt think of what rhyms with job)  No matter what you're going through I'm here for you You've been here for me I hope this'll always be My friends are all that matter   i mainly wrote this poem with one person in mind, but ive been finding other friendships with other people that fit this poem also, but this poem is still mainly for  (or about)   (me and) my best bud

       Inside   There's no way for me to describe, the pain I'm feeling inside. My heart aches for what I don't have. I can only hope, even though I have tried, to see if I can find someone to heal my pain inside. All of my friends seem to have someone. All my hoping is killing me, I just want to be set free, from my aching heart. It's tearing me apart when I'm with you, When I see you, I wish it were true. Why can't we be the ones holding hands? My tears fall freely, like the rain outside, My emotions I do hide. No one knows the pain I feel insdie, It makes me want to cry, These dark feelings insdie. Please, don't let my heart die! The sight of you keeps me alive, My emotions spin around like a beehive. Guide me, tell me waht to do. My mind is full of hope, I don't think I'll be able to cope. I only survive because of you, But it would be better if my dreams could come true. Guide me, help me, tell me what to do, Because I am nothing without you!   yeah, on this one...i sorta had a big crush on someone, and im not saying any names..but yea, cuz someone told me something, then they told him something they wernt supposed to, then i heard something else, so i was sorta unsure...but yea

       The Pain Their Causing Me   Why do they hurt me like this Why do they want to see me cry What's the poitn of this painful bliss What's the point of asking 'why' Why do they like to see me torn apart Why do they like to see me cringe What's the point of hurting my heart What's unclear about me, a 'squeaky hinge' Why do they punish me Why can't I escape them What makes them see the joy in the 'condemmed' Why can't I make them see,  The pain their causing me ...

      hum....what shall i type today? uh...nothing really...dum de dum....Oh, i counted how many poems i've written, and i've written like 18...wow...and that's been within the last month, or two, or whatever...but the only way i can actually write successful poems is if im havin a strong emotion, like being mad at someone...the majority of my poems are from when i was mad...so yupperz....  anyways, here are some nice quotes i've "gathered' hehe:    I love you not because of who you are, but because of who I am when I am with you...  No man or woman is worth your tears, and the one who is, wont make you cry…  Just because someone doesn’t love you the way you want them to, doesn’t mean they don’t love you with all they have...  A true friend is someone who reaches for you hand and touches your heart  The worst way to miss someone is to be sitting right beside them knowing you cant have them...  Never frown, even when you are sad, because you never know who is falling in love with your smile  To the world you may be one person, but to one person you may be the world…  Don’t waste your time on a man/woman, who isn’t willing to waste their time on you  Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before we meet the right one so that when we finally meet the person, we will know how to be grateful ((- - - - - to all my friends who read this! I've got a good example! *ahem* me and creston...hehe...yeah, i met the wrong person, but i still havnt met the rite one! - - - - - ))  Don’t cry because its over, smile because it happened  There’s always going to be people that hurt you so what you have to do is keep on trusting and just be more careful about who you trust next time around  Make yourself a better person and know who you are before you to and know someone else and expect them to know you  Don’t try so hard, the best things come when you least expect them to  True friends remember whatever happens, happens for a reasons  How many people actually have 8 true friends???? Hardly anyone I know! But some of us have all right friends and good friends!!!  A friend is someone who bails you out of jail – a best friend is the one sitting nex to you saying “boy was that fun”  Don’t betray an old friend, a new one isn’t worth as much  The only way to have a friend is to be one  Life without a friend is death without a witness  A friend is someone who sees through you and still enjoys the view  Friends don’t let friends drive naked!  One does not make friends, one recognizes them  I had a friend who was a clown. When he died, all his friends went in one car.

      haha, the old guy trying to snow board! hahaha     When you're 47 years old, you sometimes hear a small voice inside you that says: "Just because you've reached middle age, that doesn't mean you shouldn't take on new challenges and seek new adventures. You get only one ride on this crazy carousel we call life, and by golly you should make the most of it."  This is the voice of Satan.  I know this because recently, on a mountain in Idaho, I listened to this voice, and as a result my body feels as though it has been used as a trampoline by the Budweiser Clydesdales.  I am currently on an all-painkiller diet. "I'll have a black coffee and 250 Advil tablets" is a typical breakfast order for me these days.  This is because I went snowboarding.  For those of you who, for whatever reason, such as a will to live, do not participate in downhill winter sports, I should explain that snowboarding is an activity that is popular with people who do not feel that regular skiing is lethal enough.  These are of course young people, fearless people, people with 100 percent synthetic bodies who can hurtle down a mountainside at 50 miles per hour and knock down mature trees with their faces and then spring to their feet and go, "Cool."  People like my son. He wanted to try snowboarding, and I thought it would be good to learn with him, because we can no longer ski together.  We have a fundamental difference in technique: He skis via the Downhill Method, in which you ski down the hill; whereas I ski via the Breath-Catching Method, in which you stand sideways on the hill, looking as athletic as possible without actually moving muscles (this could cause you to start sliding down the hill).  If anybody asks if you're OK, you say, "I'm just catching my breath!" in a tone of voice that suggests that at any moment you're going to swoop rapidly down the slope; whereas in fact you're planning to stay right where you are, rigid as a statue, until the spring thaw.  At night, when the Downhillers have all gone home, we Breath-Catchers will still be up there, clinging to the mountainside, chewing on our parkas for sustenance.  So I thought I'd take a stab at snowboarding, which is quite different from skiing.  In skiing, you wear a total of two skis, or approximately one per foot, so you can sort of maintain your balance by moving your feet, plus you have poles that you can stab people with if they make fun of you at close range.  Whereas with snowboarding, all you get is one board, which is shaped like a giant tongue depressor and manufactured by the Institute of Extremely Slippery Things. Both of your feet are strapped firmly to this board, so that if you start to fall, you can't stick a foot out and catch yourself. You crash to the ground like a tree and lie there while skiers swoop past and deliberately spray snow on you.  Skiers hate snowboarders. It's a generational thing. Skiers are (and here I am generalizing) middle-aged Republicans wearing designer space suits; snowboarders are defiant young rebels wearing deliberately drab clothing that is baggy enough to cover the snowboarder plus a major appliance. Skiers like to glide down the slopes in a series of graceful arcs; snowboarders like to attack the mountain, slashing, spinning, tumbling, going backward, blasting through snowdrifts, leaping off cliffs, getting their noses pierced in midair, etc.  Skiers view snowboarders as a menace; snowboarders view skiers as Elmer Fudd.  I took my snowboarding lesson in a small group led by a friend of mine named Brad Pearson, who also once talked me into jumping from a tall tree while attached only to a thin rope.  Brad took us up on a slope that offered ideal snow conditions for the novice who's going to fall a lot: Approximately seven flakes of powder on top of an 18-foot-thick base of reinforced concrete.  You could not dent this snow with a jackhammer. (I later learned, however, that you COULD dent it with the back of your head.)  We learned snowboarding via a two step method:   Step One: Watching Brad do something.  Step Two: Trying to do it ourselves.  I was pretty good at Step One. The problem with Step Two was that you had to stand up on your snowboard, which turns out to be a violation of at least five important laws of physics.  I'd struggle to my feet, and I'd be wavering there and then the Physics Police would drop a huge chunk of gravity on me, and WHAM my body would hit the concrete snow, sometimes bouncing as much as a foot.  "Keep your knees bent!" Brad would yell, helpfully.  Have you noticed that whatever sport you're trying to learn, some earnest person is always telling you to keep your knees bent? As if that would solve anything. I wanted to shout back, "Forget my Knees! Do Something About these Gravity Chunks!"  Needless to say my son had no trouble at all. None. In minutes he was cruising happily down the mountain; you could actually see his clothing getting baggier. I, on the other hand, spent most of my time lying on my back, groaning, while space-suited Republicans swooped past and sprayed snow on me.  If I hadn't gotten out of there, they'd have completely covered me; I now realize that the small hills you see on ski slopes are formed around the bodies of 47-year-olds who tried to learn snowboarding.  So I think, when my body heals, I'll go back to skiing. Maybe sometime you'll see me out on the slopes, catching my breath. Please throw me some food.

      haha! this is such a funny joke     She's New To Football  A guy took his girlfriend to her first football game. Afterward he asked her how she liked the game.  "I liked it, but I couldn't understand why they were killing each other for 25 cents, " she said.  "What do you mean?" he asked.  "Well, everyone kept yelling, 'Get the quarter back!'"

      one day there was this brown hair, brown eye girl walking down the side of the road.  a guy in a blue truck was driving by, and he pulled over.  "what are you doing?"  he asked, she looked at him, and shook her head.  "you wouldnt understand."  she then walked a little faster, but the guy kept driving beside her.  "just try telling me" the girl sighed, and stopped. "alright. someone called, and asked if Ridge was home, and i said how was i supposed to know, and then they started lauging, and said, 'is he running' and i looked in the kitchen and said yea, and turned away, and then the person said, 'you better go catch him! he just ran away, he's heading down the street." so then i ran out the door and i've been walking down the street the whole day." the guy looked at her, then laughed. the girl frowned and turned away from him.  "i knew you would laugh! i'll never find Ridge!" the guy shook his head.  "i'm sorry, its just that, if Ridge was running, wouldnt you have to run to catch him?" the girl looked at him, and smiled, but then frowned again. "The only thing i cant figure out though, is how he got out the door, down the steps, and ran down the street!" The guy was puzzled. "well he opened the door, walked down the steps, and then began to run.." he said, now utterly confused. the girl let out another loud sigh. "you Just DON'T understand! Ridge is my grandmother's refrigerator!"     Haha....me so funny....ehehe, i made that up :p lol, its sorta gay actually...

       here's another blonde joke...   A man was in his front yard mowing grass when his blonde neighbor came out of the house and went straight to the mail box. She opened it, then slammed it shut, and stormed back in the house.  A little later she came out of her house and again went to the mail box and again opened it, then slammed it shut again. Angrily, back into the house she went.  As the man was getting ready to edge the lawn, here she came out again, marched to the mail box, opened it and then slammed it closed harder than ever.  Puzzled by her actions the man asked her, "Is something wrong?"  The blonde replied, "There certainly is! My stupid computer keeps giving me a message saying, 'You've got mail!'

       hahaha, im finding some good jokes...     A blonde, brunette and red-head where driving down the road, when a cop starts to chase them.  Speeding off, they crash into the side of a barn, immediately jump out of the car and hide under potato sacks.  The cop charges in after them and comes across the first potato sack, where the brunette is hiding under. He kicks it and the brunette says, "MEEEEOOOOOOW." "Oh!", the cop says, "it's just a stupid cat."  He then moves to the potato sack the red-head is under and kicks it. The red-head replies, "WOOF, WOOF." The cop, angry now, says, "STUPID DOG!!"  Then the cop gets to the potato sack the blonde is under, he kicks it with great force and the blonde screams,  ...."POOOOOTAAAAATOOOOOO!"

      "A little girl had been shopping with her Mom in Wal-Mart. She must have been 6 years old, this beautiful red haired, freckle faced image of innocence. It was pouring outside. The kind of rain that gushes over the top of rain gutters, so much in a hurry to hit the earth it has no time to flow down the spout. We all stood there under the awning and just inside the door of the Wal-Mart.     We waited, some patiently, others irritated because nature messed up their hurried day. I am always mesmerized by rainfall. I got lost in the sound and sight of the heavens washing away the dirt and dust of the world. Memories of runn ing, splashing so carefree as a child came pouring in as a welcome reprieve from the worries of my day.     The little voice was so sweet as it broke the hypnotic trance we were all caught in "Mom, let's run through the rain," she said.     "What?" Mom asked.     "Let 's run through the rain!" She repeated.     "No, honey. We'll wait until it slows down a bit," Mom replied.     This young child waited about another minute and repeated: "Mom, let's run through the rain,"     "We'll get soaked if we do," Mom said.     "No, we won't, Mom. That's not what you said this morning," the young girl said as she tugged at her Mom's arm.     This morning? When did I say we could run through the rain and not get wet?     "Don't you remember? When you were talking to Daddy about his cancer, you said, 'If God can get us through this,   he can get us through anything!"     The entire crowd stopped dead silent. I swear you couldn't hear anything but the rain. We all stood silently. No one came or left in the next few minutes.     Mom paused and thought for a moment about wh at she would say Now some would laugh it off and scold her for being silly. Some might even ignore what was said. But this was a moment of affirmation in a young child's life. A time when innocent trust can be nurtured so that it will bloom into faith.     "Honey, you are absolutely right. Let's run through the rain. If GOD let's us get wet, well maybe we just needed washing," Mom said.     Then off they ran. We all stood watching, smiling and laughing as they darted past the cars and yes, through the puddles. They held their shopping bags over their heads just in case. They got soaked. But they were followed by a few who screamed and laughed like children all the way to their cars.     And yes, I did I ran. I got wet. I needed washing."    Circumstances or people can take away your material possessions, they can take away your money, and they can take away your health. But no one can ever take away your precious memories...So, don't forget to make t ime and take the opportunities to make memories everyday. To everything   there is a season and a time to every purpose under heaven.     I hope you still take the time to run through the rain... (( I DO!  _,.-'`i LUV the rain!`'-.,_    They say it takes a minute to find a special person, an hour to appreciate them, a day to love them, but then an entire life to forget them.    Take the time to live!!!     Keep in touch with your friends, you never know when   you'll need each other -- and don't forget to run in the rain!      God makes everything but unbreakable hearts.

      THIS one is about tears...YAY, ehe, I mean..aw..well, I like the rain, so yea   Thousands of songs have been composed about tears and almost every movie worth remembering stimulates their flow. We cry for all different reasons...whenever what we're feeling transcends what language can do. Whenever we honor experiences that go beyond words like music or sunsets, or attend funerals and weddings and lately patriotic ceremonies, or become involved in an episode of Dawson's Creek, or close the car door on our finger, we cry. Our parents cry at events that mark the passage of time....award ceremonies, recitals and graduations.  There are also reflex tears that occur when our eyes are irritated or sore. They help keep our eyes moist and lubricated and flush out things that aren't supposed to be in there like dust and grit But no matter what causes the waterworks, these salty, watery secretions have some interesting facts behind them. Read on.  The use of our vocal cords comes shortly after birth in the act of crying. That signals that a newborn's lungs are functional.  Male and female babies cry about the same amount, yet by their teenage years, that's no longer true. This leads psychologists to feel adult crying behavior is mostly a learned response, with kids adopting the crying behavior of their same sex parent.  Girls cry five times more frequently than boys...and their tears tend to stream down their faces while boys' usually well up in their eyes.  Sadness, followed by anger, sympathy and fear are the reasons most adults give for crying.  A happy cry averages two minutes; a sad cry averages seven minutes.  Humans are the only animals positively known to cry emotional tears of sadness and joy.  People tend to feel better after they cry leading researchers to believe tears help the body alleviate stress and cleanse itself of stress.  Boys are more likely to cry as a result of positive feelings, like at sporting events.  Girls are more likely to cry as a result of negative feelings, like personal conflicts.  It's the sulfuric compounds in onions that bring tears to our eyes.  To cut down on crying, chill the onion and cut into the root end of the onion last.Our tear ducts are the tiny little holes in the corners of our eyes nearest our nose.  Most of our tears run down these "drainpipes," back into the nose. That's why we get runny noses when we cry.  Some whales have tear ducts that secrete grease rather than water.  A crocodile really does produce tears but they're not due to sadness. Their tears are glandular secretions that work to get rid of excess salt from their eyes. That's where the expression "crocodile tears," signifying false tears, comes from.  In space, astronauts cannot cry because there is no gravity so the tears can't flow..  Tears contain the same proportion of salt as blood does. They also are made up of glucose, enzymes, hormones, oils, mucous, minerals and antibodies that protect the eyes from infection.  Emotional tears contain 24% more protein than reflex tears, leading doctors to believe we are ridding our body of excess stress hormones, which may be why we feel better after a good cry.

      I found this interesting...and I like to laugh, so ehe   Whether overheard in the cafeteria, hooted during the noisy chatter of friends or noticed as the overly enthusiastic laugh track on your favorite TV program, laughter is a fundamental part of everyday life. Because it's so pervasive, we tend to forget how strange and important it actually is. Somehow we just laugh, without consciously knowing why we do it. Truth is, the familiar "ho-hos" and "hee-hees" are part of a universal vocabulary, used and recognized by people all over the world. For a behavior that's so common, it's amazing how little we understand about laughter's meaning and purpose. What we do know is that ultimately laughter is an expression of emotion...joy, surprise, nervousness and amusement. In the hopes of unraveling the details of this innate behavior, here are some funky facts.  Did you know...  There are three main categories of humor which makes us laugh...verbal humor involving the use of words as in jokes and puns, visual humor which relies on images like cartoons and the way someone looks, and physical humor which uses actions, like in slapstick comedy.  Although we think that laughter comes from an audience after something funny is said by a speaker, in actuality, the speaker laughs almost 50% more than the audience.  Only 10-20% of the laughter witnessed in a recent study followed something funny being said. That shows that it is the other person, the relationship, not the words, that stimulate the laughs.  Laughter is 30 times more frequent in a social setting than when we're alone. This shows that laughter is a signal we send to others and it disappears when there's no one else around.Laughter is extremely difficult to control consciously. Ask a friend to laugh. She probably can't on command.  Females tend to do more of the laughing (126% more) and males tend to do most of the laugh getting. Chances are the class clown will be a boy.  When it comes to what men and women look for in a mate, women seek out a sense of humor and men are more likely to offer one. So girls look for men to make them laugh and boys are eager to fulfill that request.  Laughter is contagious. If you've ever experienced a case of the giggles, you know how spontaneous and hard to control laughing can be. Even canned laughter on TV laugh tracks has been shown to make viewers laugh as if they were part of a live audience.  Although laughter did not evolve to make us feel good or improve our health, scientists have found that it raises our heart rate and blood pressure and helps temper intense pain. While it might not be "the best medicine," surgery patients who watched comedic videos requested fewer aspirin and tranquilizers than another group who watched dramas.  The energetic activity of laughter encourages creativity. By loosening up our mental gears, it fosters out-of-the-ordinary ways of looking at things.  Humor is intensely personal. You might find Jim Carrey hilarious while your friend thinks Mike Meyers is the funniest and your brother laughs the hardest at South Park. We can know someone really well and find what he or she laughs at surprising.  By the time a child reaches kindergarten, he or she is laughing some 300 times a day. Sorry to say that by the time that kid grows up and becomes an adult, he or she will laugh only about 17 times a day.When we go to the doctor, we laugh about four times during our visit and 70% of the time the doctor doesn't laugh back!  Men will laugh more if they know their audience well, while women laugh more in the presence of men. Both are attempting to subtly shape others' responses.  Although the healing power of laughter is still being debated, the stress levels of students who recently participated in a study were shown to significantly lower after watching a humorous movie.

      He won the Preakness Stakes! Yay! He only has to win the Belmont Stakes to have all three stones for the Triple Crown! The last Triple Crown winner was Affirmed, (1978) and before that, Seattle Slew (1977) But both are dead now, so there is no Triple Crown winner at the moment. GO SMARTY! hehe...I think he'll win! Not only did he win the Preakness (the one he just won) by 12 lengths (thats A LOT, considering one length = 20 ft) well..enuf horse talk, i bet anyone who reads this has no idea what in heck i'm talking about...

      "Grace Like Rain"  By: Todd Angew  Amazing grace how sweet the sound That saved a wretch like me I once was lost but now I'm found Was blind but now I see So clearly  Hallelujah, grace like rain falls down on me Hallelujah, all my stains are washed away, washed away  T'was grace that thought my heart to fear And grace my fear relieved How precious did that grace appear The hour I first believed  Hallelujah, grace like rain falls down on me Hallelujah, all my stains are washed away, washed away  When we've been here ten thousand years Bright shining as the sun We've no less days to sing Your praise Then when we first begun  Hallelujah, grace like rain falls down on me Hallelujah, all my stains are washed away, washed away  Hallelujah, grace like rain falls down on me Hallelujah, all my stais are washed away, washed away  All my stains are washed away, washed away.   (I'm not quite sure about the end part...that's what Chris said, but oh well.)

      I just wanted to say that the facts I had on my last post aren't all true. Thanks to the person who commented. I'm sorry if they're wrong, but truthfully I have no control over that. Pssssh, phony sites, I wonder why they say such wrong things. Once again, my apologies to those who might've been affected by the so called "facts."  &nbsp;

      here are some 'facts' i found on  urlLink www.hookedonfacts.com &nbsp;   &nbsp; In the next seven days, 800 Americans will be injured by their jewelry.  Frogs can't swallow without blinking.  The only king without a moustache in a deck of cards is the king of hearts.  All the gold ever mined could be molded into a cube 60 feet high and 60 feet wide.  When Heinz ketchup leaves the bottle, it travels at a rate of 25 miles per year.  There are three golf balls sitting on the moon.  Fifteen people are known to have been crushed to death tilting vending machines towards them in the hope of a free can of soda.  Only 55% of Americans know that the sun is a star.  Pontius Pilate was born in Scotland.   Poll results: Nachos is the food most craved by mothers-to-be.  One in three snake bite victims is drunk. One in five is tatooed.   The storage capacity of human brain exceeds 4 Terrabytes.&nbsp;   (What are eterrabytes?)       &nbsp; Babies start dreaming even before they're born.  X-rays of the Mona Lisa show that there are three completely different versions of the same subject, all painted by Leonardo Da Vinci, under the final portrait.  In one day an average person will take about 18,000 steps.   28.1% of people pee in the pool!  45.2% of people pee in the shower  The higher the income, the more likely an American man will cheat on his wife.  In Florida, It is illegal to sing in a public place while attired in a swimsuit.  Drew Carey once worked at Denny's.  A frog can't empty its stomach by vomitting. To empty its stomach contents, a frog throws up it's stomach first, so the stomach is dangling out of it's mouth. Then the frog uses its forearms to dig out all of the stomach's contents and then swallows the stomach back down again.   (ew...what if people were like that?)       &nbsp; Mark Twain didn't even make it through elementary school.  160 cars can drive side by side on the Monumental Axis in Brazil, the world's widest road.  Ants don't sleep.  Malaysians protect their babies from disease by bathing them in beer.   (beer battered babies?)       &nbsp;  well I"m gonna stap there...gotta go call Zack now...yay! lols

      She wipes the webs from her mind, Takes off her blind. Steps through the light, To face another lonely night. &nbsp; She pushes the shadows away; Prays for a good day; Locks her misery behind the door; Throws the key at the floor. &nbsp; Watches her pain melt away, Crumble up, and decay. Lifts her face to the sky, As she wipes the tears from her eye. &nbsp; She's starting her life over, Crawling from her cover. Lifting hands, giving praise, As she thanks God for this new day... &nbsp;   (copywrite Emma Helligso 2004 - all rights reserved)   &nbsp;

So yea... &nbsp; ok, so to get away from the sad part of my day/week or wateber,  I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL CHRISTMAS BREAK!!!!  yAyAyAYaYaYa!!!! That's when Z (Zack)&nbsp;is comin to visit!
