      So I have a new boss.  I am not sure if this changes my world yet or not.  He seems like he would be okay.  But I fear the minions will get to him.  We have two gargoyles here that love to do the power play thing and kiss up and horn in and steal everyone else's glory so that they seem as if they walk on water and the rest, well, we are all just garbage.  It is a shame.  I prefer to be low key and just do my job behind the scenes.  Remember me on pay day and at evaluation time.  I used to have management dreams but it seems one has to sell pieces of their very soul to be in management at times.  Is there no such thing as ethical and management in the same breath?  I supposed there is.  I know some managers for whom I have a great deal of respect.  There there are the bone headed ones who make decisions with out really giving it any thought.  So much has changed here.  I miss the family atmosphere.  I miss the team effort.  I have survived many management changes and with some exceptions I have been here longer than most managers.  So I will probably survive this one as well.

      On another site I have kept a diary on I used to receive so many responses to my entries.  I was really quite flattered.  I am not sure what was different over there but here I am a small fish in a very large pond.  Plus the blogger.com site doesn't lend it self as well when it comes to finding others blogs.  So if I was hoping for comments from others, I obviously need to "go back where I came from."  Here I will just post to hear my self think and if someone comments so be it.  These things are more fun when they are interactive.

      Well, no use keeping it a secret.  I have this dream of a house built on my folks' land.  But the money just isn't there.  I am tired of renting.  And I want a place where the kids and the dogs can roam free without worry.  So living in the country is the ticket I think.  Saturday we went to Aiken to visit a modular home dealership.  Strangely I was impressed until they gave me the price.  Ouch.  Currently around here it costs about $85 to $95 per square foot to build a house.  Modulars cost between $55 and $65 per square foot to build.  So we thought this might put us under the magic number I have in my head as far as financing goes.  With three kids so far with plans for just one more we want a house with five bedrooms.  That way every one gets their own room.  Also we want the garden tub in the master bedroom and walk-in closets.  We also want a wrap around porch so we can have porch swings and rocking chairs and so the kids can run the Matchbox cars off the edge of the porch.  Or set up the race track or the Lego blocks and play in the shade of the porch.  It is not so much to ask but it costs to much to dream about.    I want to build a stone or brick fence around the yard and have a long drive way with oak trees planted on both sides.  Kind of like Twelve Oaks in Gone with the Wind.  I want to be in one place and never have to worry about having to every move again.  I am tired of moving.  I have been divorced before so of course it nags at me the idea of building a house to share with my new wife on my family's land.  I don't want anything to ever take that land away.  It isn't made of gold and it doesn't have oil underneath it but I still want it to always be in my family.  Land to me is a rich inheritance.  If I keep this land in its current shape it will always have trees and when the world knocks down every tree to build a mall I will have the last trees left.  I would love to buy even more land.  I want to preserve it all.

      While editing my profile I received the random question:  The children are waiting! Please tell them the story about the bald frog with the wig:  (My response for too long for the answer box so here it is.)  There once was a bald frog with a wig who lived in the bog.  He was a very vain frog.  Hopping around from log to log.  He looked at himself in the mirror every day.  "I am the most handsome frog in the entire bog," he would say.  "Nay Say," said another frog one day.  "I am the most handsome frog in the bog."  He then jumped onto the same log as the frog of the bog.  "I am the most handsome frog anyone has ever seen.  Call up all your friends and you will see what I mean."  It was then the handsome frog of the bog realized he had no friends at all.  And from the log he did fall.  Never to be seen in the bog again.  The End

      Sometimes it is hard to belive something that you can't see. Religion is like that. My son is blogging now (at my suggestion) and he posted the following  urlLink Religion to Me  The very idea that poof and we all began to exist is difficult for me to believe. I believe we are the result of a big bang. I believe we are the result of evolution. But I also believe in the Biblical creation as well. The Bible doesn't go into great detail about how everything was created. It is a pretty loose story as far as details go. And it says God created it all in seven days. How can we expect a higher power who has been around from forever to infinity to have a concept of time. For him to keep up with time would mean it would probably drag on. We do not have the full mental capacity to understand God. In fact often when I try to imagine how it all came to be and try to put some understanding to it my head hurts. The Greeks believed when we die we gain all the knowledge there is to know. When we are born again we lose that knowledge and spend our lives trying to gain it all back. In death we repeat the cycle. I wonder at times if the Greeks were on to something; if our brains contain all the knowledge there is to know but we are simply waiting for the different pieces of information that allow us to unlock that.  I am a logical person. It doesn't mean I am a smart person it just means I claim to have some rhyme or reason to my thought processes. I have to think things out to the Nth degree before I make up my mind. To me there is absolutely no way there isn't a God. I believe sort of like the Deist that God created it all based on rules he determined. These became our scientific laws. Because God made up the boundaries as science progresses forward we will discover these boundaries and because they are consistent through out creation and the universe we can depend on these "laws" to work. Math is a science. What if God is a mathematician? God could have created it all anyway he wanted. So what if he used the Big Bang to create the Universe and then he used evolution to create all animals upon the earth?  Every religion has their own creation story. In many of then there are similarities. Because of this I have theorized that several religions worship the same God in a lot of cases and our religion is shaped by the survival skills and culture that come about from countries forming. The original Bible stories are put together by prophets to teach as well to keep their followers in line. Often these were written from myths that had been passed on by word of mouth before the written word. I believe all of these words were influenced by God. I believe in Heaven and Hell. Nearly every religion has some punishment and reward system. I believe if we live a good life and do good unto others we will go to Heaven. If we do evil and wrong we will go to Hell. And I believe going to church or synagogue re-enforces our beliefs and helps us to continue to do well. Being close to God is a good feeling. We may be God's soap opera, but so what. And with freewill it is up to us to seek him out and not God to see us out.  This is what I believe. I am sure others believe something different.

      I really want to get into video editing.  I finally have all the software...well sort of.  I spent a few bucks to get the mucho grande deluxe video editing software.  Granted this isn't Adobe or Final Cut or anything like that.  I bought Pinnacle Studio 9 and I bought the Mega pack.  So when I finally get it installed (and that is a story unto itself) I find there are still portions of the program I can't use because they want me to pay additional money.  This makes me mad.  I still like the software but when you buy the deluxe pack you assume this means you get the deluxe package.  So anyway I shot movies of family and events and such for fun.  But I would like to do it for profit. There are only so many hours in a day.  More later.  I think I will be smart and go to bed.

      I just love that song by Traffic. I mean, what the heck is the song even about? Is it really about high heeled boys? Do they really wear high heels? And how is it they kill in this method? Either way this song is such a cool jazzy song. I bought the Traffic Greatest Hits album and this song wasn't on it. The CD had room. Why not include it? Later a new Greatest Hits was released and it was on there. The song runs about 14 minutes. A long song. How many long songs are there worth listening to?  My list of long songs worth listening too: The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys by Traffic (about 14 minutes) Stairway to Heaven by Led Zeppelin (about 14 minutes) Freebird (the live version) by Lynard Skynard (about 14 minutes) In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida by Iron Butterfly (just over 17 minutes) Thick as a Brick by Jethro Tull (about 40 minutes {both sides of the album LP}) Paradise by the Dashboard Light by Meat Loaf (about 10 minutes) Baba O'Riley by The Who (about 10 minutes if you can find that version) The End by the Doors (about 8 minutes)  I am sure there are more but that's all that come to mind right now.

      Blogging is facinating.  I have an online diary elsewhere but I can't really post my private thoughts into a public forum.  Conversely what is the use to have a thought you want to make public and put it into a private diary.  The coin always has two sides unless you count the thin edge.  So I start here.  As time goes on I will post more.  Tonight I just wanted to set it all up.
