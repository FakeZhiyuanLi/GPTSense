      Sorry for the move, guess i just feel more comfortable here talking, cause i know "he" doesnt come here, and i dont need to try to impress him, not that i could. but i can say how i feel withought having to worry about making him  think even less of me that what he does. Sad after all this time, my life seems to revolve around the same thing. the same pity party if you will.  But i guess you can tell from my last few weeks of posts how vividly he effects my being. But the time has come to move on and forget all of it and try to be the person i was put here to be.

      Here in a few moments will be the start of a new week. Hopefully today has put an end to the shit! One can but hope. after all , what is life without hope. Ever have someone say something, and even though, it perhaps might not be directed at you, or even about you, but it just slaps you right in the face. So much so that you can almost feel the warmth on your cheek?? Well i had one of those today. kinda sucked. but makes you relize why you are where you are today. And today does find me back in a place i have tried to get away from for so long. Seems i have wasted my whole life trying to get away from situations, only to wind up right back where i began. A complete circle. Kinda like being lost in the woods. Waiting for someone to come and resue me. in another life time perhaps.maybe the next one coming up? one never knows.  for this life time though, i have been trying to get this new business going. bad thing is, i cant do it alone. and i cant seem to find anyone to trust. my girlfreind wants to do it with me, and she thinks out in her area would be a better idea, which might not be to bad of an idea actually. So this week we will start the search. Think our best bet might be to call up a real estate agent and ask for their help. But i am not to sure she is to set on the idea. And i think she might be a little bit lazy. lol. but then again , in the last year, i have become so also. so maybe this is what we both might need. who knows, we will see. well, i guess i am just gonna go do what i do best and thats go to bed.its gettin late and that gym isnt gonna come to me. Where ever you are Love, i hope that you are happy, and i wish it was i that was kissing you good nite.

      Figured i would post that before i lost it . Ever wonder why people do the things they do. Ever wonder why you do the things you doo?????Its funny, sometimes i think, no he doesnt just think i am another one of these messed up woman that are online. and even when i do things, i know i shouldnt do. i know i am nothing more than one of the hoe's, and he thinks of me no different. And Then know this, why do i do it?????  it just seems like though without hope, seems you would just eat yourself inside out.  i guess that is why the heart is stronger than the mind, your heart knows that without hope, you would wither inside, whereas your brain really doesnt care one way or the other, it only need oxygen to survive. your heart needs a will. and will needs hope. at least thats how i see it. and i guess as long as i can hope that one day hell would freeze over and i could become the kind of woman he craved , my heart has a will. andi guess that is what kept me going back, was the slight chance that this time might be different, that maybe he didnt want just a blow job from me. and that he would give me the attention that he described to so many other woman on line, but alas, it NEVER happened. some may find that a pathetic way to live, perhaps it is. i am once again though becoming to dependent on the chance of his attention.  its like a drug, like when a teenage takes a sip of his first beer. its the best thing in the world at that moment. Till there comes a time , when that beer just doesnt do the trick any longer, and requires more. And i dont like to be dependent on something that i can not provid myself with. Guess that is why i am afraid, well, not afriad, but have never let any guy go down on me, and the only ones i ever did, did nothing more than make , what they thought to be funny, remarks that devistated me.  But i also dont want to enjoy something i have to depend on someone else to give me. but i have never been with a man that actually took the time to get me excited to make me want it. i dont know, most guys seem to think that if they stick their tounges in your mouth and wildly wiggle it around for 20 seconds that this excites you! or that there attempt as relieving their childhood by trying to breast feed is nothing more than nausiating. i really need to learn to spell. but ya know what , this is my page ! LoL. just cause i cant spell , doesnt mean i am stupid. Just means i smoked to much dope and fried my spelling brain cells. Course when you are pounding a cash register, and counting money, doesnt leave much room for practice. I was one of the top 10 spellers in my whole school all the way up till 10th grade lol so thats not to bad. And i dont know what happen! LoL. Deal with it. Well, i havn't even started on what i really wanted to talk about. guess i am just still pissed. I just wanna pack my bags and leave , and phuck all this dumb shit. There is absolutely nothing keeping me here now. and my case comes up next month so. Who knows, maybe thats what ill do.Gonna go out on the boat tomorrow, cant wait. i need to get me a freaking job and stop playing around !!! Or get my ass moving on this bussiness if i am gonna do it. Now would be the time to do it. Well i am gonna go to bed. (o:

      Well, the week has left in a much bitter place. Seems like when it rains it pours. Went out with this guy, first one in a year mind you. i guess it was kinda a second "date" perhaps one could say. Now, keepin in mind, i have talk to this person for about a month now everyday , yea and i know, you can find out if you like someone like that or not. but hes not to bad in person, he is cute. nothing major or anything , but not bad if you know what i mean. if you cant be with the one you want , take the one you can get right? Well, guess it was the same senario for him. And yes, as always , i let things get out of hand. i dont know, its weird, i guess thats why i dont go out with many guys cause they all seem to think the same thing. but , like i said one thing lead to another and things got carried away. and i guess the kiss goodnite i took as we would still at least talk ya  know. but after three days of silence , and him being on all three days i sent one of my pshyco emails and messed everything all up as usual. LoL. Fuk it i guess i truely dont care anymore. damn why is it so hard to find a guy willing to give you a little attention???? i guess i look at it this way, if a guy wants to be with you, he will give it willingly , you dont have to beg for it. Thats why i have such a problem i guess with asking for what i want, or what i like , or whatever . i want it to be givin to me, i dont want to have to ask for it. guess thats why i have never gotten it nor will ever get it huh. LoL , i guess i am just hopelessly foolish in believing in the fairy tale. i believe one day, i will find a man that can consume me the way a woman desires to be consumed. LoL. i guess i am a freak. me and my girl friend was talking the other nite, and she said , if you could have the ideal situation , what would you have, if you could chose your life to be in a certian spot , what would it be like. i told her that my certian spot would consist of a man that was my whole world. One that bought my cloths, meaning, i only wore what he chose. One that controls the house, meaning, a man that is secure in the world and can go out and earn the cash to afford the things that are nice. One that controls my bedroom, meaning, i am not sleeping at the foot of the bed kinda shit, but to control the situation. i like an agressive man. i am not controlling in that department what so ever. We would have two children, one boy and one girl. i would cook and clean, wash and iron, take care of the kids, and be rewarded each nite by romantic kisses from someone who was totally infatuated with me.     She looked at me as if i was a martian.     LoL she said she would be single, living in an expensive condo working as a ceo somewhere. LoL . and i am the freak!   LoL .

      Seems like i keep making the right decisions, but keep falling farther and farther away. Last week truley sucked ass. And this week isnt going much better even though its just monday. i can tell, its gonna be a long week. Just not sure what to do anymore. i just want to wake up tomorrow and things be how i wish them to be.perhaps something other than today, and having others feel sorry for you, nothing is more pathetic than having someone feel sorry for you. but i guess that it different from someone just wantin to have "fun" with you. Guess there really isnt any difference in the two.  So anyways, i so need to find a job. thinking about going to real estate school , lol. got screwed at nit , so maybe i should see who else i can get screwed by. but i dont think i would mind selling real estate. who knows i might be good at it ! ya never know. wonder if i could get all of the contract stuff down. Guess i need to get me a paper and start from there huh. that would be the best plan. Well i think i am gonna go play some euchre . bbl

      Gezus what a truely fucked up week this has been . WTF have i done to deserve all of this?????how come it seems when things are going pretty shitty as it is, something comes along and makes it even shitter? just my luck i guess, i am not sure at this point.  Why is it soooooo hard to find a guy of my own. every guy i meet wants to do it with me and some chick, and even though i tell them over and over again, they still try to shove me in that situation and get pissed when i dont play along. im just not into chicks plain and fuckin simple! i dont want one, if i did, i would have her ya know. And the thoughts of the other nite, just sends wavs of nausia through my body. and why i am not sure. i mean i knew what was gonna happen. i guess i knew as sooon as i got the ball in motion, and he asked me what will you do if she kisses me. i knew then, i would be over looked again. guess some chicks have it and some chicks dont!! and i diffinitly dont have it, wish i did, might have a man if i did. but i am just not aggresive. i have tried to be, but just felt stupid. i mean i know what turns guys on! i just cant seem to bring myself to do it. oh well, good thing masterbation is so bad. but it is pretty sad when you have meet with 4 different guys in one week and couldnt even get laid!!!!! i guess perhaps i didnt want to either. i guess i just cant get into this casual sex stuff. no matter who i try to fool . So i guess i am just best off sticking to my plan. the plan of me , myself, and i . and to hell with everyone else ! No one can take the time to get to know you anymore, unless its what kind of position do you like. or are you into oral or crap like that. oh well, just makes me appriciate my blow up doll more and more everyday............

      Well today has left me with a hard slap in the face from reality. Made a date with someone, plans was he was gonna come to the house, and we was gonna watch a movie, right? well anyways, he was suppose to come over at 9, then it got pushed back till 10 30 , and he actually showed up at 10 50. at which point, i figured he wouldnt show, so i burned one. and of course the house reeked of pot when he got there. so he came in, sat on the couch, didnt even get a hug hello or anything. so we sat down and he started flippin through the cable, flip , flip , flip. we made small talk, and i do mean small talk. he had asked before he came over if i minded if he drank, i said not at all. figured he would bring something with him. so after he had been there for 10 minutes he asked do you mind if i drink and i said no not at all , i offered him a beer, but he said he had , well i thought he said he had captian morgan's and he asked me what i kind of pop i had, i said coke, and he said perfect. so he went outside to what i thought get it out of his car. so there i sat for 45 minutes waiting for him to get back from the car, i washed my face and brushed my teeth and now am going to bed. before i went , though of course i had to sign on and share. when i signed on an old cutie im'd me. he always is able to make me feel things arent so bad. i shared with him what had happened and he said that he wish he had been invited over. so after a bit , i asked him to come over. and got the oh i have to check my schedule crap. you would think at some point in my life i would catch on! ya know? WTF.  So once again, it was proved what a big fat ugly pig i truely am. oh well, as a freind said, life goes on ...  And i guess i should get my fat ass in bed .

      guess i am just stupid to think that he could care, or to even think things will ever change. just wish it hadnt taken me so long to relize it and to see it. i guess looking up in the sky and seeing all of those beautiful fireworks its hard to imagine yourself as anything more than just another human on the face of the earth. and i think now i relize that i will be alone till i pass. but i can except it. would of been nice to had been able to expereince real love just once. or knew what it was like to be held by someone simply because they enjoyed being next to you. its okay though, cause i did have a father that truely loved me with all his heart. just wished i could of gave it back the way he gave it to me. guess i am just to selfish and imature to do any different.  Driving home yesterday was a trip. makes me wonder if people just go online and get the answer to the driving test to get their liscense? makes ya wonder what they think as they are driving down the road. was ona two lane high way yesterday, and this dumb bitch just had to pass me , i guess cause i was not close enough to the guys bumper that was 20 feet in front of me, and tried to pass me. now mind you there is this semi truckin down the road, not to far away from us, and she tries to pass me, wtf! i just dont understand it! can anyone explain it to me? and to top it off, she had a small child in the car !!!! god damn i was fuckin pissed. how can she be so careless! how can she be so stupid? so of course i slam on my breaks so the stupid bitch can get over. i mean , come on now! wtf is wrong with people , i flipped her off the 20 miles i road behind her every time i seen her look up in the mirror. my aunt i know was thinking horrible things lol . but god i was pissed. shes luck she took off so fast that i could not catch up with her, because that is one person i would of wished that would of pulled over and i could of just slapped the dog shit out of her! well, ill be back later

      how sad is it when you are so in secure in your woman hood that you do nothing more than day dream of how things could be. it is so easy to be selfish when others are not involved. but when is it time to say enough is enough? when is it time to live your own life how you wish, and not have to worry what others will say. and to what point do you have to be pushed to just pick up your bags and leave and never look back. i try to say the right things, i know the words are there in my head, but when it come to speaking them, or trying to express them to someone, my emotions take over, and i just spew out things that i wouldn't ordinarily say, or do things that i wouldn't normally do.  I have been shown that Wishing for thing will never make them happen. dreaming of someone to be yours, will never be nothing more than a dream. and loveing someone will never get you anything more than hurt. but being able to remember that one nite, the one special nite that you felt those butterfies makes it all worth while.

      Funny how , someone call tell you they love you, and the minute they think you are not looking , try to wedge themselfs into something, that if they did truely love would, would never even think twice about doing. hell perhaps its me, i could of never did , what someone did to me tonight. but i guess we live and we learn. just wish i didnt have to repeat mistakes twice to learn the lesson.  But at least i have learned the ultimate lesson, that , i am better off alone. without freinds, and without a man. lol, well the thought of a man anyhow.   God Grant Me the strength to do what i must .

      ii: That's got to be one of the more ridiculous things you've ever said to me  Just what every girl wants to hear from her dream man huh . lol . i just dont know what to say to him anymore, and really, what is the point of saying anything, we both for some reason just seem to push each others buttons. i guess perhaps its my fault. i wish to much sometimes for things to be the way i want, that i convience myself that things are different, even when they are not. the heart is a strong and bitter enemy sometimes when it wants something that it can not have.  and it can eat you inside out and turn you into a strong and bitter person. Many walls are put up, many defenses made. i think this is the castle i reside in today.  He said tonight that i was a closed booked. and its sad that he just can not see , perhaps he could care less, who knows. i can not care anymore. it needs to be over with for me. i cant think of it as nothing there anymore, cause for me there is still something there, and i am afraid it will always be there, but i do need to move on. perhaps moving away will help. and hopefully soon, this will happen.

      Life comes today with a differnt out look. i think i am strong enough now , to do what needs to be done. perhaps i am finally growing up. i now see that what i have will be the best that i will ever get. So i guess its time, to stop living in a fantasy and love what i have instead of loving what i dont. Things wont be like this forever. hope fully time will let me forget him. and hope, someday, my heart will beat again. i was so bad last nite, and i am so lucky i have such a good freind, or last nite i could of ended up doing something, that today, i would of regreted. or would i have? but it was nice to be taken care of. to be treated like someone cares for me, even if last nite is the only affection from a nother human being i will ever experience again, i couldnt ask for it from a better person. i guess god does sometimes give us those little things that do carry us over to the next day. perhaps one day i will be happy with just being here. and no need to look for a reason. if it doesnt swollow me up before hand. well, guess i am done being stupid for now. guess i gained a very good freind yesterday, and lost one today. but then again, how good can a freind be that just uses you. guess he doesnt stop to think why , perhaps, he doesnt care why, just as long as it is . but now that it isnt, wonder if the insults and hurtful comments are gonna return. perhaps i just wont be here to listen to them this time.

Well, its midnite. Happy Birthday Daddy. I miss you more than anything i have ever missed in my life. and i pray you are better off where you are , instead of here, where you left me. Just cant seem to get a grip on things anymore. The more i try to push forward, the further i keep gettin knocked back. guess its a good thing i have a big fatt ass for padding huh.  its funny , i sit and look at things from different sides, ya know, try to get the full spectrum. And he is just so full of shit. I guess he doesnt think these girls talk about him. or talk about the things they do. says he never views anyone else, yea , ok. Maybe its just everyone else making it up. at this point, what the fuck doesnt it matter, i am done with it, period, for good, and forever. gezus! i mean come on now! ya know??? can ya feel me????  Well, i do need to run and get a cake mix for my dad , and some kitty litter for the kitty lol . Maybe ill be back later who knows!

      Well, another day wasted. Another day further from my goals.  Seems i am working harder to make things not happen than i am too make them happen. why is that?? i seem to think that having one thing would make things right, would make my life complete. If God Came to me tonight and asked me, if your life where to end, what is the one thing that you would wish before you go?  My answer would be plain , my request would be simple. It would be to know what it was like to be held in your arms. To know what it was like to have you look into my eyes and to have been more to you than what i was. God could make that possible. He can make anything possible. If only he could heal my broken heart.

      Ive sat here for three years now, hoping my life would become better than what it is. But yet i have not done anything to change it. Day after day i sit here and day dream of a man for me. Some one to hold me when i cry. To listen when i talk. To just be there when i dont. Someone to share a Real life with. Guess i ask for to much , and give up to fast when i dont get it. i guess i am bad for not asking for what i want. but i cant just help but feel if i have to ask for it, i dont want it ya know!  i feel like someone should be able to read my mind and know what i want, how easy life would be if that were possible huh? lol . i guess i just feel like if i have to tell someone , i guess its like telling someone what to get you for christmas. you know like on graduation day, after ceremony, you dream about that brand new car, after you worked so hard to be an A student, and earn 3 different varsity letters, To play in Symphonic and the Marching band, give up your senior prom because you had to work to help put a roof over youand your fathers  head just wasnt good enough to merit one, or even an, Darlin, i am so proud of you. Oh well. I bought my own damn car. But it still doesnt fill that void. And now, here after a year of being ate up with guilt , i am nothing more than fatter. lol.

      LoL, its funny, the last couple of days i havnt been online that much, and i have been happy. Was craving to get on to see him. To see what he had done that day. Its funny, i was given an opportunitly to ask a question, and out of the 3,000 i wanted to ask, my mind just went numb. i want to ask sooooo many things , but i just sat there, like an idiot. LoL its like this thing just takes over me, and i just spit out mean and hurtful things , why? cause i cant have him and i know it? and if thats the case, why do i toture myself day after day to just see crap he types on a screen. i was almost there though, almost over it. And now , that things are going good, the little demon is popping out and i am finding it harder and harder to control, so maybe its just best i take a break for a while huh . he doesnt deserve that. So i guess i will just go back to fake screen names and watching from the window till i can learn how to control my emotions. LoL. how pathetic am i? This business thing is just so full of shit, and all the people i am talking to are also. But i just cant do it on my own. Or maybe i can , i dont know.  Guess i just need to have a little confiedence in myself , and faith. And just do what i set my mind to ! And here it is sunday morning, and i still havnt seen american pie, maybe after church , ill just go myself .

      Been awhile since i have been here, yes i know. I guess thinking of someone today brought me back to here. Funny how time go fly by, but the pain in your heart remains so fresh. Kinda sad. They say the only way to heal is through love. but what if you do, if you cant find love, or if in fact it was love that had hurt you so bad in the first place. But anger has helped me. i have let the anger consume my soul and eat me from the inside out. But at least now, he is out of my heart, and out of my head. So i guess this is the point where they say life goes on. But doesn it? You will never understand what it is like to not go on untill you have totally fallen for someone, and to them , you are trash. Well, i guess i am tried of being trash. i wanna be me again. i wanna smell the flowers and experience the good things life has to offer. And so what i have to do it by myself. i kinda like me. At least i can put up with myself huh. lol.

      Well, since it seems i  have nothing to really write about anymore, i thought i would start sharing im's with you, here's one i got yesterday, had to laugh my ass off. Thought i would share it , along with a few different aspects. My Comments are the ones with the ( ) 's around them.   eyecandy_andi: lmao .... you have never been a real friend in your life ...... (This Coming From the Author of Friendship, who only a few weeks back kicked out her 'best friend' Ricky and delivered her furniture to her by stoppin in front of ricky's house and  throwing ricki's stuff out the back of her truck into a mudd puddle")    all you do is talk about people behind theyre backs ... (This Coming from a woman who has done nothing but for the last year send me naked pics of the fat chicks and laugh about em.)    even you own mother and brother...  (Who knows what this crack is suppose to be. i assume that i talk about my mother and  brother behind their backs, and umm so , who doesnt.My mother and brother both have stolen from me, but oh, then again , so did Andi and her hetherns  But the difference between her and i , is my parents dont live in a run down shack. And  then claims to know all about family , when she smokes her dope in front of her 10 year old son, and then wonders why he is retarded. But then again , she spends her other sons money to buy her dope with. so go figure)   you are so bitter and hell bent on revenge ,,, you cant get your head out of aol ... to even ask for help or begin to move on...  (Ya know, everyone keeps saying i am so bitter, i cant figure out why that is. Because i no longer let people like her and her buddy use me, i am bitter? Okay then, i am bitter, sue me. But hell bent on revenge? Life has already done a good enough job to her for me to even have to consider it , if i had the few minutes to waste thinking about it. And i  cant get my head out of aol is kinda like the pot calling the kettle black isnt it, at least i am not sittin here wasting my time masterbating for people on cam, instead of try to teach yourself something so you can be a better person, ya should try it sometimes,  you might be able to get a real job and support your kids for a change instead of your kid  supporting you. )  when some one does try to befriend you and help you get backl some self esteem....  (Now this is a laugh, befriend me?  Hmm you befriended me when you passed my tit pics all over aol. You befriended me when i invited you into my home to share a nite with me and a  friend , that you knew i liked, to after an hour and a 6 pack of coronia's, you are phuckin him in my bed. And was she trying to help me get back the "self esteem' i have apparently  lost By Sending her tit pics to a guy who she knew i was in love with. Or when she brought  her drug dealer friend to my house apparently for me to watch them phucking. I guess perhaps she though i might learn something from this. i dont know. i never knew i lost any self esteem in the first place. i guess the 20 guys that im me a nite beggin for attention have  made me loose it. Or maybe because i dont sit in the fat chicks room day in and day out talking about how wonderful i am and how beautiful i am , and how nice my tits are, or how many guys i phucked last week, i have no self esteeem. i dont knoW? do you?)   you still can unplug yourself from aol .....  the friendship.... is suposed to do what , ... gain you AOL status???  (Now what she is going off about here i am not to sure on. I kinda assume that it means  i wanted her friendship to gain aol status? HAHAH Can we say OMG , get a clue? I guess  maybe she thinks everyone wants to be her, showing their bodies on cam, having guys oggle over you every moment you are on. Hey , i think thats awesome, i just simply dont need it. i know i am beautiful, i dont need anyone to tell me that, or to only be able to keep thier attention by showing them my boobs, or how far i can sit on a dildo. Personally i think  that is diguisting. So if thats the aol status that i am supposidly looking to gain, ummmm i think ill keep in the shadows. )  lmao ... you cant even come to that friend with a problem  ..  (yea i guess since i dont know anything about friendship and find out my friends are  masterbatin on cam for a guy that she knows i like, and i try to over look it and still be friends, and even after saying something it still continues, whos the friend??)  u go to a chat room instead and start talkung shit ....  lol but you dont like it when they do the same to you ......   (Hmmm well correct me if i am wrong, but it has always been her that has started it, and me finishing it. Maybe in the past three years Ms Andi has found a way to express herself other than with the name calling, doubt it ,but stranger things have happened. But i guess i am  suppose to be the better person, and when her and her 'buddy' are tag teaming me, sit there and take it, lol, i think not baby girl. Its just to bad either of you cant think of anything else to talk shit about other than my saggy titties, or my blow job talents. But i am the one that needs to move on. I guess gettin evicted out of one home and having to move to another  one while trying to get your son approved for a loan to buy me a home is what i should do to  move on. Well, i am opening up a Fat chicks clothing store with money i earned, so i guess in her sense, i would be moving on , wouldnt i? )  you are the lamest fat slob in the entire world  ..... you cant get a man or keep one  .. or any friends for that matter ..... you really are eyecandy_andi: a silly fool eyecandy_andi: good luck may you and your bitterness grow till it finallydevores you  (And this being her parting statement ! LoL. This Coming From Someone Who only days ago was going on blah blah blah about how much she loves me and adores me. Can We Say Two Faced?? And OMG another person to call me a fat slob, i think i might cry. But come on now, in the entire world?? I cant be that, i am sure you have phucked on more than one occasion that person, and  are just pissed at me cause i didnt want to join you in your little sick world. What makes you think i would want to have sex with you? *BARF* and thats what i did that nite listening to  you phuckin keith in my bed. If it makes me bitter cause i didnt want to have a threesome with  you , oh well, label me bitter. And anyone can look at me and know that i can get just about any man i want, and i have, and i can. Flabby boobs and all baby. The Sad thing is , none of them  are good enough to keep. And i have keep the ones that was worth it, or at least long enough to pays my bills. And i am a slob? i am not the one that got evicted for mold being all over my house. And not  to even mention the pig stye you left my house in when you and your hethers went on your  stealin spree. I am still washing shit off the walls.   And yes you are right , i am a silly fool, becuase i let you and your buddy , fool me not once but twice !!!!  I can understand your buddy for doing it , but not you. Like i said , i was the only one that treated you like a person, instead of the pig you truely are. Instead of poppin those diet pills you should try your sons riddlen, might help ya out. But i guess maybe i am  just to bitter because bill wants to look at your tits on cam and not mine. The only reason you two get along so well is because you are so much alike. And i guess maybe i am jealous cause i dont phuck a different black guy every nite of the week. Or maybe i am jealous cause everyone likes you more than me. What ever the case may be, i am jealous of you, i want to be you. Maybe that will make you feel better about yourself so you can finally accept it and  shut the hell up now. Damn baby girl , let go of the hatred. I did, its great!!!   Maybe i should just go and have me 3 kids by 3 different dadies, and sell dope, and live off my kids, and screw 3 different men a week, and the rest of the time show my tits, and ride suction cup dildos on a web cam, while smokin dope in front of my kids. Maybe then i can be a  complete woman.Theres more to life than having a cock between your legs, its bout time you find it baby girl . Well , i am off to the docs so i can get me some diet pills so i can be a mini bbw also , and work on the street corner, oh wait, with a computer , who needs a street corner right baby girl. At least i did learn that from you .

      Well, here i sit suckin ass as usual. Waitin on a dream to come true. For my turn to Come. But i dont think it is gonna happen.  Been kinda in a dream world the last year of my life. Falling for the same crap over and over again. That if i was in a right frame of mine , otherwise might not had fallen for. guess it wouldnt be so bad, if i keep falling for the same thing over and over again. but i guess it is just the need to wanted , the need to be held in his arms that gets me this way. Who do i think i am to think that he could ever feel anything for me. who i am to think i could be more to him , or any man, more than a blow job. i dont get it, i mean, this isnt gonna come out right anyhow, but if i wanted to , i could sleep with a different man every nite of the week, and still not have to hit the same man twice in a month. So whats wrong with me. why do i sit here, lettin myself feel this way, feel this way about someone who could give two shits. Its funny, how anger and bitterness can consume you inside out, and eat you alive. i feel that is what i am experiencing now, well, the final stages of it anyhow. i think i am past the point where it is eating me alive. i think tonight, it took its last bite. And is now sittin like a rock in the pit of my stomach. why do i torture my self ? why do i lead myself into believing that things will change for me, and just except the way things are and get on with things. I mean do you really need love and companionship???  So you really need someone to lay in bed with at nite, telling all your little secrets too, or just sharing the day, or a goodnite kiss? Do you reallly need someone to hold you and wipe away your tears when you cry. After Crying for way over 365 days straight, someone finally wiped away my tears for me. Although it was through a dream, to me it was real. When he spoke, his words rang in my ears as if i was in the middle of a syphony. And when he wrapped his arms around me, all the walls came tumbling down and i was filled with such love that if i never awoke, i would of been estatic living there in that dream, in that moment. sucks to miss someone that bad when they are gone. i guess my heart has been on my mind lately, or the lack there of, and it just comes to mind that Isnt it strange that how when your heart aches so bad that if you took one more breath, it would just explode. Thats where i am right now. And as i sit here, looking at the pill bottle, trying to find a reason to stay here, i am coming up with nothing. with the loss of hope and faith, i just wonder, Could i find the courage.

      Well as the battle continues, so does the stupid shit. The parting shot before i was put back on ignore tonight was:  Here you go....post this you psycho bitch....I'm done......you win if you wanna call it that.....No more for me!  Have a nice life!  But Before this wonderful message i was left what i guess you could call a serious of away messages i am more than sure was meant for me. one being get a life or kill another one. and one something like post this, you will never talk to me ever again, or some shit, hell i forget now. but i just don't get it honestly. i really dont,i have asked over and over for it to be explained. my only crime was falling for someone that didn't exists i would email him, but he told me to never contact him again, and that's what i am doing. he hasn't told me to never speak to him again, or i would do that also, lol. but he does have me on block, so its all good. But i never intended for any of this to be a battle and , actually he has no reason to be mad at me, i done nothing this time. my problems are/were/was with andi and cam. And yea, i got pissed, not jealous that andi was showing her tits to bill. She claimed to be my "friend", but yet still cam'd with the man i at the time thought was in love with. No granted she knew, and i know i make him sick, but still, you don't do that to friends. No one i have asked that question to has said they would do it or  felt that it was right to do it . but its all good. the girl actually makes me sick to my tummy. But i should have figured out the kind of person she really is the day i seen her pass a fatty to her kids, and watch her 9 year old toke it. Should have ended it then, but no i let it continue to the point i invited a friend over, and she ended up fucking him, knowing i wanted to go out with him, then got mad at me cause i didn't want to join in. I was to busy puking in the bathroom. But that's another story.    Just wished i could contact William frazie lomas the 2nd and tell him that, listen, i never wanted to win anything. Never wanted it to be a battle. You turned it into one. I just wanted us to get along. i understand fully you are with whoever now and that you don't want nothing to do with me, never have and you never will, i get that! Got it a long time ago, but it doesn't stop me from liking you! But all the hurtful things you have said, have finally gotten to me. and i am sick of being your punching bag. You can sit there and laugh at me, and bash me all you wish. Simple truth is the only thing i am guilty of being is in love with you. and yea i know you sit there and say how could i have loved you, i didn't know you. And your right, i feel in love with someone i chatted with on a computer screen. So you are right, i am pathetic. And you can get on the roof tops and scream it from all i care. You can not hurt me anymore. All of your fat jokes, and your i smell jokes, and the baby jokes, have all gotten you what you was seeking. And You can copy and paste this to whom ever you want. Or maybe be a man for once and have some compassion and try to understand rather than trying to hurt me all the time. that is what you are trying to do isn't it? You don't think i hurt enough already? You don't think i wake up every day and look in the mirror and see the monster i have become? Well, i do. And never once have i said any of that was your fault! You did. You just assumed that everything was about you, actually that is one of your biggest faults, you think everything is about you. And i never at any time ever said all of my lifes problems were your fault either. my life is how it is because of my own doing not yours, or anyone elses. So please can we just go back to pretending we have never meet. i think that is the best way. Maybe someday, when all the clouds clear from your head, you will see the truth, and maybe then you will understand, i hope to not be around when that happens , but untill then, please,  leave me out of your conversations, and i will also . Deal? deal!

      they say dreams are the flowers that bloom in your heart. I used to dream of flowers, but the weeds have taken over. was reading a post today. talking about how one good thing that happens in your life is replaced by a bad thing. And yes, if you always look for that one bad thing to happen, it will. But it closes your eyes to the posibility for the good things. Same with if you sit here waiting for things to happen, one day you will awake and find out that things did happen, you was just to busy waiting, you didnt see them fly by. Mine has flown by. Funny how that saying is sooo true, that you never realize what you have till its gone. dont you sometimes wish that you had the power to know how to change a situation, to manipulate life to make it all that you want. To perhaps change the way you did things. But honestly, if given another chance, would you change anything. or would you still continue to do the same thing. i am proof of that more than likely you wont. i was blessed to find myself in the exact same situation that i had been a few years ago. And a few years ago, i made the same mistake as i did this time. But the last time it happened, i did not know that it was just a game. Today, i knew , it was just a game, but still...... i did the same thing. But i guess today i wanted the same thing as i did years ago. and i knew today, as i knew then, i never would have it. so perhaps thats the reason i did it again.  Guess i just wanted to be worth the effort. Just wanted someone to take notice of me. To want me for more than pleasing them. lol. how funny is that??? People claim to know me, but no one has ever taken longer than 5 minutes to talk with me. or spend more than an hour with me, to see what's inside. To know all that i have to offer.  But on another note, FAT CHICKS. HAHAHAHAH. Good God, as much as i hate to admit it, fat chicks are fuckin stupid. Or at least some of the ones that come in to my store. Like this one old lady i got in here. She tells me oh well i am a plus size, but i am not that plus. HAHAHAHA . She was clearly a size 2x if not larger. It took all i had to not just laugh in her face. then the next question she spews out her mouth is, where is your clearance rack. I felt like tellin her at wally marts where you shop. but she was old and i couldn't be that cruel. One day i to will live on a fixed income. lol yea and when pigs fly .

      Well , this week has came and gone. As well as today has. But the sun had set very long before teaching me another lesson on freindship. Funny how you try and try again. Let another person into your life, thinking perhaps, this time will be different. Only to end up just the same. i dont know, i think its just me. since the patterns seem to repeat themselfs. am i destine to only having men in my life who simply feel i am not worth the effort, and filled with woman claiming to be my best bossem buddy, while they think i am not watching, show the men i 'fall' for thier best bossem. >Shrugs what can you do? Whats left to do ?   How many times can you pick yourself up and try again???

      Is the attraction of wanting something that you cant have so great , that you often make a complete fool of yourself , or do you just simply push that thing so hard and so quick and so fast away from you that you make it impossible to obtain. or is the fear of rejection so great, that you construct it in your head that it is something impossible to have. Either Way, the out come SUCKS!!! Either way , you still dont get what it is you desire. And often enough its those things that are so simple in life, its strange that one should have to desire it. like love. some people have more than they deserve , while others are left stranding outside looking for scraps like a homeless person. sometimes i envy a homeless person. how bad could it be to have no one in your life. no one to hurt you but yourself? often i wonder what things would be like like if i had made just a few different choices . Would i be happy, would i be married with the 'dream' hubby??? or would i be worse?? Doubt it would be any different though, i am sure i would still be going for the same guys that dont want me, but i want them, and the guys that want me, i find totally a bore.

      Ughhhh here i sit , wishing it would warm the hell up!!! It takes so long for this building to get warm it seems. kinda wonder if it isn better to just leave the shit on! good god. what can ya do. been trying to clean files off this computer, and pics. the recent break in has me paniced about my pics being on here , like if someone stole it ya know, and searched through it. lol . i am sure after they got through barfing they would send them to that one web site , nasty. com or some shit like that.  --shurgs-- what can ya do .  When blogger was down,  i wrote a few posts and just saved them on note pad. figured might as well post them as i find them. then delete them. most of it is arguements with whats his face. and reading them, really makes me realize how pathetic i was. how could anyone care about someone who says the kinda things that he said to me over and over and about me. but i did.   but he finally gave me closure.... his last mean act did it for me. just kinda bumms me out though, that i didnt see it coming, and took the situation for what itwas worth, instead of just being stupid and lettin him walk over me yet once again. I should had jumped up and told him just exactly what I tHOUGHT and felt. but no, once again, i played stupid and once again, got what i always get, because i always do , what i always do. dont you wish , just for once,  you could find the courage, and make the one you want, see you !! and want you. lol, but then again, what would life be if it was happy. glad that is something i will never find out.  One file , room log i found , that i dont remeber reading, and was just shifting through it. after reading it, i was at a loss , wasnt sure how to read what was written. and surely can not understand how someone even at such a young age could ever trash someone for wanting to end their life. guess its not meant for me to understand.  Well here is the entery..... January 15,2004 : 	I picture my sister singing into the hair brush : 	Music has always been a huge part of my life  : 	Here's a little known factoid about BB : 	I was in an orphanage for a while as a small child  	I went to live with some people near Irish Hills MI : 	they had 4 daughters : 	they would all get together and watch Dark Shadows 	it was on around 3 pm I'm thinking 	But they were very mean towards me : 	One day While they were all in the house watching Dark Shadows : 	I tied the extra clothes line rope from the clothes line around my neck and jumped off a picnic table : 	They looked outside and saw me hanging there : 	and rescued me : 	I was 6  : 	Wow..... : 	Sorry  	That came from a far away place

      Was hopin to come back a month later and things be happy hunky dorry . LoL. guess thats for fairy tales and silly stuff like that. seems that every day that goes by, is just sucking a little more out of me, my hopes, and my spirits. i just wish i could wake up one day, and find that there is happiness for me. that there might be someone to share my life with other than myself. and i guess i am not alone in this wish, or alone in the fact that i am alone..... its kinda funny if you dont stop to think about it. been trying not to think about to many things lately. seems everyone else has moved on with their lives, and are happy. and here i sit , still dreaming for the love that i once dreamed of as a child. i guess, being in such a state of mind, leaves it open to misconception and deciept.  but as in every situation in my life, there has been other choices, better paths i could have taken. and certian people, whom i knew , to start, would only end up as in fact, the way they did. gezus i hate when i am right.  I have cried before , and oh i have hurt. Thought i had finally grew up , and gotten over the childhood fantasies, and was able to accept the way my life was.... alone.  But something inside wouldnt let the feelings die. untill saturday. Something .... that nite.... died inside me. As i sat there on that cold seat, with tears that ran down my checks without a thought, i realized i would never have anyone that would truely love me, or except me for me. or in fact ever even be good enough to stand any anyones side.  -shrug- well i am good enough to stand by my own side, guess that will have to be good enough for me. thought i might be good enough to at least spend some time with someone i recently found to be awesome. but like everything else in my life thta i touch , that turned to shit also.  A comment was made in the room today, guess i kinda took it personal, even if it wasnt meant that way, guess that is one of my biggest downfalls, is i always think its about me......   And i am not even really sure of the conversation, just happen to sit back down in my seat to see it being said. The comment was , not everyone in here is beautiful......  guess i have always know that i am not very beautiful, i guess , and perhaps , what was meant by this comment, is that beauty is not only outside, but inside as well. And i am not very beautiful in either aspect.  Funny how quick happiness can be replaced with a cruel intention and open your eyes to the real world.........

      HeLLo From SiLLy Well this weekend was kinda strange to say the least. Seems i am not alone as i once thought i was, so guess i will have to be more careful in what i say. lol. thats a whole other thing that i dont understand. and i know i say that over and over and over again. but damn it i wanna understand.  i try so hard to not hurt people. everyone is always going on about how online is so fake and what not, and i guess to a point, i do see that. but if its so fake, how come it hurts so much ya know. how can it not be real. i mean just becuase you dont see faces???  i guess  thats one thing i could never understand. cause i have meet people in person, and to me  they are not fake. well a lot are phoney, lol, but they are still real people. i am online ,a lot, to much actually , but a day doesnt go buy that i get im'd and chatted to by some guy who think that i am wonderful. who ask me out, blah blah blah. but i dont want any of them.. why is that? guess its cause i always look for those things i can not have in stead of settling for whats in front of me. ughhhhhhh  i dont know. i just dont get it. but..oh well...... Started looking for another location today. but its hard to find places that are already up and ready to go , and espcially with a drive through window, or the possiblity of puttin one in. so ill just have to keep looking and looking and looking. Well, the mother is here and she hates when i am on this thing, so i better turn it off.

      HeLLo From SiLLy  Well here it is Saturday already, funny how time is flying so fast. i kinda wish i was 65 and gettin ready to go. >shrugs sigh Whats cool though is the more i have phazed people out of my life the more content i have become. how strange is that. the anxiety attacts are still there, but they are becoming more and more managable. maybe i am growing up hahaha.  i think today is the first day i havnt cried in a long long while, makes me wonder, if i am over all of it, or am i just so hurt inside, that i am now numb to it all.  which is kinda scary but welcoming , if thats a word.   But the girls that come into the store have been nice, and most stay to conversate with me after thier purchases, so i guess its not all to bad. there was this one girl that came in today. kinda what i wish i was like. she was bout a size 2x. bright blonde hair shoulder length and nice . lol. and you could tell she was the kind of person that is happy all the time, the bitch ahhaha. i am happy for the most part. just most people see the uglyness, i guess cause thats what i chose to let them see. so i only have myself to blame . then again i am not blamin anyone in the first place. guess the whole thing is to  make yourself happy, which i do. just would be a lot happier if i had someone to share it with ya know.  Then this other couple came in, and the ladies hubby was a guy that used to bowl on thursday nites, i have known him for about 10 years, but never knew he had a wife. and you could never really tell by the amount of girls he kissed on at the bar >shrugs On another note, been thinking bout maybe going back to aol, finding another room to hang out in, a new name , haha, not like i dont have 400 of those. but it has been a while since i have made a new one. maybe try the michigan room for a while, or even the michigan affairs room.  maybe i can find a married man to have myself an affair with haha.  but i know there has to be someone out there that would want to be with me for other than a blow job. fuck i am not that bad of a person. but maybe i am , if i wasnt i wouldnt be alone right.  So i guess i am gettin what i truely deserve.  oh well pity party for one signing off ................................. (o:

      HeLLo From SiLLy Kinda funny how you can get so excited about life, and in a quick few hours forget why you was even put here on this earth. Lately , and especially driving home from grand rapids at 3 am, which by the way only took me an hour and 20 mintues to get home. but, i have been think why was i put here. and what is my purpose here. and i cant seem to find any reasons. or any reasons to even remain here. yesterday i drove 4 hours to be with someone, but he only felt i was worth two hours of his time. so after i blew him, he left. and why i would think this one would be different is beyond me. Sucks when someone sees you as nothing more than a cum dumpster ya know. but i guess that is all i truely will ever be. but he even turned that around on me, because before he left i told him he would never see me or hear from me again. and that hurt his feelings. wtf. what about mine?  what about the fact that i was just used again ya know. and why i keep letting it happen i dont know. i guess i am just so desperate to have someone. for someone to feel i am worth the effort and want to spend time with me, and not be ashamed about it.  but i might as well wait for the sky to turn to gold. guess i believed when he told me he wanted to spend time with me, go to the cemetary, blah blah blah . should had just kept my fat ass at home where it belongs and take my whoops like a good girl.  oh well...... On another note though i did get rid of aol, so at least i wont have to worry about falling for anything again. and turn back to having a simple life again. try and pick up from here and carry on.  but that doesnt stop the drama from coming in. even after being off aol, i still get a phone call, telling me some chick is bashing billy in the room. and then another chick came in and was bashing on everyone. And i got the blame for being both people. how funny is that?  i have never needed a fake name to bash anyone, i guess that is why that is so funny. and i have never needed to create a name to bash bill. Is it so hard to believe that i am they only fat chick he had used and abused? >shrugs  Just once, would had been nice to have someone feel even an 8th of what i felt for them. guess that is my problem. i care. and that , along with everything else , stops today.  I have deleted aol from my life, as well as everyone else.  probably the best thing i could of done. and should had done it a long long time ago.  Oh Well. time to go home. yahhhhhhhhh.......     and get some kisses from my kitty.

      HeLLo From SiLLy  Well this morning really sucked butt. On my way to work this am, freakin 94 is under construction, for some reason they are chopping down all of the trees. and had to stop and wait while the chopped down three trees. which was kinda cool. but as i almost got here, i happen to look up in my rear view mirror , and see my dad. Wow. Talk about freaky. Its kinda funny how your mind goes blank and goes back in time, and you forget that they are gone. my mind almost believed that it was my dad. and in the next second, my heart told me he was gone, cause the tears that ran down my face blinded me. but it was soo real, it was his truck, and not to many of those out on the road anymore, his same exact sweat suit that he loved to wear, a gray one with a red strip across the chest. i had bought it for him one year for his birthday. i missed his last birthday because we was fighting. but the hair sytle and color and even the glasses was the same. i slowed down so he coud drive by, and was crying so hard, i had to pull over. geez what a sucky baby i am , good god. oh well, guess i should go price the crap i got in yesterday and do something productive with my day , right? haha phfffffffffffffffffffffffffft

      HeLLo From SiLLy   So, here we are again. Babbling endless stupid thoughts to a computer screen. Trying to find that reason for being. Trying to grasp that one last straw. Was it worth it? Is it worth it now? And could the future possibly bring anything worth being here for?So many people have came in and out of my life so fast in the past few years, that it has all left me in a blurr. Strange , how you think about things that has happened in your life, things that happened, that you now sit and look at how different they actually were, instead of how you thought they were at the time they happened. To bad you cant see things for how they truely are when they happen. but then if it was, love wouldnt be blind. i think love makes you not only blinde. but deaf, dumb, and stooppid also. But isnt it grand... to fall in love. To fell those little tiny butterflies in your belly when he kisses you. To have your whole body quiver from a simple touch. How silly is that? i felt that again not to long ago.  when he kissed me, something happened. cant quite describe it. nothing i had ever really felt before. it just felt sooo right. felt so warm and wonderful. And although, as everything else in my life, i do the same thing i always do, and ruin things. Let my self get carried away, and was carried out the door half hour later...  but i guess the reason with was the same reason that there always is. i knew he did not feel for me the same way i did for him, they never do. and thats the only situation i will ever be wanted in.  guess i have excepted that. and in excepting that , i might as well just except my situation and take it for what it is. and adjust.  the only person that ever truely did, and ever will care for me is dead, so here i am alone.

       Memorial Day 5 Years Later     5 years ago today, was the best day in my life, and yet the worst. And 5 years later, today i truely know everything about that day and the the days before , and rest of the time up untill today has been nothing but a lie. I guess in life people become selfish, not often caring, as long as things are as they wish. and i guess that is not such a bad thing, i mean really, what is wrong with gettin what you want. i often get what i want. its just often times you dont realize who you have crushed in your drive to get there. i know i have not gone out of my way to hurt anyone. but yet, someone has more than gone far and above the line of duty to make sure my heart is stomp and trampled on over and over. but i allow it to happen, so i only have myself to blame, i knew, and now know for sure there was never nothing there. but i guess in my haste to have what i want, i often tend to take this road. sometimes dont often consider the other persons feelings. so perhaps i am no different. i guess the only thing i know how to do is hurt others when i hurt. but i have been doing a good job of not taking my anger out on others. funny how life gets twisted and turned upside down when you think you are in love with someone. how you distort things so your heart doesnt hurt so much when your love is rejected. you try to blame it on other things, even perhaps on other people, instead of being brave and taking the blame on yourself. Its just a shame it took 5 years for something to end for me that should of ended on that day as it did for him.   Happy Memorial Day and Good Bye          Love SiLLy(o:

      Finally got my room done , yippeeeeeee. i love my bed. the room is sooo bright, lol. But i still would prefer to be out on my own. gettin out of the basement i think has made me realize this. so yesterday i started looking at apartments. my friend said she new a few places in this complex that were up and ready to move in, wouldnt take that long to get into. we are gonna drive by there today, its on dix i believe, dix and reeck road. lived in southgate most of my life, i wouldnt mind going back. we will see. depends on the area i guess. some parts of southgate are a bit run down.  on a brighter note. i think i have meet someone, he seems really nice. might be what i need.gettin tired of the useless men in my life now. a change of pace just might be what i need. he seems to have his shit together. lives in northville, beautiful home.and he knows how to take care of it and keep it clean. has a good job. single, no wife or ex wife or girlfriend. very polite, very well manored and only 41. And he doesnt even think i am stupid, which is cool, haha. and what was even better, was on our first date, all he wanted was a kiss goodnite. never once did he lead me off to the bedroom. was very cool.  Well, guess i should get off my ass and price some stuff. bbl

To Make, To make you love me  I am extrodinary, if you'd ever get to know me. i am extrodinary, i am just your ordinary average every day sane psycho super goddess.  You may not believe in me. but i believe in you. so i still take the trash out, does that make me too normal for you? so dig a little deeper, cause you still dont get it yet. you see me lickin my lips, need a primitive fix, and ill make, ill make you love me.   I am extrodinary, if you'd ever get to know me. i am extrodinary, i am just your ordinary average every day sane psycho super goddess.  See me jump through hoops for you, you stand there watching me perform. what exactly do you do? have you ever thought its you whos boring . who the hell are you????

      HeLLo From SiLLy  Another day Another Dollar. Another Day gone by, another failed attempt. Another reason to simply give up. I swear i feel like a dog with a bone sometimes, i just cant stop nawing at something untill its gone, or completely destroyed. why is that? why do i do everything within my power to keep somoene out of my life that i so want in it?  guess its just all the other stuff i cant deal with very well. was told a few things a few days ago, didnt quite set right. but i know who i heard it from had no idea what it was they was confiding in me. but i put on the happy face, the one i have come so good at using. and wore it like a trooper. but after hearing the tails, i am left feeling sick to my stomach. i mean people had told me. and yea i listened, but i guess i am the kind of person that believes in what i see. but just because i cant see it doesnt mean its not true. lol its funny, as now, i sit here and think about it... i think i see things in people, you know , see something different than others see. but , now i know , its just my mind playing tricks on me. or perhaps that is where they coined the phrase looking through rose colored glasses. i seen what i wanted to see. not what was there, right in front of my face. but there was the apologies, and the excuses. and i fell for it, once again, hook like and sinker. one would think after 2 times i would learn. guess it took the third time though to make me realize what an idiot i truely am.

       well seems you cant put long entries in here anymore so heres the rest     everyone says they are tired of my pity parties. never really realized that is what i do. i have never asked for anything i want. guess i feel like if i have to ask for soemthing, i dont want it. You dont ask someone to buy you a birthday present, they do it because they want to. perhaps cause they care about you. So how doyou ask someone to love you?? how do you ask someone to care? but i guess you can sit here and through a pity party for yourself, or just learn to deal with it.  i prefer the party!

       Sometimes you need to stop your life. and take a look. and just see if what you are doing has measured up to what you set out to do. I am sure nobody ever dreamed they would be where they are today. Are you in life where you set out to be? is anyone. Are you happy with the life you are leading? is anyone. I sit here all day long, thinking..... so many thoughts flow through my mind, things i would like to write dowm......... but yet when i take a moment to write, nothing comes out. Perhaps it just i try to hard. try to hard to be what everyone else wants me to be, instead of myself. and i just simply cant be that person anymore. im tired of fighting all the time. and tired of being angry. So how do you stop? how do you remove the hurt from your life???? Drugs??? Perscription pills??? Therapy??? What do you do , when non of that works?? where do you go??? As i layed in the er the other nite, listening to a baby cry, i cried also. and thought about how wonderful it would had been to have a child in my life. and how old he/she would be today. and how big. and how blessed i would of been. but i guess things happen the way they are suppose to. not everyone is meant for happiness, i guess i am just one of the fortunite people that will never experience that. I had kinda been under the influence that one day, i would find someone to love me , and have that life that i have so long wished for. But today, i realize, thats not my plight in life, how ever you spell that damn word. When i was a child, i would lay in bed and dream of what my life would be. guess i lost those dreams somewhere along the way. got lost in the shuffle of shelfishness. just seems like i have fought so hard to get what i want, only to wake up to find, that i have pushed the dream farthest away from me. perhaps i am afraid to live my dream. afraid to be happy. cause it seems i do so much better with the lonlyness and anger , and these walls that i have built so high. my solitude is my life. and i guess i have worked hard to keep it that way. even still till today, i fight that fight, instead of perhaps letting someone inside. lettin myself love again. its just taken so long to get here, to be able to look myself in the face again. to be able to look in the mirror again. And look at what i have become. something i promised myself i would never become, but yet , here i am. still alone, and twice the size. everyone says they are tired of my pity parties. never really realized that is what i do. i have never asked for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           

And look at what i have become. something i promised myself i would never become, but yet , here i am. still alone, and twice the size. everyone says they are tired of my pity parties. never really realized that is what i do. i have never asked for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            

       Sometimes you need to stop your life. and take a look. and just see if what you are doing has measured up to what you set out to do. I am sure nobody ever dreamed they would be where they are today. Are you in life where you set out to be? is anyone. Are you happy with the life you are leading? is anyone. I sit here all day long, thinking..... so many thoughts flow through my mind, things i would like to write dowm......... but yet when i take a moment to write, nothing comes out. Perhaps it just i try to hard. try to hard to be what everyone else wants me to be, instead of myself. and i just simply cant be that person anymore. im tired of fighting all the time. and tired of being angry. So how do you stop? how do you remove the hurt from your life???? Drugs??? Perscription pills??? Therapy??? What do you do , when non of that works?? where do you go??? As i layed in the er the other nite, listening to a baby cry, i cried also. and thought about how wonderful it would had been to have a child in my life. and how old he/she would be today. and how big. and how blessed i would of been. but i guess things happen the way they are suppose to. not everyone is meant for happiness, i guess i am just one of the fortunite people that will never experience that. I had kinda been under the influence that one day, i would find someone to love me , and have that life that i have so long wished for. But today, i realize, thats not my plight in life, how ever you spell that damn word. When i was a child, i would lay in bed and dream of what my life would be. guess i lost those dreams somewhere along the way. got lost in the shuffle of shelfishness.

      HeLLo From SiLLy Been cleaning out old folders on my computer. and came across a few files. ones being filled with enteries because blogger was down for so long. figure wtf might as well post em. might as well fill alll of this with the ignorant shit that goes through my head huh.   November 13 its funny the other nite , i think we played message tag. Im not to sure. one of the things that he posted  was its your dime, i am listening. i mean honestly , what else is left to  talk about? Does he need to rub it in a little bit more that he doesnt feel anything for me? does he need to make it clear to me once and for all? LoL, I GET IT! boy oh boy do i get it. Message Came in Loud and clear .  i just dont understand what it is i have done for him to treat me this way though. i  guess it does suck to have someone be in love with you when you feel nothing for them but disguist, and then have to listen to everyone say shit about you and that person. i guess  i am truely sorry for that part. if i could control what other people said and did, this world would be a better place, at least through my view.   its halarious to watch though, seems like every screen name that comes in the room is me stalking him . Whats even more funny is the fact that he thinks everyone is in love with  him, in a room full of those fat chicks, pee wee is a dream . What more needs to be said. Kinda makes me laugh now, before i used to find him charming, witty, somewhat attractive, but now.. he just makes me nausiated  Ti Kanis Kookla? Poli Kala, Afkaresto  WTF Does that mean anyhow?   Dec. 20 But i just dont understand one thing that has happened in my life, well, i guess i  should say one person. My memory has never been all that hot to begin with, and perhaps its a little bit of remembering things the way i wanted them to be ,  i am not to sure anymore at this point. So much has happened, so much hurt. something that could of been  solved with a few words , or perhaps a little better communication. and whos fault is  that. makes me wonder now , if it was really mine or not. just seems like all i ever did was tell him how i felt. babbling on in stupid emails , rambling on about my feelings and  i guess i never asked him how he felt. my biggest problems is not asking for what i want. and i feel if i have to ask for it, i dont want it. and felt if he felt anything for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          

      HeLLo From SiLLy   Well, seems as if blogger got a new look, and more shit for me to try and figure out. SINCE A CERtian SOMEONE WILL NOT HELP Me!!!  hehe . =-P~~~  Boy oh boy what a week that was. fuckin men i swear to god. what is the problem there. i used to think it was all them. but now i realize its me. guess i expect to much. i demand honesty. and am tooo damn impatient. i want it now or i dont want it. and if i have to ask for it. i sure dont want it. yea i know kinda ass backwards , but then again so am i.  How lucky people must be to have someone to love . what an incredible feeling it must be to know that someone cares for you. and to love someone and them love you back.  its close to time to go home, and we just had a rain storm. how beautiful it is to have it rain, and the sun shine at the same time. makes me feel at ease inside to know that even when it rains, there is still sunshine. i have missed that sunshine in my life. guess you cant make the sun rise though, you can only hope that it will. and hope someday....... somehow that someone will come along that will see me as more than a blow job, or more than just tits on a screen .  >>shrugs

And  now i am glad i didnt. i wrote the letter, but never sent it. i could never be anything in your life,  never was. one day maybe ill get it through my head i was nothing more than a whore to you.  one day i will get over you. one day, i will be myself once again. sucks big fuckin ass, that i am  not even good enough for you to flirt with. just good enough to blow.

                       My Last Post  Well guess as usual i have said to much. So i will go one step further and finish the task. you have always thought that i was out to hurt you. or out to do you harm. yes, i spoke many words out of anger. and iam sure you know that. and i think that you thought that if you came down, i would think it meant something, but i knew it wouldnt. i wanted you to come down because i simply wanted to see you again. and was willing to pay the price to see you.  every day, your image seems to fades a little further from my mind. but i know i ask for to much, i realize this, and i truely need to leave you alone. i dont want to. but i can see how it effects things. my obsession with you needs to end.  all my life, everything i have wanted, and i touched, turned to shit. but i am not gonna sit here and throw myself a pity party. sure you do not care to read it. in the past, i have said that i would leave you alone, and didnt. this time , you have my word, i will not contact you anymore. i will not drive by your house anymore. i will not care for you anymore. i will not love you anymore. i will not dream of you anymore. and i will not think of you anymore. i will however sit in the room with my screen name. it has brought a few girls in. but i will never speak again in the room. that you also have my word on. Once again, i hope you get the best life has to give.  please forgive me.

      Well here it is July 5th. Fireworks are over, and life returns back to normal tomorrow. Been thinkin a lot today. Mostly about you, as usual. And thinking about how foolish i have been. here i sit day after day, begging for bits of attention from you. hoping that perhaps today, things will change and you will allow me into your life. For 4 years i have sat here watching life pass me by, while i have done nothing but sit here , getting fatter, and gettin uglier. Crying day after day, and at this point, not even really sure why. How can you love someone who cant even kiss you. i have often asked myself, why. but i know the answer. deep down i have always known the answers. guess it was to easy to hide behind the things i wanted to see , instead of seeing things for how they really was, and are. I was hoping that today, i might see things a little more clearer. perhaps pull my head back out of my ass and move on with my life. i want to leave here and never look back. but i dont have the strenth to. i cant get over you. and i know that you sit there and think how can she love me, she doesnt even know me. and perhaps i dont. perhaps i dont even love you. but what is it then? why do you go through my head , all day and all nite. still?? you no more care for me today, than the first day we meet. and i know that is all my fault. i am not what you want in a woman, i need to except that and move on. i need to leave you alone, you are happy with your life. you dont need me in it. its funny every nite when i go to bed, i fall alseep to thoughts of you. cry myself to sleep to thought without you. and i dont know how to stop. i dont know how to quit. i am a drug addict and you are my drug. but there is no clinic i can go to. no pills i can take to remove the desire for you from my soul.  Even now i sit here thinking of you. thinking about how you are probably curled on the couch with your wife, watching television before retiring to bed for the nite. I think about you preparing for bed, going through the house, making sure the doors are locked, and things are in order. Then going to your bedroom to slip into your jammies. Washing your face, brushing your teeth. Then climbing into bed with your beautiful wife, and holding her in your arms. and i dream , and wish that it was me. laying there in your arms. recieving your kisses. but it needs to stop. life is to short to cry over something you could never have. something that was never even possible for you to have. something thats not mine to have.  i have tried everything i know to make you care. but you cant force people to care for you, you can only hope that they do. im just tired of feeling guilty. in my heart i know i could not of changed things that day. things happen, and sometimes, you just cant control the way things go. perhaps if i had done things different. who knows. the only thing i ever wanted out of life, was the only thing i could never have. Someone who loves me.    Well i have a few things to do before i lay my head on my pillow for a bit.

       Thought of you today, and yesterday.  My days had been free lately, free of from constant thoughts of you. thought of your face running through my head all day. they had finally started to fade. but you refreshed that. when you touched me, it sent shivers through me. gave me goosebumps and the whole 9 yards.... but i know i cant feel this way towards you. just standing near you made me break out in a cold sweat. oh man, then you kissed me. i honestly thought i had died and gone to heaven. i had waited sooo long for you to kiss me again.  even though i asked for it, and even though you did it so i would give you what you was after, still , made a lot of that pain go away. i used to hold you on such a high pedistool. to me, you was everything a woman could want. or at least everything i wanted. i used to think you had made such sacrafices to get your family back. but really you didnt. i think i just kept tellin myself that , so it didnt hurt so much, so that i didnt feel like such a loser in life. but i know i will never be, nor ever was good enough to be anything with you , other than what i am. i kept tellin myself , maybe he does care for me. lol.  but then i sit here and wonder , how many other chicks you hook up with. then i laugh at myself , that i have become reduced to being totally head over heals for someone who doesnt even know i breath. ya know, its funny, last time you was here... i smiled for a week, even though you didnt come for me, it still filled me with something, for a moment , for what little bit there was , i was happy. lol but you did killed that smile quick.  And seeing you this time, just wasnt the same.... i didnt smile for days, but i wasnt sad either. just kinda numb. not really sure what to make of that either. am i gettin over you? has it finally gotten into my head that there was never anything between us, and there are no feelings for me from you.  and thank you for refreshing my memory of your kiss.  i can still close my eyes, and taste it.  lol. hope its enough to last me for a while, the last one had to last me 3 years.  wonder how long this one will last.    i wish i had the nerve to touch you. i love feeling your skin under my fingers.  is it pathetic that someone could be so affected by you? does it bother you that there is someone out there that would give up everything they had for some of your attention. it must truely suck. and i am sooo sorry to have done that to you for all these years. i sit here and think how stupid i am to crave what ill never have. kinda makes me feel like a crack addicted , to have sat here day after day, month after month, year after year waiting for the scraps you through me. and i greatfully gobble em up like the pig that i am . and today, i sit and wonder........ was that it. will i see you again....  but i doubt i will ...  i know you feel guilty for using me. but obviously i am cool with it, or i wouldnt allow it.....     wish sometimes i could had found the courage, and strenth to tell you just how much i adore you. wish i had the nerve to tell you that i love you.  but most of all i wish i had the brains to let it go...............       i kinda think thats why you never came to the house because you didnt want to hurt my feelings if i started with all that crap. i think here, you feel more comfortable and know that it wouldnt ever get on a person level here. and i guess that is all for the best. i have made a fool out of myself on here over and over and over again. no sense in doing it in real life huh. lol .  but its okay, i have you in my dreams. and in my dreams you are mine.
