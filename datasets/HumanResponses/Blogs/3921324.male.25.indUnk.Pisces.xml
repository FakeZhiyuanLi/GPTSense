      My life is boring. What can you do?  I saw "Anchorman." It was all kinds of funny. Will Ferrell has an unparallelled ability to create the strangest, funniest characters. The mentally retarded weatherman was inspired as well. "I ate a red candle." Laughed my ass off.   I am about to head off to see my family for a few days, then I'm in a wedding. I'm a groomsman, a demotion from best man the last time I was in a wedding. I hate being that age where everyone you know is getting married and you are ALONE. Oh well. I'm fine with being a crazy old cat man with my five thousand cats. That's fine. Really.  &nbsp;

      Just got home from seeing "I, Robot." It was pretty good. When did Will Smith get all buff and running around shirtless in movies? I haven't seen so much extraneous shirtlessness since "The Punisher" with Thomas Jane, aka Hunky McHunkster. Now I'm scared of robots- they will kill you...or hook you up to the Matrix...or be Robin Williams and want to marry you. Its crazy!  &nbsp; We are totally loving the "South Park" most outrageous episodes marathon. Matt and Trey are soooo going to hell for some of these shows.  &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Here's the continuation of the Broadway reviews from last time.  &nbsp;   Caroline or Change   Book by Tony Kushner, Music by Jeanine Tesore  with Tonya Pinkins, Veanne Cox, Harrison Chad, Capathia Jenkins, Chuck Cooper, Anika Noni Rose, et al.   I went into this show with a sense of foreboding- a musical about race relations at the time of JFK's assassination? One that has been accused of being an exercise in expurgating liberal guilt? Anyway, I loved it. The more I think about it, the more effective I think it was. I don't think it will take a place among classics, because the material is difficult (not unlike "Assassins.") The music is effective and makes great use of motives and styles specific to each character. Pinkins is a force of nature in the central role of the embittered Caroline. Chad is one of the strongest child actors I've seen and Rose is a ray of sunshine as the proud and hopeful Emmie.   &nbsp;   I am My Own Wife   by Doug Wright  With Jefferson Mays   This Pulitzer-prize winning play is a monodrama about the life of German transvestite Charlotte von Mahlsdorf. Wright tells her story with a variety of characters and techniques, all brought to amazing life by Jefferson Mays, in a virtuosic performance. Charlotte survived the Nazi regime and the Soviet controlled East German years. She is charming and enigmatic- is she a survivor, a traitor, a sweet old lady...who happens to be a man.&nbsp; A fascinating afternoon in the theater.     &nbsp;   Jumpers   by Tom Stoppard  with Simon Russell Beale, Essie Davis, et al.   This is not a play to go into looking for a fun evening of entertainment. It requires intense focus on the part of the audience, as the majority of the play is a debate on religion and philosophy. Beale is incredible in his prolonged monologues and Davis is stunning as his psychologically disturbed wife. I'm glad I saw this, but I definitely need to read the play and spend some time with it to truly "get it."     &nbsp;   Avenue Q   Music and Lyrics by Whitty and Calhoun, Book by Whitty  with John Tartaglia, Stephanie D'abruzzo, Rick Lyon, Ann Harada, Jordan Gelber, Natalie Venetia Belcon, Jennifer Barnhart et al.   A surprise winner for this year's Best Musical Tony, "Q" is charming and irreverent. For those of us raised on "Sesame Street," this show is even more familiar with its use of puppets and humans. The cast is incredible- making each character unique and adding depth to what could become a cartoon. The score is strong and catchy and the lyrics are so funny that you will miss half of them in the theater because the audience is laughing so loudly. Tartaglia and D'abruzzo make strong debuts on the Great White Way, with D'abruzzo's act 1 solo "There's a fine, fine line" being the heart of the show. Innovative and original, a must-see.     &nbsp;   Bombay Dreams   Music by Rahman, book by Thomas Meehan  with Manu Narayan, Ayesha Dharker et al.   I had to see this just because it was pretty much the only thing I hadn't seen in NYC this season. It was total trash, but still fun. I'm not familiar with the Bollywood movie genre, but this purports to be closely related. The choreography is fun and leading man Narayan&nbsp;provides an energetic, likeable performance. The music is not particularly strong- the strongest pieces "Shakalaka, Baby" and "Chaiyya, Chaiyya" are from other sources and are lip-synched in the theater. Fun to see, but go to "Avenue Q" or "Wicked" for a better time.     &nbsp;  Now, wasn't that fun?      &nbsp;

      So, I'm gay and I like musical theater...a lot. Which is such a cliche it makes me sad, but that's another story and that's what Zoloft is for, right? Anyway, I just got back from a trip to New York City with my family. Here's what I saw and what I thought-   A Raisin in the Sun  by Lorraine Hansberry with Sean Combs (P. Diddy), Audra McDonald, Phylicia Rashad and Sanaa Lathan  A very strong production of an underappreciated piece of American dramatic literature. McDonald and Rashad both won Tonys for their incredible performances. Despite what you might have heard, Puffy wasn't that bad. He just faded into the background when the stronger performers were present. I have to admit to being a HUGE fan of Audra McDonald. She is an incredible performer and singer. Find her CDs and buy them. Do it.    Assasins  Music and Lyrics by Stephen Sondheim with Michael Cerveris, Mario Cantone, Neil Patrick Harris, Becky Ann Baker, Denis O'Hare, et al.  I am also a huge Sondheim fan. This show was incredible- moving, funny, challenging, chilling. All of the performers were excellent, which is important because this show is really an ensemble cast. Cerveris and Harris both sang strongly. Baker's take on Sara Jane Moore is laugh out loud funny and O'Hare does well with the manic Charles Guiteau. The material is difficult- a musical about people who have tried to assasinate American Presidents? I don't foresee this musical ever being a "hit," but it is a must-see for people who enjoy theater that requires thought and challenges the audience.    Fiddler on the Roof  Music and Lyrics by Bock and Harnick with Alfred Molina, Randy Graff, Sally Murphy, Laura Shoop, Tricia Paoluccio, John Cariani, Robert Petkoff, et al.  A very different production from the "Fiddler" we all know and love. The set is gorgeous and well-utilized. Molina is an earthy, pleasant Tevye who is well-matched to Graff's strong Golde. I felt this production was more poignant and less broadly comic than the traditional production. The idea of the fiddler, the boy and the beggar being observers or whatever they were supposed to be was a little unnecessary and confusing. A strong production of a classic.    The Frogs  Music and Lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, Book by Burt Shevelove and Nathan Lane, based on Aristophanes with Nathan Lane, Chris Kattan, Burke Moses, Daniel Davis, Michael Siberry et al.   Okay, so I already said that I'm a Sondheim fan. I didn't enjoy this. The music was okay- some of it lovely. The production (still in previews when I saw it) was not gelling. Lane is funny and handles the heavy second act well. Kattan seems lost and unsure of himself, with weak singing. He has since been replaced with Roger Bart. The costumes are lovely and the set works well. Burke Moses is a hunky, well-sung Herakles. The actual frogs are well done too. I'll be interested to see what the reaction to this is when it officially opens.   That's it for now. I'll do the rest later.

      Look, I made a profile. I feel like such a loser.   Okay, so here are some thoughts for today...  I just got home from a dinner for a colleague who is leaving our lovely college town to teach at a middle school in South Florida. Here's the thing...I didn't want to go. This chick is insane and annoying and I'm not sure anyone really likes her. Anyway, I went because I felt guilty about not going. I seem to do that a lot...do things I don't want to because I'm so worried about what people think of me.  I have to go watch "The Amazing Race" now. I've already missed 7 minutes. Oh, by the way, "schmackhaft" means "tasty" in German.

      I'm not sure why I'm doing this...starting a blog, I mean. I guess its cause I've taken to reading all these blogs recently. Or perhaps its because I want to be able to leave a comment at "Go Fug Yourself." Oh yeah...that was the reason. I remember now.
