      I can't sleep. I'll be going to KL this morning 7am. But I am not excited about it. Am I trying to escape from my relationship? Anyway, I am still glad I am going with 2 good friends of mine. At least I can relax for a while.  But when I am back, I still have a problem which I am so afraid to face... That's being single again. It's going to be hard. Yesterday evening, I told Sarah about "tuesdays with MOrrie" is a good book which help me to be strong and sort out my thoughts. However, when night fall I still miss those good days with him. Sad to let it go... but I have stop crying.  I like to thanks all my friends and cousins who called, text me and send me short notes to show their concern. I'll be fine. I have to get out of the misery myself.   Well, he is not the only male on earth. Men in KL here I come. Heehee.....

      Today I spend my whole day in Sentosa alone. I was reading this book called " tuesdays with Morrie" by Mitch Albom. It is a true story capturres the simplicity beyond life's complexities. I found this book by accident, on a bus. And I only start reading it today and completed it too. I cried and laughed reading the book.   There's a sentence said that "there are few rules I know to be true about love and marriage: If you don't respect the other person, you're gonna have a lot of trouble. If you don't know how to compromise, you're gonna have a lot of trouble. If you can't talk openly about what goes on between you, you're gonna have a lot of trouble.And if you don't have a common set of values in life, you're gonna have a lot of trouble. Your values must be alike."...Values is "belief in the importance of your marriage"  A few days ago, I realised that my dear dear don't have feeling for me anymore. I realised I love him a lot but our values are different. It break my heart and I cry over it but I'll detach from it.   It's another chapter of my life.  _______________________________________________________________  "The very thought of you and I forget to do the little ordinary things that everyone out to do.... I see your face in every flower, your eyes in the stars above, it's just the thought of you, my love...."  ________________________________________________________________  Quote "The most important thing in life is to learn how to give out love, and to let it come in."

       I'm glad my cousin and buddy likes the present I get for them....I bought shak a bag from Billibong and Portia pearl set from Robinson and pouch from OP. We had a good time at Sketeches at Buggis Junction, chatting thru' the night. But the food wasn't so good. Guess all of us are not as young as we were anymore. After dinner, we were so lazy to move our butts to another location. In the end, we sat at Skteches till they closed.    Next round Sarah's present will be bought by Tina...good idea?

                       10 Things I Hate About You       I hate the way you talk to me, and the way you cut your hair,    I hate the way you drive the car     I hate it when you stare at other girls,   I hate your big dumb mouth talking cook, and the way you read my mind     I hate you so much it makes me sick; it even makes me rhyme   I hate the way you're always right    I hate it when you lie    I hate it when you make me laugh, even worse when you make me cry   I hate it that you're not around, and the fact that you didn't call,   but mostly... I hate the way I don't hate you ...  Not even close, not even a little bit, not even at all

        Today is Thursday and I got 2 more days to go before my long leave.... Can't wait for the break.    I was shopping this morning at Metro. I tried a few blouses. Oh my God I look so fat! I can't wear them and it look so ugly with the extra meat coming out. In the end, I bought a new set of bed sheets with quilt cover. I really very spendthrift. This month I have over spend again!   Must   stop buying things!     After work, I played badminton with my colleagues. At last I took the first step to lost weight. Wonder how's my darling doing? Hope she has started planning to lost weight too...    Thanks Tina for the comment. I have get over it liao..I still have you guys.      Tomorrow is a better day.

            I feel bad after reading my darling blog.     She wanted so much that we can meet tonight for fish noodle soup at Far East Square.   I'm sorry I can't made it.          Actually, I feeling down over my relationship, which is giving me a headache. I am stucked with making decision on whether to break up or hold on for a few more months. Today, he went out with a girl for dinner, just the 2 of them and he said she was his classmate. Shouldn't I feel jealous? But I don't...what's wrong with me? Actually, I'm angry with him for going Karaoke with his friends yesterday and never tell me, untill I asked him. Why he goes out with his friends and can't go out with me? Even if I took long leaves, he never ask me out, not if it's a weekend..... I hate when he take me for granted!       Anyway, I really need a break! Lucky for me, next week I'm taking one week off to       re-organise my thoughts.  I plan to go Sentosa for sun tanning on 10/08/04 Tuesday morning and do coloring for my hair in the afternoon.   After that Shak will be meeting me.    Tina want to join us?   Call Sarah (hope she is not working), Carol ( chances is higher), Shariza (but i doubt she will be free) and Portia (most probably)......    But the rest of the week, I think I'll stay at home and surf the internet and chat with my friends. Heehee.....         I'll have more time to meet up for coffee or even meet for lunch....so call me! (Provided I'm not lazy)
