      After some serious thought, i have finally decided to just try and create an account here where i can share my thoughts about the life im leading now, the love i've long been searching for, which i have resolved to forget by living a vicarious life.  For starters, i now have a current addiction which i got from first watching the Taiwanese version of the Japanese manga, Hana Yori Dango (Boys Over Flowers), entitled "Meteor Garden".  I cannot resist being hooked with it like a high school student.  I know i'm too old for the heck of this..just turned 27 last month..hehe..but i simply can't help myself.  I was moved by the simple yet very effective performance of the main actors,namely, Jerry Yan (who played Dao Ming Si in the series) and Barbie Xu (portraying Shan Cai along with the former).  They were  spectacular, i must say.  I really can see the chemistry in their performance!  I've watched it for the nth time now, but i just can't get over it.  I still laugh and cry and get mixed emotions along with them.  I don't know why but i feel so young watching them, as if i never aged.  I don't mind if others perceive me as crazy because of this new addiction, as i've not stopped reading fanfictions made in their honor, after all the craze has passed for some time now.  Everyday i read a new story, version or plot in whatever way their fan would write about them, and i just don't know when or how to stop.  Inspite of the many years that passed since it was first aired on TV, say running 4 years now, i just can't get over IT.  I know it might seem like an escape from reality and fear of not having the same kind of intensity in love, but i'm still hoping that someday, somehow God would grant me my heart's desire which is to experience that same kind of intensity in loving which i know is just too good to be true--indeed a manifestation of an unconditional love.  Now for the main stars that i simply adore, i also do hope that someday they will realize that the chemistry in their performances will turn to reality coz i still feel that they do find an attraction with each other while making the series.  How else could they have made such a splendid show which gained them all stardom on their first air?!  And to think they all stayed on the set together for 6 months to complete it.  On one account i could still remember each of them liking the other person and being shy about their confessions.  Sadly, they simply decided not to rekindle the budding attraction.  But who knows, soon enough they might still have the same feeling when paired together again..we'll never know..yet i still pray and fervently hope that it will turn out right for them both soon.  Afterall, its their happiness at stake!
