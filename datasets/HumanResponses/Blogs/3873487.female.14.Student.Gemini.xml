        Trippin Tuesday o6.29`o4
Mood: depressed.guilty 
___It's crazy that the relationship I had over the weekend only lasted 2 days... yet everything that had  happened  seemed like it would have been a 2 month or 2 year relationship. I admit I still do feel guilty and I am depressed over him... but didn't I only take this relationship as an experience? So shouldn't I be feeling slightly guilty and depressed? We had perfect moments, and his personality really did fit mines, but he could never be who I want... We watched the stars, and I could talk to him as if he was my best friend, but when the next day came around, I knew he could never keep that part of him with him at all times. That sweet, understanding, loving side of him... he'll never be able to show it or keep it. By day he's that&nbsp;cocky black man... but OMG! Once you get to know and talk to him, he'll care about you like no one has... well at least for me. I guess it's a really great feeling for some else out there who isn't supposed to love you, to care for u... bcuz I was never really cared for in  that  way. His kisses didn't feel as good as I had dreamt they would. It's odd bcuz only a couple days ago I had a dream that I kissed my ex boy very unprofessionally... and then on Saturday night when Brandon tried to teach me how to kiss, I couldn't kiss as great as&nbsp;I had in my dreams.&nbsp;But how?! I mean I've kissed many guys in my dreams, and  trust  me I could kiss. 
 Do kisses really have to be experienced to be learned ?  
   ___Why can't everyone's good and sweet personalities follow them around everywhere? He was so sweet and understanding the hours we spent talking on Saturday night. He asked me questions that&nbsp;I've always pondered about, in those quiet moments&nbsp;I have,&nbsp;but never really bring up to discuss. It's weird how he's probably and practically everything I've wished for, yet I know that nothing I do will mean anything to him. He'll break up with a girl, and find another one to put in her place. Like he said: 
" I can't keep a relationship for that long... I mean don't u get bored looking at the same face everyday&nbsp;that your together?&nbsp;And kissing the exact same face... Ooo, I can't do that... "  
 It's not  that  hard... I mean now that I come to think of it, it is hard to not be bored of looking at the same face everyday. But you can't be that shallow bout stuff like that, I mean once you love or care about someone truly, nothing like that shit would matter. Too bad all my relationships always end up with a lost friend...

         Waq Ass Wednesday o7.21`o4 
    Mood: completely wiped out by love.  
    ___I can’t understand why I wanted to see   Brandon   that bad, even when I tried to know that there would be a lot of consequences at the end. When I first got up this morning, I wanted to dress “sexy but sophisticated” just for him, and of course, to look good at Grant’s party. I mean… why?!??! Why couldn’t I just think of being myself 24/7 then being someone else’s image? Looking good for a cause that isn’t worth it, especially if you know it, just isn’t right. When Gilbert told me to sit tight and that we’ll head over to   Brandon  ’s after he eats, I swear my heart almost did a flip. But why?!?! I mean not on the fact that yes,  I   DO  want to see him, but on the fact that I still wanted to see someone that made me think so fucking much about them. I am not a person to linger on stupid thoughts for too long, because I believe in being able to proceed and grasp every opportunity that makes its way right in front of your face. If you waste your time with such pathetic shit, your holding yourself back from knowing what could have happened if you took that lil risk that could have indeed changed everything from yourself, to your morals, etc, so yea, my heart waited patiently to see the face that I’ve thought of for so long, especially when it’s a face of a former boyfriend that basically changed you so damn much. I wanted everything to be like what it had last time, that beautiful weekend… but of course, can the past really happen again? Especially when I’ve been looking forward to it for so long and blocking out what is important to me right now??  NAHHHH , never. But it felt so good, yet terrible when our eyes met the humorous moments of him being crazy. I sat on my regular spots, near the edge of his trampoline, watching his black figure jump around and talk and joke. They were playing   Brandon  ’s version of Yu-Gi-Oh dueling. It consisted of you putting down any of you cards, then him “ frying ” your ass with his trap cards, monster cards, and magic cards. So at the end, you’d have a big pile of cards, in the center for claming. Haha, it was really funny, and we hooked eyes a couple times, and it felt great. Of course, it will feel great that moment!!!!! But how the hell will it feel now, that I’m writing this and thinking back of today’s events?!?!?? I feel  terrible . I feel  stupid  that I even got myself and my heart into the stupid business of dating  again !!!!    WHY   !??!?!? I’m stupid!!! Dating was and is the   worst   thing I’ve ever experienced!!!! It’s  always  either person getting  hurt , and this time it happens to be   me  . And I can’t even describe the way I’m feeling right now, I just want to hug and hold  my   boo  real tight right now. And guess who I want to be  my   boo ?  Brandon .  Why ? Because he made me feel so much, experience so much, and learn so goddamn much. And now I just can’t let go. I can, and I probably shall, but just for now, I just want to feel. Feel the happiness and twirls my heart were doing when we connected eyes, feel the pleasurable kisses he gave me,   I JUST WANT TO FEEL  ! Not think, thinking take too much of me for one, and it let’s you dream, which is bad because it isn’t real. You’re imagining, not living. And when we were walking back to Gilbert’s, I felt the precious moments I was living when we were holding hands and waiting to get my first kiss later that night. It felt dream-ish… The results of that were bad though, because I’m sitting here, writing about what has happened these couple of weeks, and listening to  Alicia Keys’ Feelin U, Feelin Me . And when we entered the house and headed for the basement, I felt as if I was a shadow on looking the couple making out on the one person couch. Is that me?!  HELL   YES  it WAS, and I will never damn forget the aching in the pit of my stomach when he nibbled on my earlobe, or the silent whispers. When we sat down to start playing Starfox, I tried to use my mental prediction of where he might sit just so I could be near him and day dream. But that didn’t work, it even back fired. He sat all the way down the row of chairs, and the farthest one away from me.  DAMN  my mental predictions, which are usually right. I was surprised that that had happened, but it never showed. Haha, it was funny when yee-kow-fuu walked downstairs and I looked right into Brandon’s eye and told him to say “ Hi ”. He did, but it sounded weird, he said, “ Good afternoon Mr. Luong ”. I thought that was hilarious because it sounded so unlike him, but hey at least he’s (…trying to…) repair the social image that my uncle has of him. We started to play Uno Attack, and let’s just say he’s not as dumb and clueless as I thought he might have been. We won and lost pretty much on the same level, but the whole first segment of our matches was “ out of mercy ”. I was  MAD  and  pissed  at him, so I guess I decided to take it out on him in the Uno games. I mean what could be better for me than silent feuds that leave the other person wondering if you’re ok? And I  K    NOW    he  K    NOW    ’s    that when I’m silent, it means I’m thinking. But after a lil break, and playing again, but with Gilbert, my silent feud faded as Brandon kicked our butts first, then second round, I kicked all their butts! Gilbert, however, never won while Brandon was playing… ( hmmmmm ) intimidation maybe? At 5:30-ish Jamon and Brandon went home and that’s when the boredom started. Not until like 9:15-ish did they come back for Grant’s little party. I was praying and wishing like hell that they’d change their mind to let Brandon come to Grant’s party. And, like so many other times, when I was out of hope, and I thought maybe all luck was lost, and  ALSO  when I asked Grant about it he said, “ DEF    INIT    ELY     NO , because he was being so mean to me this morning.”……………………………………………   it happens  . There he was, standing at the door with Jamon, at first I thought he wasn’t even there, because all I heard was Jamon’s voice. I also noticed how different a black person looks behind different clothes. I did really like Brandon with his first outfit on the day I met him, and now when he came in with a green, white, and yellow jersey, black pants, and a yellow band around his head, I  S    WEA    R   …. That man looked cute. “ Does Gene have competition with Brandon? ” HELL  YES . I mean they’re both 15, it’s just one failed 7 th  grade. There’s not much of a difference ( no I don’t want to get into ALL the DAMN differences ).  Brandon … he’s perfect for me, it’s just because he’s black and his black side comes along with him. I mean the pimp, lookin good, rapping future, etc. All that, and I think that is perfect for me.  Gene … he’s (… I think …) too damn slow to get the fact that I’ve liked him, and that he’s not experienced.  Experience  is  BAD , because it shows how much they’ve ( or could have .) done it before with other people before you. But if it came to who can make your first kiss so remember-able and make you feel exactly how they want you to feel ( pleasure, good… etc),  experienced is definitely favored. I guess I’d rather the guy have had their first kiss so that they can at least know what to expect and what to make the other person feel when they kiss you. Remember that lil white lie I told? About how my grandma doesn’t exactly get along with Gilbert’s mom, thus that is why I do not see them often? Well when my family got to Gilbert’s house, he asked me about that, and I quickly thought up of another white lie. I simply said that it’s all alright now, and that that isn’t even the grandma I was talking about. I know, I know… really bad story that didn’t fit together as  piece-fully  as I expected ( haha get it ?  Yes me trying to be humorous as this blog gets longer and longer ). After that it was more Uno, and cherishing the moments with the future rapper. Just before I was about to leave though, just when I was standing at the door already  O    UTSI    DE   … I had the greatest desire to run back in there, give Brandon a hug for “that weekend” and for being my bf. I also just wanted to tell him to become that rapper, along with wishing his grandmother wellness and inspiration for always, and just a big ass  TH    ANK    S   . But all I did manage to do was run down the stairs ( check .), hug Grant and wish him a last happy birthday ( where the hell this come from? Ain’t this a lil late ?), and a poke for Brandon, telling him to not do anything illegal ( that was GREAT. What did we plan earlier?? You  HUG  him, not  poke  him and tell him that!!! stupid… now are you wondering what would have happened if you did the hugging plan and not the poking plan ???!). So yes, now I AM wondering what would have happened if I had done that, the scenario (my internal mental image) would have been a kissing scene, not a pondering scene. So even if I had done it, it wouldn’t have mattered really since I won’t be seeing him for the next 1 or so. I asked Grant if he’s taken, yes duh, and I think her name is Jill. And that was it. No more Brandon. NO more memories, just a broken heart, a head-full of cherished moments and bad memories, and a very confuse and lonely soul. Is there any good side to this? Or is this what I’ve deserved for wasting time with a young blood like him? I have no clue, nor do I wish to ponder on that for too long… gottah head forward to the next brick wall. Looks like the last one is almost into crumbs and bits, but it’s still there. Crazy how in about 2 weeks I’ll look back and see nothing but dust and fog, no person, no nothing. Thanks Anh… for all your help and understanding for what I’m going through, even if I’m ranting…

       Sleepy Sunday&nbsp;o7.18`o4  
 Mood: exhausted
 
 
___I spent a total of 5 days at the beach and it was almost a total nightmare. Monday and Tuesday it rained like hell and there was almost no sun till Wednesday. So the first two days we spent running from the rain, and shopping. We didn't swim at all... Anh and I walked on the beach, but  DAMN  was that water cold as  ICE !!! I also can't believe I spent like $20 the first day… haha. All I know now is that I’ve got 3 jackets for school, a pink “shorty” tube top, the Alicia Keys CD, 3 books, fudge, and gum! Now I have enough jackets to live forever with!! Haha, I’ve been running out of outfits for the hook-up so yea… but anyhow, I don’t think I will go ever go shopping again, now I’m just plain scared of stepping foot in front of the register. Anyhow swimming was loads of fun, especially when Anh is like boy-crazy forever. We’ve been doing nothing but checking out guys and life guards. They are so  DAMN  fine… the tan is off the hook, and the body…  DAMN .  PHYSIQUE  people, the physique could make any girl  worship  it. So yea, Anh and I were checking out guys the whole damn time, and catching waves as our eyes pondered (0.v) But I personally didn’t enjoy it as much as I thought I might. It got pretty boring and I was bored. They’re a kind of family that don’t do much, and they only came all the way here to roll onto the beach, but if I went with my family, we would have gone mini-golfing, and done all this fun, cool shit. I was purely bored by the 4th day, but hey I still got loads of contact with all my loved ones (0.v) hehe.

___I think I wasted more time on the phone with Gene then my one family… ooooopps, but it’s all good. I got really scared after  that phone call  but it turns out that everything is just fine. Me and Anh's little lecture on the 2nd or 3rd night really did help me alot. It's so odd how I've always come to think that no one in the world will understand what goes and runs  this&nbsp;azn chica &nbsp;but it seems that I was very damn wrong. She completely understood everyword that was slipping from my mouth. Anh is a very motivated perosn adn it isn't hard for her to get upset when aomeone unworthy beats her at something. And that's whats me and her talked about for almost what felt like 2 hours. I kept bringing up my personal bitch ass issues, while she kept all my rants stright so even I could understand what I was saying. And by the end, we realized that we made up very good quotes and metaphors ^.^ harhar~ (thxx Anh!!)

___I hope that I can find my motivation to impress the world with my bitch ass chinkess attitude... because that's crazily, all I wish for. I'm not wishing for Bling, them Summer Flings with the guys,&nbsp;just a great impression on the world to remember always. I can't truly promise that I won't get side tracked, but hey life's going to hit you up slow and that's what you got to learn to take it. Nice and slow, so everything can take effect on you so that your future will be everything you wished, wanted, and hoped for it to be...

Mood: waiting 
   ___What happens when you run away with nothing but a life within you? And your father died, and your mom’s a drug addict, who just happened to get out of rehab? Would you run away and be spotted last weekend? And also have a detective on your case? Well that’s what one of our former friends decided to do on May 2 of this year. Melissa found her missing profile on the internet… and I guess it was foreseen that this was bound to happen for all she’s been through. She came over and we tried to call the agency but it was being  soo f,cking shitty . I mean a person could have been killed form the speed their servers work at  !!   Then went back onto the internet to look for other missing children agencies, and she appeared yet another site. We called in to that detective and at first he thought we had her tied down and ready to be taken to the police, but then we said that we only had an updated picture of her, so we could help their searches. I made Melissa talk… I was too scared to talk. We finished the phone call, and the detective might even call me for questioning…  scary . Jordan wasn’t all that great of a friend, but I still owe her for lying to her… so this is how I’m going to help her. I wonder when she’ll finally find a family that will love her and turn her back into the normal Jordan, without the drugs, sex, boyfriends, and family shit. God please bless the common sense she needs to hold on strong, and get through all this. I want to see the friends that I’ve had to become great people, not one who regrets ruining her life.

   ___It's exactly like the title says, more of my random rants about things that happen to always bother me. Let’s rant about... my weight! I hate it. Especially last weekend when I wore a bikini to the beach, I mean I want to lose my  TUMMY !!!  I HATE IT !!! I’m not fat, but I’m not on the weight that I want to be on!!! It was weird how I lost 5 lbs bcuz I’ve started to starve myself the whole entire day, making dinner is my only form of a real meal. I think I might go anorexic or something. Even when I was on the trip to NYC, I felt like throwing up every time I ate. It’s not that hard, and plus my best friend said that she’d probably follow me into doing it too. I know I know this is madness, but hey I’m ranting! This is me ranting… so agree with it or fuck off and leave.   
    ___I’m waiting for Gene to come home from his summer school… it’s weird to have these feelings of waiting again. Seems like a long time ago when I actually waited around for a guy. I’m growing up ain’t I? I no longer feel scared for things that will have to happen to me once the future decides to snack me in the face like it always does. But how come the topic of relationships always freaks me out so? It’s always the same topic that causes me to end something that could have been worth keeping, especially with friends. I admit I do miss have Tim and Jacob around, but they were only friends, and well… sometimes you just had to let them go. I just wish that life for me wasn’t all about losing old friends and gaining new ones that I will lose also. Sometimes I wonder if I’ve left any  impression  on anyone so that 10 years later they can remember me as the/that ________ .   
    ___You guys fill in the blank. Tell me what impression I’ve left on you,  good  or  bad , I want to know what you think.

   ___I spent the whole morning wondering about what I was going to wear to Jeannie’s party later. I did come up with that azn top and that black skirt I got from Rehoboth on Sunday… but that didn’t seem to match quite as I thought it would. And plus, the skirt is, weird. It’s a lil shorter in the back than it is in the front!!! So it looks as if some guys wanted to get a butt show, all I had to do was bend over just a little bit!!! I finally came up with the new capris I got and that blueish palm tree top, along with my Tommy Hilfiger purse. I was so spring and blue  J  ! Then I washed my hair, and waited for Lillian to call and come over. When she finally got here, I started Holes, and started eating my breakfast =P the phone rang, and I thought it was another telemarketer, so I just used my weirder tone of voice. The dude said, “Hi, is Cathey there?” I thought the dude said Cassie, so I was like “Huh? Sorry, who did you say again?” Then I finally heard  CATHEY  and noticed it was Gene. LOL, yea I’m so slow… anywho we talked about basically nothing. He had just gotten back from summer school and was bored and tired. Then Lillian showed up in the kitchen to call her mom, I got off the phone and called Gene back when she was done. Melissa showed up not too long after, and they started to watch Holes. Then I started talking to them while I was on the phone with Gene, and it went downhill from there. First, Lillian would not let go of the fact that I didn’t have any tissue paper in my gift to Jeannie, and then there was the fact that my grandmother was there, so they had to sneak upstairs to get the tissue paper. It was funny bcuz I was like saying, “Don’t fall or break anything up there… and no looking through my stuff either” Gene started laughing bcuz he’s never heard me yell before and he found it rather hilarious on what I keep commenting on my friends. Then when they brought up the idea for Uno, Gene left me bcuz he wanted me to stick with my friends and play with them… haha, yea RIGHT, the dude called me back in like 10 minutes wondering if I was gone yet. Can’t live without me huh? Hehehe. So yea I basically stayed on the phone with Gene the whole entire time…  
   ___Jeannie’s party was great! We had fun, but I thought we weren’t bcuz of how Lillian and Melissa thought that Katie hated them, and vice versa. But it turned out to be great, and no one hated anyone! The day passed by with some light clouds, but by the time we got there, chatted, and awaited to get into Jeannie’s car to go see White Chicks, it poured!!! But when we go to the theatre, White Chicks were out, so we went and saw Spider-Man 2. Lillian and Michelle has already seen it, and so they were a lil bored sitting there and napping.  LOL , so anyhow, I thought the movie was way too  LONG , and ending where Peter’s bff was talking to his father, and we were all waiting for him to throw the knife at his reflection into the mirror… that was annoying. After about what seemed like forever, and only lasted 2 hrs or so, we headed back fro Jeannie’s and ate pizza and took pictures. I ate 4 slices bcuz I never had eaten anything at home before, and Pepsi all the way  J  !!! We sang “Happy Birthday” to her, and when she was wishing upon her candles, I spat out “Malfoy’s watching…” bcuz Jeannie was wearing the Draco Malfoy t-shirt she got, and we all laughed. Funny bcuz I never spat out anything like that before, and bcuz I don’t really have a sense of humor… oh well  J  . After that Jeannie took more pictures with us, making us do all these funny poses for the camera… haha. At around 8:45, Melissa and I started to head home,  IN THE DAMN RAIN !!! It started to drizzle and it got a lil heavier by the time I got on my door step.

      ___We finally got that dog we were looking at since 7-23, and she's  ADORABLE !!!!!!!! She's an American Eskimo, all white, with dark dark caramel eyes, a lil pink bald spot near her nose, and has the  sweetest  personality. So far, since Tuesday (that is) she's been making alot of progress. On thursday morning, she wouldn't eat or do anything, no poopy or pee. So that whole day i was basically at my mom's work, waiting to take her to the vet to be examined. I was semi worried about her to tell the truth, because I get he fact that she's realizing ( very   very   very  slowly) that this isn't a trip to a firends house for a day, this is a new home with a new enviroment, new rules, and new family. When we arrived at Layhil Animal Hospital, the examinations began. The staff there was super super nice and they loved Camille! They weighed her, and she lost about a pound and a half... I'm scared for her. One of the staff tld us to go into one of the examination rooms, and she showed us how to apply the flea medication, and then the terror began. They did the physical examination on her (so the appointment on Monday at 5pm is useless) and  OMG  they had to take a poopy and blood sample from her. I can't stand it when dogs cry... it makes you want drop on the floor and start crying hysterically. I've never seen a poopy sample in action, and the moments when Camille was held back and crying and whinning as if she was an inch from a vicious, bloody death... I seriously had teared up and wanted to run to her and hug her to tell her to shoosh. It was crazy to watch the doctor stick a stick up Camille's butt just to get a poopy sample. I mean how can u even dig that far up?? Or down for that matter?? It hurt lie shit, I could tell. The bloody sample was much easier, but if something as painful as that happened to me in one day, I'd commit suicide. Then after the tests results were back, she doesn't have heartworm, so she's completely healthy ^^. That day, we spent like almost close to $100 for her medications and stuff... damn we're spending alot on her... or more like my mommy. I do feel really bad that she has to pay for everything, and especially when we just got back from vacation, fixing our air conditioning, fixing our toilet and sink, and her new jewelery. THings that a mommy will do for their children so they can have everything they didn't have when they were young, and most importantly to be happy. I hate it how I couldn't work this summer, when I need it the most since I got  MY  dog and everything. It almost seems like my mommy only got Camile to make me happy. Mommy I'm grateful and completely happy that your always there for me to love this crazy ass babie girl, but you really don't have to do all this for me, make me do stuff, yell at me!!! I know I can piss you off and all, but I'm only me, and I'm only human, and as a human doing so much for someone who doesn't deserve this much... well it's just feels really  wrong .
___Tomorrow we have to go to Gilbert's abandoned house to mow their lawn... I hope they're having fun in China, because I could have gone with them.  DAMN YOU PASSPORT !!!!! Badminton was great today, I did pretend again, but it felt like what I was supoosed to do, so I just kept at it. I know Gene cares because he'll ask me if anythin gis wrong and if I wanted to talk to him about it. But today, after I said "no", he sorta just left with an "ok". That hurt hunny, that really did...
