       Well managed to   wake up at 6am... went to Mac at white sands for breakfast by myself. Lol not that I'm a loner or what, I just felt like it. it felt so good to walk in the midst of daylight as fresh air starts to fill around me. Even as I walked I walked with a little beat to it, like as if there was music being played in my mind. It felt real good. Then I got home after a good breakfast and went straight back to bed. yet again I woke up at 2pm, had wesern for lunch, went to see Marlina to get the campaign results and then had a last mintue decision to head to Alvin's house. He bought his new MP3 which is so CooL! "envious mode". Lol lucky chap, well he had some problems to it and I helped him out. And in the end he thanked me by lending me his headset. yeah! Lol. Well it was something I always liked. Then I headed to white sands for dinner and did some schoolwork and now I'm back home, sweet boring quiet little messy room. Hmm... I feel so peaceful now, its like there's complete silence that seems to be the loudest around. And yet again I am dazzled by something... man..whats got into me lately? Oh bummer... I just noticed, pup's on my bed sleeping already, lol cute little chap, wonder how he got up there. Well he shall have the bed then, I'm heading to the floor, peace out ya'll. Hope ya guys would be filling ya minds and dreams with hte sweetness of life... Hmm...like me peaceful soundly quiet little buddy DeeJay..

       Well as usual, went to school forgetting to bring the most important file which contains all my homework and ended up re-doing'em in class. Bummer... Anyway I was okay I guess. To think I would pass a test in A-maths based on a topic that I dislike the most, coordinate geometry. Well then there was Parade rehearsal, it was pretty much better this time round, however they still gotta be a little more serious now as ya never know what could happen during the day itself. So yeah I was in school till 6. Well of course I have to thank my friends like Sing Ho, Wee Cheng and Erwin for being with me all the while. They are indeed cool friends to have.    Then we decided...lets go swimming! Lol it was so funny its a Friday but the poolside at DTE was empty! So we had the whole place to ourselves. We started playing and shouting and messing around it was so much fun. I never laughed so much ever in my life...well at least for the pass few weeks. Then we did the lamest of lamest, well there's this mirror thingy wherby the people below can see us swimming. So we started dancing around and my friends were like showing their "erhmm". Lol it was so funny based on the people's faces. So we ended like in a hour and and half time and headed home. Well fun comes...fun goes. Now I'm stuck at home...all alone... Lol hey that rhymes! Peace out ya'll...

       Hmm... something past my mind today, I guess friends have a little criteria within. Its like, when ya wanna comment on something about ya best friend, but just see no chance to just intervene at all. For the first time in so long, Alvin and I just gave a raised eye-brow to each other. Well I'm giving him his space with his partner that is. I've got no right to say "hey! Ya gotta be with me." And ya know that feeling ya have inside when ya see someone else doing it but not ya? Sometimes it makes me wanna find one too. But I guess its just a part and puzzle of friendship.    Anyway Floorball was yet again amazing. Our team won like 10 to 0 or even more than 10, we lost count. Lol. One rule's proven, anything can be done if ya know it can be done. So yeah I felt so good inside. Hope I can maintain my standard anywhere else. Well Had a E-maths mock paper today...man it was tough, but I guess I can do pretty well as I know I've given my best. So I got home after a long day.. had to meet Alicia, but ended up being just with the pup. Hmm...she must have been coupped up by something... ah well... life goes on...

       okay I had to show this to ya guys, my friend Marlina went to this funny web thingy and got a name that was named after me. It goes like this."How to make an eric : 3 parts intelligence, 3 parts self sufficiency, 3 parts leadership Layer ingredientes in a shot glass. Top it off with a sprinkle of lustfulness and enjoy!" Dear me... don't anyone ever dare to make a drink like that okay! Lol. =P

       It was just awesome today, 5 maths period free of being taught. So the rest of us were just trying out this mock paper for A-maths and come to think of it.. it seemed pretty easy.Well I still need more practice though. Then during recess I forgot to wear my tie and got caught by little vixen(Nat) and paid a dollar fine... she had better use that money for herself and not to put in the councillor fund.Lol. Well then there was a couple more boring classes which turns out that we learn nothing at all. But the fun part was in the Physics lab. We had to do this balancing thingy with a ruler but we just couldn't so we ended up playing with plasticine. Lol it was so weird we were like creating our own animal planet. I made a lion, snail and even a dino..which of course had nothing to do with the practical work but when there's fun, who cares! Lol. Well I did know what teh practical was all about so I guess its fine with me, its just the rest of the classmates who joined the safari. Well during physics remedial, did this test and had like a half an hour break, with the lovely cooling weather I couldn't help but nap....nap till I didn't even know my my paper was handed in. Had an awesome dream too..lol. So in chemistry remedial we had like half the class present, and we got back our test papers. I passed!!!!!!

       Yeap...yet again my services in NCC is required.Not to train, rather more of motivating them, telling every unit that they are good and they should bring out their best. Well as for Alex... I can understand his situation when he needs to get things right, howeer my suggestion to him is to keep a smile and lets things flow fluently and in the right manner. So in the end everyone wins. Well I'll certainly pray for the company(all uniform groups) and of course the brave souls of Shi Min to give her very best this coming National day. Like I promised them I will be there to advise them to make it a more thrilling and enjoyable parade to witness.Go people! =)   Oh and Mr razak has approved my services to help Band in footdrill. He made it sound so grand though...I kinda liked it in fact.lol. Well well enough of boasting about myself, now I wanna focus more on the company and parade. I hope I am able to satisfy their standard on the day itself. Well I gotta go get something to eat I'm starving! Lol peace out ya'll!

       Well I'm in school now, using the school computer lab to do some chinese work, I'm so lost in reading the question...not that I even know how to type in chinese.Lol I'm using this chinese translator thingy to get my language right. Anyway its like 10 more minutes before this lesson ends and I'm I've learnt nothing new at all since this morning. Guess its just gonna be another long...long...boring day. Well at least for now I can think of what to have for recess... "hungry hungry little old me".Lol. =S

       Hmm... just got back not long ago from MAC at whte sand after studying... well rather more like helping Isa out wit a couple of Maths question. Then I bought this really cool ring, well my bro used to have the same one whch I fell in love with so I decided to get myself one too. Well so after white sands I headed to TM for Long John Silver. Man ya should have seen what we did. We kinda had some uncooked fish and extra fries plus a small cup of Sprite. Isa dumped the whole piece of fish into the sprite and I added in some spices( fries and the little crunchy bits) and he took a photo on it. Man it was sick. But it wasn't the end of it, we even added on some chilli or was it ketchup, man it was disgusting! So we left the place in a secon dor so. Lol. So so I got home, and my bro(Jake) told me some really annoying and mean news, well of course its something against us and yeah, there might be changes on for us then.Can't say anything yet... maybe someday, sometime.&nbsp;Hmm... I can't imagine, a new environment with different friends all over again. My social circle seems to be extending all the time... how amazing.. Anyway off to bed I will, so as to ya guys. Peace out ya'll! Pleasant dreams! =)

       For the second time in my life, I sleep for a perfect 14 hours. Since mid-night till this after at 2. Well so obviously I missed school which I am not really happy about but I had really bad sore eyes this morning, so yeah my weekend's extended. Not going to school today&nbsp; might get some friends in trouble though, one- the results for last week's campaign, I have'em and they are suppose to be up by today! Two- Haslinda might be bored since I ain't there to let her pinch me all the time, hey wait...wickkkeeeddd... Lol. Well&nbsp;thats about it I reckon. Anyway now I'm dead bored and I'm gonna entertain myself with...whatever i can get to do. Peace out ya'll!&nbsp;

       Well woke up at 7am...erm okay more like 7.30 and had to rush to prepare for tuition first which was at 8, man was I still in the "dead brain" mode.So tuition was cool, managed to get a year paper done for A-maths while my tutor was playing with the pup. Lol.So I hurried to church at around 10 plus plus, and service was kinda odd, it was a mix session with chinese, so it took longer I guess as the pastor had to translate the words into chinese for the chinese chaps.    Okay I was so mad this morning when I took some wrong information for Iris to get the results recorded. Hope she wasn't angry. Yeap... after church I went to Selatar with Jake and his mum(my god mother rather) to have lunch at the counctry club. The houses there were gorgeous! Kinda brought back memories of how Australian houses looked like, though the weather is the only difference. So I headed home with god mum's yummy cheese cake, can't wait to eat'em with my brother Dickson. Lol. Well I'm about to head out to meet me other bro(Alvin) to play pool, study, play with my pup and watch Ju-On 2!!! Freaky!

       Pity school was kinda boring with Chemistry class. Lol we were so daring, we were listening to our MP3 and radios and discman and stuff like that during his lesson which of course he didn't notice at all. So yeah we escaped it good, though it shan't be repeated again. So I spent my day on MSN chatting...staring at the plain screen... played with little DeeJay and got biten on the thumb.Lol. Around 6 pm my butt got sore with all the sitting so I decided to head to Jake's( my bro/ closest friend) place to study. I was so glad I managed to finish at least 3/4 of my homework. I headed back home cycling in the lovely drizzle, had dinner and again went out, however this time round it was to TM with Jake. It was kinda lame, we were like going in and out, back and forth all the time but bought nothing. So our final destination... Swensens! Bought this really delicious gorgeous looking cookie summit and&nbsp;ate to my fill. Yeap, thats been yet another day for me... hope something rather more interesting with occur tomorrow. Anyway I'm heading off to watch wrestling, peace out ya'll and pleasant dreams.

       Well apparently something came over me today. I feel more...free. Lol its like memories that circled the mountains finally reached upon its peak and extinguished through thin air, of course with the help of the ever lasting strong wind that help me blew it away,The breathe of God and his infinite love for me and all, was indeed that wind that I needed so much. Now he has created a new mountain of memories for me to begin with, the memories of my friends and family. Well anyway coming back to reality, today I practically failed my both A-maths mini test for I forgot to study for them...or more like had a mental block, anyway that ain't inportant for now, at least I know where I stand and work for better grades. I'm so glad I was able to help a councillor friend today, hope I made things better for'em all. Had a good meal, grapes and now I'm heading off to the&nbsp;chatroom. Peace out ya'll.

       Hmm... first day on this thing. Don't know why I decide to create one. But I guess its to express myself rather than keeping within. I know I know, I'd rather get a diary. But sometimes its good that others see whats up with me as I tend to be not myself these days. Reasons are behind them undeniably. Well... this is the beginning of my chapters of  urlLink recovery ...

Well its going fine lately...i think.lol. Anywya today was a pretty sluggish day. Went to chruch, after which we headed to the mall to watch a movie with a bunch of kids from my school, but ended up playing at the arcade.Lol. I fell in love with the percussion freak again! Lol. Ah well everyday there's always something or someone to like. Well of course not talking about the "someone" for i ain't that kinda guy. Hmm... yesterday was another remarkable day spent...don't really wanna go into detials but just to know it was a good day. Well its about 9 plus night now, it's time for me to head to the tables to finish up all my homework. Well I'll be in here again aite. Peace out mates!Have a great night ahead!

       Tension surrounds the place around the graduating level, the chinese results were out. Not many were anxious to recieve it, though some were too scared to see what they got. Me? I didn't really care... not that i like the subject anyway. But still the anxiety was still there.All I could think of was Iris saying "I won't get a F9." That was so sweet of her, yet I still had the thought of getting my dream come true. Well I got back my result, as I said, if I scored a F9, it'd be a dream come true for I dreamt all the days before that I'd get a F9 for chinese. Lol bummer... my dream didn't come true,Iris was right..I scored a D7! So my eyes turned to Alv first, but for the first time, Alv went to others before coming to me, I was looking high and low for him to let him know what I got. For me to smile and be happy for him upon hearing his score comparing to mine, yet he was with others carrying the joy around. Ah well... life goes on.lol. I sound so stuck up huh? Anyway then came the afteroon, English oral started. I was first in line, man I was so nervous, lol okay okay the truth, not really in fact. Thanks to the time keeper teacher. She was nice. She had a short chat with me and I felt kinda relaxed and more confident. Well I had to enter the room, I was shaking not physically, but mentally. Lol I was polite to my best all the way. They were really really nice and friendly invigilators, comparing to the chineses ones, geez.. they were bad. Anyway they were nice, I treated them as friends rather, for they carried that kinda attitude. Everything went flowrously, I felt that the path out of the room turned floral. Geez I was with smiles even till the evening. Guess I felt really confident and joyous about my performance. Well not that I didn't still feel the little(the slightest in fact) sad with my chinese results. But hey... no giving up yeah. Peace out ya'll.

       The real comments appear when something isn't of a lie. I feel that I am taking granted for even my own chance of hearing and speaking, when others, who are unable to ever receive this marvellous gift would express themselves so well. If I had that million bucks, I know where it'd end up. Yes its true that I find Singapore Idol a nonsensical programme for the famous Singlish we have. But the participants have yet to make me feel anymore pitied and ashame that I had insulted the progamme. For from this hour of TV show, we could all see the beauties of unfortunate youngsters. I bet a hearing that if that lady, who was deaf, could hear, she would have been in the finals for sure. That guy who had voice defection, I bet with him a voice, that he too will end up in the finals, no matter what situations are like for them, they will remain someone, rather something that I will do for sure, when I grow up earning money. For they should deserve this gifts, though natural to us, but something special to them, as they will one day be the level of inspiration and of an IDOL themselves. This is the true posession and meaning of being an IDOL, not to immitate someone, but to be one to others. For once we can see that humans are afterall still humans, feelings and expression still flows. For today, tonight, the judges showed their true opinions, not just saying things to make them happy, but words of encouragement, and proudness of these people. May God bless them will a fulfilling and a happy life forever.    Even the most ruthless judge made someone feel good about themselves, guess it really takes back what I said before huh. Yet again I learnt something new, something that my feelings have taught me. Always be grateful to even being a perfectly normal person, whether rich or poor. See how feelings play about in one's life... one guy,who lost his father, sang for his late father. Words that are meant, are words that would win. I hope he keeps his feelings, not of condolence, but of a motivation, for his family, and for his own bright future, and to do his late father proud. I believe he will be blessed no matter what happens in the end. Today my mates, we should all carry a tear in our eyes for these future IDOLs. Peace out ya'll.

       Yet today I couldn't bare to hold back my smile. There;s always someone in school who'd just upon sight, would make ya smile. I guess its human nature to keep a smile for at least a moment of the day. Its not that ya wanna show it, it just...appears. Lol weird how I put it in that sense. But still I do know that even the most crooked person would have a pleasant thought in his mind that'd make him smile, even without reasoning. Hmm... no wonder the saming goes, "friends brighten ups ones day." Its just goes to say who really can be a friend and who can't. Thank god all my friends are true friends, be it even just a schoolmate who I barely meet.    Well today I went to court with my family to settle my brother's court case. Finally it was the last hearing. He is put under probation. Lucky him, or rather that was something expected. But even the best in language makes mistakes in grammar. Man we had to wait so long just for them to amend their mistakes. Ours took like only 5 minutes.Lol. Well I got home and rushed back to school. I thought though I missed the whole day of lesson, doesn't mean I should miss the extra classes, and I live near the school anyway. So yeah, now I am home, gonna start to prepare for my English O level Oral which is tomorrow. Its thrilling to be the first in line! Lol. Well anyway peace out all my friends! Do help me to boost my confidence in getting tomorrow's O level chinese result back though! Thanks!

       Hey mates...its been long since I last came in here. How's it going? Sorry Jake I was studying the whole day today. Geez... I just realised something on Saturday, actually when I was "high". Man... its been like ages since I last did something like that. It was only one mug, then twiced, darn... it was bad. At the Village, I looked up, star gazing brought about some thoughts. True in fact, but hard to believe. I realise I'm better off being a lone ranger. Why? Lol... simple reason, its like, everything ya do, some people do approve, some don't. But am I here to meet their demands? Am I here to satisfy them all? Why do I have to worry what others would think of me, even when I am doing the right thing. I just looked at the stars real hard, not to count'em, not to bore myself, but try to be like one of 'em. All alone, far away from one star to another. What would that little star feel being all alone. The right thing of it to do is shine itself, let others see that that particular star is standing out, not hidden in darkness far into the galaxy. Thats its only purpose, whether ya like it being there or not, its just there. No other stars are gonna bump into it and say "hey, ya're taking my spot". So its like, I rather be by myself, thinking for myself, helping myself. The Os ain't something whereby we all stand the same, but rather will I have better grades or the one behind. Its like, why should I drink when I am told to. Yeah, in fact thank god I drank that day, for I thought so deep, deep that I could still think. Tab.. my best friend, online all day but not a single greeting at all. Jake in Poly, barely have time to be well organised for an outing, Alv, having someone close to him, I gotta give that space. Its not them to be blamed, rather myself. I put myself in that position whereby I stand to feel...weird after. Its been the DX- generation that turned me lost, but I found myself, Aims made me sad, but I found myself. Now them... am I to be lost again just because I can't find my best friends at times? Geez... I stand back now, far back. But yet yesterday and today I took one step forward in helping a friend, to help him do well in his prelim, so we sat, while others were partying, we sat there, studying and pushing from one subject to another. Realising, I rather be seated, than with others. A lone ranger stands out, but gains to lose alot, be discriminated, insulted, ignored. But still stand out, not for others but himself. Should I be one of that? Who are my real friends... or rather what are they..    Today I stand to realise why we should be like plants in forest, always fighting to be taller than the other, why? Only to survive longer. The only person that stays within ya, is yaself. And it took my a mug and a star to see this. Every minute, every second counts. Be it getting a better life, getting a supporter, getting what ya want, just like a race, first to the line wins, be it a split second behind, ya still lose. But losing in a winning way its what we have to see.To see whats the next step to take, not to sit and wait. But yet there's always someone to "light my fire",always someone to help ya. No reason to look for someone, try ya best, let them see it, and let them come, to light or relight ya fire.But till that day comes, it'd bring a smile or a word of phrase from me and to me. Guys I've done this thinking for so so long. Turning into something else could take place anytime, its just the moment of time that comes. For me, it came, yet now I am trying to push back, real back.Don't help me though, I have to do it on my own, do not be disturb by my ignorance, nor my hypothetical behaviour. Lol fancy me using that word...but I chose this way, just gotta see when this way will come to an end. Silence brings about changes to yaself, can it be broken? Will I allow it to be broken? Till then mates.. till then...

       Well to start off, it was annoying to wear the old green uniform again. I was so lazy to put on the badges and my Headwear was atroucious>lol bummer. Well who cares...I still had to go to school anyway. So I reached school, had a good morning greeting with Nat and Marlina, went to my seat and in the hall and starting crapping about everything with Alvin. It was so lame we weren't allowed to watch the parade from the parade square so instead we watched it over a projector which of course had no sound system.Geez... So yeah then came the silly boring long award giving. Not that I recieved anything from all that I've done but just a memento, maybe that's the reason for my apathetic behaviour. Then we had to sing the national songs and stuff like that but I didn't take part for I found it quite silly. I know I know I'm being hypothetical but by now I reckon ya should know why. The best part only was to see the ex-graduates again. They looked different but still the same. Lol. So there was a reception which I ate to my fill and then I helped bring the hampers to the Old Folk's home. Lol we had such a jolly time there joking and messing around.I was like pretending to be one of those folks being relunctant to leave school. Even Mrs Pang was giggling about how I acted.lol it sure was a fun trip to the home. Glad to know that we were able to bring about a smile upon their faces.Its like, they're better off being there with the friends then being with their family members who ill'treat or rather leave them with no one. Thus proving something, friends are indeed important, its just how ya make use of ya friends and WHO are ya friends that counts. So yeah that was about the morning, then we came back to school, took photos, played around stuff like that. headed to central for Bubble tea for the juniors, I only bought some peanuts.Lol don't know why but I just wanted to buy some. I reached home feeling so tired that I slept from 2 to 8pm just now.Geez... and when I woke up, no one was home but little DeeJay and me.Well the usual, I starved. Just hope that mummy or daddy would buy back some food for me. Anyway I'd gotta go sleep in the shower waiting, peace out ya'll.

       Hey guys...finally my com's back online through serving the net. Geez there were like so many crappy stuff in my com which was jamming it up. Anyway nothing much has been going on. I've just been slacking at home doing nothing and studying...well hardly of course.Lol. Oh yeah went to play pool with bro the other day and it was so so fun. Its weird everytime we play we end up doing something cool(also known as a tyco trick shot). Well the other day was weird as the orange ball that was like so close towards the far end hole, I had to hit the white ball so hard that upon collision, the orange ball bounced backwards, balanced itself by the edges of the table and came towards the other dar end at top speed! I was like..."what the.." then we burst into laughter.Lol. It was so cool still. Well then today I my day was pretty good, had some stuff to do for Parade tomorrow, and geez after so so long I've gotta get back into my NCC uniform for the very last time.. Hmm... Yipee? Lol. Well I'm off to get something, perhaps its food or whatever I can get then. Peace out ya'll.

       Finally I get to use the computer again. My dad was like messing around with the cable wires and all. Well at least now we don't have to move the cable wire around no more.lol. Anyway yesterday was weird. Missed church... went out with Jake and in the end we watched a movie. I-robot was awesome! Its like any normal detective kinda show but man was it really really cool. Ya guys can't miss out on it ya don't know what's ahead of ya. lol. Well today was good. We had three free periods and I ended up during some revision, which was good of course. Then went along with friends to have a chat. Well then came after school... english remedial. Lol our class are united! Well apparently the teacher was gonna go through some comprehension that other classes haven't seem to have done but our class did. So at first like 3/4 of the class just walked out of the hall leaving the teacher in "pissed mode". So the rest of us were reluctant to stay to but we just did. Within the next minute the teacher was like "Ya guys decide to stay or not go." So we immediately stood up and left.Lol it was so cooL!!! Then everyone else was just standing by the stairs and when they saw us they all cheered! It was so so cool. Anyway we all then headed home and now I'm gonna help my mum make some really delicious sugar sweet. Rock on guys!
