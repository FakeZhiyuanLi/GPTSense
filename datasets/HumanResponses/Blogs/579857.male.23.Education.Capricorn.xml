       Greetings in the name of Jesus!  Romans 7 15 I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do.  16 And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good.  17 As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me.   without comtemplative "chewing" on verses like this, i'd be left at, "huh?". you know P. Min fasted, prayed and reflected on it. here are some sermons on it. listen to God more carefully.  urlLink here's one ,  urlLink here's the other .   here's my breif understanding of it.   when God gave the Law through Moses, our Sin was revealed. though we did not know what Sin was until the Law came, we still had it. the Law made us slaves to Sin. because of the Law, we are now accountable to our sins. by the Grace and Mercy of God, through Jesus, we are set apart from our sins and are freed from the Law and along with that, the punishment deserved for Sin. see  urlLink The Passion of the Christ .  growing Christian or sometimes sinning hypocrite? good desires vs. sinful desires. though we are set apart and freed, are we sinless? did Jesus or does God expect us to become Sin-less in this life?   i only know of One who lived without Sin. everyone before and after Him lived with sin. but because Jesus died for us, we are justified. in justification, we are considered sinless and are adopted into His family. in adoption, we are His perfect children, because of the blood shed by Jesus. in us, He sees Jesus. while we live in this world, we are being sanctified. in sactification, we are becoming more like Jesus here in this world. it is our part to persevere, with the help and strength given through the Holy Spirit.  (post publication addition) know the phrase "do what i say, not what i do"? i believe this is typically used in the context of hyporites. the response of this hypocrite is that i must make what i say, what Jesus did. Give Him the glory so that despite what i do, what i say points others to the cross.  2:33AM, May 31, 2004  By His Grace and Mercy, Gill

       Greetings in the name of Jesus!  because she called me to see how i was doing this weekend, this blog is dedicated to my playmate of the year, miss JAnette (shown below)    she went all the way home to MD/DC a couple weeks ago. i miss her lots. now i'm on campus and almost everyone i know is in Chicagoland or elsewhere.  JAnette and i began hanging out a lot this past semester. she knows me pretty well and feeds my heart well (see  urlLink This Love-Me Success ). we hungout so much that random people in CFC even began coming up to me and asking what was going on. i assure you, we are good friends. just cuz i have many more female friends than males doesnt make me a playa or pimp. hate the sin, not the sinner. besides, i'm just me. coming from where i wanted to go, going to where God wants me to be. if you knew me, you would love me. just playin', i'm so terrible!  ;p  thanks for caring!  here she is back home with a new sensual haircut, showing off fashionable lunchboxes (click to see her blogger):  urlLink     anyways, we visited my hometown/Chicago and her hometown/DC, which i've never been. i donno why spending time with girls is considered taboo in our church culture, but i still love CFC. just gotta play the wise old man role i guess. if my life offends you, look at the offense of the cross. man, i just plank-eyed you. lemme get that piece of dust outta your eye with my elbow.   love God more, Gill.

       Greetings in the name of Jesus!  i will fast from tv. well except for basketball. because it helps me chat with nonChristians at IMPE. anyways, here's why...for lent i fasted from all types of Law and Order. believe you me, that was tough. it's my favorite show. there's lots of drama and a feeling of compensation and closure at the end. none of the relational drama i know about.   anyways, being summer and kinda bored down here in the apt alone, i've taken up a lot of television watching. so now i will fast for...forty days. i hope i have the right heart in doing this. in place of TV i will read, read and read. cuz i dont read much. i will still watch movies if it means i'll be spending time with people and building relationships for God's glory. basically, i'm fasting from wasting time, letting TV fill me unhealthily.   i will break fast after June 30th, so we'll see where i'm at July 1st. God help me!  By His grace and mercy, Gill

       Greetings in the name of Jesus!  hi friends,  soon after finding an apartment with two faithful Christian brothers (Chris and Aurum), God provided for me a job at the YMCA. i began helping as a temporary bus driver for the program. as time went on i became a more regular bus driver and helper for the program. second semester, the person i was helping left and i took over as Coordinator.   in addition to the responsibilities i had before, as Coordinator of the Fun Pass program, i had to plan monthly activities, update families with what was going on and take on full responsibility of the students and program. as i took over, a rapid growth in attendance occurred. this was worrisome and stressing for me. the majority of the students were first time Fun Passers, as i was, so we had to get used to one another. though there was only one of me, there were days where i had to take charge of 20+ junior high students. but i can testify that God is good and has taught me a great deal through this experience.   as the school year comes to a close for my students and me, there is a dwindling of attendance. part of the reason is the warming weather and the disciplinary problems some students have, at school/home, with parents.   i am now debating if i will return as Coordinator or just come in as an assistant. i want to stay in these students' lives, but i also want to choose where God wants me to be. i havent seen fruit of change of heart, but i feel confident that God has placed me there for a reason. i just want to share God's love for these students. i feel convicted that many people dont see that love without the committment behind it.   we must live consistant, Christ-like lives.   Gill

      i feel very displaced right now. i havent gone to morning prayer since last week. i just wake up, eat, get ready for work, work, come back to the apt to eat and watch tv, take care of pookie, then talk on AIM till it's too late and repeat.   i've been experiencing a lot about double-motives. whether it is brought up by someone or comes from something i read or listen to. what is God trying to teach me? i know i need discipline and even ask for it on occasion. why does God love me so much? i want to get myself out of this slump, i dont like it at all. i feel distant from people and God. but the true answer is...  i need God. only by the grace and mercy of God. go to the cross!

      for those of you who stumble across here randomly, this may or may not make sense. the senior pastor at my church here at school,  urlLink CFC (covenant fellowship church) , pastor min, wrote his doctoral thesis on the heart motives of people.   this may not be totally precise, i still have a lot to learn about heart motives. basically, every person has one major heart motive, but there are different layers and minor(s). your layer determines how your major reacts. your minors are the other heart motives that come out, but your major is the basis of why you do the things you do. your heart motive, layers and minor(s) are what makes people different. with a better understanding, you too can redeem your heart and love God more.   there are four heart motives; love-me, like-me, respect-me and perfect-me. then you have success and failure layers. everyone has one heart motive and is in one of the layers, but in different situations and with different people, other layers or minor(s) will surface.   click it to learn a little more about  urlLink heart motives .  now on to me...remember, this is me, not love-me successes in general. my minors may show through this paper.  This LOVE-ME Success    DEFINITION  This love-me success honestly believes that if you do not love me then you do not really know me. To know me better is to love me more. God so loved the world...Jesus loves me, therefore you should love me. That is the sinfulness of this heart.  RELATIONSHIPS  People who talk to me and spend time with me consistently, feed me. The time and/or priority someone gives me shows they love me, which shows they know me. I am also fed by constant and consistent pursuing from anyone, unless you are unlovable to me. Do not worry, I am redeeming this grossness.  CHOSEN ONES  Because of my selfishness, people are in concentric layers (circular levels with a common center) in relation to me. This is not to be confused with heart motive layers.  Chosen ones are people who have "passed" my testing process. They are in my inner most layer. This may have taken many years to come to fruition. Potentials are in process of testing. They may be determined at meeting, or after passing a few general tests. Close friends and aquaintancees may be potentials. Potentials are non-chosen ones as are everyone else.  My family does not seem to be my chosen ones. To me, they are required to love me, so their love is not as genuine, though I know it is. I have few close friends whom I consider chosen ones. With my chosen ones, I desire to spend more time with them. I am not afraid to chase after them, though they may reject me infinite times. With potentials or non-chosen ones, there is a testing period. After a few missed meetings/unreturned calls, I am turned away. Generally, I am testing everyone, I have many potentials. I tend to seek out or settle for relationships when I am not getting fed. My currant SG members may become my chosen ones for a short period of time, but basically they are potentials. They just get a head start on everyone else because I have a predisposition to love them.   SITUATIONS  I do not get fed by casual nods/handshakes in a large crowd situation. I would rather have a chosen one come to me and spend time with me. I think it makes me feel loved or show my lovability.

       1. Please explain how your past personal and professional experience make you a quality candidate for the position for which you are applying.   I believe I am a qualified candidate for the teaching assistant opening for early childhood summer session at Washington. Though I have not decided which teaching certificate to attain, I am convicted to pursue teaching opportunities. These convictions began to formulate after my summer job, teaching English in Taiwan (The Silent Teaching Center 2002). In the fall of 2002, I took education classes at UIUC and volunteered at King’s Club International. By the New Year, I was fully committed and am still pursuing different teaching opportunities. I want to assist at Washington because it would give me experience with early childhood students in the classroom setting.  Being born in Taiwan, but raised in America, I jumped on the opportunity to teach what I learned to students at The Silent Teaching Center. For two months I taught three intermediate level ESL classes with students ranging from 8 years of to high school aged. More than learning the routine and developing classroom material, I learned a passion for my students to come to class and take something away that is useful. I am still passionate for that.  When I came back in the fall, having completed almost all of my required business classes, I decided to take some education classes to further develop my teaching and understanding for any of my future students. I enjoyed the classes and genuinely felt like I was learning. At the same time, I wanted to continue to work with children, so I signed up to volunteer with King’s Club International. Coming from a predominately upper-middle class family living in suburban chicagoland, I had to adjust to the differences in race and socioeconomic status of the families we served. It was through this ministry that I gained a love and compassion for inner city children and their families. It is through these experiences that I continue to be committed to kids as a whole, to actively make a difference in their lives.  I am currently employed at the YMCA as the Fun Pass Coordinator. The Fun Pass program is an after school program for junior high students in Champaign County. The goal of this outreach is to give lower income families a place to send their children to have safe and active fun. I began as a temporary bus driver who helped out with the program, but after a semester of commitment to the students, I was offered the coordinator position. There was no transition period from my previous coordinator to myself coordinating, so I quickly had to learn to discipline these students while adjusting to their level in order to reach out to them. In the midst of that, we experienced a rapid growth in attendance as students learned of the program. I continue to run the program with very few, if any volunteers, all the while planning field trips and activities for discontent, complaining junior high students. Though some days are very difficult, I am committed to them, knowing that I may be their only positive interaction for any given day or even week.   I know that anyone can love young children, and I do, but I think I can give more to Washington. Based on my past experiences, I have learned and adjusted for my students. I am fully committed to their lives and learning, even when it is difficult to love them. I am learning that being a teacher means you serve and are no longer being served.

       Greetings in the name of Jesus!  June 23-27, 2004 was CPTPC retreat 2004 was awesome. how great it is to be totally dependant and blessed by God. i am not worthy, but i am available! more later...  Ephesians 6  The Armor of God     10 Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power.  11 Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes.  12 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.  13 Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand.  14 Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place,  15 and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace.  16 In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.  17 Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.  18 And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints.    19 Pray also for me, that whenever I open my mouth, words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel,  20 for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may declare it fearlessly, as I should.    Final Greetings     21 Tychicus, the dear brother and faithful servant in the Lord, will tell you everything, so that you also may know how I am and what I am doing.  22 I am sending him to you for this very purpose, that you may know how we are, and that he may encourage you.    23 Peace to the brothers, and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.  24 Grace to all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with an undying love.  By His grace and mercy, Gill

       Greetings in the name of Jesus!  YMCA Fun Pass ended the last school week of May and then i was jobless. i knew i could stay at 908 Stoughton #1 'til our subletters moved in. so the plan was to find a job and stay on campus somewhere, somehow. in the midst of Fun Pass ending, i was working with Karen for the YMCA Fun Bus. Fun Bus is a free YMCA on wheels. we bring equipment and sports to the community and run YMCA activities. it can range from a group or class of twenty students, to an entire grade level at a school to an entire school or community. along with Fun Pass, which runs Mon to Thurs, in the last two weeks i helped with Fun Bus Friday and Saturday. the week after Fun Pass, i worked with the Fun Bus on Wed, Thurs and Fri. it was still not going to be consistent work and pay, but i was grateful. in the midst of that i was praying and thinking about what other jobs i could do to stay down in chambana. i know God has something great in store for me here.  that same Friday, June 4th at about 9:30am, i received a call from Andy. i knew that she was in charge of the YMCA's summer camp programs, so i assumed that Chad talked to her about being a substitute bus driver for the summer. but to my surprise, she offered me a permanent position as a YMCA Summer Camp bus driver. i would work consistantly five days a week fulltime. O PRAISE GOD! He totally provided on this one! i was gonna apply at Wal-Mart or some random restaurant, but instead i get to use my limited skills and work with kids. how amazing is that?  now, after a week and a half driving for the Summer Camps, i can kinda see where God wants to use me. all the kids know me by name. thanks to the counselors who treat me like another counselor rather than a bus driver. i can see what God means when he glorifies the humble. i would have been content serving kids as a bus driver, but here i am, being appreciated and included in their lives. i am probably the only staff person this summer that all the kids and counselors know in name. that is so amazing to me. this probably feeds me in many ways, but i just want to serve God in whatever way He has chosen this summer. like i've said before, i dont know exactly where i am going, but i know that right now i'm in the right place, cuz God is in control. if this life was up to me, i'd probably be a businessman somewhere else, making lots of money, growing farther and farther away from this God who loves me. what a privilege it is to know my God wont let me go that easily.  By His grace and mercy, Gill

       Greetings in the name of Jesus!  i have moved to  , Champaign, IL 61820. it is also known as John Randolph Atrium, or stricty ATRIUM, though there is another Atrium on Lincoln, across from UnicoRn.   i have taken over Dean's (aka Ding Ou) room. the apt is kinda dirty, but i'll work on that, starting with my bathroom. my roommates this summer are Jonathan Choe, who Justin and i were supposed to live with originally, Matt and Estin. i'm excited to have the chance to live with Jon before he leaves campus. we are gonna have tons of fun.   the first full day here we had a huge Dimsum dinner with Catherine Yoon's friend Mo. he's a great cook. we started at 7pm and ate around 12:30am. it was crazy good though. we made a ton of dishes from scratch. it took a long time cuz it was for 8 people. i think dimsum is made to be eaten out, the price to time consumtion we experienced proves this. Pheonix anyone? even better, let's go to HK!  more fun stories later i'm sure...  By His grace and mercy, Gill

God'll take care of the rest.   sometimes i feel so misunderstood and unloved. no one even wants to take the time to get to know me. what is there to know about me? why do i think i should be loved? what am i worth? the blood on the cross? of course, but it's not by my blood, but the blood that covers me. because of Him i will get through my hurt heart and persevere.  ONLY by His grace and mercy, Gill

       Greetings in the name of Jesus!  this Tuesday and Wednesday, i spent the school day playing with 1st graders and kindergardeners respectively through the YMCA Fun Bus. OH MY GOSH, they are so cute!  i saw a lot of my King's Club kids there too. most of them are 2nd graders or older, but i had some kindergardeners today. it was good to see them, and they actually recognized me. i made some new friends too, but i'm biast to my kids first. OH I MISS THEM!   seeing them a few times a week, through the program and home visits will leave the deepest of memories with me. it really makes me thing what kind of work/ministry should i persue? i know that where i am now is exactly where God wants me, but how do i figure out where He wants me to be in the future, or how to get there? i feel really slow when it comes to hearing and listening to His voice.   i am so grateful that in the midst of looking for a job and finding direction, God provides me with simple loves and joys. may i continue to live and be a blessing to everyone i encounter. all things in His great timing.  By His grace and mercy, Gill

       Greetings in the name of Jesus!  why should i convince you to see it? are you gonna have the same convictions from God after seeing it? maybe, maybe not, dont read on. just go see it! enough said.  soldiers in Christ, "Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes." Ephesians 6:11...another way to look at it, superheros in Christ, embrace your supernatural powers "of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes."  my revolution...how clear the picture of the Christan fight comic book writers create! what other reason is there for "supernatural beings" to have flaws? Christians are in a supernatural battle 24/7. though we have flaws, we have an awesome God in which to trust. our powers are not of ourselves, but a gift that can only come from God.  according to Ben Parker, "With great power comes great responsibility." the woman behind the man, Aunt May, reminds us by always keeping Peter/Spider-man grounded. there's more, but it's so late already.  By His grace and mercy, Gill
