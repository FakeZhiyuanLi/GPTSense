      So it comes that we as a nation-state, need to remember those the few who have given the ultimate sacrifice so we the many can sit on our collective asses and forget about it.  I'm talking about Memorial Day - where America is to remember it's soldiers. Those who fight for us when called upon.  Now I don't want to get into a "Is this or that conflict for us to be involved with?" discussion, but to simply ask folks to try and remember those that served (and are currently serving) in the United States Armed Forces.  This day was started to remember the costliest war to date - The American Civil War.  More Americans died or were injured in that war than any other.  So take a moment out on Monday to attend a parade or a memorial for the soldier. I know I will.

      Just went through yet more tonado warnings here.  LOTS of rain.  Luckily, I was able to slip in a lawn mow between the morning and early evening rain showers! Lawn looks great for this time of the year and even the next door neighbor's lawn (who has yet to fertilize his lawn in 3 years) is starting to perk up.  With all of that, fixed a friend's computer who has his motherboard wedge on him today. On powerup, fans spin up, drives seek, but nothing else. no video, no beep codes, nothing.  After trying a new video card (nope) and resetting the other cards (nope), decided to pull out all the memory and put them back in one at a time. Sucess!  I cleaned up the wiring inside the case for better air flow (the person who built his system must of been a moron) and redid his front panel USB connectors (I believe they were wired to the mobo incorrectly).  All and all, about 3 hours of work.  Now I have to log into work and get ready for a long 24 hours of testing .......

      OK,  It's now rained badly 3 days in a row here in Balmy Aurora, IL.  Tornado sirens are going off much too often to warrent any good  as most folks (including me!) stand around outside or or look out a window to see if they  see anything . Most of the really really bad weather has been tothe west and north of me, but my lawn is in need of a serious mow and it's too wet!  Finished my son's spring soccer league off today (in the rain!) so that's out of the way, but now summer baseball has started. At least I don't have to coach this year.  Spousal unit has decreed a jihad on the dirt in the house today (must clean from top to bottom). She's getting a little nuts by moving the furniture (did that a month ago dammit). Ony have time for a quick note (not like anyone's actually watching here....)

      Same Shit, Different Day.  Cold is still on-going, but at least my head doesn't hurt too bad.  Chest is sore from the coughing, but it * is * getting better. Had a friend try and pursuade me to jump over to a Tivo, but I really want that network connectivity. I guess I can't blame ReplayTV too much - they were bought out by the folks who own Denon and you certaintly don't see any Denon equipment at BB. Might have to bend the plastic a bit to get a ReplayTV (5504 - I can always upgrade the HD later). Will have to prime the missus for that expense.  Oddity for the day - why in the world do folks think a single day, National Strike against the Oil Companies is actually going to work? To most, gas is not expensive enough to force folks to make a drive/don't drive decision. I would guess that would be about $5.00/Gallon right now.  Plus, if no-one buys today, most folks are sure as hell going to buy tomorrow.  When will people learn? It would be like boycotting food. Can't do it forever.

      Now I've had this cold for about 3 days, and yes, they really do suck.  Coughing, sneezing, blowing my nose so many times it makes my head hurt.  All this because some little prick at work had to come into work last week while *he* was sick.  The bastard coughed right in my face.  Lovely.  Sick for sure I thought.  5 days later - sick.  Now I respect my friends and co-workers enough not to give it to them, so here I sit at home. I've logged into work a few times, but after awhile, I get a bit dizzy and don't feel like looking at a screen anymore. Speaking of which - back to the couch for me.

      Why is it (now don't I sound like Andy Rooney....) that now that I am on the National DoNotCall list, I get more calls than before?  This time it's the Charity brigade.  I know they only survive from donations, but come on - you don't have to call as early as 9:00am and as late as 9:00pm, now do you?  I've got every wacko chaity under the sun ringing my phone asking for something.  If I screen the call (i.e., don't answer), then they call back - AGAIN AND AGAIN!!  Like the fucking plague.  This is most annoying when I'm home during the day for something like, oh I don't know, being sick and these idiots keep calling.  They don't take no as fast as the non-charity calls that I used to get.  These folks are animals.  I used to have fun with the old telemarketeers that used to pester me (accept their credit card/home equity offer and ask them to hurry because I'm getting ready to file bancruptcy, set an appointment for windows/doors/siding/carpet/ball scratcher, whatever and ask them is the salesman is friendly because I have 42 cats and miss human companionship, or fake an accent - whatever I can do to prolong the call to waste their time), but with these charities, that really isn't a chance. I tell them to put it in mail and I will decide when I get it (make them pay postage), but now that's backfiring on me because they are calling to followup on my wonderfull "pledge". If you have any ideas, let me know ......

      Now that's I've had my less than invigorating 3.5 hours of sleep, I'm rested and ready to take on the world.....  Bleah.  Like to crawl back into bed for a couple of hours.  This day might have turned out OK if my 8 year old son hasn't got nearly the same thing (at least he can sleep).  Now I have to watch him and try and get some rest.  Lord, give me strength .................

      OK, I took an odd 5 minutes and finished filling out most of the rest of the template for the Blog.  Now you see it. I'll get around to filling out the rest soon I suppose (maybe tomorrow - good chance I will be home sick). Right now I'm feeling more like crap every minute so I think I'm going to call it a night and just give in the to drugs and try and get some sleep.

      Here I sit, head in hands with a screaming headache from this lousy cold and all I can think of doing is creating my blog.  Now ain't that something. Always wanted a blog.  I see too much odd crap on a daily basis not want to share this with ..... Who? Anyone, I guess. So here goes. I dip my big toe into the very deep pool of blogging, knowing full well that pobably not a soul will see it or believe it in any way, shape or form.  Enough ramblimgs (cold medicine must be kicking in ...)  One thing to note with this blog - I spell like crap, type even worse and care not one iota.  Wanna flame me for the spelling and the typing mistakes, go 'head - won't hurt my feelings.

      Here's the scenario - My son's in a baseball league with the Parks dept. In this league, the kids pitch the first two innings with the coaches pitching the last 4 (6 innings total). Game started off a bit rocky - the opposing pitcher's first pitch beaned the or first batter.  Had to pull the kid (he's only 8) as it rang his bell quite a bit.  You see the other kid throws pretty damn hard.  Now, as a parent and as a coach in a previous life, I would of had a small talk with the pitcher (especially after he hit the next 3 kids as well) or pull the kid, but no, he let him keep pitching using our team as targets! We get through the inning, scoring the league maximim 5 runs.  Later on in the game, a play came up where he was sending the players on past balls out of bounds. Normally, a valid thing to do, but not in this league - it's a dead ball.  He argues with us, argues with the ump and didn't relent until shown the rulebook. He wandered off muttering that no-one in the previous games minded.  Our coach pulls me and the 3rd base coach off to the side and tells us to start running the kids more aggressively on the basepaths.  Not a problem for me - 20 years ago my 12 year old team I coached set the league record for stolen bases and doubles.  So the next kid up has a decent stick. I tell him in private that if he rips one, to bust his tail down to first and I might send him to second.  He cracked a good one and send him I did.  The second baseman was camping on the base and he slid right over him. Other coach starts bitching but Ump says everything is happened according to league rules and his players shouldn't be blocking the bases.  Couple of innings later, I have same kid on first and the first basemen is in the basepath. I ask the coach to move him forward or back.  He stares at me and does nothing. I tell the kid to run straight down the basepath - if he runs into the kid, so be it.  It's a hit, the first basebman runs squarely into my runner and they fall down.  The force him out at second.  Ump calls him out, I say no way - basepath interference, Ump agrees, coach goes nuts!  Tough shit!  Last inning, we have last at bats - we are down by 1, we score two - we win!  Other coach says - no way it's a tie. I tell him "Believe what you will."  Some guys can be real assholes!

      Weather forecasters - what a job.  You get to be wrong as much as you are right and still get paid big bucks.  So it goes for today. Was to be dry after sunrise, but instead it rined off and on (more on) until about 4:00pm.  Then it cleared up. Let's see if they can hold onto their next prediction - dry until Sunday!

      I think you get the picture. It's rained over an inch on Saturday, 3 inches on Sunday and it rained again Monday during the Naperville Memorial Day parade (and again and again). May is now the wetest month on record. I'm now heading to the Cubs game and it's raining again!  I know I wanted a nice looking lawn but this is ridiculous.  Someone I know asked if India had contracted out their monsoon season to the midwest. Hah!

      OK, stop the snickering. I actually have 2 posts less than 2 weeks apart.  Someone sent me something.&nbsp; Says that John Kerry's wife is the Heinz owner and they have moved factories out of the country.&nbsp; If true,&nbsp;I find it hard to believe a man that says he will bring jobs *back* into the US.&nbsp; He might want to start looking at home first.......  Don't know if it's true, but if it is, then he's a blasted idiot for standing in a glass house chucking boulders......

      OK - I did say I was going to be more prompt about doing this blog, but .........  My's son's baseball team went 13-0-1.&nbsp; Not too damn bad if I say so myself.&nbsp; Especially for Parks league baseball.&nbsp; Lastteam we played was a hoot.&nbsp; Their team showed up to the game 90 minutes before to get serious practice time in.&nbsp; They had 6 coaches and they  all  yelled.&nbsp; And non too pleasant. I thought I would say something, but the parents of those kids let it go so I did as well.&nbsp; They came over quite cocky talking about teking it easy on us.&nbsp; I had several parents from our side come up and say they really wanted to win this game.&nbsp; I spoke to the Head Coach of our team and he agreed,&nbsp; Turn up the agressive meter (more running on the bases, etc).&nbsp; Not that I minded.&nbsp; When&nbsp;I coached baseball almost 20 years ago,&nbsp; We set league records for stolen bases 3 years in a row.&nbsp; I must say, the kids responded wonderfully!&nbsp; We won, 9-4.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was quite proud!  Meanwhile,&nbsp;I still have this damn splint on my finger.&nbsp; Will see the doc on Thursday - hopefully, it will come off.&nbsp; I take it off every day (when Ii shower) and try some bends - hurts like a SOB.  Lastly, I've been invited to the Cubs/Brewers game in Milwaukee. Row 1, right behind the Cubs dugout.&nbsp; Gotta love having friends with money.... :-)

      It's been well over a month since posting anything here and what a month it's been.  I tore the ligiments in the tip of my right hand on my middle finger (no flipping people the bird for awhile).  This has been a major pain as its in a brace and catches on most everything.  It also gets in the way of typing, tying your shoes, writing your name, holding a fork, using a mouse, almost everything (especially being right-handed).  My's son's baseball team is now 11-0-1 for the season with 2 to go.  Kids are all stoked, but since that early game - we really haven't had too much competition (ourscoring opponents by 8 or more per game).  Caught a couple of cubs game - even sat in the new "dugout" section they built right behind home plate - Sweet!  Working on editing video and stills of various events I was invited to and asked to tape/shoot.  *That* takes a lot of time on a P3 1Ghz machine  I so need a new computer.  Finanly got that ReplayTV - had to order it for myself for Father's Day.  Very nice!  Recorded (keep wanting to say "taped" - but is doesn't have any tape!) a couple of shows and pulled it down to my computer and bruned it to DVD.  Take that Tivo!  A few weeks ago, I worked 3 15 hour days in 1 week followed by 60 hours in 4 days and 1 day 23 hours long.  Yeeck.  All and all, a busy month.  Hopefully with baseball winding dwn, that will free up more time and I will be able to catch up and keep the blog going.

Finger still hurts like an SOB and now the Orthopedic Surgeon hey - stepping up in the world!) says it will hurt fo quite some time and I may not expect to have full motion ever.  Niiiiice.  I got to see the Cubs/Brewers game on the 27th in Miwaukee.  Very nice park - suck-ass drive home (I think 20,000 folks of the 42,000+ were from Chicago and fighting to drive south back to Chicago .....
