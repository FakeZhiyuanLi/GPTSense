      I work in a retail setting where people constantly come in with names. Most people I'll never remember there names. However this particular family is one that I'll never forget. Jokes will forever be made. The families last name is Seeman. Ok, now having the last name Seeman would be rough. Why would anyone encourage bad names for their children? I would have kept it simple and try and make life easy for them. Not this loving family! First born--Mia. Second child born--Guy. Now this is crazy. Why?   I can just imagine some funny way in which the parents were like, "Hi, these are my kids, Mia and Guy Seeman." Mia,Guy Seeman. Man that's horrible.I fell your pain children of the Seeman.

      Well this is weird, I don't really dream or have any kind of dreams. My girlfriend on the other hand, gets out of control with her dreams. She can wake up and tell me in great detail what has happened for like a half hour at times. Not me I sleep like a rock. Nothing goes on. Now I got hit with one. This didn't even happen recently. I just remembered. OK here I go.... Sara (girlfriend) and I were riding my friends downhill bike and my other friends mtb bike. I was on the downhill bike and she was on the other bike. Now we're in the city most likely NY, and we stopped somewhere for whatever it was. We both left these bikes leaned up against a railing unlocked. I knew something was going to happen so I went back outside. Yes my bike was stolen. Now I looked around and saw tire tracks. I got Sara and followed. So here I am following these tire tracks around in circles at first then kind of randomly. Then I notice that they tear into the woods. That's right in the city. I follow them straight back and then they tear left very suddenly. When look I almost fall. It's like some kind lake with a huge dirt cliff with woods on top. That's what I'm on top of. I look down and there's the bike in very shallow water and two people around it trying to get it out. I yell and they run. One of them looks like one of those guys who wear the white t-shirts that are f'in huge. He's also wearing one of those white spandex du-rags. SICK! The other is some older white guy with jeans and t-shirt on. Joe normal. Whatever.....Now magically I'm down in the water and near my bike. I pick it up and ride out of the water to the shore. Then run into Sara on the same trail as I took in. Cause I see my foot prints and those tire marks. We ride out back into the city. Now we're in what I think was Portland, OR. We have to cross a bridge, but we are both scared because of the bridge. We sit there and watch all kinds of traffic and other bike riders cross. We are still scared. Then thats it. That's all I have. I'm not sure what any of this means, but one thing I am sure of.....I had a dream....I fell like M.L.K. Oh-and remembered it. YES!

      The day & night were good to me. Working 9 hours at the job. Drive 20 miles to make 60 bucks an hour working on indoor spin cycles at a gym. Job took just a few minutes, but the drive was cool. The sky was clear over head, but out in front and pretty much all around it was big gray clouds. Purple, pink, orange and other colors associated with dusk were awesome. Those clouds just looked ominous and unpredictible. It must have been shitting the bed out in front. But over head it was so clear. Perhaps just me sitting there in the car not trying to think about driving was what I needed and the sky helped. After that I got to see my friend Paula Lemme, she rules! I got to pick up the picture of me jumping off a pine tree in Connecticut. It was from about 30 feet up. The guy who took the picture was nice enough to blow it up to 11 x 18 or so. Kootoes to you Jacob. After the short visit with Paula I was on my way to the Flemington skatepark. SHIELDSSKATEPARK.com Back to driving it was 30 miles to that. Damn that gas! Arriving to the skatepark I felt good. I was ready to ride my little bike around in circles. I was riding very well. I felt strong and confident. I was thinking up new lines and tricks. I stayed commited to all that I tried. Perhaps going away from what you live your life around and then returning a few weeks later too is what you need. It has done a real fine job on me. I have come back to riding only to feel stronger and better at what I have always been able to do. Now evolution. With the opening of this skatepark and the at half a dozen or so other skateparks only 1/2 an hour to an hour away from my home things will be excellent. Perhaps?

      Hello and welcome to my venting. I will be here every so often to flow anger out into ways to better my-self. Spelling will be off and grammar even worse. So, welcome to me.
