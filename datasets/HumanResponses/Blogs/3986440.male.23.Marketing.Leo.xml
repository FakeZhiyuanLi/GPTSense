        Unbelievable.  That's all I can say over the cold run I was having over the weekend. You could not get a worse run if you tried. Looking over the stats, in one game on Aloha I had no calls, no bets, no raises, 22 folds. That's just wrong. I couldn't even protect the blinds. Eventually, I was down to my last chip and went all in with some crap like 93o, which was pretty standard for the night. But this continued onto other tables for me...Again and again. I pulled 1 pot our of 128 and my miniscule winnings from the week were gone. Just like that. I can not re-interate enough just how bad this run was. I had not one picture card for 7 single table tournaments. I had 4 and other low card on 8 consecutive hands - I was beginning to question how many fours were in the pack. This run was devastating, and from now on will forever be referred to as "Uranga" - an African beast with powers of frost that are un-matchable. All 23 cents gone in one weekend. Well, I guess it is back to square one and onward we go. I did say when I had the points before that this was my " first " start. So I knew I would probably loose it all some time, I was just hoping to have a little longer to play with it. The best thing about having those points, as miniscule as they were, was that I could play a real money game anytime. Now with my bankroll back at $0 (where it never left really), I have to wait for the scheduled free-rolls again. Maybe No-limit isn't best for me? I think it is the most fun, and at these low levels limit games tend to get capped on every round of betting - making it a bit of a joke. I think I need no-limit for now and move on to limit when there is more than $1 on the line. For now, we go back to the freerolls with the rest of the Rounder wanna-be's! After loosing all I had, and going through the worse run of cold cards in my life I needed to went some, so I entered a free roll tournament with no prize but the pleasure of winning. I don't do these tournaments very often anymore because they do not contribute to my challenge, but I needed an outlet and I decided to play this game very aggressive - I had to, I wasn't getting the cards to play super tight. I got a little lucky with some sets and steeling a few pots, and before I knew it I was up amongst the leaders around $70K (start at $10K). Flopped a nice straight with KQo in hand and Jh Tc Ad on the felt, and went all in. I was followed by one player on $40K who had 9c3c. Well, I wouldn't be telling this story unless it went bad, and the turn was 6c, river Jc. A Jack high straight took the wind out of my sails, and I was playing against that one player from then on. That's no way to play, let alone the terrible mood I was in due to "Uranga", so I was out not long after that. But the purpose had been served. I had a few good starting hands (even pocket Kings, I was most proud.) and got that ll out of my system, so here we go again...

       I'm not going to post daily on this blog, but since it is still new and my enthusiasm is up, I will for now.    &nbsp;  Had a few quick games last night on Bugsy Club, and I managed to add another 8 cents worth of points to my tally. The Aloha tournament was juts awful. 17 folds in a row. Not one bet, not one raise, not one call. 17 folds. That is mind blowing. In those 17 hands, I had one picture card (It was the mighty Queen of spades herself. My, what a woman.). When on the 18th hand I had K7h, I was all in out or bordem. My small stack of $280 was quickly eaten up by a pair of Jacks on the river. I was playign with some maor annoyances in the background, so it was probably not going to be my best game regardless of the cards.    &nbsp;  But like I said, I did manage to add some Bugsy Bonus Points to my account. With my grand 15 points, I can now enter single table tournaments for 1 point or 10 point, with the chance to win 10 tens that amount. Causiously, I am only going in the 1 point tables at the moment. I don't think many of the other players took these games as seriously as I did. Could you blame them? The grand prize was 10 cents! Hardly worth the time when you think about it (so I didn't think about it). But I'm on a mission.    &nbsp;  Here is my gripe today: I had pocket Jacks and went all in on one hand, and was followed by another player who had ATh. The flop came ATx, then x, then the river was the J I needed to win. No big deal, small pot really in the sceme of things but the other player posted a message along the lines of "If it wasn't for that lucky river...". I don't get it. If it wasn't for that "lucky"&nbsp; ace on the flop, he wouldn't have been in the hunt. I knew I had only 2 outs on the river, and he was well ahead on the flop, but he was really pissed that he lost it on the river. I don't get it - it wasn't like he had a monster in two pair. You know why they put five cards out in the middle of the table? So you can use all of them. ANY of them! I know I get annoyed too when I get beaten by the last card, but this guy really went off. Like I had no right to win because he was ahead after the flop. The river is there for a reason - you either sink or swim. I'm allowed to use it.&nbsp; I've had my bad beats on it too - but when your stack is gone the only things you can blame are the cards and yourself.    &nbsp;  &nbsp;And there is NOTHING you can do about the cards.

        Even though Poker is a skill game, you still need a bit of luck on your side, especially when it comes to tournaments and especially when you want to make $6K starting with zero. Your luck is a roller coaster with it's ups and downs and even a few loops. I have been having the worst "Lucky" run ever. That needs an explanation.   Just last night I was playing in two freeroll tournaments, one on Aloha and the other on Poker Pages. The Aloha pays about $28 for first place, while PP pays in "Bugsy Bonus Points" - frequent player points that can be transferred into tournament entries or cashed out for 1c a point - so the big prize was equivalent to about $4. Either win would do, all I need is a start to get going.  I was traveling well on PP, doubling my stack on the first hand with Jacks full. After an hour, I have moved from $10K to over $100K and sitting in about 3rd out of the 77 players left. I'm reading everyone like a book, playing like a champ and feeling good. Even on the few times I have called some of the short stacks when they went all in, I'm getting the great river cards to throw them out. Dealt A6o in the BB, and the action is limited but there are 3 callers. The flop comes A6x - checked all around back to me, time to top up my stack a little bit...  Mean while, over on Aloha I made a bold early move (because with low starting stacks you have to), and go from $400 to $1060 on top pair with ace kicker on the river, with no action before it. I have no idea why the followed with what they must have been holding, but hey that's not my problem. A few hands later, again on the BB I'm holding poker 4's - not a great hand, but since I'm on the big blind I can be hopeful. The flop comes and there is a 4, so I start to get a little more confident and think "I'm killing at both tables, this could be the night I get started!".  I flip back to Poker Pages to raise a thousand or so, and the player immediately to my left is trying to make the decision to call or fold.   Gee, he certainly is taking his time.   Don't they have a timer on these things?   I mean, it was only a few thousand, his stack is $60K, throw it in if you don't have it.   Where is that timer?   Oh...Hang on...Oh no...   I looked over at Aloha, and the same thing is happening - nothing. For some reason my raise on the flop is not showing. My internet connection is down. I frantically press the reconnect button but to no effect. I go all the way out then all the way back in, take the phone cord out (yes, still on dial up), restart the computer but nothing happens for 20 minutes. I even used a trace on Poker Pages, and the only sites I can connect to for the time being is in Australia. My ISP has cost me. So, for the record my ISP is Optus and I say they now owe me $28, $3 more than my monthly access fee. They won't get me to upgrade to broadband that way!   I was pissed off. I had put nearly two hours into Poker pages, and was just getting a run on Aloha. I checked this morning and I finished 27th on Aloha by folding away my $1K, and 16th on PP by folding away my $100K. 27th gets you nothing, 16th however did put me in the money! 15 Bugsy Bonus Points! That's the equivalent of 15 US cents. Sound better if I say approximately 22 Australian cents. Yes sir, one more monster like that and I can play two-up!   And what about this game the other night? In four consecutive hands I had the following either on the flop or the turn:      Quad 7's    Ace high straight    Ace high flush    Queens full of 5's     Not a bad little run for four consecutive hands. And what did I make of this bevy?    Nothing.    I folded each one before the flop. I had cards like this (I say like because I can't remember exact):     73o    T2o    Qh2s    Q5o     It only took one raise before the flop to convince me not to start with a hand like that. Four monsters in a row, all folded and all good enough for the money. I am having the best of luck and I still can't capitalize on it.

       You know, I was thinking that the internet needs another Blog. Hey, I'll even be original with it and blog about my poker exploits. Why, there can't be ANYONE who ever thought of that before...  With the knowledge that what am I doing is hardly original and no where near revolutionary, you are now reading the beginning of "Poker On Film" - A&nbsp; poker blog (a "plog" - no. Defiantly no.).  So what is the point of all this? I will give you the short&nbsp;version and the long after it.   &nbsp;          SHORT       My goal is the make enough money through poker to buy a video camera and begin a career in film.

        Albrecht:   Police! Don't move! I said, "Don't move!"   Eric Draven:   I though the police always said, "Freeze!"   Albrecht:   Well, I am the police, and I say, "Don't move!" Snow White. You move, you're dead.   Eric Draven:   And I say, "I'm dead," and I move.     "The Crow"       First things first, read a great little political/poker article   urlLink   here.    I don't care much for any political affiliation, but it gave me a chuckle so that will do.  Got back into the tournaments last night and had one of the most puzzling results I can recall.Early on I was able to double up with Big Slick when another player went all in with pocket 5's. He really thought he was on a monster with that. I hit an ace on the river, and man was he pissed. I mean come on, I know it is a free roll and all, but you can't go getting all pissed off when your 5's get busted. Anyway, he was out and I was still going. I read over at   urlLink Uwannabet   about how he would like to hear stories about how people just got out played. No bad beats, lucky outs, just out played. I have a great story I think.  I'm holding As2d in the big blind, and I get to check into the flop with 3 callers. The flop is (5h 4h Ah) and I don't like the hearts. But it gets checked around to me and I think I will test it with a modest $500 bet. I get only two callers, and that will do. The turn comes (3c) and now I have a straight. I'm still worried about the hearts, but nobody is betting them on this usually loose table. I figure nobody has two hearts, and now my straight looks ok. I bet another $500, and get only one caller. The turn comes and it is a heart breaking (2h). This not only ruined my straight but put four hearts on the board when I had none. The other player calls, and I decided I better make it look like I have a higher heart than him (if he has one). I bet $2K, and he thinks about it then re-raised me another $2K. I know I am probably beat by his heart, but I need to see if he was bluffing. I call the other $2K and he shows (Ts 3h). I could cry. Yeah, I was representing a higher heart than his, but this guy was checking a straight flush. It was comforting to know that I was ahead on the turn, but I was really lucky he didn't take me for more I think. Well, if the re-raise was any more I don't think I would have called, but if he opened up the betting who knows? I don't think I could have played those cards the way he did, but damn did I fall for his trap. I had no choice, I had to post in the chat box how well I thought he played - even if I was screaming at the lucky bastard on my screen. Oh well, at least he left me with most of my chips.  Later on, I'm up to about $30K, about double the average but 3rd at the table. I have AsQs and I raise in early position pre-flop. I get three callers, and the river is (7s Ts 6d). I bet $1K, and get a fold, a call and a re-raise of $1K. I call and so does the other one. The turn is a beautiful 2s. At this stage I am pretty confident, and bet $2.5K. I get a call (yes!)...and a re-raise all in. What the fuck? Now I know I am far from poker elite status (I'm still Algae status, remember?), But I was pretty sure I was holding the best possible hand at this stage. No pairs on the board? Check! What about a flush? No, hang on I have the flush. Straight? Yeah, he could have a straight but I doubt it and besides, my flush is still good. A straight flush perhaps? Well, he doesn't have that yet. Surely I can't get rivered on a straight flush twice in one night. I call all in and so does the last player. He shows T6o for two pair, and the last player shows 77 for a set. This means that I was right, I do have the best hand in spades, but now I bet I get rivered into a full house. The river is rags, and we are now in the big time. I am now chip leader, and dominating this table. I feel good.  One of the faults of novice players I read about is not knowing how to play either position of stack size. If I was to rate myself on both of those out of ten, I would say I play position 5/10 and stack size 1/10. I am good at getting to be the largest or second stack at the table, but I have no idea how to play from there. I always see other players in that position try to push everybody else off out of the pot, but I seem to be really crap at it and usually end up giving my big stack away in chunks. Tonight, I decided that since I am crap at playing the size of my stack, I would ignore it. I remained around the top 5 stacks (out of 200 left) for some time. Something happened though as the blinds started to get around the $1K mark. I was up to $150K, and was dealt KQo in middle position. I raised the minimum and it was folded all around. Two hands later, I have a pair of 10's, and the same thing happens. Then I got them, for the first time in the night I look down (figuratively speaking) and see those two little A's staring back at me. I bet the minimum again and it is folded all the way around for a blind steal. I decided to show my hand to the table and post in the chat box "Am I playing too tight?". I get a copy of responses in the affirmative and I knew I was set from now. Two or three hands later, I raise the minimum and again it gets folded around. I had the hammer, and boy was I hoping nobody leaves this table! I was pocketing $3K to $4K every 3 hands or so. Not much when the blinds are $800-$1600, but in each orbit I am getting more than $10K up. I am chip leader again, and with a little buffer as we go into the final 60.  For the first time ever in these tournaments, I press on over $200K (and even my flat mate is proud.). But it doesn't stop there as I catch some very nice river cards and march on to $290K with under 50 players left, and the top 27 get paid. There was one dead hand at our table - a player who had left long ago and was now posting and folding every hand. He was down to under the small blind, and he lasted about 4 orbits. Damn, I just could not get rid of him. It was becoming a bit of a table goal to get rid of "808Maverick". Sad to say, somebody else got him before me.  One of the short stacks goes all in with $30K, and I am holding AJo. I am in last position and call to go to a showdown with just the two of us. He has pocket 2's, and I am forgiven for being confident. The felt doesn't even show a picture card, and the pocket 2's are good enough. I'm annoyed, but still over $250K so all is well. Two hands later, another short stack goes all in. I am sick of stealing blinds (as nearly every hand is just that), and it look slike everybody is trying to limp into the money. I have AsQs, and I think I am good enough to call his $50K. He shows pocket 5's, and again they are good enough as the board helps neither of us. Hang on, I'm starting to get around the average now. I loose another pot when my jack kicker isn't good enough, and I have gone from top five stacks to bottom 3 in the one orbit. It is down to 28, and only the top 27 get the money. I have enough to last just 2 orbits. Luckily, I see the 28th position go out in the lobby, and I am guaranteed money. I have a $30K stack, go all in and get beaten by a pair of pocket 10's. Want to beat me? Come with pocket pairs, they kill me every time it seems.  So I go out in 27th place, and win a grand total of 13.5 cents. Oh well, what can you do? What was funny was that I never really had a monster hand. I had a few straights, one flush and the rest was two pairs or top pair/top kicker. I never saw a set all night, let alone a boat. Does that mean I played a mediocre hand well or just got lucky with the cards? Let me know what you think.  So I am bank to having a bank roll, but it may be useless. The Bugsy games have changed I think, and now you need a minimum of 100 to do anything with them as far as entering tournament go. I have 13.5 of them, not much to do with at all. What can you do? "Stop playing the stupid free rolls and put some real money on the line you dumb ass" I hear you say? Yeah, but what would be the fun in that?  On to the live game front, and I am again asking for some help. I have been trying to buy a few decks of used casino cards to go with our new poker stuff we bought. I want to buy a deck from the Bellagio, the MGM Grand and the Mirage - which just happen to be the three casinos that George Clooney and his friends try to rob in "Ocean's Eleven". I found a few sites that will sell these internationally, but postage is through UPS express and for 3 decks of cards it cost over $50US. That's just fucking ridiculous. I know the casinos hawk these off for $2 each or something, so I don't want to pay $40+ in postage for some worthless items to be here in two days when normal parcel postage that takes 2 weeks for $10 will be just fine. If anybody is on their way to Vegas any time soon and wouldn't mind picking up some of these decks for me, drop me a line and I will be happy to pay through PayPal or something for your trouble.  Thanks for reading, and feel free to critique my play as you see fit.

        Mr. Madison, what you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.    The Principal,  "Billy Madison".

         Killing is wrong. And bad. There should be a new, stronger word for killing. Like badwrong, or badong. Yes, killing is badong. From this moment,I will stand for the opposite of killing: gnodab.   The Chosen One,  "Kung Pow"        I have not played one hand of poker since my last post, mainly due to finding a little program on the home computer that shouldn't be there. All has been fixed for now, and new virus protection has been sought. If there are any great recommendations out there, then I'm all ears.     I am however in the process of getting some live games going. I have been looking on eBay and other internet sites to find a decent poker table and chips. How hard is it for somebody to sell this stuff in Australia? The very few people I have found that sell something vaguely similar to what I want have a ridiculous price like $399 for a 500 chip set. So it looks like I will have to order from overseas. There are so many places that sell them in the US, and with the current poker boom I should be able to find a decent set of 1000 chips for a pretty good price. Again, if anyone out there has any recommendations, I'm all ears.     I have been reading too many poker sites lately to mention, and have been trying to decipher it all. I know one of my weakness' is I can play too tight, and only playing in free rolls certainly doesn't build up too many good habits. But these are the challenges we set ourselves. If I wanted to make a career out of poker, I would invest some real money in it. But I know that it is probably so far off - not to mention risky - choice that I can not see a justifiable reason to try. I really would love to say one day I started my poker career with $0 down, and hence this blog.     I think this will be my shortest post since starting, due to not playing any poker since Saturday. As I said in my last post, I am looking at upgrading the connection on the home PC, and hopefully I can then get more out of my game by having fewer time-outs and lost connections. I guess the live game has it's draw backs too - like a boxed card in the deck, dealer drops a card, accidentally mucking a winning hand in an alcoholic induced haze. Oh well, what can you do?    Saw "Wonderland" last night, the movie about porn legend John Holmes staring Val Kilmer. Damn it's weird - it is less about the star's fall from grace and more about "Wonderland" - an apartment frequented by drug users at the time and some murders than went down there. I guess that should have been more obvious considering the title of the movie, but all the promotion and even the back cover was about Holmes. It is interesting, but nothing too special.     That will do for this post, hopefully next time I will have a little more to talk about: more winnings and less bad beats!

          Goldie Wilson:    Your wait and see, Mr. Carruthers. I will be mayor. I'll be the most powerful man in Hill Valley. I'm gonna clean up this town.      Lou:   [hands him a broom] Good. You can start by sweeping the floor.      From  "Back to the Future"             I'm in a surprisingly up-beat mood. Surprisingly because this past week I lost the entire bankroll I had. Upbeat because I can honestly say it wasn't my fault.  Now one of my biggest faults is not taking responsibility for my play or my mistakes, this I know. But my massive $5US ($7.12 AU) bankroll was lost without me making any huge errors. Well, I did make one small one perhaps. I decided that in order to try and make the bankroll grow, I will split it in two so that if I loose out I will still have half to fall back on. Should I have put all my eggs in one basket? Perhaps. As we all know (I can say "we" now, because I have confirmed readers in double digits!) the size of your stack is just as important as how you use it. I was cutting my stack in half - not always a wise idea. It also meant any tournament entries I could win would be paying off less. Anyway, we make these choices and stick by them.  Firstly I was playing on Aloha early Saturday morning. My poker playing habits are very weird (besides starting from a bankroll of $0). Since we are still on dial up, I can't play all the time as it takes the phone away from my girlfriend and flatmate (I know, I'm nearly 24 and shouldn't be still living in share accommodation. But you should see the place, it's awesome and this is the only way we could afford the rent. Besides, at least I don't live with my parents.). It also annoys them a hell of a lot for some reason. So generally the only times I play are late night or early morning. Getting up early on Saturday, I was in fine shape and ready to go for some 9am action.  But this is the weekend. And we live in Parramatta.  Quick geography lesson for anybody living outside of Sydney. Parramatta has a busy little CBD, and is constantly growing. Parramatta is also home of a rather large shopping mall known as Parramatta Westfield's Shopping Town. The place is huge, five stories high spread over 3 blocks and they are building more. At one time it was the biggest shopping centre in the southern hemisphere. Come to think of it, nearly everything in Australia is the "biggest in the southern hemisphere" since that excludes North America and Europe. So anyway, the place is busy. Always. Parking is hell, people are stupid - usual busy shopping centre. For some reason, we have to go there every weekend. Every weekend at least once without fail. Even if all we need is bread and milk, we go to Westfields. Haircut? Westfields. Last weekend we spent a couple of hundred dollars there and hopefully we got everything we needed. Um, no. We had to go back today. This meant leaving my poker session hanging, and I would fold away everything I had.  What did we get? I can't remember. I know the other two got haircuts, but I refused out of protest. Suffice to say, I was in a less-than-happy mood, but still positive because I knew I could play tonight with no distractions.  I should point out that one of my little code words here is "distractions". You can bet London to a brick that when I say "distractions" it means my girlfriend is nagging about something, 99% of the time complaining about me playing poker again. So when I say "distractions", lets just share a knowing smile and move on.  Tonight was going to be a big Saturday night for me. Flatmate was going out with some friends from work to the other side of the city, and my girlfriend was going to a girls night. This leave me home alone for about four hours. This is what kind of poker tragic I am - home alone and no plans for Saturday night? You better bet I'm going to poker it up like a wildman! I was ready willing and able to make the most of my free time. All was well, until my second demon came for another visit.  Again, I was playing the tournaments at Aloha and at Poker Pages, and doing ok in both. There was about 60 or so left in the NL holdem tourny on PP, and I had been doing ok but was now falling behind as the blinds got bigger. I was down to $35,000 (average was among $45K) but confident in my play and read on opponents. Over on Aloha, it was still early days but I had tripled my stack to $1200+ early on and was looking forward to a good session.  Then it happened. I heard this faint little "click", and I knew what it meant. The connection had dropped again. I was already annoyed because I just folded KT pre-flop to a big raise, and saw AQJ come afterwards (eventual winner was a pair of aces), but this tipped me over. I was pissed. I tried to get back in several times, but to no avail. I could connect, but it would go no further. I know only the basics of computers, but when I check my connection spread and it reads "12kps" on a 56K modem, I get annoyed. I don't know if that is how it is supposed to be, but I was willing to accept any reason as to why my connection sucked. After 30 minutes of trying to get back into those rooms, I called it quits. I lay down on the couch, wrapped myself up in a quilt and sulked at my bad fortune. I am now looking at broadband options as we speak.           ***

          "Yeah casinos are all the same. Room full of fake boobs and real assholes."    Ray, "Walking Tall".       It seems to be pretty popular among poker blogs to start a post with a quote. Rather than a quote from online play or some other post, I will be throwing in movie quotes and the like than interest me or have something vaguely to do with what I am writing about. The one above is from Johnny Knoxville's character in "Walking Tall", which I was very happy to see last night. I notice the critics don't like the movie all that much, mostly because it is just ass-whooping after ass-whooping and a few one liners thrown in for good measure. Screw the critics, I liked it!  First of all, let me tell you I was really happy to get a few free tickets to the premiere off a friend who works at a local radio station. The movie doesn't open in Australia until next week, so it is always great to be a part of that elitist group of people who see a movie before it opens. But best of all, when we got to Fox Studios to watch the movie, there was a pretty large crowd of fans and media surrounding a red carpet going into the cinemas. I started to laugh, and then looked around for where we could get in. We couldn't, they had the whole entrance blocked off. Hey, you know what this means? Yep, we flashed our tickets to one of the security guards and we were through to the red carpet! It was weird, having all these people waiting for the celebs and The Rock, and here I come with my girlfriend and two other girls, all still in our work clothes and eating subway sandwiches. Afterwards my younger brother said we should have gone in two at a time, with the other two waiting with the crowd asking us for autographs and so on. For the record, the carpet was really soft, and they have no security at the other end of it where we go into the cinema.  Since we wanted decent seats, we went in about 20 minutes before The Rock arrived, so we missed all the shenanigans going on outside when his limo pulled up (I'm presuming he was in a limo). He spoke briefly before the movie began and came out with this great quote:         "I'm just like a cow, I always say this: You feed me and keep me watered and I'm good to go."    The Rock, Sydney premier of "Walking Tall", 5th August 2004.     Ok, so the Rock likes to call himself a cow, I can deal with that. Johnny Knoxville is hilarious in this movie, and it looks like they would have had a blast behind the scenes. The fight scenes are done really well and look very realistic. The head make-up artist was Jeff Dawn, who does all of the Rock's movie and Arnold Schwarzenegger's too. Wow, I think that is the first time I have commented on how good a movie's make up artist was. Does this mean I am becoming a movie nerd?    I haven't had a chance to get back to the poker rooms since my last post, and I just know my massive $5 bank roll isn't going to collect any interest on it's own. With the weekend coming, and with my real bank account only marginally better than my online poker bank account, it looks like I will have plenty of time and opportunity to make some changes to both.    I have added two new poker blog links to the section on the side.   urlLink Double A's   poker blog is what I like about poker blogs. It tells his stories of poker while a little bit of strategy creeps in. There is nothing I hate more than reading a blog that is all "I do it this way, everyone should play poker like this, if you don't then you're shit." I like reading other people's strategies too, but only if they put it into a practical sense and make it interesting.     I have also been reading   urlLink Bad Blood's   blog, and I like that one also. It is well written and his poker and non-poker stories are worth a read. And I can certainly relate to both of the above mentioned blogs.     That will do for now, hopefully I will have more good news to post after the weekend.

       What a great night I had in Pokerville.  I settled in for a standard Bugsy Bonus Points NL Holdem 9.30pm free roll as I regularly do, and thought I may as well register for the Aloha free roll that starts in an hour or two. If I am still awake, I might give it a shot.  The BBP tournament was going well, I was up to about $15k from my starting position of $10K, and playing solidly enough. I decided that my attempt at being aggressive was in reality piss weak up to this point. I would raise before the flop when I had a good starting hand, but I would raise only $50 which isn't really all that much out of the $10K stacks we all have. This was going to change tonight - if I was going to raise, my minimum was $500. It was working pretty well. I wasn't scared to loose my $500, and more often than not the cards were good enough to justify another bet or two. Out of the 10 hands I won early on, only 2 made it to showdown, and 5 made it to the turn at least. I hadn't doubled up at all, no all-in coin flips - I considered it my most solid play since I began. Contently happy was I.  Then in the chat window pops up a message telling us all that the 7 card stud hi/lo was starting in 10 minutes. I am not a big fan of stud, and hi/lo is very new to me but I thought I would give it a go for practice sake. If I lost out early (which was very likely) it doesn't matter because I still have the holdem game and the Aloha coming up if I want to.  There was a funny thing about the stud game though. As novice and clue-less as I am at stud, everybody else seemed to be more so. I was playing aggressive when I had a good starting hand or showing Ace, but not trying to find a hand amongst my rags. The game was pot limit, and I found myself stealing pots with regular ease. The amount of times I pocketed around $500 (starting stacks are $2K) by betting the pot limit, with the low only, and stealing it all was becoming embarrassing. Pretty soon I had doubled...Then doubled that...And again. I was chip leader out of all the tables in no time. At one stage, I was up to $60K and was the only active player at my table. While it is good to steal the ante and bring-ins without any competition and my stack was always on the rise, I really wanted to play and not just coast through. Eventually, I knocked out a few of the dead players and got some action back on the table.  Mean while in the other tournament, I was still reading the cards very well. I even through in some big bluffs and got away with them. Slow play the bullets? Done! Collect $20K. Out of the 100 or so left, I was probably up around the 35-30 mark and feeling good. As the numbers got lower, I found myself stumbling at $60K. I would go up to $70K then back down to $45K, and everywhere in between before settling yet again on $60K. There were now about 60 left in the tournament.  7 Card stud was still going well - I was still stealing pots when all I had was the low. I am still chip leader with about 50 players left.  And then Aloha starting. Oh no, I am not used to this.  I read a lot of other poker players sites out their in the world wide web. I know a lot of people play 3 or 4 tables at a time, so that they don't try to get too clever on one table and play each hand on it's merits. I am not one of those people. I play two tables sometimes, but I always prefer just the one. Now I was playing three, and I didn't want to loose any of them because the first two were getting towards the money and the other was for more money. I was frantically switching from one table to the other and was nearly getting timed out on all three as I made my decisions.  I thought if I have to loose one it will be the stud, so even if I am the chip leader I may force a few short stacks out and dominate onwards. If I lost, I could concentrate on the holdem games. That was stupid. I was going pot limit constantly and after a few losses, I was back amongst the rest of the crowd. With about $40K left, I was all in with a low hand again, and was beaten by a 3! I had A,2,4,6,7 against A,2,3,5,7. What was more stupid was that the money starts at 18th position, and I went out at 19th. I didn't even think about it until the nano-second after I clicked the button. You fucking idiot, but never the less, there are 2 other tables waiting for your domination.  Back to the Holdem, I was going nowhere and eventually went all in with AJo, loosing to a pair of Queens. 22nd. 4 places out of the money. You idiot.  Aloha was going ok though. I was able to double up early to $860, and was again playing solid. Again, I thought if I am going to raise, it will be a decent one. I doubled again to $1500, then lost some to go back to $1000. More so than ever before, there was some major chip movement in front of me. And I had a massive bluff come off. With nothing but a pair of 3's, I bet $8K after the river against chip leader. He thought long and hard about it, and because I had raised and re-raised this far into the pot, he folded on the river giving me about $12K. In the chat box he said he had top two pair, did I have it?       Dreamscape: Good move, flopped the straight.     Yeah, I'm a player now!    As the hands went on, while still trailing my new aggressive play, I was also conscious of how loose I would be. After reading a poker article about discipline at the table, I was very aware how loose I can get with a small pocket pair. In one hand, I was able to fold my pocket 6's pre-flop - and boy was I proud of myself! Good move to, because the flop came AKQ and it never made it to the turn.  My stack was looking impressive, and I was busting out the punters left, right and center. It was down to 50 players, but I was only just above the average chips. I thought I would be out before 40, but a few good draws and I'm back in there!  I'm glad I am only playing online, because if this was a real poker room I would be wearing my tells like a billboard. I had to remind myself that there was not a huge amount of money on the line - and none of it was mine - but I was so nervous and anxious as the numbers got lower and lower. Most people seemed to be content with folding everything and trying to wait it out for the final table - but I had better ideas. I was going to knock them all out on my way to the final table! I was going well, and blind stealing was the order of the game. The blinds were up over $1000, and with the average stack at $5K, it wasn't all that hard to steal and it was worth it. But one hand hurt me.  On the big blind, I get pocket 2's. Now I know I have to be disciplined, especially at this stage, so I think that if there are any bets I should probably let it go and live to fight another day.  No bets. Ok, I'll check to 2 callers.  Flop comes (2 4 4).  I'm pretty happy with a full house, and doubt anyone was a 4. I'm going all in against the two short stacks.  One of th problems I find in Aloha is that when you are all in, it doesn't show the cards until after the river. But for the sake of this and with the miracle of hind-sight, lets have a look at this hand.  Caller 1 has Q8o. Caller 2 has 9h8h. I have a boat. I admit, as boats go they don't get much smaller, but you could forgive me for being confident.  The turn (8). At this stage, I didn't know they both had an 8, so I'm feeling even better!  The river (8). What? Two pairs on the board? Two *shitty* pairs? I made them go all in late in the game though, so they must have AK or even AA. Hey, I can beat AA right now...  Of course, they both show 8's full. How pathetic I felt. I lost half my stack and was again in danger of loosing out at 16th, but I still had $10K and with the blinds now over $2000, stealing would get me back up...I hoped.  Slowly, one by one players fell at the other table. Not at my table though. One player in particular, with only $4K, would get timed out on every single hand. In the chat box (which I was watching but not contributing to) most of the other players were getting very annoyed. A quick look in the lobby shows the other table had 2 players under $1,ooo. Obviously he is just waiting them out, but it was annoying none the less.  So I steal a few more blinds and before you know it, I'm at the final table. Guranteed money now, I relax. I know blind stealing won't be as easy because we are already on the final table. 2 other players bow out, and then with a $20K stack I raise with Kc9c. Get two callers, and the flop shows (Qh 8c 7s). I bet $3K, just to see if they follow and I get one caller, one fold. The caller is chip leader with $50K, and I don't think he has a very good hand. Turn comes 4d, so the flush is gone for everyone and I bet $3K again. CL takes a while to think about it, then eventually calls. Either he is still looking for a draw or has trapped me perfectly. I put him on the draw, and look to the river. The river is a Ten, and I have nothing but King high. But I could have a straight. CL checks, and I am now convinced I have not been trapped. I go all in. He thinks and thinks and thinks about it. I hope and hope and hope that he folds. He is thinking, so he must have a pair. Eventually he calls and shows ATh, and I'm out of there because of his tens.  In hind sight, I probably shouldn't have gone all in with my remaining $10K - but it was a tight game and I thought I had enough to scare him off. But he had the balls to call with half of what he had left with only a middle pair, and furthers his lead while I lick my wounds. I read the results the next morning and find out he went on to win, while I get no Olympic medals out in 8th place.  But hang on, because this is good - 8th place gets money. Not poxy Bugsy bonus points, but real cold hard cash. How much did I win?     Five big, American ones baby! I bet when Lincoln posed for his currency photo shoot, he never thought that one day a modest Australian poker player aspiring to make his own films would own electronically one of his likenesses. And if he did think that, then man, he truly was a prophet. To put this massive win into perspective, I converted it over to Australian currency with today's exchange rate:    Woo hoo! I am under way yet again! $7.12 Australian dollars - not enough to make a movie, but I could get an over night new release rental! I felt so proud at 1.30am on a Tuesday night, but sad that I had nobody there to share in my glory. I went to bed (actually tried to go to bed, but my girlfriend had already cocooned herself in the sheets and I was forced to either freeze, wake her up and put up with her being shitty for the rest of the week or go sleep in the spare room. I chose the later.) unsure whether I would be able to get up in time for work the next day.    So here I am, under way again with US$5 bank roll behind me. The bad news is since the $5 is on Aloha, and well below the withdraw limit, I can only use it on Aloha and the real money games there are few and far between. I may try my hand at some of the micro limit tables, but I will definitely continue on with the free rolls there for now.  Onward we go!  And continuing with my current tradition of adding one link for every post, the new link is for the personal web site of     urlLink Percy Pringle  , real name William A. Moody, and better known as Paul Bearer from WWE fame. Percy Pringle III was a previous stage name used in the wrestling territories by Moody in years gone by, and he has kept his site to tell stories of old and let his fans know about his current situations. The stories are great, and there is a really moving account up on the site at the moment about his struggles with surgeries and so forth. Any fan should take a look.  Thanks for reading, tell your friends, invite your neighbors.

       Poker has been good to me so far, without being overly nice. Had a good run in a few tournaments, top 20 finishes but still no money. Had a great hand on Aloha when severely short stacked against chip leader early on, went all in pre-flop with Qc4c against AhKh. Flop came Th 4h 4s, turn 4d and the 2h river. Always nice to beat the leader at the table when he has a good hand, but really with felt like that it is just begging for a boat. I don't know if I've said this before, but man I love Quads. Bit of a silly thing to say really - I'm sure everyone loves four of a kind. But for me it is a bit like having your point guard dunking on their center. Can anybody out their remember KJ dunking over Olujuwon? Now there is some contemporary/old school basketball references for you.  I feel a need to comment on a very important aspect of the online poker game - The name you choose to be represented by. The name you select means a lot about you as a player (Huh?), and really can determine if you win or lose (just go with me here.). The names chosen at any poker site fall generally into one of the following categories, and I give my apologies in advance for my lame attempt at l33t for I am no match for the real l33t poker names out there:   1 - "Local Tourism Board"   Completely made up examples include: "OhioMan", "NYPoker", "JerseyBadMan".  The "LTB" player needs to tell people where they were born, are currently living or recently received a wrongfully addressed post card from. There is a sub-division for players who choose to use their college to define their name, even though they dropped out freshman year in 1984. Just how specific they are varies from national monikers (Non-US only, mostly Canadian), state-wide (Mostly US), to the local small one horse town that recently got the Interweb thingy hooked on up. The reason why US players choose state-wide as opposed to a national identity is because they believe that since they exist, it must naturally be assumed that they are from America (the fact that the state they mention is an American state can be ignored for the sake of my argument.). This is deeply entrenched in their genes from an early age, where they watch the "World Series" being played out by only American teams. Canada has a law where any Canadian person who is likely to come into contact with people from a country other than the US must at all times remind those foreign people that they are Canadian and NOT American. This goes for real life as well as in poker rooms. The "LTB" player is likely to loose all their chips.   2. "Poker Terms"   Completely made up examples include: "PocketAces", "RiverMan", "Foldme", "QueensFull".  The poker terms player likes to hide their true identity behind any random poker term they find on any poker medium available. Favorite among this all too popular breed are "pocket" anything. It has been proven by The Greater Univeristy of Poker in North-West Dubbo that by naming yourself after a good starting hand will fool 43.765% of professional players into thinking you have that starting hand on most occasions. The number increases when the hands become higher ( 'PocketKings" = 74.218% and "BigSlick" = 66.667%). The unfortunately reality of the results of the study from the Greater Univeristy of Poker in North-West Dubbo is that their credibility has been shot to pieces ever since they recommended the best way to win lotto was birthdays. The "Poker Terms" player is also an expert on all things poker, and as the name suggests they will throw in any poker term they can at any time no matter if it fits or not. Please see example below.   PocketAces:  Ha! Bet you didn't see my boat coming down the river with the cowboys doing the paddling!  RiverMan:  Yeah, but my bullets and hammer UTG sucked out your runner-runner over pair!  PocketAces:  But my button burst your bubble on spades full of broadway with crabs kicker on the blind!  RiverMan:  N00b.  They hate anybody who mentions the movie "Rounders", and thinks ESPN ruined the true, pure poker that they play. If you beat them it was luck, if they win it was skill. The "Poker Terms" player is likely to loose all their chips.    3. "I'm Famous!"    Completely made up examples: "U5h3r", "Tr1ppl3HHH18", "SlimShady", "DustinDiamond4EVA".  On rare occasions, the "I'm Famous" player attempt to convince the rest of the table that they are in fact who their names says they are. While maybe the odd celebrity may try their hand at poker every now and then, I find it hard to believe that they would spend a few hours online trying to win $29.66 (with the exception of Dustin Diamond perhaps. Hey, Screech gotta eat you know.). This is seen as really pathetic, especially when "BigGuy1955" tries to hit on "BritneyGurl" and asking if she could show some more skin in her next film clip.(this is of course not confined to online poker.). When the "I'm famous" player is not trying to impersonate any random celebrity but just honoring them by name, all seems well...That is, until "SlimShady" sits at the same table as "R34LSlim" - and nobody stands up no matter how politely you ask and it is best to turn off chat immediately. The "I'm famous" player is likely to loose all their chips.   4. "It's Me".   Completely made up examples include: "BarrySmith", "JoyceUK", "Henry21", "FitFrank69".  "It's Me" players really don't understand what the Internet is for, and that is hiding behind an online persona and never letting on to who you relly are. They have chosen a name that even the Boulder City Police could decipher (Jay Leno would be so proud of me right now). With no imagination evident, you can guarantee the "It's Me" player will either see every single flop just to make sure their 72o is no good, or they will fold everything that isn't pocket aces. When ever anybody wins a hand - no matter in what fashion - they are sure to post "nh" in the chat box, and give you a "gg" when they finally loose their stack. When playing against an "it's Me" player, you must never post anything similar to them, as it will start a never ending run of constanants the likes of Wheel of Fortune only dreams about. See example below:   BarrySmith:  gl all.  JoyceUK : TY.U2.  BarrySmith:  lol. vnh.  JoyceUK:  ROFL :)  BarrySmith:  ty. asl?  JoyceUK:  U BBQ?  BarrySmith:  udg fgrt qzxc?  JoyceUK:  IOU SAD VCR DVD FUBAR.  And on it goes. Do not enter into any discussion about important shit, because it is guaranteed that the "It's Me" player has a world of experience and an opinion on every matter that your tender years could not understand. This does not include poker, even though they will tell you what you should have done all the time regardless if you won or not. The "It's Me" player will loose all their chips.   5. "l33t".   Completely made up examples: "$3xyH4x0r", "1  The scurge of the internet, online poker rooms are not immune to the "Leet" player. The have studied the "shift" key for hours, and experimented with "crtl" and breifly "alt", and is even prone to binges of "Caps Lock". You are a "n00b" if you are sitting on the same table as them and dare to speak. Similar to the "Poker Terms" player, if they beat you then you have been "0wn3d", you stupid fucking noob you. If you beat them, it is because they are so damn drunk right now (they're not). He knows that this poker site is fixed and he has proof (he doesn't). You may beat him but he was on fire last night when he won $10K at the bigger limit tables, he is just slumming it on these tables you are on because he is bored and still so damn drunk (they're still not). The "leet" will loose all their chips.  Well, there you have it. Try and spot as many of these as you can in your next poker room and already you will have the advantage.  Off the topic of poker, I'm pretty stoked to be going to see the Australian Premier of "Walking Tall" later this week, and even happier about the fact that The Rock will be there in person. He has been doing all the usual media spots aorund Oz at the moment and is good to listen to. Been watching a bit of Futurama on the weekend, and with quotes like these I don't know why it got cancelled:       "Now the dominoes fall like a house of cards. Check mate!" - Zapp Brannigan.      Damn that was a good show. Now that I have already received a response to my last little update with the links, I will be trying to add one more link per update, be that poker related or not. This week I am adding   urlLink Wrestlecrap  . If you love professional wrestling, or just a good laugh at it, then be sure to have a look. And buy his book too, it's worth a read.  That will do for this update, don't know when the next one will be but hopefully I will be above my current $0.00 by then. Cheers.

       Reading another poker blog over at   urlLink  Guinness and Poker    by Iggy, and it strikes up an interesting point. The cliff notes of the update are a friend of his won a $50,000 tournament when everybody hates him because of what he puts in the chat window. He is offensive, quotes rap music and posts IN ALL CAPS! A general shit talker - show me any online poker room without at least one? Iggy also goes on about how all the observers and other players are saying how lucky he was to win and how much they hate him, so on and so forth. Well I'm going to chime in with my two cents...      He won. When someone wins a big money tournament like that, with 500 other players or however many more there were, chances are there are some very decent players among the punters. ANYBODY who wins ANY tournament needs a little luck. I don't care who you are, luck plays a part of it. The idea of a poker player is to limit how much luck you need. I am reminded of Rickson Gracie, one of the greatest no-holds-barred fighters of all time and a genuine legend in Brazil. He even concedes that luck plays a part in all his fights, his job is to limit how big a part it plays. Calling the winner lucky is like calling the ocean wet - that's just how it is and doesn't really need to be pointed out.    We see how professional players almost adopt a persona at the table. Just this last weekend watching the World Poker Tour on Channel 10 (YES! About time Australia caught up on the poker boom) I see players telling out-and-out lies about what is in their hand, and that is with cameras everywhere. While many actors may be currently trying their hand at poker, I believe there are many poker players who are already professional actors. This is true for the online game also. If I was in that tournament (and with $300 buy-in it is highly unlikely) I would have assumed he was making an ass of himself on purpose. Like Brad Pitt says in "Ocean's 11", the first rule of poker is to leave emotion at the door. AustinKearns may have been playing the fool, but he wasn't playing foolish. Or I could be wrong and he is just an ass.    I have never seen an online poker room that couldn't turn off the chat. Really, it isn't that hard. 'Click' and it's all over. If the chat is annoying you that much, switch it off. I must admit I usually play with it on, but only post something if I really feel the need to. If someone seems like a genuine player and nice enough, even though I don't show my winning hand when I take it down,I might tell them (99% of the time only if I wasn't bluffing mind you.).     He won. You lost. Get over it. Did I mention that already?     And who am I to say all this? Well, I'm just a nobody and that's nobody's opinion!    If you're reading this (and who isn't?) then you'd probably like Iggy's blog. I'll make it the first one add to my links on the side. Please don't get annoyed with the site if it seems all scrambled - I really do have no idea what I'm doing and hoping that the templates need as little manual touchs as possible.    Enough of that, back to my game. It is with great pleasure that I tell you "Uranga" has left for the time being. I now know once again what an Ace looks like, and have been pulling a few big pots. No winners yet, but I came real close on Aloha and enjoyed it.    I was having a roller coaster game on Aloha, and played really well up until one hand. With about $3K in chips, I was 2nd at the table to chip leader on $5.5K. With top pair on the flop, I made a modest raise, and then was re-raised by CL to $600. Here is where I made the mistake. I am used to playing on Poker Pages where you start with $10K and a $600 bet is not uncommon. On Aloha, it is quite a big bet. I was not thinking straight and thought "I'll have a look for that piddly amount, you ogre-headed buffoon" - paraphrasing slightly. The turn came, and I was no better but for some reason, another $600 bet and I was looking again - "You can't scare me off my most noble of quest with barely a pittance to show!" - paraphrasing again but slowly loosing the plot. The the river and finally I realized what I had done when the pot was bigger than my stack. I had dropped nearly $2K on a hand where I was merely speculating. He bet $600 again, and I folded in the first sensible move I made all night as he showed a full house over my pair of Queens. But the damage had been done and my mighty stack was gone. Not long after this, I was all in with AcJc and got beaten by trips 2's to end my night at 25th, 15 places out of the money. I don't regret going all in on AcJc pre-flop with my little stack, but I know I really lost when I went searching for copper with a golden shovel. Wow, that's a pretty cool analogy, I think I might re-use that in a film later on...    I'm going to add a few more links to the side, here is my explanation for each of them - both poker related and not. I hope these links reflect my online usage and not just plugs for other sites that will plug my site back (they won't).        urlLink  Guinness and Poker    - One of my favorite poker blogs, he doesn't try to be too preachy about how to play and seems really well read on the subject. Worth a read, and his posts seem to be of epic proportions more often than not.    urlLink  Poker Pages    and   urlLink  Aloha poker    - where I am currently playing. I am convinced the only reason you would go to Aloha is the free rolls. If you want real money, look elsewhere.    urlLink  Dave Gorman    - The funniest comedian I have ever seen live. If you here that his "Google Whack Adventure" is playing anywhere near you, do whatever you can to see it. I also got a copy of the book of the same name signed by him when I saw his show in Sydney earlier this year.    urlLink  Fark    - If you don't know what Fark is, it's about time you found out. Funny links to news stories and other stuff. Don't bother with the comments on each article though; Why do people spend the time to comments on an article about, say, basketball when all they want to say is "I don't like basketball.". Like I always say, the world is full of stupid people.    urlLink  Mentally Incontinent    - funny stories from the life of Joe the Peacock. Well written and has a reasonable following there. Some of the stories are a little less humorous and a little more self-enlightenment (like the current romance.net series) but hopefully Joe will return to the comedic brilliance that is "Ouch" and "The Cows...They talk!".     urlLink  Something Awful    - Another mostly comedy site. Really funny stuff mixed in with "how many times can I swear in this post" stuff. Check out the "comedy goldmine", as it is just that.    urlLink  Hawthorn Football Club    - The mighty Hawks! Ok, so we might have not met our expectations this year (2 wins for the season as opposed to a possible premiership...), but the hawks will be back!  That will do for now, and I hope somebody appreciates the biggest post to date. This week I will hopefully get the chance to play more than two or three games and get back in the black!
