						   What a long day. It was finally the time to leave the great city of Boston. I had to do one of the things I absolutely loath. I had to pack all of my stuff up. How I hate doing that. Anyway, I will have a lot of fond memories of Boston. There were a lot of people that I met and alot of things that I learned while I was out there. I will miss that place. But it is back to reality and the world that I know.  I shared a cab ride to the airport, sharing the fare always keeps the cost down somewhat. As I was going to the airport I had mixed feelings. I was sad to leave this great environment, but was happy for the memories that I will always cherish in my heart. I will always be greatful for the things I did out in Boston, and for the friendships that came from that time there.  I boarded the plane and everything went without any problems. As we were on our descent towards Chicago we passed through several layers of clouds. At one moment we were above one set of clouds but below another. As I looked up towards the sun, the light broke through and shone into my window, and God winked at me. I felt an overwhelming sense of happiness.  I have been a very fortunate person. I have been a very lucky man. I have been lucky for the things that I have been a part of, and of the people that I have met. This trip has opened my eyes to just how lucky I have been. It has been good to me, and I only hope that it can get better.  So it is with a wink, and a smile that I go forward.

						   "Now here's a little story I like to tell about...." So goes the beginning of one of my all time favorite songs. Paul Revere by the Beastie Boys from their classic album "License to Ill". Most people like "No Sleep til Brooklyn" or "You gotta fight for your right. (to party)". So everyone reading this is probably wondering where is he going with this?  I was in the north end of Boston today and went to see the home of Paul Revere. The day started out as any of the other days here in Boston began. I went to my morning seminar at the Washington Center. I then took off for a lunch downtown at the Black Rose pub. Leona, the best bartender ever,  was working today. I sat and we talked for a few minutes. I was in search of a lobster meal, and this pub was happy tom oblige. Many first occured on this day for me. I had my first full lobster dinner, my first bowl of clam chowder(good stuff I might add), and my first slice of Boston creme pie, talk about a diabetics nightmare.  While I was at the pub I got a call from someone that I had the pleasure of making an acquaintance while I have been here in Boston. Her name is Debra, from Los Angeles, a very nice person indeed. She told me she has to talk to me right away, she had something important to tell me. I told her where I was at and she said that she would meet me at the pub.  When she got there she gave me a pass into the Fleet Center for the nights events. This pass would in fact get me into the building for the nomination of our future President John Kerry. I thought that could be the best thing in this entire world. She had gotten a pass to get into the convention, and wanted instead to give it to me. I appreciated the gesture, but told her that I had already been in the hall. I told her let's give it to someone that hadn't been in the hall yet. Debra quickly agreed.  We had a lot of time to kill for the day so we went to Boston Harbor first. It was pretty out there looking over the water. It was interesting to see the apartments over looking the harbor and the parking docks right there for their boats. I wonder how much it would cost to have one of those places?  We walked all over the north end of Boston. The both of us fit in, shes a tanned brunette, and I'm a pudgy mexican. The north end of Boston is inhabited by the city's italian population. We went there to see Paul Revere's house. It was pretty good to see where one of the sons of liberty actually lived. It turns out that this house was built in the late 17th century. It was about 100 years old when Revere bought it.  We then went souvenir shopping and ended up in Quincy Market. That was were the John Kerry store was at. (This is where you spit and hiss my conservative brother.) This place was filled with many different campaign stickers, buttons, t-shirts, and all kinds of other stuff. It amazes me how expensive the stuff was, but I did get a few things.  A bunch of us went to the Red Hat for our last night of convention watching. We watched in eager anticipation to see Kerry's acceptance speech. I was nervous and hoped that he wouldn't come off as wooden as he has done in the past.  This raises a question in me. Why do Democrats always nominate these stiffs? Gore, Kerry, the list goes on. Can someone please tell me why???  Kerry gave a great speech. Someone made the comment that he had "hoped that Kerry would at least hit a double, but he instead knocked it out of the park." I have to agree.

						   Chief of Staff of the DNC Leah D. spoke to us earlier today. She was insightful into the inner working of the bureaucrats on Capital Hill. She has a vast array of knowledge that only a true Hill insider could give. She also had a very idealistic outlook on government.  It is interesting to see how laws passed by the legislative branch are enacted and interpreted by the Executive Branch. The Executive Branch and its bureaucracy help to implement the laws and procedures. Sometimes a law that was begun to help can have an adverse effect on individuals.  It is tough not to forget whom you are working for when you are in the White House. You are working for the people of the United States and not just for a select few.  Some advice she gave to the crowd included. Learn how to do everything in the office this will make you indispensable. Always get in the way. Change happens when you get in the way.  Reg Weaver. The President of the National Education Association was by far the best speaker that I have seen in my entire time here at the Washington Center. He was very raw and very energetic. He engaged the crowd like no one I had ever seen before. If there were a style of speaker that I would love to emulate, it would be this mans.  He began his speech with a story about a mouse. The moral was that even if something doesn’t seem to impact you, it sure could.  This man gives us two sound bites of the day. One of these is an inspirational little ditty; the other is an indictment of the entire education system under the current White House administration.  “If the mind can conceive it, and you can believe it, you can achieve it”  “The White House wants you to believe anyone can be a teacher as long as they have a Bachelor’s degree. That’s like saying anyone can be a doctor as long as they like to cut.”  I truly wish that I would have more of an opportunity to see this man in action.  Amy Walter then spoke about different things about campaigns. Some of the advice that she gave to the members in attendance was, don’t go to Washington right away. Gain contacts and experience elsewhere so that you will become more valuable in DC.  She gave insight into the apparent polarization of the United States as a whole. In most of the state legislatures across the US there is almost a 50-50 split among partisans. The GOP also has an eleven-seat majority in the US House of Representatives and two-seat majority in the US Senate.  As of this moment in the polls running for the presidency of the United States, Kerry has a safe margin of 165 electoral votes while Bush has a margin of 182. This means that the battleground states have a total of 120 votes to be won by both men.  When a tie is not a tie. The polls in most battleground states and collectively around the United States show Bush in a virtual tie with Senator Kerry. No incumbent President has ever had less then a 50% job approval rating after June of an election year and won re-election. The last person to do this was Harry S. Truman in 1948.  I was able to gain credentials into the Democratic National Convention this evening. I was scheduled to attend the bloggers event in Charlestown as part of my fieldwork detail, but this was an opportunity that I could not pass up. I initially only had credentials to get into the building, and not reach the floor. I was able to find a delegate from my home state of Illinois that I knew. Her name is Sheila Miller, and she was kind enough to lend me her floor credentials for a few minutes so that I could get into the convention hall itself.  The sight was truly enlightening. I have never been apart of anything like it. I will make sure to try to run and become a delegate next time an election comes around. It was truly powerful to be apart of something that is bigger than yourself. It was an amazing experience and although I was only there on the convention floor for a few minutes, it truly inspired me.  At the hall I was able to get pictures of many different Democratic icons of our time. I took a picture of Reverend Al Sharpton, Reverend Jesse Jackson, Representative Dennis Kuccinich (D-OH), and Senator Joe Liebermann (D-CT). I was also able to see Jerry Springer, Al Franken, and Representative Bobby Rush (D-IL). I also took pictures with Art Alexakis of the band Everclear, and Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan.

						   I did not go to this morning’s seminar because I instead had a fieldwork assignment for the Revolutionary Women’s seminar at the new Boston Convention and Exhibition Center. I was a guest and was not there on a voluntary status. It took awhile for things to get going, and had I known that I did not truly need to be there until 1 pm I would have gone to the seminar this morning.  I choose to go to the one hour-long mini-workshop that was setup before we were to go to the big convention hall to hear the main speakers. It was entitled, A foot in the door. Getting started in Politics at the local level. Although this was geared towards women there were some insightful things that were brought to the forefront.  Some of the ideas shared by these women on the panel were. You have to get into the game to learn the process. You have to be prepared to lose. Running is in itself an art and a skill. Go with your heart and interests. The one thing that they said and I never gave much thought to was, most women run campaigns on the issues and not on vanity.  The one sound bite of the day came from Martha Copeland. “They call it a campaign because it is War.”  At the event that occurred later on in the day, I had the great pleasure of hearing Governor Howard Dean give a speech and then introduce the women that would later speak to us. This group of women included, Secretary of State Madeline Albright, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Ambassador Carol Mosely Braun, and Senator Hillary Clinton.  The interesting thing about Governor Dean’s speech is that it was very toned down, but still had a forceful air to it. He later ended the speech with a very toned down version of his speech that he gave to his supporters after losing the Iowa caucus. He named a list of many states, but did not give the battle cry. The place did still erupt in applause.  Many of the women on the panel gave support to the notion of a possible women being in the White House in the next few years. They kept alluding to Senator Clinton being the first women President of the United States. The Senator was visible taken aback by such public displays of support. I think this has to do with the rumors that she is secretly hoping that Senator Kerry does not win this years election so that she can run in 2008.  Later on this evening I went to watch some of the convention speeches at the Red Hat once again. I was unable to gain a ticket to get into the convention center for the second night in a row. Hopefully I will be able to get a ticket before this week is out. I found it rather tough to get into the speech delivered by Senator Kennedy. I thought the delivery was rather flat.  I left the pub for a little while and walked towards the Fleet Center to see what was going on. I had heard that “The Cage” was a sight to see. “The Cage” is the nickname given to the fenced off area where protesters are supposed to engage in their distaste for the convention. It is rather sad that when people speak of free speech they are forced to do it in a hindered manner. I realize that all of the delegates and parties going into the Fleet Center already have their minds made up to support the Democratic Party, but these people should at least have to see the many words and faces that these protesters portray.  I later watched the keynote speech by State Senator Barrack Obama (D-Chicago). He is truly a rising star and gave a very inspiring speech to the masses in attendance and watching on televisions across our nation. His message gave hope to all those that feel that the American Dream eludes them to this day. He states that we are but one nation and that we must unite together for the common good.  I later saw Teresa Heinz Kerry’s speech and honestly was unmoved. I am not sure exactly what it was supposed to do, all I know is it didn’t do anything for me.

						   Congressman (Ed Pastor) D-AZ was one of the featured speakers today at the Washington Center’s morning seminar. It was rather inspiring to see a Chicano speak in front of our audience. This is a man that is a pioneer and a trailblazer for the Latino community. I made sure to listen to his discussion intently.  He first stated that when then President Clinton would give his State of the Union address every January, the congressional members would take bets on how long it was going to be. Pastor stated that if you bet less than an hour you would surely lose.  Congressman Pastor previously held the chairmanship of the National Council of La Raza. He is also a member of the Hispanic Congressional Caucus.  In Florida there is a shift from the traditional Cuban nationals and their bond with the GOP, to a more liberal stance and connecting with the Democratic Party. This is because of the younger generations that are now living there, and also because of the influx of many more South American immigrants.  Here is a little tidbit that I was unaware of. United States Supreme Court Justice William Rehnquist served as an attorney in Phoenix, Arizona in the 1950’s. He was part of a group of Republicans that would challenge Hispanic voters on the legality of their vote. In some cases he would outright lie to them that they did not meet the requirements to cast a ballot in an election.  David Wilhelm served as the former Chairman of the Democratic Party. He was also the campaign manager of Al Gore in his failed attempt at the Presidency in 2000. He stated the top ten things to do to win an election. Always be the aggressor and determine the agenda. Figure out your competitive edge, drive it, and don’t go negative. Your opponent will drive the competitive edge take steps to limit it. Know your targets, get to 50% of the vote don’t waste time getting to 100% When attacked respond in a hurry. The phone call that you must return is the one that makes your stomach turn. Be on message and stay repetitive. Understand the rules of the game. Create an organizational structure that can deliver bad news. Values and Big ideas move people. Work on the long term not the short term.  Governor Michael Dukakis came to speak to us as well. I never knew how short of a man he really was. He spoke to us about his failed attempt at the White House in 1988. He was very candid and a very approachable guy.  He had the sound bite of the day. “It is my fault that George W. Bush is President today. If I would have beat his old man, then no one would have ever heard of this guy.”  One piece of advice that I found inspiring was, don’t let anyone tell you that you have to compromise your integrity in this business (politics). It is always interesting on how people outside of this game think that politicians are nothing but self-serving hacks.  Another quote that he stated was “Foolish consistency is the Hob-Goblin of narrow minds.” Ralph Waldo Emerson. After the session was over I had the chance to shake hands with the former Governor. He also gave the class his e-mail address.  urlLink M.Dukakis@neu.edu   Later this evening I went to a pub called the Red Hat. It is the happening place here for those young people that wanted to watch the convention but did not have access to credentials. The nice thing about this place is that they had a 10-cent Buffalo Wing special. I hadn’t had any wings on a Monday Night since being back at Western. I had to jump on this special.  I spoke at length with a guy from Washington DC about many different things. We then watched the many different speakers that opened this year’s convention. Al Gore spoke with more vigor and energy then I had ever seen him give. Now if this was the Al Gore that would have ran for President four years ago, then he certainly would have won. He was not a statue as he had been portrayed in the past. This was not the Gore that inspired so many parodies on Saturday Night Live by Darrell Hammond.  Hillary Clinton gave a rousing speech that served as the introduction to the night’s last speaker. The incomparable President Bill Clinton. His speech was one of unrivaled genius. He told the crowd what they had come to hear. Clinton spoke of how the current administration had sullied the American people, by causing the largest deficit in the history of the United States. He gave us hope in his words and showed why he was still the master of the party. We the members of the Democratic Party, and those that hold Progressive ideals can only hope that John Kerry can carry a message half as resounding as Clinton’s.

						   After standing in line on Landsdowne street for 3 hours waiting to get into a jam pakced club, I was not able to see any of the stars that I wanted to see. I guess thats what happens when you are just a lowly peasant and everyone else is in the VIP sections.  The club was very nice. It had to very big bars on each side of the room. I would have guessed that a few thousand people were there. The music was good, the DJ was Biz Markie of early nineties Rap fame. He through out a mix that gave me chills. Some of the music I hadn't heard in a very long time. There were songs he played that took me back to the days of hanging out at Jaime's eastside house. That was a long time ago.  Anyway, the only thing that made the wait to get inside the club bearable, was that across the street there was a game going on inside Fenway Park. The local heros were duking it out with the Evil Empire of New York. I have to say that although the wait was a pain in the ass, getting inside was worth it.

						   Democratic Gain is finally upon us. I have chosen to participate in this series of workshops for many reasons. One it would be good to gain the knowledge of how to run a campaign, two this will look very good on a resume, and three (the most selfish of the reasons) I want to go to the JumpOff party this Sunday night at the Avalon nightclub on Lansdowne street next to Fenway Park. There are supposed to be a lot of celebrities there, such as Bill and Hillary Clinton, Al Sharpton, Terry McAuliffe, Jerry Springer, John Stewart, with music by Biz Markie, and the X-ecutioners.  Gain:  Field Organizing: Contact voters directly Identify those that support you  The Field Plan: Keep it simple Be creative Be flexible Detail your activities. Include a timetable: Time-Date-Location of all activities. Measure your success with specific goals. Hold it and your organization accountable.

Understanding the Dynamics of the race and campaign: ·        What is the role of the staff? Do you need to increase your name recognition? How much time will you spend persuading undecided voters? How massive does your GOTV (Get Out The Vote) operation need to be? How much of the budget will the field operation have to work with? Will there be paid phone bankers and mail? What are the office space needs? How much is available for GOTV? Know the process & laws. Can people vote by mail or absentee?  Vote Goal: Minimum amount of votes needed to win. Expected Vote ______ x (.50) + 1 = amount needed to win  Comfortable margin of victory Expected Vote ______ x (.52) = amount of vote  This is a WAG (Wild Ass Guess)             Vote goals are based off of prior elections. Don’t know how many people will actually show up on Election Day. Targeting:             Democratic Base Voters Will always vote for you. Get them to the polls maximize their turnout and involvement.             Persuadable Voters                         Ticket splitters, move to Dem column.             Republican Base Voters                         Will not vote for you don’t waste time courting them.  Base Vote + Persuadable Vote = # of votes needed to win.

						   “Conventions are like Jeopardy, you have all the answers, it’s just formulating the question.” Dr. Sandy Maisel  President Bush gave a speech yesterday beginning to outline his second term initiatives. Half of this speech was pro-Bush and the other half was anti-Kerry/Edwards. The President’s second term agenda is education and the continuance of his tax cuts.  The GOP will have Vice-President Dick Cheney campaign throughout the Democratic National Convention. This is unprecedented. In years past opposition has taken a back seat in times of their opposing parties conventions.  The Democrats have raised over 36 million dollars in the last 30 days. It was thought previously that Bush would have an insurmountable lead in the financial aspect of this campaign, but that lead has been cut very quickly.  Michael Genovese.  Americans vote at a very low rate. The United States has the worse turnout rate in the world. Americans have many different elections. The United States elects more officials than anywhere else in the world. Most people tend to forget that the federalist Government of ours is bigger than most other democracies. Most other democracies are drastically smaller than the many differing states of this union. We have a far larger mass and greater population than anywhere else.  In analyzing partisan voter preferences one only need to look at gender to be a factor in choice. Women tend to vote fairly more often for Democratic candidates then for Republicans. The Latino population is also making their voice heard in politics and it is felt that this base needs to be courted in the future.  Most young people view voting as being up to the individual person and note a civic duty.  I went to Fenway Park today. This was the second game that I have gotten to see in my favorite Ball Park. I was able to scalp a bleacher ticket for $20 face value. I only needed one so that usually makes the price go down. The Yankees are in town this weekend, and that would definitely be the ticket to get. It was an extremely hot day out in those bleachers. This was probably the hottest day of the summer so far. I walked around after the 6th inning and started taking pictures all over the place. I was able to sneak into the box seats a few rows back from the third base side for two innings. It was nice to be so close to the field. Man those tickets are expensive though, $70 per ticket in the box seats.  I went to this club near Fannueil Hall near the Boston Court House. This was a nice hip-hop club by the name of Q. My first impressions of the place were a reminder of a club back in Chicago that I used to go to when I first turned 21. The place was named Elixir and the one thing that I like about it so much was that it had a gothic feeling to it. The bar, which always had this hot little blonde number, was actually lit up by candles. This was a very cool thing to see.  They had a camera crew from Playboy television there. It must have been for some show that they produce. I have to be honest and say that I was hoping for a big Girls Gone Wild thing to occur, but unfortunately that did not happen.

						   *Quick note:  If this sounds a little bit like a technical political essay I have to inform you now that I am using most of this writing not only to inform all of you of everything that is going on here in Boston, but also I am turning this in for credit to my group leader here at the Washington Center.  Dr. Maisel brought up some valid points during this mornings lecture on the nominating process. How can someone design a process where the best two people for the job run against each other at the end? This tends to conjure up a quick discussion of one thing that I have noticed about the people here at the Washington Center. They do not necessarily like John Kerry, or even think that he was the best candidate for the job, but they certainly despise George Bush.  The current presidential nomination process is very different from the process in place prior to the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. In this year Eugene McCarthy challenged incumbent President Lyndon Johnson for the Democratic nomination. McCarthy ran under a peace banner and wanted to get our troops out of Vietnam. McCarthy put in a strong showing in the New Hampshire primary, and Johnson decided to pull out of the race for President. RFK had entered the fray prior to that and this convinced Johnson that he couldn’t win. Kennedy won a series of primaries and was on his way to capture the nomination, before a bullet took his life in California.  Kennedy was the primary season winner and the man who would be nominated at the convention in Chicago, now that he was dead, who would run under the Democratic banner? Hubert H. Humphrey, the Vice-President of the United States, a man that had not even entered the primaries was able to gather enough delegates support to nominate him, even before the convention took place. People cried foul and rose up to protest. The party answered with committees to review how their system worked.  The McGovern/Fraiser committee found that each state had different ways of choosing their delegates. In 1968, 16 states had primaries, 25 had caucuses, and the rest let their states Governor choose the delegates. (At this point it got a little hazy, I was tired and passed out for a while.)  Frontloading a primary gives even more added weight to the winner of the early primaries. If they were spread out further, people might have the chance at launching a comeback, but as it stands now, after New Hampshire and Iowa, someone is in bad shape if they didn’t win at least one of them.  Dr. Susan Bear, spoke about the complete differences in organizing in the Democratic and Republican parties. The GOP feels that all power should be at the state and local levels; while the Dems feel that a strong national party is essential to its survival.  We had a reception at City Hall today. This thing was by far the biggest event planning disaster I had ever seen. We were actually sitting all dressed up in concrete stairs. At the bottom of those stairs stood the mayor of Boston talking over this horrible PA system that no one could hear. I had to high tail it out of there quickly; the bright side is that I got the chance to eat for free anyway.  Later this evening I went to Cambridge to look around Harvard square. It is a very nice area, and was delighted to see so many people out and about on a nice summer evening. I ducked in to a bar and grill called the Cambridge Common. A nice place it kind of reminded me of an Applebee’s restaurant a square bar in the center of the restaurant and tables around it. I sat at the bar watching the game for a while the game started off with the Baltimore Orioles scoring early and then the Sox tying it in the 4th .It looked promising for a while until Pedro gave up a few hits and all went down hill from there.  There were two older gentlemen sitting next to me watching the game as well. I started to speak to them and turns out that one was a retired Psychiatrist and the other was a Professor of Social Sciences over at Harvard. Two very nice gentlemen, but as I began to speak to them more and more, the thought occurred to me. These guys aren’t liberal minds. These two are conservative in their ideology. We spoke about many different things, from the cost of medicine (which the Doctor said was too high, and even advocated a free market economy on our medicines.); too why the insurance agency sucks, and even spoke about Iraq, and the release of the 9/11-commission report.  We spoke for a few hours and exchanged stories. It was rather enjoyable to see a different point of view, considering I am with many like-minded individuals, and it is rather tough to get a dissenting opinion over here. The Psychiatrist did give me a quote that I have to send back to all of you. This is originally a French quote, but Winston Churchill later borrowed it. “A man that isn’t liberal before the age of 30, has no heart. A man that isn’t conservative after 30, has no brain.” So sorry to my GOP brother out there, but now I can understand the heart problems at such a young age, and as for my red haired friend out across the Mississippi, thats a cold blooded thing to say.

						   Kenneth Greenberg the Dean of Arts and Sciences from Suffolk University began the morning session. He is a History Professor, with an emphasis on American Slavery.  When John Winthrop landed at Boston in 1630, he uttered the phrase, "City on a hill. The eyes of the world are upon us." He spoke this to tell his fellow travelers that the world would watch to see their colonization of the new world.  He began to prep us for the things to come in the next few days as the convention opens up over Sunday night with Delegation events, and meetings all next week. Physical participation in the convention events can paradoxically render its significance Unnewsworthy. Basically when you are part of a historical event, you tend to forget the larger message to it. A person that attended Woodstock might just remember sitting in the mud, and not think about how this has become a cultural and historical phenomenon. There is an illusion that there is a center to the convention events. There really are not any, and make sure to pay close attention to the little things that occur around you. Just keep in mind that the real action is all around us.   Dr. Sandy Maisel, Colby College spoke of the context of Campaign 2004, He began with the statement that this campaign began with the 2000 election. It is a continuing expansion of televisions coverage of elections.   He stated that our democracy has to change the way it elects Presidents. Looking at a map and seeing America in the context of Blue and Red areas is wrong. Many states are highly divided in their choices for President. The Electoral College is a winner take all system, the only two states that don’t follow this is Nebraska, and Maine. These states give votes to the candidate that gains the most votes per congressional district, and the candidate with the most votes in the entire state get the two votes from the Senate seats. We have simultaneous elections, Presidential, Senate, Congressional, State, and local governments. People tend to get confused as the office gets closer and closer to home.   As it stands right now Kerry and Bush need 270 Electoral votes to win the Presidency. Right now Kerry has 11 states for a total of 165 votes, Bush has 22 states with 182 votes. The battleground states for this election will be, Florida, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. These are rich with Electoral votes, and any one of them can swing the election towards the winner, such as Florida did in 2000. There has been more money raised and spent on this election than in anytime in the history of the Presidency of the United States.   C-Span’s Unconventional Political Coverage brought to us, two producers for the great information channel. Richard Weinstein (Family Guy. I wish I had a Jew…), and Russell Logan.  C-Span is sent to over 90 million homes in America. 50 Million people state that they are regular viewers. The channel gets it’s funding solely from the fees that people pay when paying their cable bills. Five cents from every bill goes to pay for the production of this channel and its programming. Of these viewers 34% state they are Conservative, 36% are Moderate, and 23% identify themselves as liberal.   C-Span is different in that it shows a different side of politics. It doesn’t just show the sound bite and picture of the day, instead it follows events from start to finish and gives people a better feel for the candidate, or politician. All of these people do have a human side to them after all.  One thing that I did find reassuring about these two men, is their answer to a statement that one of my fellow students said. She made the comment that she gets most of her news from "The Daily Show with John Stewart", I find this rather sad on her part, but I thought it was pretty cool when they admitted that they enjoyed that show a lot. It goes to show that these two men that hobnob with the movers and shakers in Washington, can have just as twisted a sense of humor as I.   Michael Genovese, of Loyola Marymount presented his speech, The First Presidential 9-11 election. Before I give highlights of this speech and what I most gained from it, I must first say that this man’s approach to speech was a welcome one. He had a humor to him that was very good-natured; there were many little things that he said that got a roar of laughter from the audience. If there is a type of speaker that I would like to become it would be one like this, but not only like this, but to also inspire people as well.   Dr. Genovese, gave the opening remarks of how Constitutionally, Congress is stronger than the President. I would agree with this statement, but in years past we have seen the President become stronger and stronger through the use of Executive Orders and Agreements, also the budgeting initiatives as well. I could go on and on, but I won’t, at least not for the moment.  Most countries have systems of government where their heads must be time tested and prove themselves through time and rise through the ranks of his/her party. In the United States a political outsider is actually encouraged to run for office, and in some cases can even win. Such is the discouragement that politics is out of touch with everyday citizens. We welcome the chance to have the citizen politician.   Presidential Campaigns (A play in 3 Acts)  Act 1. A referendum on the incumbent  If this incumbent can pass this referendum favorably than Acts 2-3 become irrelevant.  Act 2. Enter the Challenger  The Challenger must give the electorate a reason to vote for him.  Act 3. Post Convention  The Presidential debates are finally here. Rarely are these debates won, but they can be lost. All participants must exhibit caution.   The election of 2004 is a peculiar one, in that neither party is worried about its support base. In most elections, there can be a sway in the support of one party to another for more moderate members. In the past, after the nomination the candidate must solidify his base and then go towards the middle. With this particular cycle, the candidate must appeal to the middle of the road voter.   Can 9-11 impact this race? Can the challenger attack an incumbent on National Security? How should Senator Kerry play up his service record and hit Bush for his non-service? These were some of the questions that were brought up, and none could really be answered.   The best quote out of this presentation would have to be. "The only difference between Al Gore and Osama bin Laden is that bin Laden is wanted."   I have a list of events that I will try to hit over the weekend.  On Friday, July 23 at 7 pm at Fanneul Hall of Emerson College, Dennis Kucinnich and Howard Zinn will be speaking. If only I had known earlier that the Radical Dr of History was going to be in town, I would have brought my copy of "A people’s history of the United States for him to sign." I just hope it is not too expensive to attend.   On Sunday, July 25 from 4-6 pm at the Old West Church, a tribute to Paul Wellstone. The guest speakers at this event include the one and only Al Franken. The cost is $25 but I think that goes to Wellstone’s foundation. This should be a very fun event to attend.   On Monday, July 26 at 10 am at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, a barbeque will be held to help people get together to talk strategy on how to mobilize the people on your college campus to vote.

						   For some odd reason you can not copy and paste on these god forsaken machines here at Suffolk University. I have a rather long post for you guys tonight, the only problem is that I can't paste it here on the Blog. As soon as I figure out a way to paste this thing to the Blog I will. For all you Political Science buffs out there, you should like it when it is posted. I gotta go for now.  &nbsp; &nbsp;

						   The seminar has finally begun, and it looks like there are alot of things that need to be done. There are alot of like minded people here at the Washington Center. Then again go figure as this is the Democratic National Convention. I know a few of you that read this probably just shuddered to think that there are so many liberally minded people that want to become part of the electoral process. My God, the horror.....  &nbsp;  So the morning started out way to early. I woke up about 6:30 after drinking too long and having had only 4 hours of sleep the night before. At least my roommate sleeps like a rock, cause I was snoring like my older brother, sounded like a buzzsaw. Had breakfast before noon, for once in my life, it's free so I might as well take advantage of it. We went to a theater a few blocks from here, it was raining. Which reminds me, I thought the rain only followed me when I drive? Now that I think about it, it rained in New York when I was there in May. Damn, I guess I really do bring rain with me wherever I go.  &nbsp;  We started the morning off with those goofy ice breaker exercises. You know, Hi my name is...... kind of things. Then we had this Assistant Director of the Secret Service speak to us. He was rather insightful, had a few things to say. It was interesting watching him talk, you could see his eyes darting back and forth around the room surveying the area. He was still on the job.  &nbsp;  Right after him we had a US Congressman speak to us, his name was Michael Capuano (D-Ma) this is the guy that now sits in Tip O'Neil's old seat. O'Neil was Speaker of the House back in the 1980's. This gentleman was actually pretty personable, real salt of the earth kind of fellow. He definitely didn't mince words and told you exactly how he felt. Here is a list of some of the more notable things he spoke about. This is the most important election since the Vietnam War era. His own personal philosophy, which I completely agree with, "We owe something to everyone in society. In that we owe some level of healthcare, education, and retirement." He got into politics because he was an "angry young man", and believes that you shouldn't complain about the system if your not engaged in it. I thought this one was pretty good, when he gave the analogy that "Elections are organized fist fights."  &nbsp;  Capuano&nbsp;also spoke about the partisanship on Capitol Hill. When talking about different congressmen he gave the example of how some people overexaggerate when disagreeing with each other. The Congressman then stated just disagree with me, you don't have to get personal. He then cited an example, "Not only do I disagree with my opponent on the other side of the aisle, but he is stupid and evil." The audience laughed, and he continued, "Well maybe I ain't so smart. (gave a curt smile) But Evil?" Then the crowd erupted again. He also cited some of the funny things that people would say to prove a point. "Mr. Speaker, the reason the sun did not come up today is that the extreme left didn't like it, and then taxed it." I know a friend of mine would definitely like that quote.  &nbsp;  He spoke a little bit more about the differences in the people that come to the hill, and how rural representatives get a little bit more exposure. He gave the example of how one Representative read to a sixth grade classroom and it made front page headlines in the town paper. Congressman Capuano, then said "I would have to kill the entire sixth grade to get the front page!"  &nbsp;  For lunch I went to the Black Rose pub downtown by the market area. I thought about getting the lobster, but even here the price is high. $15.99 for a 1 1/2 pounder. To steep for my blood, I got a corned beef sandwich instead. I talked to the bartender for awhile, here name was Leona, a cute brunette Irish girl of about 23 or so. She had the accent, which made me want to talk to her even longer. It is always interesting to talk to people with different accents. She gave me a few pointers on things to do in Boston. You honestly need to talk to everyday people to find out what is going on in these towns.  &nbsp;  I then went to a meeting with a smaller group and the faculty member, that will be my teacher for the next two weeks. We got the rundown of what was expected of us and then sent on our ways. I have some work to do tonight so I better get to it. Have a good one and hope all is well in the Midwest.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  Almost forgot to mention this one. About five blocks away from here there is a Barnes and Noble. So if I get bored I can always go over there to hang out. There's also a Borders about 7 blocks from here.&nbsp;   I hope to learn how to help curb voter apathy. How do we get young people engaged in the process? How do we get everyday people to start to care about the issues? I spoke with a fellow student about this earlier and she stated that if we can just get people to care about one issue very passionately, then maybe they will begin to care about more than one thing and then stay informed. I think this is a strong way to look at these things, but it will take alot to change many years of carelessness. &nbsp; It is important to have a working knowledge of the City of Boston. I was here a few years back, and to tell you the truth, it has come very much in handy. This has helped me, by giving people directions and just letting people know how to get certain places. You also need to just be kind to people. A smile and a nod can get you alot of places. You never know who you might be talking to. &nbsp;  &nbsp;

						   I was out last night until way too late with my buddies in Joliet. I didn't feel all that well this morning as I hit the ATA terminal at Midway in Chicago. To top it all off I wasn't too thrilled about&nbsp;flying to Boston. So after waiting in too many lines for too long of a time, I finally boarded the plane and was aghast at the sight. I never knew that they packed people into these planes like sardines. When you are flying an economy airline, they make sure to get their money's worth. I slowly walked my way to my seat, sat, and sweated out the anticipation of what would be my first flight ever. As a buddy of mine told me the night before, "If you hit any turbulance on the flight you might as well kiss your ass goodbye!" Then the engine roared and the plane started to move very fast and before you know it my ears were popping. I got a slight twinge of nervous stomach. You know the type where you stomach goes into your throat whenever you go over a hill quickly. That was it. &nbsp; As&nbsp;the plane&nbsp;climbed higher than the Sears Tower I realized that I was higher than the clouds, this time in reality not just in a mental state, I felt a sudden foolishness over how much I had over reacted about flying.&nbsp;It really was not a very big deal at all. I began to feel a nervous anticipation of what would certainly be a life changing event in Boston. As we landed it was an overpowering sense of serenity that overcame me. I am glad that I took this chance and am happy to have so many people behind me. &nbsp; As for getting my luggage, that was the easy part the tough part was getting to the Suffolk University dorms. I had to wait 20 minutes with&nbsp;a bag, that weighed more than most young adolescents, for the shuttle bus to come and take me to the subway line. I got to the subway and had to&nbsp;lug that big bag up two flights of stairs. *note to self. Write letter to Teddy K., and John K. about need of escalators in subways. Got off the subway or T as it is known in Boston and then went to the wrong branch of Suffolk University. I talked to a security guard and he informed me of my error. He said I could catch a cab around the corner, but after thinking about it for 2 seconds I decided to tough it out and walk back the other way. This decision was also influenced by the fact that I don't have a whole lot of cash, and that the walk would probably do my chubby self a service. &nbsp; I got checked into the dorm and relaxed for awhile. My roommate showed up. The guy's name is Jesse and he is from Connecticut. Oh yeah, turns out he is a Yankees fan, but hey not everyone is perfect after all. Anyways, gotta get going gonna check out the town. I'll get back to you as soon as I can. &nbsp; I would like to give a shout out to the PoliPrincess, The Eagle has landed, take cover under the mushroom seed. And for everyone else, have a great day.

						   Well I finally got all of the MIG stuff taken care of before this weekends meeting and my travels begin. I can't believe all of the time that I am putting into it right now. I must be either really dedicated or just very bored? I think it is a little of both.  I have to go to Macomb and get all of my stuff moved out of my old place. This ought to be fun to do in the next day. I have to finish up everything out there before I leave for Beantown. It should be a very fast few days. It is already Wednesday, and still have to pack up all of my things for the big trip.   Oh well. It should be a whirlwind couple of weeks now. Must get some sleep, I won't be able to in the next few weeks not with everything to do for the internship.

						   I got an email today from the Washington Center detailing a bunch of the different things that I will be doing in Boston. It seems this thing actually has some academic merit to it after all. It was a laundry list rundown of the different tasks that I have to complete while I am there.  Turns out that I have to interview five random people at the convention, read a book and write a report on it, keep a daily journal, and write two different papers while I am there. All of this in a matter of about 12 days or so. And here I thought it was going to be a cake walk and nothing more than a vacation for me. Who knew that politics was going to involve actual work.   Oh well, at least this will actually help me when I have to turn things in to Dr. Helm for three hours worth of internship credit. I just hope that I will gain some ideas on how to get more people involved in the whole process when I get back to Western this fall.  I guess I am just complaining for the sake of complaining. I know that this is going to be alot of fun while I am in Boston, and the experience is one that I will look back on fondly. In a few days it will all begin and then in a blink of an eye it will all be over.

						   I went to go see the new  urlLink King Arthur  movie today with my brother Art and my cousin Joe. I cannot recall the last time that the three of us went to go see a movie together, and I am afraid I do not know when the next time will be. Joe is moving to Texas soon to be with his wife and two kids. I certainly hope that he finds what he is looking for down there, and wish him the best of luck. I know that he is moving about 30 minutes away from the University of Texas in Austin. I will definitely try to make it down there to visit him and the campus.  I thought the movie was good, but I am partial to the movie  urlLink Excalibur  made in the early 1980’s. Excalibur was based on the book  urlLink Le Morte D’Arthur  written in the 15th Century by Sir Thomas Malory. This new version is based on some new information that was uncovered about the Arthurian legend. I will say that  urlLink Keira Knightley  was nice to look at in this movie. I read somewhere that she got her start as a double for  urlLink Natalie Portman  in the Phantom Menace. You can definitely see a strong resemblance between these two young actresses. Of course, I know not to look to closely at Miss Portman for fear that my friend Ira may get a little upset.

						   It seems that everyone has their own Web Blog nowadays. I figured I might as well join the craze and get my own. Next thing you know I will have a webpage completely devoted to myself. I am vain but not quite that bad.  Anyways, with one week to go until the Democratic National Convention I felt compelled to setup a Blog so that people will be able to keep up with my progress out in Boston. I only hope that I will be able to post on this blog often enough during those two weeks.  I have to be honest and say that I am a little nervous, having never flown before. Better late than never though. It should be a fun time out east, I really enjoyed the last time I was out there and am looking forward to this trip. This trip can definitely have a lasting impact on my life.   I just recently read the book,  urlLink Fifty-Two simple ways to make a difference , written by the late United States Senator from Illinois  urlLink Paul Simon . This is a man that is very inspirational. There are alot of tips in this book on how to make a difference in the world. It is amazing the little things that can be done to change the world around you. It is a relatively quick read, and I highly recommend it to all of you. I will definitely try to take some of his suggestions to heart.

						   You know I have been giving this alot of thought lately. Most people have the view of life that things have to change. Whether it is tax cuts for the wealthy, better education for the poor, Universal Health Care for all, ending hunger, rampant drug use, crime getting out of hand, or even free access to guns. These are just examples but the list is endless on what people perceive is wrong with our world. Now I am not saying that I have the answers, but I do have an idea.  Turn off the Television. Thats right. Turn it off. How many of us are overweight lazy bums because that idiot box gets the best of our lives? I have to admit that I am one of these poor unfortunate souls. I haven't watched a whole lot of TV since I got back from Boston. All that time I was in Boston I never got the chance to watch any TV except for the convention speakers.  It is not only this God forsaken idiot box and its neverending "Reality Television Shows", but also the Xbox, Playstation 2, Gamecube, and whatever other game console came out last week, that robs us of our time. Now that I think about these reality shows, what is realistic about living in a house with 9 other strangers as you all try to manipulate the situation to try to win one million dollars?  I'll give you a reality show. How about a single mother of two that has to have four hours of sleep a night to work two jobs that combined will only pay her 28,000 a year? All the while trying to teach her kids to do right and pray to God that they don't get caught up in the "glamourous life" of drug dealing and other illegal activities. And for these children going to and from school through a neighborhood warzone where there is no one at home to greet them because mommy just went to her other "part-time job" that she works 40 hours a week at. That warzone that teaches a child that education is not the way out, but rather illegal activity where you can make a fast buck, but when caught the price is not at all worth it. Thats a reality show if I have ever heard of one.  Turn off the box. Read a book, a newspaper, a magazine, have a conversation, just do something that will stimulate your mind instead of sitting there like a drooling mindless drone to see whether Cameron Diaz and Justine Timberlake are going to get married or not. All this stuff is done to make you think of things that don't matter. What about making a decent living for yourself and your family? What about being able to gather the necessary skills to get a high paying job? What about education? Is knowing the name of the guy who got filmed in the sack with Paris Hilton going to earn you cash? It could if you were ever on Jeopardy, but then again that is only one question out of a bunch. You better hit the books if you want to get on that program.  Now this rant can't change the world, but I do hope that it will at least get you to open your eyes. Turn off the TV. Go for a walk. Go for a drive. Do something with yourselves just get away from the evil box. You will feel good about yourself, and who knows you might even think about doing something for others.

						   It is now the pleasure of the Illinois Grand Old Party to introduce to you their next candidate for United States Senator of the State of Illinois. Ladies and Gentlemen introducing Alan Keyes of the great state of Maryland. Thats right folks, the guy isn't even from Illinois. What a sham, and a shame.   Now some people will make the argument that Hillary Clinton wasn't from New York when she ran for Senate. True but correct me if I am wrong, but didn't she at least win the Democratic primary first? This guy didn't even inquire about the job. The GOP committee interviewed a number of different candidates before wittling it down to two finalists. Keyes, who by the way was never even interviewed by the committee and another woman, who also happened to be black. Keyes was interviewed the day after he became a finalist for the GOP choice. I am glad to see that the Illinois GOP still believes in grassroots democracy.  The Illinois Republican Party's choice of candidate just reflects how far this party has fallen in the past few years. It is tough to see how they will even have a chance to retain this Senate seat. Maybe this is just a sham by the party to keep people from coming out to vote in November. Put someone up for Senate that is so out of touch that people won't vote for him. And if people begin to think that this race is a joke, then they won't vote for the other guy either. Could be one hell of a way to try to swing a solidly blue state like Illinois over to the red column for Bush in the upcoming Presidential elections. Voter Disenfranchisement what wonderful concept.  God Bless the GOP and no one else...

						   Now any of you that know me know that I am a complete sweetheart when it comes to crime and punishment. Not to say that I think people shouldn't be punished for their crimes, but I do believe in giving people second chances after they have paid their debt to society.  Read the following story here and form your own conclusions. I'll tell you mine at the end.  Girl's death didn't stop driver's reckless ways By  Stewart Warren  STAFF WRITER ( July 31, 2004) JOLIET — After killing a teenage bicyclist in a hit-and-run accident 15 years ago, Gerene Ohlund clutched a Bible and told a Kendall County judge that she was afraid to drive again. She got past that, apparently.  Since that fatal accident she's been charged with numerous offenses including multiple DUIs and hit-and-run incidents.  Now a married mother of three with another baby on the way, her name is Gerene Ruane. She lives at 10918 Kerry Court, Mokena.  In 2002, she was charged with two counts of driving under the influence of alcohol. Ruane pleaded guilty in May and was in Judge Robert Livas' courtroom Friday morning for a sentencing hearing in those two cases.  "She was over .30 (blood-alcohol content) on one of them," Will County Assistant State's Attorney Janine Boggs told Livas. In Illinois, the legal limit is .08. But that is just her latest offense.  Wearing a long black crocheted sweater dotted with white beads, the smallish blond woman was lightly tanned on Friday. She sniffed, cried and picked at her fingernails while sitting next to her lawyer, Kevin Rosner, during the testimony in the hearing.  A bleak story emerged Friday of the 39-year-old's years since the fatal accident. More details about her past are found in files maintained by The Herald News. Ruane has a history of driving under the influence of alcohol and leaving the scene of accidents, among other things:  In 1987, her license was revoked for drunken driving, according to newspaper files. She lived in Joliet then. No other details about that particular incident were available Friday.  On Aug. 5, 1988, Ruane was driving her red Chevy Camaro southbound on Ridge Road near Van Dyke Road in Kendall County, according to newspaper files. It was about 9 p.m., and Ruane, then 25, had two friends in the car. They were on their way to a pig roast, but were lost.  At the same time, Connie Bryan, 15, a volleyball star at Joliet Central, and her cousin, Sarah Cherry, then 15 and a Plainfield resident, were heading south on Ridge Road on their bicycles. They were going to a friend's house.  Ruane hit Connie from behind, throwing her about 170 feet, according to newspaper files. Ruane drove away, even though one of the passengers urged her to stop.  "She said she couldn't. She didn't have any license and insurance," Darlene George testified during the trial.  Ruane and her two friends fled the scene and ditched her car, Boggs said Friday. Ruane then called a cab for a ride to the pig roast, Boggs said.  Meanwhile, Sarah Cherry flagged down a passing police officer, according to newspaper files. Another passer-by, a trauma nurse, tried to revive the accident victim. But she was pronounced dead at Provena Saint Joseph Medical Center later that night.  After tipsters called police, Ruane turned herself in a few days later.  But in the end, Ruane was acquitted of reckless homicide during a bench trial in front of Judge James Wilson. He found her guilty of driving while her license was revoked and leaving the scene of a personal injury accident. The state did not provide enough evidence that she was driving recklessly or was drunk at the time of the accident, the judge ruled.  She was sentenced to three years in prison.  On Oct. 3, 1989, Ruane was involved in another hit-and-run accident, this time in Crest Hill.  While on Plainfield Road, a pickup slowed to turn into the McDonald's restaurant, Crest Hill police Officer Dwayne Wilkerson testified Friday. Someone hit the truck from behind and drove away, he testified.  Ruane was the hit-and-run driver, he testified.  "According to a witness she was with, she'd just come from a bar, but I don't know (if she was drunk)," Wilkerson testified.  Ruane later was arrested and convicted of driving while her license was revoked.  On Oct. 27, 1989, Ruane was involved in her third hit-and-run that year.  This time, she was in New Lenox, Boggs said. New Lenox police Cmdr. Dennis Klier testified Friday that Ruane hit a car from behind and drove away. She later was convicted of driving with a revoked license, he testified.  When Ruane was sentenced to two one-year terms in prison for the Crest Hill and New Lenox hit-and-run incidents, she looked over her shoulder in court and winked at relatives, according to newspaper files.  On March 2, 1996, a red Ford pickup was stopped in New Lenox by Officer Pete Nelson. During testimony on Friday, he said the driver was Ruane. But when he spoke to her, she gave the officer a false name.  Nelson recognized her, and said so, he testified. Ruane admitted who she was and later was convicted again for driving while her license was revoked.  On June 12, 2002, Marietta Glass and her husband stopped at the posted intersection of Revere and Wolf roads in Mokena. The car in front of them was stopped, too, she testified Friday. Although that car had several chances to pull away from the stop sign, it didn't, and several minutes passed, she testified.  Glass and her husband became concerned, got out of their car and walked up to the other vehicle, she testified. The driver was resting her head on the steering wheel. It was Ruane, she testified. "We thought she had a heart attack," Glass testified. "She had a baby in a baby seat in the back ... it was obvious she was intoxicated."  Glass and her husband told Ruane not to drive and promised to help her. But Ruane floored her car, pulled into the wrong lane, narrowly avoided a head-on collision and hit the vehicle, she testified.  Ruane was later charged with two counts of driving under the influence of alcohol, and pleaded guilty earlier this year.  On Nov. 14, 2003, Ruane and one of her young sons were walking down 191st Street in Mokena. Ruane talked about the incident while on the witness stand Friday. After drinking the night before, Ruane took her son to a restaurant for lunch, she testified.  The little boy didn't want to hold her hand, and wandered into traffic, Ruane admitted.  Some motorists stopped and tried to get Ruane off the road, Boggs told Livas.  "(She said), 'C'mon, don't do this. I've been drinking, but I can watch my kid,'" Boggs told the judge.  Ruane's son told police he was afraid of his mother, Boggs added.  Ruane later was found guilty of endangering the life of a child.  During the closing arguments of Friday's sentencing hearing, Boggs asked Livas to throw the book at Ruane for the drunken-driving convictions dating to 2002. Ruane is eligible for a sentence of up to six years in prison, Boggs said. It's only a matter of time before she kills someone else, Boggs said.  "We have a deadly human being here — walking, driving, whatever," Boggs said.  Rosner asked for leniency. Ruane is six months pregnant and has three other children, he said.  "They won't have a mother if she goes to prison as Miss Boggs has suggested," Rosner said.  Her husband has his own business and often is gone for 16 hours at a time, he told the judge.  Ruane quit drinking in December 2003, has been in treatment programs at Stepping Stones in Joliet, and is in weekly counseling sessions, he said.  "If she didn't get help, she'd be 6 feet under herself," Rosner told the judge.  At the end of the hearing, Ruane stood and spoke to the judge herself.  "I'm really sorry for everything I've put everybody through," she said, looking down at her hands.  Now that she's volunteering as a switchboard operator at Stepping Stones, Ruane said she felt like she was giving back. If she could go to school, she would like to become an addictions counselor.  "I feel like that's my calling," she said. "I'm scared."  Livas decided to take the case under advisement. He will consider her punishment until 9:30 a.m. Aug. 3.  2 DUIs: Prison for pregnant mom 5-year sentence: Gerene Ruane of Mokena gets one year short of maximum By  Cindy Wojdyla Cain  STAFF WRITER (August 4, 2004)  There are three types of alcoholics in the world, Judge Robert Livas told Gerene Ruane as she stood before him crying softly.  The first type makes one mistake and changes.  The second type has to lose everything before they stop drinking.  The third type, he said, are the people who will eventually drink themselves to death.  "You might be in the third group," a stern Livas told Ruane on Tuesday.  The pregnant mother of three was sentenced to five years in prison, one less than the maximum possible, for two driving under the influence of alcohol charges.  "Quite honestly, if you want to drink yourself to death, that's your right," Livas added.  The judge also said Ruane, 39, of Mokena, showed "a remarkable lack of responsibility" by getting pregnant again considering her drinking problem.  Ruane, who wore a pink maternity top and capri pants, broke into loud sobs as she was handcuffed and taken into custody. She covered her face with her hands and continued to weep loudly as the judge moved on to other cases.  Ruane's lawyer and husband left the courtroom after the sentencing. But one woman stayed behind to hear Ruane's sobs and to watch her take her seat with other prisoners.  "I want to see this," Dorene Bryan said as she stood up in the courtroom.  Bryan is the mother of Connie Bryan, a 15-year-old who was killed in a hit-and-run accident 15 years ago this Thursday. In that case, Ruane was convicted of leaving the scene of a personal injury accident and sentenced to three years in prison.  Livas said he did not take that crime into account Tuesday because Ruane already served time for it. But he did take her conduct — which he called "completely and absolutely appalling" — into consideration.  Ruane, then 25, drove away from the 1989 accident because she didn't have a license or insurance, a passenger testified during the trial.  Ruane turned herself in a few days later. But she was acquitted of reckless homicide in a bench trial because there was no proof that she was drunk at the time of the accident.  After the Bryan accident Ruane, formerly Gerene Ohlund, continued to get involved in traffic incidents including two more hit-and-run accidents in 1989, driving under the influence in 1996, and endangering the life of a child in 2003.  Tuesday's sentencing stemmed from a June 2002 accident at Revere and Wolf roads in Mokena. Ruane pleaded guilty in May to two counts of DUI.  Livas said he was not going to delay her sentence until she delivered her fourth child in about three months. Ruane's continued drinking could cause damage to the unborn child, Livas explained. And her alcoholism could lead to postpartum depression.  After the proceedings, Dorene Bryan said she was glad Livas sent Ruane to prison, where she will have to serve at least 2 1/2 years of her sentence.  "I didn't think this would happen," she said. "I thought she'd get off."  Both attorneys on the case agreed that it was a difficult set of circumstances.  Kevin Rosner, who represented Ruane, said he fears his client will not get the alcoholism treatment she needs in jail. He had urged the judge to sentence Ruane to probation or a light prison term.  "Who knows what will happen when she comes out," Rosner said. "She's another casualty of addiction. It impacts not just her, but everybody around her."  The two DUI convictions brought Ruane's total to three, said Assistant State's Attorney Janine Boggs, who prosecuted the most recent charges.  "As the judge said, her history warranted this sentence," Boggs said.  Ruane's husband left the courtroom carrying his wife's small black purse with him as he headed to the elevators.  "It's very devastating," he said with a shocked look on his face.  For Dorene Bryan, the devastation has lasted almost 15 years.  "She (Ruane) paid her dues for Connie," Bryan said. "But she's here and Connie is not — and never will be."   Now that you have taken the time to read this, I will give you my opinion on this matter.  This woman should honestly never have her freedom. I am sorry to say that but she has shown a clear disregard for human life and thinks of no one other than herself. It is unfortunate that her children will not have her in their lives for up to 5 years, however is that necessarily a bad thing? There is a part of this article that states she was passed out behind the wheel of a car with a baby in the back. That is not only a disregard for her own life, but of the life of her children.  Justice was not served in this case, I feel that this woman should have been locked up for the rest of her natural life. I look at the facts of each individual crime when they happen. I mean people do things for a reason. And in most cases, you can sometimes see where the person who perpetrated the crime was coming from. I am not saying that they shouldn't be punished I am just saying that you can understand what was going on.  As for this woman, there is nothing here that I can understand. This woman had her driving privledges taken away years ago, and she still continued to drive. It is painstakingly obvious that she could not be left on the street. Kudos to the judge for sending her to prison. It is too bad that it wasn't forever.
