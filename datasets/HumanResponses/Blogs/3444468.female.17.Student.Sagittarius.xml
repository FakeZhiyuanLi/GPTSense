      I've figured out why I'm always in a bad mood at home. It's because I'm so damn bored. At least with Joseph here, it's a bit interesting. I mean at dinner tonight, my father and I just sat there staring at the wall. He's probably thinking of more ways to repeat himself. So damn boring. So damn slow. So freaking boring. I can't stand him. At least with Mom, I'm in a freaking good mood.   I can't stand to be around my father. So damn boring. I can't stand him.

      Hopefuly this isn't what's gonna happen tomorrow:  Geometry Quiz (I have no idea what's going on) Chem Part I test (electrochemistry - again I have not idea what's going on)  Tuesday:  Physics test  Wednesday: Chem Part II test Chem project (I don't get how we're gonna present on the same day of our test)  Okay have I studied? No. I feel like a broken record, never do I change. I better get my act together before it's the day before the exam!

      So. No prom for me. It was yesterday and I didn't go. I didn't even go to the after-prom. It was either at the beach (barb-q) or at the hotel (party and get drunk). I didn't go to either. I stayed up till 12:30 last night doing God knows what. And I wake up late this morning. I tell Mom that I'm not gonna go to school since for the people that went to prom, they don't have to go since the teachers all understand and the teachers all told us (even the ppl that didn't go to prom) to not come to class. Anyways, I didn't do any work or study. All day instead I read Harry Potter. Harry Potter. I just started reading it for the hell of it. 700-something pages. I ended up reading all that. At first I was just gonna read a couple of pages. Then I was like, "Who died again?" And so I had to find out it was Sirius who died and I was like, "Why didn't I remember that? I mean it was Olga who spoiled it for me last year." Damn what a day wasted. Now I gotta go to Apex.   I'm so busy next week! Physics (last) test, Chemistry (big) quiz, and Chemistry (big) project/presentation. So much to do. And I have to get started on studying! I mean four exams in two days.   Day One : Chem at 8 (2.5 hours) and Accounting at 1:30 (2.5 hours)  Day Two : Geo at 8:30 (2 hours) and Physics at 1:30 (2.5 hours).  Shit I am sooo screwed.

      She's probaby like my closest friend in Glen Shields (from like Kindergarden to what grade 4 or 5). Mom tells me that Kristine might be going to Mac and I was like, "Damn, now I can't go to Mac!!" What in the hell is wrong with me? I mean I just be happy that somebody I know is going to Mac! And guess what, Brenda's going too. I don't like that girl. She's a tad eccentric. She's only going there for Arts. Pfft, I ain't gonna call her stupid but she is good at music.   Why oh why has the St George acceptance not come yet? I heard that if you get accepted to the Scarborough Campus, you won't get accepted to the St George campus? I really hope that isn't true. Still, I don't know anyone who applied to both but me, well except for Joseph. He got into both though. Hmmm.

      Why do I keep giving her all the fucking answers? And when I saw I didn't get into UofT, she makes this face like as if she's really sorry that I didn't get in but inside, she's really feeling like she's better than me. She's not even a friend. She's a loser.  So I had the accounting test today. I bombed it. I freakin' skipped Geometry to study for accounting (Yeah I know). It's Olga's birthday. ... YAY!!! Anyways, I thought I knew everything and Morgenthau's not even there. So the test had 34 M/C and T/F questions. LIke 4 or 5 freakin' pages of short answers. The test was so freaking long I was afraid I couldn't do them all! I don't care anymore. As long as I get 70, I'm fine. Wow, such a big difference from me last year or two years ago, getting pissed off from an 80 mark.  The physics quiz was today. I studied my ass off in period 4 for the freaking quiz. Liena comes like 20 minutes to class and obviously she didn't study. Then she has the fucking nerve to ask me how to do the quiz. I fucking finished the quiz in like less than 20 minutes and I'm the one waiting around for like 15 helping her. I'm such an idiot. Next time, don't even help her. I'm seeing why Jodie doesn't want to help anybody or give anybody the answers. Karima is stupid too. She gives Natasha and Veena all the answers. She lets those two walk all over her. Me, not so much because I always ask them for favours too. I'm such a pushover. So Liena's gonna get perfect because of me, doesn't even thank me. I'm not gonna get perfect because I made a stupid mistake that I told her and she's gonna get right. It's not fair. She gets a 90 average. How in the fucking world does she get a 90 average. She says she doesn't study, she has her freaking genius brother to ask all the questions. I hate this. I hate her. I hate my life. At least when I get to McMaster, I don't have to see her again. I hope she fails at UofT. She's probably not going to because she has her brother and she's so damn "smart" but you better believe it, I'm gonna wish she fails.   What a lousy day.

      Oh Dwyane Tyrone Wade, why do you do this to me? You first grabbed my attention in the NCAA tourney last year at Marquette. First game of the NBA season, I watched you go up against the Sixers. Here's the real ROY. (Jks, Lebron deserved it but Dwyane needs major props, as does Chris Bosh).

      So. I probably failed the geometry test. Oh well. So I rush up to the 3rd floor so I'm not late for my accounting test. Everybody's standing around and Ms Morgenthau's nowhere to be found. Suddenly Gerald and Edwin yell out "No test! Test is cancelled!" And I am literally bouncing up and down! I was so excited. I was so nervous for the test too. So now that I got an extra day to study for accounting? What do I have to show for it? Nothing.  It's 8:44 now and I haven't started studying. I'm such a loser. Eh, whaddya gonna do?

      Honestly, I don't know what's wrong with me. Saturday, I had this great plan. I would study Geometry on Saturday and study Accounting on Sunday. Then I would review problems for both Geo and Acc on Monday (Victoria Day so no school -- whoohoo!)  It's Monday. I haven't done anything. I have two tests in less than 8 hours and what have I done? Both tests are important too! Well, ever since I got accepted, I have become this lazy ass. I haven't done any work since midterms. I'm surprised I got good on most of my tests. It's because I'm so smart ...     I'm not even going to prom. I don't really care but at least if I was going to prom, I would have an excuse as to why I haven't been doing any of my work.  I'm screwed? Yeah. Do I care? Not even a little bit. I need somebody to come to my room and slap the hell out of me. Man I suck.

      I am so fucking tired right now. And bored. I have nothing to do. I didn't have any work today or tomorrow so I have basically nothing to do. All I'm gonna end up doing is sitting at home on the computer doing nothing.  Some friends I have huh? Nobody calls. I should feel blessed.

      My problems must seem so trivial compared to abusive parents, drug-abuse, death and all that shit but I don't give a damn. I can't stand this place. I actually wish that I was in that car accident and that I had died. I don't care. I can't live for another minute with that selfish idiot. The guy goes on and on and how I don't appreciate every fucking little thing that he and Mom did for me. Of course I fucking do. Why do you think that I don't cuss you out every fucking second I see you? I do to myself but not out loud. That's why I hate Korean Christian parents. They make you think that they want the best for you but all they want is to look good in front of their friends and show off to people. That's the only fucking reason they want me to be a doctor. I hate him. I love my Mom but I hate my father. He's a freaking asshole. He's so damn obnoxious that I don't even see how he doesn't annoy himself.   "I'm going to throw you out when you're 18". See if I care. In 5 years the only  parent  that I will be talking to is Mom. I don't give a fuck about you. I just wish he would fucking leave me alone. Just go away! I wish I was in that car accident. I wish I was dead. I don't want to go to school. I don't want to go to university. I don't want to live another day in this hellhole you call "home". I just don't want to live anymore.

      When I first heard this song, I was like Oh Nelly, another sweet pop attempt to get into the top10 charts. Now I believe I've listened to the damn song more than 100 times and I still love it. Is it the guitar? Or is it Jaheim (who sings the chorus) or is it the Nelly I've missed? LOL.   I'm off to work at 5pm. Guess what,  I finally got my period today . Just a little but still I got it. I'm freakin' relieved. Now my stomach hurts like hell, but at least I know there's nothing weird going on with my body.
